Central to this is the need for precise global time series of plastic pollution with which we can assess whether implemented policies are effective, but at present we lack these data. To address this need, we used previously published and new data on floating ocean plastics (n = 11,777 stations) to create a global time-series that estimates the average counts and mass of small plastics in the ocean surface layer from 1979 to 2019. Today's global abundance is estimated at approximately 82-358 trillion plastic particles weighing 1.1-4.9 million tonnes. We observed no clear detectable trend until 1990, a fluctuating but stagnant trend from then until 2005, and a rapid increase until the present. This observed acceleration of plastic densities in the world's oceans, also reported for beaches around the globe, demands urgent international policy interventions.","We thank Ocean Missions for data from Iceland and Greenland and thank Ocean Research Project for data from across the Arctic.

167,pub.1161683313,10.3390/su151411221,,,"Role of Digital Transformation for Achieving Sustainability: Mediated Role of Stakeholders, Key Capabilities, and Technology","Sustainability through digital transformation is essential for contemporary businesses. Embracing sustainability, micro-, small-, and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs) can gain a competitive advantage, attracting customers and investors who share these values. Moreover, incorporating sustainable practices empowers MSMEs to drive innovation, reduce costs, and enhance their reputation. This study aims to identify how owners or senior managers of MSMEs can initiate a sustainable digital transformation project. A systematic literature review was carried out, including 59 publications from 2019 to 2023. As a result, this research identifies the first steps owners of MSMEs can take to begin the transition by identifying critical organizational capabilities necessary for successful transformation, explores the technologies that can support MSMEs in their sustainability goals, and emphasizes the significance of stakeholders in achieving a successful digital transformation journey. Firstly, owners or senior managers should change the organizational culture to support decisions and strategies focus on sustainability. Secondly, the leading role of stakeholders is in the innovation process that allows businesses to be more competitive locally and globally. Finally, big data is the technology that can provide the most significant benefit to MSMEs because it will enable analyzing data of all kinds and contributes disruptively to decision-making.",,This research received no external funding.,Sustainability,,,,2023-07-19,2023,2023-07-19,,15,14,11221,All OA; Gold,Article,"Martínez-Peláez, Rafael; Ochoa-Brust, Alberto; Rivera, Solange; Félix, Vanessa G.; Ostos, Rodolfo; Brito, Héctor; Félix, Ramón A.; Mena, Luis J.","Martínez-Peláez, Rafael (Departamento de Ingeniería de Sistemas y Computación, Universidad Católica del Norte, Antofagasta 1249004, Chile;, rafael.martinez@ucn.cl; Unidad Académica de Computación, Universidad Politécnica de Sinaloa, Mazatlán 82199, Mexico;, vfelix@upsin.edu.mx, (V.G.F.);, rostos@upsin.edu.mx, (R.O.);, hbrito@upsin.edu.mx, (H.B.)); Ochoa-Brust, Alberto (Facultad de Ingeniería Mecánica y Eléctrica, Universidad de Colima, Colima 28400, Mexico;, aochoa@ucol.mx, (A.O.-B.);, rfelix@ucol.mx, (R.A.F.)); Rivera, Solange (Departamento de Ingenierías Química, Electrónica y Biomédica, División de Ciencias e Ingenierías, UG-CL, León 37150, Mexico;, si.rivera@ugto.mx); Félix, Vanessa G.

SDSS-V comprises three primary scientific programs or “Mappers”: the Milky Way Mapper (MWM), the Black Hole Mapper (BHM), and the Local Volume Mapper. This data release contains extensive targeting information for the two multiobject spectroscopy programs (MWM and BHM), including input catalogs and selection functions for their numerous scientific objectives. We describe the production of the targeting databases and their calibration and scientifically focused components. DR18 also includes ∼25,000 new SDSS spectra and supplemental information for X-ray sources identified by eROSITA in its eFEDS field. We present updates to some of the SDSS software pipelines and preview changes anticipated for DR19. We also describe three value-added catalogs (VACs) based on SDSS-IV data that have been published since DR17, and one VAC based on the SDSS-V data in the eFEDS field.","The documentation workshop for DR18 (“DocuLlama”) was held virtually in 2022 September, organized by Anne-Marie Weijmans and Gail Zasowski.

Yet little is known about the extent to which soil contaminants differ between urban greenspaces and natural ecosystems. Here we show that urban greenspaces and adjacent natural areas (i.e., natural/semi-natural ecosystems) shared similar levels of multiple soil contaminants (metal(loid)s, pesticides, microplastics, and antibiotic resistance genes) across the globe. We reveal that human influence explained many forms of soil contamination worldwide. Socio-economic factors were integral to explaining the occurrence of soil contaminants worldwide. We further show that increased levels of multiple soil contaminants were linked with changes in microbial traits including genes associated with environmental stress resistance, nutrient cycling, and pathogenesis. Taken together, our work demonstrates that human-driven soil contamination in nearby natural areas mirrors that in urban greenspaces globally, and highlights that soil contaminants have the potential to cause dire consequences for ecosystem sustainability and human wellbeing.","We thank the researchers involved in the MUSGONET project for collection of field data.

Therefore, measuring SMEs' performance under the digital transformation (DT) through methods that encompass sustainability represents an essential tool for reducing poverty and gender inequality (United Nations Sustainable Development Goals). We aimed to describe and analyze the state-of-art performance evaluations of digital transformation in SMEs, mainly focusing on performance measurement. Also, we aimed to determine whether the tools encompass the three pillars of sustainability (environmental, social, and economic). Through a systematic literature review (SLR), a search on Web of Science (WoS) and Scopus resulted in the acceptance of 74 peer-reviewed papers published until December 2021. Additionally, a bibliometrics investigation was executed. Although there was no time restriction, the oldest paper was published in 2016, indicating that DT is a new research topic with increasing interest. Italy, China, and Finland are the countries that have the most published on the theme. Based on the results, a conceptual framework is proposed. Also, two future research directions are presented and discussed, one for theoretical and another for practical research. Among the theoretical development, it is essential to work on a widely accepted SME definition. Among the practical research, nine directions are identified-e.g., applying big data, sectorial and regional prioritization, cross-temporal investigations etc. Researchers can follow the presented avenues and roads to guide their researchers toward the most relevant topics with the most urgent necessity of investigation.",Declaration of interest&#x27;s statement The authors declare no competing interests.,This research is funded by Fondo Nacional de Desarrollo Científico y Tecnológico (Fondecyt) Project 11230332.,Heliyon,,,,2023-02-22,2023,2023-02-22,2023-03,9,3,e13908,All OA; Gold,Article,"Melo, Isotilia Costa; Queiroz, Geandra Alves; Alves, Paulo Nocera; de Sousa, Thales Botelho; Yushimito, Wilfredo F; Pereira, Jorge","Melo, Isotilia Costa (Universidad Católica del Norte (UCN), Escuela de Ingeniería de Coquimbo (EIC), Coquimbo, Chile); Queiroz, Geandra Alves (Universidade do Estado de Minas Gerais (UEMG), Engineering Department, Production Engineering, Passos, Brazil); Alves, Paulo Nocera (Universidad Católica del Norte (UCN), Escuela de Ingeniería de Coquimbo (EIC), Coquimbo, Chile); de Sousa, Thales Botelho (Federal Institute of Education, Science, and Technology of São Paulo (IFSP), Registro, Brazil); Yushimito, Wilfredo F (Universidad Adolfo Ibáñez (UAI), Viña del Mar, Chile); Pereira, Jorge (Universidad Adolfo Ibáñez (UAI), Viña del Mar, Chile; UPF Barcelona School of Management, Barcelona, Spain)","Melo, Isotilia Costa (Catholic University of the North)","Melo, Isotilia Costa (Catholic University of the North); Queiroz, Geandra Alves (Minas Gerais State University); Alves, Paulo Nocera (Catholic University of the North); de Sousa, Thales Botelho (Federal Institute of Education, Science, and Technology of São Paulo (IFSP), Registro, Brazil); Yushimito, Wilfredo F (Adolfo Ibáñez University); Pereira, Jorge (Adolfo Ibáñez University; Pompeu Fabra University)",52,52,,,http://www.cell.com/article/S2405844023011155/pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1155604497,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3507 Strategy, Management and Organisational Behaviour; 50 Philosophy and Religious Studies; 5001 Applied Ethics",

However, what thick description entails and how it should be carried out is often missing or insufficiently described. While expert qualitative researchers may be familiar with the concept, the wide variety of meanings and interpretations of thick description in the literature may make it difficult for novice qualitative researchers to understand this concept when reporting qualitative findings. The purpose of this paper is to propose the “MIRACLE” narrative framework for providing thick description in qualitative research. We developed this framework based on a critical review of theoretical literature about thick description and writing in qualitative research, as well as our personal experiences conducting, writing, and publishing qualitative studies. The proposed framework can be valuable for improving the reporting quality and transferability of qualitative research findings.",,"FundingThe author(s) received no financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.",International Journal of Qualitative Methods,,,,2023-02-17,2023,2023-02-17,2023-12,22,,16094069221147162,All OA; Gold,Article,"Younas, Ahtisham; Fàbregues, Sergi; Durante, Angela; Escalante, Elsa Lucia; Inayat, Shahzad; Ali, Parveen","Younas, Ahtisham (Faculty of Nursing, Memorial University of Newfoundland, Canada); Fàbregues, Sergi (Department of Psychology and Education, Universitat Oberta de Catalunya, Barcelona, Spain); Durante, Angela (University La Rioja, Spain); Escalante, Elsa Lucia (Department of Education, Universidad del Norte, Colombia); Inayat, Shahzad (Al-Nafees Medical College and Faculty of Nurisng, Isra University, Islamabad, Pakistan); Ali, Parveen (University of Sheffield, United Kingdom)","Younas, Ahtisham (Memorial University of Newfoundland)","Younas, Ahtisham (Memorial University of Newfoundland); Fàbregues, Sergi (Open University of Catalonia); Durante, Angela (University of La Rioja); Escalante, Elsa Lucia (Universidad del Norte); Inayat, Shahzad (Isra University); Ali, Parveen (University of Sheffield)",47,47,,,https://doi.org/10.1177/16094069221147162,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1155523474,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 36 Creative Arts and Writing; 3602 Creative and Professional Writing",

We apply this formalism in the framework of f(T) gravity, considering three viable mono-parametric models. In particular, we investigate the induced modifications at the level of the gravitational-wave source, which is encoded in terms of the power spectrum of the PBH gravitational potential, as well as at the level of their propagation, described in terms of the Green function which quantifies the propagator of the tensor perturbations. We find that, within the observationally allowed range of the f(T) model-parameters, the obtained deviations from general relativity, both at the levels of source and propagation, are practically negligible. Hence, we conclude that realistic and viable f(T) theories can safely pass the primordial black hole constraints, which may offer an additional argument in their favor.",T.P. acknowledges financial support from the Foundation for Education and European Culture in Greece.

Nonetheless, the above is not enough to diminish the environmental impacts associated with the road infrastructure industry. Accordingly, incorporating Recycled Concrete Aggregate (RCA) as a partial replacement for Natural Aggregates (NAs) in WMA design has been gaining notoriety in the literature as a viable alternative to increase sustainability. However, the eco-friendly manufacturing of WMA with RCA contents (WMA-RCA) is not easy to obtain satisfactorily because the RCA causes alterations in the mix design. Thus, this research proposes three (3) methods to determine the optimal design conditions (coarse RCA content) that minimize the environmental burdens caused by WMA-RCA production. The first method is a mathematical model based on Multiple Linear Regression (MLR), which is used as a benchmark for the other two methods. The second and third methods are computational models based on Artificial Intelligence (AI), i.e., Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) and Genetic Algorithms (GAs), respectively. Notably, the Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) was employed as the theoretical framework to support all the proposed models. Consequently, this study concludes that: (i) all the proposed methodological alternatives achieve results with a great accuracy; (ii) the GAs model is the most precise method in terms of error minimization; (iii) the MLR model is the fastest method in terms of execution time; and (iv) the ANNs model is the method that requires the longest time of running, and its exactness is at a midpoint concerning the other models.",Declaration of competing interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

For instance, graphene-like materials have been employed as asphalt binder modifying agents in pavement engineering. In the literature, it has been reported that (in comparison to an unmodified binder) the Graphene Modified Asphalt Binders (GMABs) exhibit an enhanced performance grade, a lower thermal susceptibility, a higher fatigue life, and a decreased accumulation of permanent deformations. Nonetheless, although GMABs stand out significantly from traditional alternatives, there is still no consensus on their behavior regarding chemical, rheological, microstructural, morphological, thermogravimetric, and surface topography properties. Therefore, this research conducted a literature review on the properties and advanced characterization techniques of GMABs. Thus, the laboratory protocols covered by this manuscript are atomic force microscopy, differential scanning calorimetry, dynamic shear rheometer, elemental analysis, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, thermogravimetric analysis, X-ray diffraction, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy.

In this context, the present study aims to identify challenges through a systematic literature review of studies published between 2006 and 2023 to propose a comprehensive framework of challenges. To this end, the PICOC framework was applied to set the research scope properly; and an integrated method called PSALSAR protocol was used to find, evaluate, and review publications published in Scopus and the Web of Science. As a result, 123 articles were reviewed, and seventeen challenges were identified and classified into five social, economic, environmental, technical, and institutional challenges. Results indicated that international agreements on climate change could boost the number of studies on the low-carbon energy transition.

Thus, this study investigated whether genetically predicted risk factors and nutrients play a function in the occurrence of inflammatory bowel diseases, including ulcerative colitis (UC), non-infective colitis (NIC), and Crohn's disease (CD), using Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis. Utilizing the data of genome-wide association studies (GWASs) with 37 exposure factors, we ran Mendelian randomization analyses based on up to 458,109 participants. Univariable and multivariable MR analyses were conducted to determine causal risk factors for IBD diseases. Genetic predisposition to smoking and appendectomy as well as vegetable and fruit intake, breastfeeding, n-3 PUFAs, n-6 PUFAs, vitamin D, total cholesterol, whole-body fat mass, and physical activity were related to the risk of UC (p < 0.05). The effect of lifestyle behaviors on UC was attenuated after correcting for appendectomy. Genetically driven smoking, alcohol consumption, appendectomy, tonsillectomy, blood calcium, tea intake, autoimmune diseases, type 2 diabetes, cesarean delivery, vitamin D deficiency, and antibiotic exposure increased the risk of CD (p < 0.05), while vegetable and fruit intake, breastfeeding, physical activity, blood zinc, and n-3 PUFAs decreased the risk of CD (p < 0.05). Appendectomy, antibiotics, physical activity, blood zinc, n-3 PUFAs, and vegetable fruit intake remained significant predictors in multivariable MR (p < 0.05). Besides smoking, breastfeeding, alcoholic drinks, vegetable and fruit intake, vitamin D, appendectomy, and n-3 PUFAs were associated with NIC (p < 0.05). Smoking, alcoholic drinks, vegetable and fruit intake, vitamin D, appendectomy, and n-3 PUFAs remained significant predictors in multivariable MR (p < 0.05). Our results provide new and comprehensive evidence demonstrating that there are approving causal effects of various risk factors on IBDs. These findings also supply some suggestions for the treatment and prevention of these diseases.","The authors extend their appreciation for Researchers Supporting Project number RSP2023R120 obtained from King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.",This research received no external funding.,Nutrients,,,"Humans; Mendelian Randomization Analysis; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Genome-Wide Association Study; Inflammatory Bowel Diseases; Risk Factors; Colitis, Ulcerative; Crohn Disease; Vitamin D; Vegetables",2023-02-27,2023,2023-02-27,,15,5,1202,All OA; Gold,Article,"Saadh, Mohamed J; Pal, Rashmi Saxena; Arias-Gonzáles, José Luis; Orosco Gavilán, Juan Carlos; Jc, Darshan; Mohany, Mohamed; Al-Rejaie, Salim S; Bahrami, Abolfazl; Kadham, Mustafa Jawad; Amin, Ali H; Georgia, Hrosti","Saadh, Mohamed J (Faculty of Pharmacy, Middle East University, Amman 11831, Jordan.; Applied Science Research Center, Applied Science Private University, Amman 11152, Jordan.); Pal, Rashmi Saxena (School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Lovely Professional University, Phagwara 144001, Punjab, India.); Arias-Gonzáles, José Luis (Department of Social Sciences, Faculty of Social Studies, Pontifical University of Peru, San Miguel 15088, Peru.); Orosco Gavilán, Juan Carlos (Campus Virtual, Universidad Privada del Norte, Lima 15003, Peru.); Jc, Darshan (Department of Pharmacy Practice, Yenepoya Pharmacy College & Research Centre, Yenepoya Deemed to Be University, Mangalore 575018, Karnataka, India.); Mohany, Mohamed (Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, College of Pharmacy, King Saud University, P.O.

Therefore, we comprehensively examined CSBD across 42 countries, genders, and sexual orientations, and validated the original (CSBD-19) and short (CSBD-7) versions of the Compulsive Sexual Behavior Disorder Scale to provide standardized, state-of-the-art screening tools for research and clinical practice.
Method: Using data from the International Sex Survey (N = 82,243; Mage = 32.39 years, SD = 12.52), we evaluated the psychometric properties of the CSBD-19 and CSBD-7 and compared CSBD across 42 countries, three genders, eight sexual orientations, and individuals with low vs. high risk of experiencing CSBD.
Results: A total of 4.8% of the participants were at high risk of experiencing CSBD. Country- and gender-based differences were observed, while no sexual-orientation-based differences were present in CSBD levels. Only 14% of individuals with CSBD have ever sought treatment for this disorder, with an additional 33% not having sought treatment because of various reasons. Both versions of the scale demonstrated excellent validity and reliability.
Discussion and conclusions: This study contributes to a better understanding of CSBD in underrepresented and underserved populations and facilitates its identification in diverse populations by providing freely accessible ICD-11-based screening tools in 26 languages. The findings may also serve as a crucial building block to stimulate research into evidence-based, culturally sensitive prevention and intervention strategies for CSBD that are currently missing from the literature.",,"BB was supported by a postdoctoral fellowship from the SCOUP Team – Sexuality and Couples – Fonds de recherche du Québec, Société et Culture and the by the Banting Postdoctoral Fellowship (Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council, SSHRC).

Pretraining foundation models using self-supervised learning on electronic health records (EHR) may be effective in acquiring informative global patterns that can improve the robustness of task-specific models. The objective was to evaluate the utility of EHR foundation models in improving the in-distribution (ID) and out-of-distribution (OOD) performance of clinical prediction models. Transformer- and gated recurrent unit-based foundation models were pretrained on EHR of up to 1.8 M patients (382 M coded events) collected within pre-determined year groups (e.g., 2009–2012) and were subsequently used to construct patient representations for patients admitted to inpatient units. These representations were used to train logistic regression models to predict hospital mortality, long length of stay, 30-day readmission, and ICU admission. We compared our EHR foundation models with baseline logistic regression models learned on count-based representations (count-LR) in ID and OOD year groups. Performance was measured using area-under-the-receiver-operating-characteristic curve (AUROC), area-under-the-precision-recall curve, and absolute calibration error. Both transformer and recurrent-based foundation models generally showed better ID and OOD discrimination relative to count-LR and often exhibited less decay in tasks where there is observable degradation of discrimination performance (average AUROC decay of 3% for transformer-based foundation model vs. 7% for count-LR after 5–9 years). In addition, the performance and robustness of transformer-based foundation models continued to improve as pretraining set size increased. These results suggest that pretraining EHR foundation models at scale is a useful approach for developing clinical prediction models that perform well in the presence of temporal distribution shift.",,No external funding was received for the study.,Scientific Reports,,,Humans; Electric Power Supplies; Electronic Health Records; Hospital Mortality; Hospitalization,2023-03-07,2023,2023-03-07,,13,1,3767,All OA; Gold,Article,"Guo, Lin Lawrence; Steinberg, Ethan; Fleming, Scott Lanyon; Posada, Jose; Lemmon, Joshua; Pfohl, Stephen R.; Shah, Nigam; Fries, Jason; Sung, Lillian","Guo, Lin Lawrence (Program in Child Health Evaluative Sciences, The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, ON, Canada); Steinberg, Ethan (Stanford Center for Biomedical Informatics Research, Stanford University, Palo Alto, CA, USA); Fleming, Scott Lanyon (Stanford Center for Biomedical Informatics Research, Stanford University, Palo Alto, CA, USA); Posada, Jose (Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); Lemmon, Joshua (Program in Child Health Evaluative Sciences, The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, ON, Canada); Pfohl, Stephen R.

1490,pub.1157670108,10.1016/j.cscm.2023.e02112,,,"Environmental and economic feasibility of implementing perpetual pavements (PPs) against conventional pavements: A case study of Barranquilla city, Colombia","The road infrastructure industry consumes elevated economic resources and generates vast environmental impacts on the planet. Nevertheless, the construction and maintenance of pavements are necessary to guarantee the economic growth of the communities. In this way, finding novel methods, materials, and techniques is essential to achieve a more sustainable industry. One of the most promising alternatives is the implementation of Perpetual Pavements (PPs). Contrary to the Conventional Flexible Pavements (CFPs) and Conventional Rigid Pavements (CRPs), the PPs are designed for a long service life (even superior to 50 years). During this time, the PPs do not require major Maintenance and Rehabilitation (M&R) activities. Due to this characteristic, PPs could present greater sustainability attributes than conventional pavement structures. However, minimal literature is focused on examining these hypotheses since the state-of-the-art has concentrated on studying the mechanical behavior of materials and layers for PPs laying. Moreover, it is most worrying that few investigations have done this in the context of developing countries, where it is more decisive to perform better decisions in terms of economic-environmental sustainability. Consequently, this research conducts a case study on Barranquilla city (Colombia) to estimate the environmental burdens and monetary costs associated with the life cycle of three pavement alternatives, i.e., a PP, a CFP, and a CRP. The Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) and Life Cycle Cost Analysis (LCCA) methodologies were employed for these purposes. The results of this investigation demonstrated that PP provides less environmental damage and higher cost-efficiency than the CFP and CRP alternatives. Notably, the most significant contamination potential is provoked by the CRP structure. Meanwhile, the fewer financial profitability is caused by the CFP structure. Therefore, this study indicates that under the typical circumstances of underdeveloped nations, PPs are a more advantageous alternative than traditional ones regarding sustainability performance.","Declaration of Competing Interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

1284,pub.1154616401,10.3390/su15021740,,,A Review of Offshore Renewable Energy in South America: Current Status and Future Perspectives,"This paper addresses the current status and future research and development perspectives associated with technologies to harness offshore renewable energy, including offshore wind, waves, tides, ocean currents, and thermal and salinity gradient, in South America (SA). It focuses on five countries: Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia and Uruguay. At first, a comprehensive survey presents the number of scientific papers classified based on the resource to show the tendency and importance of such subjects in the academic community. Each country’s electricity matrix and grid connection are shown to understand the region’s renewable source participation situation. The potential of offshore renewable resources is addressed by considering the published technical papers in scientific journals. The main conflicts and synergies associated with ocean space utilization are presented by considering the exclusive economic zone of each country. The status of the regulatory frameworks to promote and development of offshore renewable energies is presented. Two sections are dedicated to presenting the active, decommissioned and planned projects, research groups and laboratory infrastructures to develop the technologies. The last section discusses the future perspectives on the development of this sector in SA. It is observed that SA, with more than 25,000 km of coastline, has a great potential for offshore renewable energy; however, so far, these resources have not been explored commercially. Larger investment in the sector, establishing an adequate legal framework and deploying full-scale demonstration projects at sea are necessary for the commercialization of such technologies in SA.","The authors acknowledge the support of the thematic network REMAR (Opportunities of integration in Ibero-American Electric Grids of the Marine Energies) from the Ibero-American Program of Science and Technology for the Development (CYTED).

The purpose of this work is to detect and classify type 2 diabetes in patients using machine learning (ML) models, and to select the most optimal model to predict the risk of diabetes. In this paper, five ML models, including K-nearest neighbor (K-NN), Bernoulli Naïve Bayes (BNB), decision tree (DT), logistic regression (LR), and support vector machine (SVM), are investigated to predict diabetic patients. A Kaggle-hosted Pima Indian dataset containing 768 patients with and without diabetes was used, including variables such as number of pregnancies the patient has had, blood glucose concentration, diastolic blood pressure, skinfold thickness, body insulin levels, body mass index (BMI), genetic background, diabetes in the family tree, age, and outcome (with/without diabetes). The results show that the K-NN and BNB models outperform the other models. The K-NN model obtained the best accuracy in detecting diabetes, with 79.6% accuracy, while the BNB model obtained 77.2% accuracy in detecting diabetes. Finally, it can be stated that the use of ML models for the early detection of diabetes is very promising.",,This research received no external funding.,Diagnostics,,,,2023-07-15,2023,2023-07-15,,13,14,2383,All OA; Gold,Article,"Iparraguirre-Villanueva, Orlando; Espinola-Linares, Karina; Castañeda, Rosalynn Ornella Flores; Cabanillas-Carbonell, Michael","Iparraguirre-Villanueva, Orlando (Facultad de Ingeniería y Arquitectura, Universidad Autónoma del Perú, Lima 15842, Peru;, oiparraguirre@ieee.org); Espinola-Linares, Karina (Facultad de Ingeniería, Universidad Tecnológica del Perú, Chimbote 02710, Peru;, c24051@utp.edu.pe); Castañeda, Rosalynn Ornella Flores (Facultad de Arquitectura e Ingeniería, Universidad César Vallejo, Lima 15314, Peru;, rfloresc@ucv.edu.pe); Cabanillas-Carbonell, Michael (Facultad de Ingeniería, Universidad Privada del Norte, Lima 15083, Peru)","Cabanillas-Carbonell, Michael (Private University of the North)","Iparraguirre-Villanueva, Orlando (Universidad Autónoma del Perú); Espinola-Linares, Karina (Universidad Tecnológica del Perú); Castañeda, Rosalynn Ornella Flores (Universidad César Vallejo); Cabanillas-Carbonell, Michael (Private University of the North)",16,16,,,https://www.mdpi.com/2075-4418/13/14/2383/pdf?version=1689422105,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1160780476,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3202 Clinical Sciences,

The database was compiled through a global collaboration between a network of researchers, meteorological services and environmental organisations from 65 countries. GloREDa is the first open access database of rainfall erosivity (R-factor) based on hourly and sub-hourly rainfall records at a global scale. This database is now stored and accessible for download in the long-term European Soil Data Centre (ESDAC) repository of the European Commission's Joint Research Centre. This will ensure the further development of the database with insertions of new records, maintenance of the data and provision of a helpdesk. In addition to the annual erosivity data, this release also includes the mean monthly erosivity data for 94% of the GloREDa stations. Based on these mean monthly R-factor values, we predict the global monthly erosivity datasets at 1 km resolution using the ensemble machine learning approach (ML) as implemented in the mlr package for R. The produced monthly raster data (GeoTIFF format) may be useful for soil erosion prediction modelling, sediment distribution analysis, climate change predictions, flood, and natural disaster assessments and can be valuable inputs for Land and Earth Systems modelling.","Declaration of Competing Interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

1102,pub.1155103030,10.1016/j.cscm.2023.e01906,,,Development of high-volume recycled glass ultra-high-performance concrete with high C3A cement,"Ultra-high-performance concrete (UHPC) is a special cementitious composite material with outstanding qualities like compressive strength greater than 120 MPa, and outstanding durability in comparison to other types of concrete. However, its production implies a large carbon footprint and significant consumption of natural resources such as quartz powder and fine quartz sand, both classified as carcinogenic to humans by the International Agency for Research on Cancer. This study produced a UHPC paste created with greener pozzolans and aggregates compared to current UHPC mixture proportions. In this regard, quartz powder and fine quartz sand were replaced by two different sizes of recycled glass powder. Furthermore, reducing the cement dosage was a goal in optimizing the UHPC mixture. This total replacement of the aggregate and reduction of the cement reduces the carbon footprint and the costs of the final material in two different ways: firstly, by decreasing the use of natural resources to produce quartz powder and sand, and secondly, by using waste material that otherwise would occupy landfill space. To reproduce the findings of this paper in developing countries with limited-quality cement, high C3A locally available cement is used in this research. The latter represents a significant challenge in the production of UHPC. Statistical methodologies such as center composite design and multiobjective optimization were undertaken to develop an efficient, healthy, safe, and environmentally friendly mixture design that meets the ASTM strength criteria for UHPC while maintaining the lowest cement content and the highest waste material dosage. The results showed that the fact that all the ground recycled glass particles have a size of less than 1 mm is not a sufficient condition to avoid the harmful alkali-silica reaction. In addition, it was observed that the high C3A content of the locally available cement had a slight positive effect on the 1-day compressive strength but a significant negative effect on the 28-day compressive strength of the UHPC. Finally, the present investigation demonstrated the feasibility of producing a UHPC that, using a local cement with almost 10% C3A, met the threshold criteria with a large volume use of recycled glass powder representing more than fifty percent by weight of total concrete.","The writers would like to thank Cementos Alión S.A. for providing the cement utilized in the study.

5658,pub.1154125645,10.2196/44195,37477960,PMC10403803,Use of the Maslach Burnout Inventory Among Public Health Care Professionals: Scoping Review,"BACKGROUND: Work can be considered a source of living, well-being, and socioeconomic development. When the work environment negatively influences individuals, it may trigger emotional disturbances, behavioral problems, chronic stress conditions, and illnesses such as burnout syndrome (BS). Recently, studies on BS have increased and placed a special focus on health care professionals. The prevalence of BS among health professionals is associated with their chronic exposure to human hardship and long working hours without proper rest. These factors have contributed to greater stress and high physical and emotional exhaustion levels.
OBJECTIVE: This study aims to identify and map studies using the Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI) scale to identify burnout syndrome in health professionals working in public health services.
METHODS: This scoping review was developed based on the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) Reviewers Manual and reported according to the PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Extension for Scoping Reviews). A total of 6 databases were searched to identify relevant studies: Embase, LILACS, MEDLINE or PubMed, PsycInfo, Scopus, and Web of Science. Gray literature was consulted on ProQuest Dissertations and Theses Global, Google Scholar, Brazilian Digital Library of Theses and Dissertations, and Open Access Theses and Dissertations. Additionally, the reference lists were searched to retrieve studies not previously selected. The steps followed in this study were proposed by Arskey and O'Malley and Levac, Colquhoun, and O'Brien: identification of research questions, identification of potential studies, study selection, data extraction and imputation, data analyses and interpretation, and consultation with stakeholders. The detailed methodology was published in a protocol.
RESULTS: A total of 55 articles were identified after screening for eligibility criteria, published between 1999 and 2021 in 32 countries. Most reports were published in Brazil, Spain, and China. A total of 22 versions of the MBI were identified, presenting different items, scores, and cutoff points. The included studies had recommendations and implications for clinical practice. The consultation with stakeholders allowed knowledge translation for those interested in BS.
CONCLUSIONS: Studies mostly included physicians (34/55, 61.8%) and nurses (24/55, 43.6%), and the original version of MBI was predominantly used. Divergences in BS classification were highlighted, which may be related to MBI cross-cultural adaptations and applications in other countries. This study contributes to the advancement of research regarding burnout syndrome as an occupational illness since it has harmful consequences for workers, health care services, and the quality of care provided to the population.","The authors would like to thank Wánderson Cássio Oliveira Araújo for their support in developing the search strategy and Probatus Academic Services for providing scientific language translation, revision, and editing.",,JMIR Mental Health,,"John Torous, Gunther Eysenbach",,2023-07-21,2023,2023-07-21,,10,,e44195,All OA; Gold,Article,"Soares, Juliana Pontes; Lopes, Rayssa Horácio; de Souza Mendonça, Paula Beatriz; Silva, Cícera Renata Diniz Vieira; Rodrigues, Cláudia Cristiane Filgueira Martins; de Castro, Janete Lima","Soares, Juliana Pontes (Postgraduate Program in Collective Health, Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte, Natal, Brazil); Lopes, Rayssa Horácio (Postgraduate Program in Collective Health, Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte, Natal, Brazil); de Souza Mendonça, Paula Beatriz (Postgraduate Program in Collective Health, Federal University of Espírito Santo, Vitória, Brazil); Silva, Cícera Renata Diniz Vieira (Technical School of Health of Cajazeiras, Federal University of Campina Grande, Cajazeiras, Brazil); Rodrigues, Cláudia Cristiane Filgueira Martins (School of Health, Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte, Natal, Brazil); de Castro, Janete Lima (Postgraduate Program in Collective Health, Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte, Natal, Brazil)","Soares, Juliana Pontes (Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte)","Soares, Juliana Pontes (Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte); Lopes, Rayssa Horácio (Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte); de Souza Mendonça, Paula Beatriz (Universidade Federal do Espírito Santo); Silva, Cícera Renata Diniz Vieira (Federal University of Campina Grande); Rodrigues, Cláudia Cristiane Filgueira Martins (Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte); de Castro, Janete Lima (Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte)",14,14,,,https://mental.jmir.org/2023/1/e44195/PDF,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1154125645,42 Health Sciences; 4203 Health Services and Systems,3 Good Health and Well Being
1838,pub.1156494412,10.1109/access.2023.3261827,,,Adaptive Protection for Active Distribution Networks: An Approach Based on Fuses and Relays With Multiple Setting Groups,"Protection schemes are essential in active distribution networks and microgrids’ reliable, efficient, and flexible operation. However, the protection of these networks presents significant challenges due to operational changes, such as variations in topology, distributed energy resources connection/disconnection, and microgrid operating modes, among others. This paper proposes an adaptive protection scheme based on overcurrent devices with several setting groups based on artificial intelligence algorithms. The developed strategy is composed of two stages. In the off-line stage, a clustering technique is employed to group the active distribution network operating scenarios exhibiting similarities. The optimal settings for the protection devices are determined for each set of scenarios. On the other hand, in the on-line stage, the protection strategy’s implementation and operation, considering the active distribution network’s existing communication system, are defined. Furthermore, the approach formulates the overcurrent relay coordination as a mixed-integer non-linear optimization problem, and as a result, the optimal setting of the overcurrent protection devices is obtained. It aims to minimize the operating time, considering the transformers’ thermal limits, fuse operating curves, and overcurrent relay settings. The solution is determined by using an Augmented Lagrangian genetic algorithm. The presented protection scheme is validated on the modified IEEE 34 node test feeder, considering the main operating scenarios of the active distribution networks, such as topology changes, distributed energy resource connection/disconnection, and microgrid operating modes (on-grid and off-grid). The results obtained and its easy implementation indicates the high potential for real-life applications.",,"This work was supported by Universidad del Norte and Departamento Administrativo de Ciencia, Tecnología e Innovación—COLCIENCIAS (currently Colombian Ministry of Science, Technology, and Innovation—Minciencias), by call contest ‘‘Convocatoria 852—Conectando conocimiento de 2019’’—Project Integra2023 under Grant 111085271060 and Grant 80740-774-2020.",IEEE Access,,,,2023-01-01,2023,2023-03-24,2023-01-01,11,,31075-31091,All OA; Gold,Article,"Barranco-Carlos, Adrián; Orozco-Henao, Cesar; Marín-Quintero, Juan; Mora-Flórez, Juan; Herrera-Orozco, Andres","Barranco-Carlos, Adrián (Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, 38118, Colombia); Orozco-Henao, Cesar (Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, 38118, Colombia); Marín-Quintero, Juan (Energy Department, Universidad de la Costa, Barranquilla, 80001, Colombia); Mora-Flórez, Juan (Department of Electrical Engineering, Universidad Tecnológica de Pereira, Pereira, 11001, Colombia); Herrera-Orozco, Andres (Department of Electrical Engineering, Universidad Tecnológica de Pereira, Pereira, 11001, Colombia)","Orozco-Henao, Cesar (Universidad del Norte)","Barranco-Carlos, Adrián (Universidad del Norte); Orozco-Henao, Cesar (Universidad del Norte); Marín-Quintero, Juan (University of the Coast); Mora-Flórez, Juan (Technological University of Pereira); Herrera-Orozco, Andres (Technological University of Pereira)",14,14,,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/ielx7/6287639/6514899/10080932.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1156494412,"40 Engineering; 4008 Electrical Engineering; 4009 Electronics, Sensors and Digital Hardware; 46 Information and Computing Sciences",7 Affordable and Clean Energy

In this condition, researchers are turning to innovative options to combat this alarming situation. Combining herbal medicine with nanotechnology has created a new strategy to increase the effectiveness of phytochemical compounds in overcoming antimicrobial resistance. Pistacia atlantica is one of the promising herbs with medicinal benefits, but its poor solubility in biological fluids is challenging. In this regard, we seek to evaluate the antibacterial efficacy of Pistacia atlantica extract-loaded nanovesicle. Cholesterol, Span 40, and Pluronic F127 modified nanoformulation was developed using an environmentally friendly improved heating technique, and it was evaluated for size distribution, zeta potential, morphology, entrapment efficiency (EE%), release behavior, stability, and antimicrobial performance. By using DLS, spherical nanovesicles were identified with a size distribution of 50–150 nm and a zeta potential of −43 mV. The extract's encapsulation efficiency was 72.03%. The developed loaded nanovesicles demonstrated controlled extract release in the tested 96 h and storage stability of at least 12 months at 25 °C. Also, Comparing the two samples, the encapsulated extract had greater antibacterial activity against Candida albicans, Staphylococcus aureus, and Pseudomonas plecoglossicida with MIC of 1320, 570, and 1100 µg/mL, respectively. Besides reducing the misuse of antibiotics by allowing for the controlled release of drugs made from natural sources, we expect the findings described here to help provide alternative plant-based formulations with greater stability and antibacterial activity.",Declaration of Competing Interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

Design: Federated pharmacoepidemiological evaluation in LEGEND-T2DM.
Setting: 10 US and seven non-US electronic health record and administrative claims databases in the Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics network in eight countries from 2011 to the end of 2021.
Participants: 4.8 million patients (≥18 years) across US and non-US based databases with type 2 diabetes mellitus who had received metformin monotherapy and had initiated second line treatments.
Exposure: The exposure used to evaluate each database was calendar year trends, with the years in the study that were specific to each cohort.
Main outcomes measures: The outcome was the incidence of second line antihyperglycaemic drug use (ie, glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists, sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors, dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors, and sulfonylureas) among individuals who were already receiving treatment with metformin. The relative drug class level uptake across cardiovascular risk groups was also evaluated.
Results: 4.6 million patients were identified in US databases, 61 382 from Spain, 32 442 from Germany, 25 173 from the UK, 13 270 from France, 5580 from Scotland, 4614 from Hong Kong, and 2322 from Australia. During 2011-21, the combined proportional initiation of the cardioprotective antihyperglycaemic drugs (glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists and sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors) increased across all data sources, with the combined initiation of these drugs as second line drugs in 2021 ranging from 35.2% to 68.2% in the US databases, 15.4% in France, 34.7% in Spain, 50.1% in Germany, and 54.8% in Scotland. From 2016 to 2021, in some US and non-US databases, uptake of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists and sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors increased more significantly among populations with no cardiovascular disease compared with patients with established cardiovascular disease. No data source provided evidence of a greater increase in the uptake of these two drug classes in populations with cardiovascular disease compared with no cardiovascular disease.
Conclusions: Despite the increase in overall uptake of cardioprotective antihyperglycaemic drugs as second line treatments for type 2 diabetes mellitus, their uptake was lower in patients with cardiovascular disease than in people with no cardiovascular disease over the past decade. A strategy is needed to ensure that medication use is concordant with guideline recommendations to improve outcomes of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.",,,BMJ Medicine,,,,2023-10-06,2023,2023-10-06,2023-10,2,1,e000651,All OA;

Teachers underwent a re-planning of their teaching approaches, shifting from face-to-face teaching formats to remote ones. These challenges resulted in high levels of burnout. The identification of risk/protective factors contributing to burnout is crucial in order to inform intervention programs. Thus, we hypothesized a mediation role of teachers' mentalizing ability (processing of emotions, a component of mentalized affectivity) on the relationship between depression, anxiety, and depersonalization (burnout dimension). Two reverse models were computed. Job satisfaction, teachers' age and gender, school grade, and length of teaching experience served as covariates.
METHODS: 466 (M(sd) = 46.2 (10.4) years) online questionnaires were completed by Italian teachers of primary (n = 204) and middle (n = 242) schools. Measures of burnout, depression, anxiety, and mentalization were administered.
RESULTS: The findings corroborated our hypotheses: in all models, processing emotions served as a mediator on the relationship between depression, anxiety, and depersonalization, and on the reciprocal one. Job satisfaction positively impacted processing emotion, and negatively impacted depression and depersonalization; women teachers reported high levels of the anxious trait.
CONCLUSIONS: Overall, it can be concluded that the ability to mentalize has a beneficial impact on teachers' well-being.

In this regard, this investigation aims to explore the feasibility of producing Hot Mix Asphalt (HMA) with the inclusion of Recycled Concrete Aggregate (RCA) as a partial substitute for coarse Natural Aggregates (NAs). Thus, four different HMAs were considered, namely HMAs with coarse RCA contents of 0, 15, 30, and 45%. Specifically, the mechanical and sustainability properties of the asphalt mixtures were determined. On the one hand, the Marshall design parameters, resilient modulus, moisture susceptibility, rutting resistance, and fatigue life were addressed as mechanical properties. Meanwhile, regarding the sustainability properties, the environmental impacts and production costs were estimated using the Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) and the Life Cycle Cost Analysis (LCCA) methodologies, respectively. Consequently, the following conclusions were obtained: (i) as the coarse RCA content increases, the mechanical behavior of the HMA progressively deteriorates; (ii) this decrease in mechanical performance is acceptable up to a 15% RCA of coarse RCA, whereas for higher dosages this alteration is abrupt; and (iii) the RCA only generates sustainability benefits at a 15% replacement amount.","The authors sincerely thank COLCIENCIAS and the Universidad del Norte for supporting this research.

However, their intermittent nature poses a significant limitation. To address this, a hybrid system can be employed to enhance system reliability and efficiency. Reliability analysis plays a crucial role in evaluating the energy production capacity to meet the demand. This study aims to assess the reliability of a hybrid PV/wind microgrid through simulation. Data from a residence were collected every 10 s, and average values were computed on an hourly basis and exported for computer processing. Solar irradiation, wind speed, and temperature data were also utilized. The modeling process involved defining the PV panel, wind turbines, battery energy storage system (BESS), management strategy, and energy autonomy. The results indicate that when PV and wind systems operate independently, they are unable to consistently reduce the residential energy deficit. However, the PV/Wind/BESS configuration significantly improves system operation and proves sufficient to meet the required load in most hours. Through this configuration, only 42.5% of the total PV/wind energy utilized by the residents needs to be dispatched through the BESS. Moreover, the BESS capacity is reduced by 50% when the systems are used separately. The public grid only supplies power when the BESS is insufficient to cover the load. Therefore, the optimal sizing of the BESS plays a critical role in system viability, reducing initial installation costs, regulating microgrid parameters, and contributing to the reduction of the energy deficit. Hence, investigating the fundamental design parameters of the microgrid and BESS is essential for identifying the optimal capacity of the system and ensuring model reliability.",Declaration of Competing Interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

193,pub.1154981318,10.3390/electronics12030681,,,Hybrid Backstepping-Super Twisting Algorithm for Robust Speed Control of a Three-Phase Induction Motor,"This paper proposes a Hybrid Backstepping Super Twisting Algorithm for robust speed control of a three-phase Induction Motor in the presence of load torque uncertainties. First of all, a three-phase squirrel cage Induction Motor is modeled in MATLAB/Simulink. This is then followed by the design of different non-linear controllers, such as sliding mode control (SMC), super twisting SMC, and backstepping control. Furthermore, a novel controller is designed by the synergy of two methods, such as backstepping and super twisting SMC (Back-STC), to obtain the benefits of both techniques and, thereby, improve robustness. The sigmoid function is used with an exact differentiator to minimize the high-speed discontinuities present in the input channel. The efficacy of this novel design and its performance were evidenced in comparison with other methods, carried out by simulations in MATLAB/Simulink. Regression parameters, such as ISE (Integral Square error), IAE (Integral Absolute error) and ITAE (Integral Time Absolute error), were calculated in three different modes of operation: SSM (Start-Stop Mode), NOM (Normal Operation Mode) and DRM (Disturbance Rejection Mode). In the end, the numerical values of the regression parameters were quantitatively analyzed to draw conclusions regarding the tracking performance and robustness of the implemented non-linear control techniques.",,This research was supported and funded by the Departamento de Ingeniería de Sistemas y Computación with the Universidad Católica del Norte under project 202203010029-VRIDT-UCN.,Electronics,,,,2023-01-29,2023,2023-01-29,,12,3,681,All OA; Gold,Article,"Ali, Sadia; Prado, Alvaro; Pervaiz, Mahmood","Ali, Sadia (Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, International Islamic University, Islamabad 44000, Pakistan); Prado, Alvaro (Departamento de Ingeniería de Sistemas y Computación (DISC), Universidad Católica del Norte (UCN), Antofagasta 1270709, Chile); Pervaiz, Mahmood (Departments of Electrical and Computer Engineering, COMSATS University, Islamabad 45550, Pakistan)","Ali, Sadia (International Islamic University, Islamabad)","Ali, Sadia (International Islamic University, Islamabad); Prado, Alvaro (Catholic University of the North); Pervaiz, Mahmood (COMSATS University Islamabad)",13,13,,,https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9292/12/3/681/pdf?version=1675833034,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1154981318,"40 Engineering; 4007 Control Engineering, Mechatronics and Robotics; 4008 Electrical Engineering; 4009 Electronics, Sensors and Digital Hardware",

For the background geometry we consider the Kantowski–Sachs and the Locally Rotationally Symmetric Bianchi type III geometries. These two anisotropic spacetimes are of special interest because in the limit of isotropy they are related to the closed and open Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker cosmologies respectively. For each spacetime there exist two distinct families of flat, symmetric connections, which share the symmetries of the spacetime. We present the field equations, and from them, we determine the functional form of the fQ$$f\left( Q\right) $$ Lagrangian which yields self-similar solutions. We initially consider the vacuum case and subsequently we introduce a matter source in terms of a perfect fluid. Last but not least, we report some self-similar solutions corresponding to static spherically symmetric spacetimes.","A.P. was supported in part by the National Research Foundation of South Africa (Grant Numbers 131604).

163,pub.1157687771,10.3390/fractalfract7050368,,,Exact Solutions and Cosmological Constraints in Fractional Cosmology,"This paper investigates exact solutions of cosmological interest in fractional cosmology. Given μ, the order of Caputo’s fractional derivative, and w, the matter equation of state, we present specific exact power-law solutions. We discuss the exact general solution of the Riccati Equation, where the solution for the scale factor is a combination of power laws. Using cosmological data, we estimate the free parameters. An analysis of type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) data and the observational Hubble parameter data (OHD), also known as cosmic chronometers, and a joint analysis with data from SNe Ia + OHD leads to best-fit values for the free parameters calculated at 1σ, 2σ and 3σ confidence levels (CLs). On the other hand, these best-fit values are used to calculate the age of the Universe, the current deceleration parameter (both at 3σ CL) and the current matter density parameter at 1σ CL. Finding a Universe roughly twice as old as the one of ΛCDM is a distinction of fractional cosmology. Focusing our analysis on these results, we can conclude that the region in which μ>2 is not ruled out by observations. This parameter region is relevant because fractional cosmology gives a power-law solution without matter, which is accelerated for μ>2. We present a fractional origin model that leads to an accelerated state without appealing to Λ or dark energy.","The authors are thankful for the support of Núcleo de Investigación Geometría Diferencial y Aplicaciones, Resolución VRIDT No. 096/2022.

This study examines the influence of social media on coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and non-COVID-19 vaccination in Asia during the peri-pandemic period. Through a comprehensive analysis of available literature, we aim to elucidate the role of SMPs in shaping vaccination attitudes and behaviors. The findings highlight the detrimental impact of social media on vaccination efforts and provide insights into addressing vaccine hesitancy during this critical period. A narrative review was conducted by searching the PubMed, Scopus, and Google Scholar databases from inception to May 26, 2022. Only English-language articles involving human participants from Asian countries were included in this review. Out of the 228 articles identified through the database search, 14 articles were included in the final analysis. The prevalence of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy or negative attitudes towards COVID-19 vaccines in Asian countries was found to be high, ranging from 20% to 55% across countries. Notably, reliance on SMPs for vaccine-related information was associated with a higher likelihood of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy. This trend coincided with the proliferation of misinformation and conspiracy theories that portrayed COVID-19 vaccines as harmful during the pandemic. Similar patterns were observed for other types of vaccines, including polio, measles mumps and rubella, and diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis vaccines. The use of SMPs was also found to be associated with increased fear among caregivers in Asian countries, as well as a 3-4 times higher likelihood of delayed immunization. SMPs negatively impact vaccine intent in Asia due to misinformation and anti-vaccination campaigns during the pandemic. However, they can be a powerful tool for healthcare providers and policymakers to promote informed decision-making. Efforts should focus on leveraging SMPs to disseminate reliable information and combat hesitancy, fostering a well-informed and vaccinated population in Asia.",,,Journal of Korean Medical Science,,,Humans; Social Media; COVID-19 Vaccines; COVID-19; Vaccination; Immunization; Vaccines,2023,2023,2023,,38,40,e326,All OA; Gold,Article,"Rodrigues, Flinta; Ziade, Nelly; Jatuworapruk, Kanon; Caballero-Uribe, Carlo V; Khursheed, Tayyeba; Gupta, Latika","Rodrigues, Flinta (Seth Gordhandas Sunderdas Medical College and King Edward Memorial Hospital, Mumbai, Maharashtra,); Ziade, Nelly (Rheumatology Department, Saint-Joseph University, Beirut,; Rheumatology Department, Hotel-Dieu de France Hospital, Beirut,); Jatuworapruk, Kanon (Department of Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Thammasat University, Pathumthani,); Caballero-Uribe, Carlo V (Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla,); Khursheed, Tayyeba (Department of Rheumatology, Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences, Islamabad,); Gupta, Latika (Department of Rheumatology, Royal Wolverhampton Hospitals NHS Trust, Wolverhampton,; City Hospital, Sandwell and West Birmingham Hospitals NHS Trust, Birmingham,; Division of Musculoskeletal and Dermatological Sciences, Centre for Musculoskeletal Research, School of Biological Sciences, The University of Manchester, Manchester,)","Gupta, Latika (The Royal Wolverhampton NHS Trust; Birmingham City Hospital; University of Manchester)","Rodrigues, Flinta (King Edward Memorial Hospital and Seth G.S.

This article presents a novel model for evaluating the emissions from the production of metakaolin (MK) as a supplementary cementitious material used in ternary blended cements (e.g., 35% metakaolin, 15% limestone, and 50% portland cement) and an accompanying decisions-support tool (MKC-Tool). Applications with a case study in California showed 36%–39% reductions in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from ternary blends with MK compared to portland cement. Compared to commercially available blended cements, the ternary blend showed the lowest global warming potential. All the cements containing fly ash showed higher GHG intensities than the ternary blend (16%–42% higher GHG emissions). The development of cements made with portland cement, metakaolin, and limestone at an industrial scale will have the potential to contribute 5%–50% to the global reduction of GHG emissions from the cement industry.","Daniela M.

Depending on data traffic requirements, the number of beams, side lobe levels, nulls, and EIRP, their beamwidth must be efficiently generated and managed. Therefore, this paper describes an approach for beam pattern synthesis applied to geostationary satellite communication systems. The beam pattern synthesis can generate beams with a beamwidth variation from 0.45° to 1.5°, which can be controlled independently for the two principal cuts. In addition, other requirements have been considered, e.g., latitude, and longitude, required EIRP, minimum and maximum side love levels for the two principal cuts, and nulling direction. The output of the synthesizer is a weight matrix with beamforming coefficients of the required beam. The direct radiating array in this contribution utilizes an open-ended waveguide antenna as unit cell elements with a period of $0.875\lambda _{0}$ designed to work in left-hand circular polarization in the frequency band from 17.7 to 20.1 GHz. Since this design is intended for high-data rates applications, the minimum beamwidth requirements are very narrow. Therefore, $36\times 36$ sub-arrays of $4\times 4$ unit cells with a period of $3.5\lambda $ are considered to accomplish the beamwidth requirements while maintaining reduced computational and time resources for the weight matrix calculation compared to the conventional counterpart of $144\times 144$ unit cells. The results show that the algorithm, which uses the surrogate optimizer, can compute the weight matrix and synthesize the beam with a slight deviation from the input data.",Please note that the views of the authors of this paper do not necessarily reflect the views of ESA.,This work was supported in part by European Space Agency (ESA) funded through the “Satellite Signal Processing Techniques using a Commercial Off-The-Shelf AI Chipset (SPAICE)” under Contract 4000134522/21/NL/FGL.,IEEE Access,,,,2023-01-01,2023,2023-07-31,2023-01-01,11,,79684-79696,All OA; Gold,Article,"Vásquez-Peralvo, Juan Andrés; Querol, Jorge; Ortíz, Flor; Rios, Jorge Luis González; Lagunas, Eva; Baeza, Victor Monzon; Fontanesi, Gianluca; Garcés-Socorrás, Luis Manuel; Duncan, Juan Carlos Merlano; Chatzinotas, Symeon","Vásquez-Peralvo, Juan Andrés (Interdisciplinary Centre for Security, Reliability and Trust (SnT), L-1855, Luxembourg, Luxembourg); Querol, Jorge (Interdisciplinary Centre for Security, Reliability and Trust (SnT), L-1855, Luxembourg, Luxembourg); Ortíz, Flor (Interdisciplinary Centre for Security, Reliability and Trust (SnT), L-1855, Luxembourg, Luxembourg); Rios, Jorge Luis González (Interdisciplinary Centre for Security, Reliability and Trust (SnT), L-1855, Luxembourg, Luxembourg); Lagunas, Eva (Interdisciplinary Centre for Security, Reliability and Trust (SnT), L-1855, Luxembourg, Luxembourg); Baeza, Victor Monzon (Interdisciplinary Centre for Security, Reliability and Trust (SnT), L-1855, Luxembourg, Luxembourg); Fontanesi, Gianluca (Interdisciplinary Centre for Security, Reliability and Trust (SnT), L-1855, Luxembourg, Luxembourg); Garcés-Socorrás, Luis Manuel (Interdisciplinary Centre for Security, Reliability and Trust (SnT), L-1855, Luxembourg, Luxembourg); Duncan, Juan Carlos Merlano (Interdisciplinary Centre for Security, Reliability and Trust (SnT), L-1855, Luxembourg, Luxembourg); Chatzinotas, Symeon (Interdisciplinary Centre for Security, Reliability and Trust (SnT), L-1855, Luxembourg, Luxembourg)","Vásquez-Peralvo, Juan Andrés (Interdisciplinary Centre for Security, Reliability and Trust (SnT), L-1855, Luxembourg, Luxembourg)","Vásquez-Peralvo, Juan Andrés (Interdisciplinary Centre for Security, Reliability and Trust (SnT), L-1855, Luxembourg, Luxembourg); Querol, Jorge (Interdisciplinary Centre for Security, Reliability and Trust (SnT), L-1855, Luxembourg, Luxembourg); Ortíz, Flor (Interdisciplinary Centre for Security, Reliability and Trust (SnT), L-1855, Luxembourg, Luxembourg); Rios, Jorge Luis González (Interdisciplinary Centre for Security, Reliability and Trust (SnT), L-1855, Luxembourg, Luxembourg); Lagunas, Eva (Interdisciplinary Centre for Security, Reliability and Trust (SnT), L-1855, Luxembourg, Luxembourg); Baeza, Victor Monzon (Interdisciplinary Centre for Security, Reliability and Trust (SnT), L-1855, Luxembourg, Luxembourg); Fontanesi, Gianluca (Interdisciplinary Centre for Security, Reliability and Trust (SnT), L-1855, Luxembourg, Luxembourg); Garcés-Socorrás, Luis Manuel (Interdisciplinary Centre for Security, Reliability and Trust (SnT), L-1855, Luxembourg, Luxembourg); Duncan, Juan Carlos Merlano (Interdisciplinary Centre for Security, Reliability and Trust (SnT), L-1855, Luxembourg, Luxembourg); Chatzinotas, Symeon (Interdisciplinary Centre for Security, Reliability and Trust (SnT), L-1855, Luxembourg, Luxembourg)",12,12,,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/ielx7/6287639/6514899/10197375.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1162909480,"40 Engineering; 4006 Communications Engineering; 4009 Electronics, Sensors and Digital Hardware",

Information regarding population connectivity is crucial to evaluate its conservation status and local fishing impacts. In this study, we sampled 922 putative Bull Sharks from 19 locations in the first global assessment of population structure of this cosmopolitan species. Using a recently developed DNA-capture approach (DArTcap), samples were genotyped for 3400 nuclear markers. Additionally, full mitochondrial genomes of 384 Indo-Pacific samples were sequenced. Reproductive isolation was found between and across ocean basins (eastern Pacific, western Atlantic, eastern Atlantic, Indo-West Pacific) with distinct island populations in Japan and Fiji. Bull Sharks appear to maintain gene flow using shallow coastal waters as dispersal corridors, whereas large oceanic distances and historical land-bridges act as barriers. Females tend to return to the same area for reproduction, making them more susceptible to local threats and an important focus for management actions. Given these behaviors, the exploitation of Bull Sharks from insular populations, such as Japan and Fiji, may instigate local decline that cannot readily be replenished by immigration, which can in turn affect ecosystem dynamics and functions. These data also supported the development of a genetic panel to ascertain the population of origin, which will be useful in monitoring the trade of fisheries products and assessing population-level impacts of this harvest.","ACKNOWLEDGMENTS This work was supported by the Sea World Research and Rescue Foundation Inc, the Ord River Research Offset grant through CSIRO, and the Marine Biodiversity Hub, a collaborative partnership supported through funding from the Australian Government&#x27;s National Environmental Science Program.

163,pub.1155171532,10.3390/fractalfract7020149,,,Revisiting Fractional Cosmology,"Recently, the research community has been exploring fractional calculus to address problems related to cosmology; in this approach, the gravitational action integral is altered, leading to a modified Friedmann equation, then the resulting theory is compared against observational data. In this context, dynamical systems can be used along with an analysis the phase spaces for different values of the fractional order of the derivative and their different matter contents. The equilibrium points are classified, providing a range for the order of the fractional derivative in order to investigate whether the cosmological history can be reconstructed and a late-time accelerating power-law solution obtained for the scale factor. In this paper, we discuss the physical interpretation of the corresponding cosmological solutions with particular emphasis on the influence of the fractional order of the derivative in a theory of gravity that includes a scalar field minimally coupled to gravity. The presented results improve and extend those obtained previously, further demonstrating that fractional calculus can play a relevant role in cosmology.","The authors are thankful for the support of Núcleo de Investigación Geometría Diferencial y Aplicaciones, Resolución VRIDT No. 096/2022.

123,pub.1163670524,10.3847/1538-4357/ace9b8,,,A Tale of Two Disks: Mapping the Milky Way with the Final Data Release of APOGEE,"We present new maps of the Milky Way disk showing the distribution of metallicity ([Fe/H]), α-element abundances ([Mg/Fe]), and stellar age, using a sample of 66,496 red giant stars from the final data release (DR17) of the Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment survey. We measure radial and vertical gradients, quantify the distribution functions for age and metallicity, and explore chemical clock relations across the Milky Way for the low-α disk, high-α disk, and total population independently. The low-α disk exhibits a negative radial metallicity gradient of −0.06 ± 0.001 dex kpc−1, which flattens with distance from the midplane. The high-α disk shows a flat radial gradient in metallicity and age across nearly all locations of the disk. The age and metallicity distribution functions shift from negatively skewed in the inner Galaxy to positively skewed at large radius. Significant bimodality in the [Mg/Fe]–[Fe/H] plane and in the [Mg/Fe]–age relation persist across the entire disk. The age estimates have typical uncertainties of ∼0.15 in log(age) and may be subject to additional systematic errors, which impose limitations on conclusions drawn from this sample. Nevertheless, these results act as critical constraints on galactic evolution models, constraining which physical processes played a dominant role in the formation of the Milky Way disk. We discuss how radial migration predicts many of the observed trends near the solar neighborhood and in the outer disk, but an additional more dramatic evolution history, such as the multi-infall model or a merger event, is needed to explain the chemical and age bimodality elsewhere in the Galaxy.","We would like to thank the anonymous reviewer for providing useful feedback toward improving this manuscript.

Given the molecular diversity characteristic of each cellular phenotype, the possible cytopathic, tissue and clinical effects are difficult to predict, which determines the heterogeneity of COVID-19 symptoms. The purpose of this article is to provide a comprehensive review of the cytopathic effects of SARS-CoV-2 on various cell types, focusing on the development of COVID-19, which in turn may lead, in some patients, to a persistence of symptoms after recovery from the disease, a condition known as long COVID. We describe the molecular mechanisms underlying virus-host interactions, including alterations in protein expression, intracellular signaling pathways, and immune responses. In particular, the article highlights the potential impact of these cytopathies on cellular function and clinical outcomes, such as immune dysregulation, neuropsychiatric disorders, and organ damage. The article concludes by discussing future directions for research and implications for the management and treatment of COVID-19 and long COVID.","We thank the Fundación Carolina, Universidad Simón Bolívar, Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation of Colombia and Integrated Territorial Investment (ITI), Junta de Andalucía for facilitating the resources for article publication.

In light of this and based on a survey, this research seeks to examine how and why work-related stress impacts the life satisfaction level of university junior faculty members. The results indicate that the three subdivisions of university faculty members' work-related stress, namely, research stress, teaching stress, and administrative stress, are all negatively related to their life satisfaction level. In addition, emotional burnout has been confirmed to function as the psychological mechanism for the aforementioned main effects. The research contributes to the literature mainly by offering a new insight in which the three subdivisions of work-related stress are regarded as independent variables affecting the life satisfaction level of university junior faculty members.",,,Frontiers in Psychology,,,,2023-02-01,2023,2023-02-01,,14,,1111434,All OA; Gold,Article,"Xu, Yin; Wang, Yike","Xu, Yin (School of Foreign Languages, Renmin University of China, Beijing, China); Wang, Yike (School of Management, Shanghai University of International Business and Economics, Shanghai, China)","Wang, Yike (Shanghai University of International Business and Economics)","Xu, Yin (Renmin University of China); Wang, Yike (Shanghai University of International Business and Economics)",11,11,,,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2023.1111434/pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1155026717,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 52 Psychology,3 Good Health and Well Being

Therefore, monitoring leaves, especially when pigment accumulation occurs, is crucial for monitoring organelles, cells, tissue, and whole-plant levels. However, accurately measuring these changes can be challenging. Thus, this study tests three hypotheses, whereby reflectance hyperspectroscopy and chlorophyll a fluorescence kinetics analyses can improve our understanding of the photosynthetic process in Codiaeum variegatum (L.) A. Juss, a plant with variegated leaves and different pigments. The analyses include morphological and pigment profiling, hyperspectral data, chlorophyll a fluorescence curves, and multivariate analyses using 23 JIP test parameters and 34 different vegetation indexes. The results show that photochemical reflectance index (PRI) is a useful vegetation index (VI) for monitoring biochemical and photochemical changes in leaves, as it strongly correlates with chlorophyll and nonphotochemical dissipation (Kn) parameters in chloroplasts. In addition, some vegetation indexes, such as the pigment-specific simple ratio (PSSRc), anthocyanin reflectance index (ARI1), ratio analysis of reflectance spectra (RARS), and structurally insensitive pigment index (SIPI), are highly correlated with morphological parameters and pigment levels, while PRI, moisture stress index (MSI), normalized difference photosynthetic (PVR), fluorescence ratio (FR), and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) are associated with photochemical components of photosynthesis. Combined with the JIP test analysis, our results showed that decreased damage to energy transfer in the electron transport chain is correlated with the accumulation of carotenoids, anthocyanins, flavonoids, and phenolic compounds in the leaves. Phenomenological energy flux modelling shows the highest changes in the photosynthetic apparatus based on PRI and SIPI when analyzed with Pearson's correlation, the hyperspectral vegetation index (HVI) algorithm, and the partial least squares (PLS) to select the most responsive wavelengths. These findings are significant for monitoring nonuniform leaves, particularly when leaves display high variation in pigment profiling in variegated and colorful leaves. This is the first study on the rapid and precise detection of morphological, biochemical, and photochemical changes combined with vegetation indexes for different optical spectroscopy techniques.","Thanks to Krzysztof Sitko from the University of Silesia in Katowice (Poland) for the encouragement and support of pipeline models, Eliemar Campostrini and Guilherme Rodrigues de Souza from the State University of the North Fluminense Darcy Ribeiro (UENF) for supporting the JIP test, Luis Guilherme Teixeira Crusiol (Embrapa Soja-National Soybean Research Center-Brazilian Agricultural Research Corporation) for supporting HVI algorithms, Glaucio Leboso Alemparte Abrantes dos Santos for supporting PLS algorithms, and Cristiane Moriwaki de Andrade from the State University of Maringá for supporting pigment profiling, and Érika Cristina Takamizawa Sato for managing funds in PGA-UEM.

For this reason, this study summarizes the results of investigating the accessibility of services and recreational spaces under the parameters of a “15-minute city” for the elderly people in the city of Santiago de Chile. The investigation employed a multivariate geostatistical analysis with a quantitative approach and was developed on a census block scale to test some of the principles of the 15-min city along with the principles on active aging of the elderly. The results are surprising, show a good territorial coverage for the study area and open the possibility of Santiago becoming a 15-min city for older adults.

Since its isolation in the last century, AsA has attracted the attention of the scientific community, allowing the discovery of the L-galactose pathway, which is the main pathway for AsA biosynthesis in plants. Thus, the aim of this review is to analyze the genetic and biochemical strategies employed by plant cells for regulating AsA biosynthesis through the L-galactose pathway. In this pathway, participates eight enzymes encoded by the genes PMI, PMM, GMP, GME, GGP, GPP, GDH, and GLDH. All these genes and their encoded enzymes have been well characterized, demonstrating their participation in AsA biosynthesis. Also, have described some genetic and biochemical strategies that allow its regulation. The genetic strategy includes regulation at transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels. In the first one, it was demonstrated that the expression levels of the genes correlate directly with AsA content in the tissues/organs of the plants. Also, it was proved that these genes are light-induced because they have light-responsive promoter motifs (e.g., ATC, I-box, GT1 motif, etc.). In addition, were identified some transcription factors that function as activators (e.g., SlICE1, AtERF98, SlHZ24, etc.) or inactivators (e.g., SlL1L4, ABI4, SlNYYA10) regulate the transcription of these genes. In the second one, it was proved that some genes have alternative splicing events and could be a mechanism to control AsA biosynthesis. Also, it was demonstrated that a conserved cis-acting upstream open reading frame (5'-uORF) located in the 5'-untranslated region of the GGP gene induces its post-transcriptional repression. Among the biochemical strategies discovered is the control of the enzyme levels (usually by decreasing their quantities), control of the enzyme catalytic activity (by increasing or decreasing its activity), feedback inhibition of some enzymes (GME and GGP), subcellular compartmentation of AsA, the metabolon assembly of the enzymes, and control of AsA biosynthesis by electron flow. Together, the construction of this basic knowledge has been establishing the foundations for generating genetically improved varieties of fruits and vegetables enriched with AsA, commonly used in animal and human feed.","The authors are grateful to authorities and administrative-technical staff of the Universidad Nacional de la Amazonia Peruana (UNAP) for providing us with facilities, acceding to the laboratories, and their permanent support during the realization of the present investigation.

The resulting design conducts a Dynamic Sliding Mode Control (DSMC) approach based on a Nonlinear PID (NPID) sliding surface. The design procedure first uses the reaction curve identification method to obtain a reduced-order model from the nonlinear system. A First-Order Plus Dead-Time (FOPDT) model represents the reduced order model. The resulting controller is derived from the reduced-order model and the nonlinear surface. Therefore, a hybrid control framework (DSMC-NPID) is obtained and then applied to a couple of nonlinear chemical processes, a Variable Height Mixing Tank (VHMT), and a Continuous Stirred Tank Reactor (CSTR) in both cases to track reference trajectories and reject disturbances. Then, the proposed control approach is assessed and compared to a PID controller and a DSMC with a linear PID surface. Such evaluation is carried out using control performance indices such as Integral Square Error (ISE), Maximum Overshoot (MO), control total variation (TVu), and Settling Time (ST), respectively. Finally, the results of experimental trials were quantitatively compared to each controller, demonstrating that the DSMC-NPID approach could reduce the ISE by around 6.3%, MO by 89.3%, and ST by 17.6% regarding DSMC-PID. In addition, the results obtained for the CSTR system were similar, demonstrating that the proposed control strategy is suitable for different industrial processes.","The authors would like to thank the Editors and anonymous Reviewers for providing insightful suggestions and comments to improve the quality of this research paper.

A survey was carried out with specialists that assessed 27 practices (PR) proposed by ISO 56002, considering two types of firms: small and medium-sized industries (SMI) and large industries (LI). The methodological approach included Hierarchical Cluster Analysis to identify the similarities between the specialists and define levels of specialists, as well as Fuzzy TOPSIS and frequency and sensitivity analyses to examine their responses. PR1 (analysis of internal and external issues that impact innovation management) was deemed the best practice for LIs, whereas PR10 (adequate assessment of potential partnerships) was best evaluated for SMIs. The PR27 (periodic audits to identify opportunities for improvement) received the lowest rating from both LIs and SMIs. In general, SMIs in the Brazilian context have more severe deficiencies in terms of applying innovation management practices than LIs.

However, the literature needs more clarification on the determinants of ex ante determinants for community participation in ecotourism in coastal lagoon ecosystems. This paper aims to analyze community-based ecosystem management through participation in ecotourism. After a case study design, a survey-like method was used to identify the social willingness to engage in ecotourism and the benefits that the participants preferred as a result of participating. The results show that most respondents believe that ecotourism would promote environmental conservation in the area and also considered their participation essential to ensure the success of ecotourism. Therefore, this research emphasizes the importance of identifying local perceptions of ecotourism before its implementation, evaluates the willingness of locals to participate in this strategy to highlight community agency, and investigates how participation could be achieved.

238,pub.1154827065,10.3389/fmats.2022.1074738,,,Application of paper sludge ash and incinerated sewage ash in emulsified asphalt cold mixtures,"Certain disadvantages could have appeared while using hot mix asphalt (HMA), such as the release of unhealthy gases into the environment (environmental issues), difficulty in sustaining the temperature over long distances (logistical issues), and consuming a sufficient amount of energy while preparing and laying down (practical and economic issues). To overcome the aforementioned issues, this study aimed to develop rapid-curing emulsified asphalt cold mixes (EACM) comprising a cementitious filler made from industrial by-product materials. Paper sludge ash (PSA) is used as an active filler for application in the EACM rather than conventional mineral filler. Additionally, to maximize the effect of PSA’s hydraulic activity, incinerated sewage ash (ISA) is utilized as an activator at a concentration of 0%–4% by mass of the aggregates. The results demonstrate that the use of waste PSA significantly improves the indirect tensile stiffness modulus (ITSM) by around 10 times more after 2 days than the traditional emulsified asphalt cold mixes. In addition, the improvement in ITSM was around 30% and 65% for 6%PSA+1%ISA and 6%PSA+4%ISA mixes, respectively. Furthermore, the rutting for the 6%PSA+1%ISA and 6%PSA+4%ISA mixes decreased to around 19% and 11% in comparison to the traditional 131-pen HMA. The formation of hydration products and rapid demulsification of asphalt emulsion, which results in binding within the mixtures, are responsible for the increased ITSM and rutting resistance. As a result, environmental issues are minimized, and energy preservation may be maintained.","The authors extend their thanks to the Ministry of Science and Higher Education of the Russian Federation and University of Warith Al-Anbiyaa, Iraq for financial support for this study.",The research is partially funded by the Ministry of Science and Higher Education of the Russian Federation under the strategic academic leadership program “Priority 2030” (Agreement 075-15-2021-1333 dated 30 September 2021).,Frontiers in Materials,,,,2023-01-25,2023,2023-01-25,,9,,1074738,All OA; Gold,Article,"Dulaimi, Anmar; Qaidi, Shaker; Al-Busaltan, Shakir; Milad, Abdalrhman; Sadique, Monower; Kadhim, Mustafa Amoori; Al-Khafaji, Ruqayah; Sabri, Mohanad Muayad Sabri","Dulaimi, Anmar (College of Engineering, University of Warith Al-Anbiyaa, Ministry of Education, Karbala, Iraq; School of Civil Engineering and Built Environment, Liverpool John Moores University, Liverpool, United Kingdom); Qaidi, Shaker (Department of Civil Engineering, College of Engineering, University of Duhok, Duhok, Iraq; Department of Civil Engineering, College of Engineering, Nawroz University, Duhok, Iraq); Al-Busaltan, Shakir (Department of Civil Engineering, College of Engineering, University of Kerbala, Karbala, Iraq); Milad, Abdalrhman (Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, College of Engineering, University of Nizwa, Nizwa, Ad-Dakhliyah, Oman); Sadique, Monower (School of Civil Engineering and Built Environment, Liverpool John Moores University, Liverpool, United Kingdom); Kadhim, Mustafa Amoori (Department of Civil Engineering, College of Engineering, University of Kerbala, Karbala, Iraq); Al-Khafaji, Ruqayah (Department of Building and Construction Technologies Engineering, Al-Mustaqbal University College, Babylon, Iraq); Sabri, Mohanad Muayad Sabri (Peter the Great St. Petersburg Polytechnic University, St. Petersburg, Russia)","Dulaimi, Anmar (University of Warith Alanbiyaa; Liverpool John Moores University)","Dulaimi, Anmar (University of Warith Alanbiyaa; Liverpool John Moores University); Qaidi, Shaker (University of Duhok; Nawroz University); Al-Busaltan, Shakir (University of Karbala); Milad, Abdalrhman (University of Nizwa); Sadique, Monower (Liverpool John Moores University); Kadhim, Mustafa Amoori (University of Karbala); Al-Khafaji, Ruqayah (Al-Mustaqbal University College); Sabri, Mohanad Muayad Sabri (Peter the Great St. Petersburg Polytechnic University)",10,10,,,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmats.2022.1074738/pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1154827065,40 Engineering; 4005 Civil Engineering,7 Affordable and Clean Energy
225,pub.1160527332,10.3390/su151310640,,,Use of Wastewater and Electrogenic Bacteria to Generate Eco-Friendly Electricity through Microbial Fuel Cells,"Power generation and wastewater treatment are two great challenges for sustainable development. Microbial fuel cells (MFCs) are a sustainable alternative that can generate bioelectricity in the bioremediation process of wastewater. For this reason, the objective of this research was to generate bioelectricity through double-chamber microbial-combustion cell systems from wastewater from the Covicorti Wastewater Treatment Plant (PTARC) in the anodic chamber and electrogenic bacteria such as Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Acinetobacter bereziniae, and Achromobacteria xylosoxidans in the cathode chamber, respectively. Measurements of the voltage, current, power density, current density, and optical density of the bacteria and biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) were made. In addition, a metagenomic analysis of the wastewater sample was performed. It was shown that the MFC with A. xylosoxidans generated the highest voltage peak (1.01 ± 0.06 V) on day 24, while the MFC with S. maltophilia generated the highest current value (0.71 ± 0.02 mA). The pH levels were slightly alkaline, and the maximum anodic conductivity value was presented by the MFC with A. cerevisiae, with a peak value of 81 ± 2 mS/cm on day 24. On the other hand, a maximum power density and current density of 195,493 ± 4717 mW/m2 and 4987 A/cm2, respectively, were obtained in the MFC with A. xylosoxidans. Finally, the metagenomic analysis identified the predominant phyla of Proteobacteria present in wastewater samples capable of generating electrical energy as Bacillota, Pseudomonadota, Bacteroidota, Actinomyketone, and Campylobacterota.",,This research received no external funding.,Sustainability,,,,2023-07-06,2023,2023-07-06,,15,13,10640,All OA; Gold,Article,"De La Cruz-Noriega, Magaly; Benites, Santiago M.; Rojas-Flores, Segundo; Otiniano, Nelida M.; Vargas, Ana M.

TransMiCable is the first cable car in Bogotá, Colombia, and the wider intervention includes renovated parks and playgrounds. We assessed the effects of TransMiCable and the wider intervention on physical activity.
METHODS: The Urban Transformations and Health natural experiment was a prospective quasi-experimental study conducted from Feb 1, 2018, to Dec 18, 2018 (baseline, pre-intervention) and from July 2, 2019, to March 15, 2020 (post-intervention follow-up) in the TransMiCable intervention area (Ciudad Bolívar settlement) and a control area without TransMiCable (San Cristóbal settlement). A multistage strategy was used to sample households in each area, with one adult (aged ≥18 years) per household invited to participate. Eligible participants had lived in the intervention or control areas for at least 2 years and were not planning to move within the next 2 years. Physical activity was assessed among participants in the intervention and control areas before and after the inauguration of TransMiCable in Ciudad Bolívar with the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (long form) and with wearable accelerometers. Complete cases (those with baseline and follow-up data) were included in analyses. Respondents were classed as being physically active if they met 2020 WHO guidelines (≥150 min per week of moderate activity, ≥75 min per week of vigorous activity, or equivalent combinations); and accelerometery data were classified with the Freedson cut-points for adults. Data were also gathered in zonal parks (area ≥10 000 m2) and neighbourhood parks (area <10 000 m2) in the intervention and control areas by direct observation with the System for Observing Play and Recreation in Communities, to assess levels of physical activity before and after the TransMiCable intervention. Multilevel regression models were used to assess changes in physical activity associated with the TransMiCable intervention.
FINDINGS: Physical activity questionnaires were completed by 2052 adult participants (1289 [62·8%] women and 763 [37·2%] men; mean age 43·5 years [SD 17·7]) before the inauguration of TransMiCable. After the inauguration, the follow-up (final) questionnaire sample comprised 825 adults in the intervention group and 854 in the control group, including 357 adults in the intervention group and 334 in the control group with valid accelerometery data. 334 (40·5%) of 825 participants in the intervention group reported levels of physical activity that met the 2020 WHO guidelines during walking for transport before the intervention, and 426 (51·6%) afterwards (change 11·1 percentage points [95% CI 6·4 to 15·9]). A similar change was observed in the control group (change 8·0 percentage points [3·4 to 12·5]; adjusted odds ratio [OR] for the time-by-group interaction, intervention vs control group: 1·1 [95% CI 0·8 to 1·5], p=0·38). Time spent doing moderate-to-vigorous physical activity, measured with accelerometers, did not change in the intervention group after the inauguration of TransMiCable (change -0·8 min per day [-4·6 to 3·0]) and did not change compared with the control group (adjusted β for the time-by-group interaction: 1·4 min per day [95% CI -2·0 to 4·9], p=0·41). Moderate-to-vigorous physical activity was 52·1 min per day (SD 24·7) before and 59·4 min per day (35·2) after the inauguration of TransMiCable in new regular users who reported using TransMiCable during mandatory trips for work or education (n=32; change 7·3 min per day [-22·5 to 7·9]). After the intervention, an increase in the proportion of male individuals engaging in moderate or vigorous physical activity was observed in a renovated zonal park (adjusted OR for the time-by-group interaction, intervention vs control park: 2·7 [1·1 to 6·8], p=0·033). Female users of a renovated neighbourhood park were less likely to become engaged in moderate or vigorous physical activity than female users of the control area neighbourhood park (adjusted OR for the time-by-group interaction: 0·4 [0·1 to 0·6], p=0·019).
INTERPRETATION: It is encouraging that walking for transport remained high in the TransMiCable intervention area when the use of private motorised transport had increased elsewhere in Bogotá. In low-income urban areas, where transport-related walking is a necessity, transport interventions should be focused on efforts to maintain participation in active travel while improving conditions under which it occurs.

Proliferation, migration and overall behaviour of those cells is greatly determined by micromechanical queues provided by the ECM. Lung fibrosis displays an aberrant increased deposition of ECM which likely changes filament organization and stiffens the ECM, thus upregulating the profibrotic profile of pulmonary cells. We have previously used AFM to assess changes in the Young's Modulus (E) of the ECM in the lung. Here, we perform further ECM topographical, mechanical and viscoelastic analysis at the micro- and nano-scale throughout fibrosis development. Furthermore, we provide nanoscale correlations between topographical and elastic properties of the ECM fibres. Firstly, we identify a softening of the ECM after rats are instilled with media associated with recovery of mechanical homeostasis, which is hindered in bleomycin-instilled lungs. Moreover, we find opposite correlations between fibre stiffness and roughness in PBS- vs bleomycin-treated lung. Our findings suggest that changes in ECM nanoscale organization take place at different stages of fibrosis, with the potential to help identify pharmacological targets to hinder its progression.",,"This research was partially funded by Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovación (PID2020-113910RB-I00-AEI/10.13039/501100011033, SAF2017-85574-R, and PID2020-116808RB-I00 AEI-Retos) and SEPAR (900-2019).

However, their usage is limited as the high capital and operating costs; according to the International Renewable Energy Agency's 2020 report, the global weighted average levelized cost of electricity (L.C.O.E) for P.T.Cs was 0.185 $/kWh in 2018. This work analyses the economic, technical, and environmental potential of sustainable energy to increase the use of P.T.Cs in different sectors. To study how self-weight, heat loss, and wind velocity affect P.T.C performance, prototype testing, and wind flow analysis were used. Although P.T.Cs outperform in capacity factor, gross-to-net conversion, and annual energy production, improving their overall efficiency is crucial in reducing total energy production costs. Wire coils, discs, and twisted tape-type inserts can enhance their performance by increasing turbulence and heat transfer area. Improving the system's overall efficiency by enhancing the functioning and operation of individual components will also help decrease total energy production costs. The aim is to minimize the L.C.O.E associated with a P.T.C in order to enhance its economic viability for an extended period. When the nanofluid-oriented P.T.C was included in the conventional P.T.C workings, there was a decrease in the L.C.O.E by 1%. Of all the technologies available, ocean, geothermal, and C.S.P parabolic trough plants generate lower amounts of waste and harmful gases, with average emissions of 2.39%, 2.23%, and 2.16%, respectively, throughout their lifespan. For solar-only and non-hybrid thermal energy storage plants, the range of greenhouse gas emissions is between 20 and 34 kgCO2 equivalents per megawatt-hour. Coal, natural gas steam turbines, nuclear power plants, bioenergy, solar PV, geothermal, concentrated solar power, hydropower reservoir, hydropower river, ocean, and wind power plants all release greenhouse gases at rates of 1022, 587.5, 110.5, 633, 111, 48, 41, 82.5, 7.5, 12.5, and 41.5 gCO2-e/kWh, respectively. This information is useful to compare the environmental effect of various energy sources and help us to choose cleaner, more sustainable options for the production of electricity. The ongoing advancements and future scope of P.T.Cs could potentially make them more economically viable for domestic, commercial, and industrial applications.","Declaration of competing interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

1528,pub.1160331695,10.1109/access.2023.3291803,,,Development of a Robot-Assisted Telerehabilitation System With Integrated IIoT and Digital Twin,"Upper limb dysfunction (ULD) is common following a stroke, spinal cord injury, trauma, and occupational accidents. Post-stroke patients with ULD need long-term assistance from therapists for their rehabilitation, which generally occurs at the hospital or outpatient clinic. Physical therapists are unavailable because of geographical, financial, and scheduling concerns, and continuity of care needs to be improved due to the need to travel to multiple locations for therapy. As a result, providing specific, tailored therapy programs is challenging due to the absence of feedback and real-time monitoring. An effective telerehabilitation system can address this issue and is more cost-effective for healthcare providers and patients than traditional inpatient or person-to-person rehabilitation. Remotely operating robotic devices and using advanced technology improves patient and healthcare provider safety and reduces injuries. In this study, we developed a novel telerehabilitation framework for rehabilitation robots utilizing PTC’s Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) platform to remotely provide robot-aided therapies for individuals with ULD. With the developed telerehabilitation framework, an operator can teleoperate the rehab robots to deliver Upper-limb (UL) exercises via an Augmented Reality (AR) based graphical user interface (GUI). This AR platform communicates bidirectionally using ThingWorx IIOT. It leverages the digital twin (DT) structure facilitated by Vuforia studio to visualize the physical robot motions happening in remote places. The telerehabilitation framework was validated through a commercially available robot (xArm 5), an exoskeleton (SREx), and an end-effector type rehabilitation robot (DMRbot) developed at Biorobotics Lab, UWM. The experiment results show that the telerehabilitation system can successfully provide UL rehab exercises in 2D and 3D planes via AR. The proposed framework is developed to facilitate robust and more promising robot-aided rehabilitation sessions remotely, and it can also be applied in other medical applications.","The authors would like to thank PTC Inc., for providing Vuforia and ThingWorx support for this research.","This work was supported in part by the Connected System Institute, in part by the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, and in part by the Richard and Joanne Grigg Professorship.",IEEE Access,,,,2023-01-01,2023,2023-07-03,2023-01-01,11,,70174-70189,All OA; Gold,Article,"Khan, Mahafuzur Rahaman; Sunny, Samiul Haque; Ahmed, Tanvir; Shahria, Tanzil; Modi, Preet Parag; Zarif, Ishrak Islam; De, Javier Dario Sanjuan; Ahamed, Iqbal; Ahmed, Helal Uddin; Ketchum, Erin M.

The strains were identified as Vibrio chagasii using phenotypic characterization and whole genome sequence analysis. Both strains exhibited the phenotypic properties associated with virulence, gelatin hydrolysis and β-hemolysis, whereas only VPAP36 produced phospholipase and only VPAP40 produced caseinase. The whole genome analysis showed that the strains harbored genes encoding for the virulence factors, the EPS type II secretion system, and Quorum Sensing (auto-inductor 1 and auto-inductor 2), whereas genes encoding a metalloproteinase and a capsular polysaccharide were detected only in the VPAP40 genome. When challenge bioassays using healthy 11-day-old scallop larvae were performed, the V. chagasii VPAP36 and VPAP40 strains exhibited significant (p < 0.05) differences in their larval lethal activity, producing, after 48 h, larval mortalities of 65.51 ± 4.40% and 28.56 ± 5.35%, respectively. Otherwise, the cell-free extracellular products of the VPAP36 and VPAP40 strains produced larval mortalities of 20.86 ± 2.40% and 18.37 ± 2.40%, respectively, after 48 h of exposure. This study reports for the first time the isolation of V. chagasii from the massive larval mortalities of the farmed scallop (Argopecten purpuratus) in Chile, and demonstrates the pathogenic activity of V. chagasii towards the Chilean scallop, the second most important species for Chilean mariculture.",Good collaboration with larval sampling at each scallop hatchery.,"This research was partially funded by the Science and Technology National Council (CONICYT) of Chile (grant number 1090793).

Average litter abundance on the Caribbean Sea beaches (1.42 items/m2–12.21 g/m2) and in mangrove forests (1.29 items/m2–28.72 g/m2) were greater than that of the Pacific Ocean beaches (0 items/m2–0 g/m2) and mangrove forests (1.13 items/m2–79.41 g/m2). The most abundant litter material was plastic, which represented 93.61% of the total litter content. According to the Clean Coast Index, the sites analyzed in the Caribbean Sea were “Moderate” to “Extremely Dirty”, while those in the Pacific Ocean were “Clean” to “Moderate Dirty”. The Magdalena River is considered the main source of litter on the Caribbean Sea coast, while on the Pacific Ocean coast, litter is essentially associated with the mismanagement of solid wastes. This study constitutes a baseline on the litter content of beaches and mangrove forests, and is useful for establishing sound strategies for their protection, restoration and conservation.","The authors thank the national park staff (Vía Parque Isla Salamanca) for their support at this sampling site.

625,pub.1158334574,10.3390/rs15112716,,,Satellite Earth Observation for Essential Climate Variables Supporting Sustainable Development Goals: A Review on Applications,"Essential climate variables (ECVs) have been recognized as crucial information for achieving Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). There is an agreement on 54 ECVs to understand climate evolution, and multiple rely on satellite Earth observation (abbreviated as s-ECVs). Despite the efforts to encourage s-ECV use for SDGs, there is still a need to further integrate them into the indicator calculations. Therefore, we conducted a systematic literature review to identify s-ECVs used in SDG monitoring. Results showed the use of 14 s-ECVs, the most frequent being land cover, ozone, precursors for aerosols and ozone, precipitation, land surface temperature, soil moisture, soil carbon, lakes, and leaf area index. They were related to 16 SDGs (mainly SDGs 3, 6, 11, 14, and 15), 33 targets, and 23 indicators. However, only 10 indicators (belonging to SDGs 6, 11, and 15) were calculated using s-ECVs. This review raises research opportunities by identifying s-ECVs yet to be used in the indicator calculations. Therefore, indicators supporting SDGs must be updated to use this valuable source of information which, in turn, allows a worldwide indicator comparison. Additionally, this review is relevant for scientists and policymakers for future actions and policies to better integrate s-ECVs into the Agenda 2030.",Luis M.

Spatiotemporal patterns of extreme NDVI anomalies, water extraction and drought severity in a large-scale mining area of Atacama, northern Chile","In the Andes, multiple human and climatic factors threaten the conservation of bofedales, a type of high altitude peat forming wetland widely distributed in the tropical and subtropical Andes. In northern Chile, climate change and water extraction for industrial activities are among the most significant threats to these relevant socio-hydrological systems hosting indigenous pastoral communities. In this study, we present an integrated analysis of Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) anomalies, drought severity and water rights granted to industry to provide insight on the conservation status of bofedales, historical drivers of their transformation, and current threats. Using Landsat satellite imagery from 1986 to 2018, we identify spatio-temporal NDVI changes of 442 bofedales in one of the leading copper producing regions of the world. The NDVI time series analysis over 32 growing seasons was used to detect extreme anomalies, i.e. values outside the 95 % of the reference frequency distribution, indicating periods of extreme changes in the productivity of these high Andes wetlands. To evaluate the relationship between bofedales NDVI extreme periods to drought and continued water extraction activities, we combine a climate-based multi-temporal-scale drought index (SPEI) with the geospatial latitudinal distribution of water rights granted for extractive industries in the study area. Over the time period of analysis, the total amount of granted water rights increased 465 % from 1,201 l/s recorded before 1985 to 5,584 l/s in 2018. In the areas where the highest amount of water rights are concentrated, i.e. between 21.3°S and 22.1°S, “green” bofedales (NDVI>=0.23) are practically absent. NDVI of the austral summer (JFM) was highly correlated with the severity of drought occurring during the three months of the growing season peak. While our findings show bofedal productivity is mostly influenced by precipitation and temperature of the wet season (JFM) during the study period, results also raise questions regarding possible bofedal loss occurring over the previous 80 years prior to the satellite record, wherein water extraction activities have significantly increased according to official records.","This research was funded by the Agencia Nacional de Investigación y Desarrollo, ANID - FONDECYT - 1201527 and ANID – MILENIO – NCS2022_009.

In this work we extend the study of these critical phenomena to Kaniadakis theory, which is a non-extensive generalization of the classical statistical mechanics incorporating relativity. By applying the typical framework of condensed-matter physics, we analyze the impact of Kaniadakis entropy onto the equation of state, the Gibbs free energy and the critical exponents of AdS black holes in the extended phase space. Additionally, we investigate the underlying micro-structure of black holes in Ruppeiner geometry, which reveals appreciable deviations of the nature of the particle interactions from the standard behavior. Our analysis opens up new perspectives on the understanding of black hole thermodynamics in a relativistic statistical framework, highlighting the role of non-extensive corrections in the AdS black holes/van der Waals fluids dual picture.","The authors are grateful to the anonymous Reviewer for very helpful suggestions and comments to the original manuscript.

This paper proposes a hybrid method that integrates a convolutional neural network (CNN) with optimized hyperparameters by the particle swarm optimization (PSO) for stock pre-selection and a mean–variance with forecasting (MVF) model for portfolio optimization. In the stock pre-selection step, to reduce the computational complexity of the model, the CNN network is trained on the clustered stocks via the K-means method instead of training on each stock. The proposed model also includes a novel feature selection method that weighs features based on their impact on predicting stock returns for more accurate predictions. The results of implementing this model on 21 stocks from the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) market demonstrate that the proposed method for training the CNN network on clustered stocks does not signicantly differ in prediction accuracy to conventional methods. Moreover, in the portfolio optimization step, the returns predicted in the stock pre-selection step are used to optimize the weight of stocks in the portfolio.

Persistent organic pollutants (POPs) are synthetic compounds that were intentionally produced in large quantities and have been distributed in the global environment, originating a threat due to their persistence, bioaccumulative potential, and toxicity. POPs reach the Antarctic continent through long-range atmospheric transport (LRAT). In these areas, low temperatures play a significant role in the environmental fate of POPs, retaining them for a long time due to cold trapping by diffusion and wet deposition, acting as a net sink for many POPs. However, in the current context of climate change, the remobilization of POPs that were trapped in water, ice, and soil for decades is happening. Therefore, continuous monitoring of POPs in polar air is necessary to assess whether there is a recent re-release of historical pollutants back to the environment. We reviewed the scientific literature on atmospheric levels of several POP families (polychlorinated biphenyls – PCBs, hexachlorobenzene – HCB, hexachlorocyclohexanes – HCHs, and dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane – DDT) from 1980 to 2021. We estimated the atmospheric half-life using characteristic decreasing times (TD). We observed that HCB levels in the Antarctic atmosphere were higher than the other target organochlorine pesticides (OCPs), but HCB also displayed higher fluctuations and did not show a significant decrease over time. Conversely, the atmospheric levels of HCHs, some DDTs, and PCBs have decreased significantly. The estimated atmospheric half-lives for POPs decreased in the following order: 4,4' DDE (13.5 years) > 4,4' DDD (12.8 years) > 4,4' DDT (7.4 years) > 2,4' DDE (6.4 years) > 2,4' DDT (6.3 years) > α-HCH (6 years) > HCB (6 years) > γ-HCH (4.2 years). For PCB congeners, they decreased in the following order: PCB 153 (7.6 years) > PCB 138 (6.5 years) > PCB 101 (4.7 years) > PCB 180 (4.6 years) > PCB 28 (4 years) > PCB 52 (3.7 years) > PCB 118 (3.6 years). For HCH isomers and PCBs, the Stockholm Convention (SC) ban on POPs did have an impact on decreasing their levels during the last decades. Nevertheless, their ubiquity in the Antarctic atmosphere shows the problematic issues related to highly persistent synthetic chemicals.","This study was funded by ANID/FONDECYT/Iniciación 11150548, ANID/FONDECYT/Regular 1161504, ANID/FONDECYT/Regular 1210946, ANID/PCI REDI170292, ANID-PIA-INACH-ACT192057, INACH REGULAR RT_12_17 (Cristóbal Galbán-Malagón).

162,pub.1156119437,10.3390/su15064917,,,Do We Consider Sustainability When We Measure Small and Medium Enterprises’ (SMEs’) Performance Passing through Digital Transformation?,"Small-medium enterprises (SMEs) represent 90% of business globally. Digital Transformation (DT) affects SMEs differently from larger companies because although SMEs have more flexibility and agility for adapting to new circumstances, they also have more limited resources and specialization capabilities. Thus, it is fundamental to measure SMEs’ performance considering different perspectives. Here, we describe and analyze the state-of-the-art of DT in SMEs, focusing on performance measurement. We center on whether the tools used by SMEs encompass the triple bottom line of sustainability (i.e., environmental, social, and economic aspects). To do so, in December 2021, we performed a comprehensive systematic literature review (SLR) on the Web of Science and Scopus. In addition, we also explored a novel approach for SLR: topic modeling with a machine learning technique (Latent Dirichlet Allocation). The differences and interchangeability of both methods are discussed. The findings show that sustainability is treated as a separate topic in the literature.

The APOGEE instrument, a high-resolution 300-fiber H-band (1.55–1.71 μm) spectrograph, is also ideal to study other stellar populations in the Galaxy, among which are a number of star-forming regions and young open clusters. We present the results of the determination of six stellar properties (T eff, logg , [Fe/H], L/L ⊙, M/M ⊙, and age) for a sample that is composed of 3360 young stars, of subsolar to supersolar types, in 16 Galactic star formation and young open cluster regions. Those sources were selected by using a clustering method that removes most of the field contamination. Samples were also refined by removing targets affected by various systematic effects of the parameter determination. The final samples are presented in a comprehensive catalog that includes all six estimated parameters. This overview study also includes parameter spatial distribution maps for all regions and Hertzsprung–Russell ( logL/L⊙ vs. T eff) diagrams. This study serves as a guide for detailed studies on individual regions and paves the way for the future studies on the global properties of stars in the pre-main-sequence phase of stellar evolution using more robust samples.","The authors want to acknowledge the help of an anonymous referee, whose comments and suggestions helped us to improve the content of our manuscript.

Some AESIs are not only associated with the vaccines, but with COVID-19. Our aim was to characterise the incidence rates of AESIs following SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients and compare these to historical rates in the general population.
Methods: A multi-national cohort study with data from primary care, electronic health records, and insurance claims mapped to a common data model. This study's evidence was collected between Jan 1, 2017 and the conclusion of each database (which ranged from Jul 2020 to May 2022). The 16 pre-specified prevalent AESIs were: acute myocardial infarction, anaphylaxis, appendicitis, Bell's palsy, deep vein thrombosis, disseminated intravascular coagulation, encephalomyelitis, Guillain- Barré syndrome, haemorrhagic stroke, non-haemorrhagic stroke, immune thrombocytopenia, myocarditis/pericarditis, narcolepsy, pulmonary embolism, transverse myelitis, and thrombosis with thrombocytopenia. Age-sex standardised incidence rate ratios (SIR) were estimated to compare post-COVID-19 to pre-pandemic rates in each of the databases.
Findings: Substantial heterogeneity by age was seen for AESI rates, with some clearly increasing with age but others following the opposite trend. Similarly, differences were also observed across databases for same health outcome and age-sex strata. All studied AESIs appeared consistently more common in the post-COVID-19 compared to the historical cohorts, with related meta-analytic SIRs ranging from 1.32 (1.05 to 1.66) for narcolepsy to 11.70 (10.10 to 13.70) for pulmonary embolism.
Interpretation: Our findings suggest all AESIs are more common after COVID-19 than in the general population. Thromboembolic events were particularly common, and over 10-fold more so. More research is needed to contextualise post-COVID-19 complications in the longer term.

A number of measures need to be taken to reduce the effects of waste materials such as rice husks, glass, plastic, and other types of materials on the environment. A significant reduction in environmental pollution can be achieved by utilizing these waste materials in construction. The purpose of this study was to investigate the use of rice husk ash (RHA) as a pozzolanic material to partially replace cement in a previously optimized mixture of recycled-glass-based Ultra-high-performance concrete (UHPC). Furthermore, this study included commercial mineral admixtures such as silica fume and limestone powder along with these components. Based on the results of the study, it can be concluded that the use of RHA in the optimized recycled glass UHPC renders the concrete much less workable and also leads to a marginal decrease in its compressive strength (by about 7%). Additionally, the study demonstrates a significant interaction between RHA and water content, attributed to the water-absorbing capacity of RHA particles, which also provides an internal curing effect. Ultimately, incorporating RHA as a partial replacement for cement in the optimized recycled-glass-based UHPC enables a substantial decrease in the concrete's carbon footprint, without causing significant harm to its performance, thereby promoting an environmentally friendly approach to concrete production.","Declaration of competing interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

In the study, a typical Pen70 base asphalt was modified with four different filler materials, namely limestone powder, cement, slaked (hydrated) lime, and brake pad powder, to produce different asphalt mortars that were subsequently used to prepare the asphalt mixtures. Thereafter, various laboratory tests, namely dynamic uniaxial repeated compressive loading, freeze-thaw splitting, and semicircular bending (SCB) were conducted to evaluate the moisture sensitivity, high-temperature stability, low-temperature cracking, and fatigue performance of the asphalt mixtures before and after being subjected to water saturation conditions. Overall, the study results indicated superior moisture tolerance, water damage resistance, and performance for slaked (hydrated) lime, consecutively followed by brake pad powder, cement, and limestone powder. That is, for the materials evaluated and the laboratory test conditions considered, limestone mineral powder was found to be the most moisture-sensitive filler material, whilst slaked (hydrated) lime was the most moisture-tolerant and water-damage resistant filler material.","We express our sincere gratitude to the experts, teachers and students who have provided help for this article.","This work is partially supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 52108415, No. 52108425, and No. 51803157), Natural Science Foundation of Hubei Province (Grant No. 2020CFB567), the Enterprise Technology Innovation Project of Shandong Province (202160101791), and the Science and Technology Project of Shandong Hi-Speed Maintenance Group Co., Ltd.

1233,pub.1163171801,10.3390/su151612171,,,Towards Cleaner Ports: Predictive Modeling of Sulfur Dioxide Shipping Emissions in Maritime Facilities Using Machine Learning,"Maritime ports play a pivotal role in fostering the growth of domestic and international trade and economies. As ports continue to expand in size and capacity, the impact of their operations on air quality and climate change becomes increasingly significant. While nearby regions may experience economic benefits, there are significant concerns regarding the emission of atmospheric pollutants, which have adverse effects on both human health and climate change. Predictive modeling of port emissions can serve as a valuable tool in identifying areas of concern, evaluating the effectiveness of emission reduction strategies, and promoting sustainable development within ports. The primary objective of this research is to utilize machine learning frameworks to estimate the emissions of SO2 from ships during various port activities, including hoteling, maneuvering, and cruising. By employing these models, we aim to gain insights into the emission patterns and explore strategies to mitigate their impact. Through our analysis, we have identified the most effective models for estimating SO2 emissions. The AutoML TPOT framework emerges as the top-performing model, followed by Non-Linear Regression with interaction effects. On the other hand, Linear Regression exhibited the lowest performance among the models evaluated. By employing these advanced machine learning techniques, we aim to contribute to the body of knowledge surrounding port emissions and foster sustainable practices within the maritime industry.","We would like to acknowledge the support and computational resources provided by our institutions, and from DIMAR (Colombian General Directorate of Maritime) for supplying the datasets.","We hereby declare that no external funding or financial support was received for the execution of this research.

This systematic review evaluates the association between SIII values with overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) in testicular cancer. We searched observational studies in five databases. The quantitative synthesis was performed using a random-effects model. The risk of bias was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS). The only measure of the effect was the hazard ratio (HR). A sensitivity analysis was performed according to the risk of bias in the studies. There were 833 participants in a total of 6 cohorts. We found that high SIII values were associated with worse OS (HR = 3.28; 95% CI 1.3-8.9; p < 0.001; I2 = 78) and PFS (HR = 3.9; 95% CI 2.53-6.02; p < 0.001; I2 = 0). No indication of small study effects was found in the association between SIII values and OS (p = 0.5301). High SIII values were associated with worse OS and PFS.

OBJECTIVE: To assess the progression of immunity (natural and acquired by vaccine) in a cohort from two Chilean cities.
METHODS: Individuals (n = 386) who participated in three phases of population-based serial prevalence studies were included (2020-2021 and 2022). Presence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies was measured in serum. Data including time of vaccination and type of vaccine received were analysed with descriptive statistics.
RESULTS: Seroprevalence was 3.6% in the first round and increased to 96.9% in the second and 98.7% in the third. In the third round, 75% of individuals who had received the basal full scheme were seropositive at 180 days or more since their last dose; 98% of individuals who received one booster dose were seropositive at 180 days or more, and 100% participants who received two boosters were seropositive, regardless of time since their last dose. Participants receiving mRNA vaccines had higher seroprevalence rates over time.

These elements contribute to increased pathogenicity and antimicrobial resistance through genes that are related to the formation of biofilms and resistance genes contained in plasmids, integrons, and transposons. One hundred and thirty-three Salmonella isolates from different stages of the production line, such as feed manufacturing, hatchery, broiler farm, poultry farm, and slaughterhouse, were identified, serotyped and sequenced. The most predominant serotype was Salmonella Infantis. Phylogenetic analyses demonstrated that the diversity and spread of strains in the pipeline are serotype-independent, and that isolates belonging to the same serotype are very closely related genetically. On the other hand, Salmonella Infantis isolates carried the pESI IncFIB plasmid harboring a wide variety of resistance genes, all linked to mobile genetic elements, and among carriers of these plasmids, the antibiograms showed differences in resistance profiles and this linked to a variety in plasmid structure, similarly observed in the diversity of Salmonella Heidelberg isolates carrying the IncI1-Iα plasmid. Mobile genetic elements encoding resistance and virulence genes also contributed to the differences in gene content. Antibiotic resistance genotypes were matched closely by the resistance phenotypes, with high frequency of tetracycline, aminoglycosides, and cephalosporins resistance. In conclusion, the contamination in the poultry industry is described throughout the entire production line, with mobile genetic elements leading to multi-drug resistant bacteria, thus promoting survival when challenged with various antimicrobial compounds.","Genome sequencing was carried out by SeqCenter (https://www.seqcenter.com).

In this scenario, it is necessary to consider the impact of technologies on different older generational cohorts to understand the future of a data-driven digital society fully. This research aims to explain the acceptance of social networking sites, a particular consumer technology, in the post-pandemic elderly population. Data were obtained from 1555 older adults in Chile based on a consumer technology acceptance model. The respondents were grouped according to their technological predisposition and their generation into three groups. Applying a multigroup analysis based on structural equation modelling reveals significant differences in the explanatory variables of the intention and use of this technology between the groups. And more remarkably, the effort expectancy is not statistically significant as a variable to explain this acceptance globally in either of the three groups. There are two principal contributions of this study. First, it shows why adults adopt consumer technology after the pandemic. Second, it validates a classification of elderly adults who use consumption technologies that are useful in understanding the heterogeneity of this phenomenon.",The authors recognise the support provided by students and interviewers in collecting information in the field.,This research was funded by ANID/FONDECYT Regular 1210130.,Behavioral Sciences,,,,2023-01-21,2023,2023-01-21,,13,2,87,All OA; Gold,Article,"Ramírez-Correa, Patricio; Grandón, Elizabeth Eliana; Ramírez-Santana, Muriel; Arenas-Gaitán, Jorge; Rondán-Cataluña, F.

This takes place by not only reducing their own carbon footprint but also by educating future leaders and contributing valuable research and expertise to the global effort to combat climate change. However, there is a need for studies that identify the nature of their engagement on the topic, and the extent to which they are contributing towards addressing the many problems associated with climate change. Against this background, this paper describes a study that consisted of a review of the literature and the use of case studies, which outline the importance of university engagement in climate change and describe its main features. The study identified the fact that even though climate change is a matter of great relevance to universities, its coverage in university programmes is not as wide as one could expect. Based on the findings, the paper also lists the challenges associated with the inclusion of climate change in university programmes. Finally, it describes some of the measures which may be deployed in order to maximise the contribution of higher education towards handling the challenges associated with a changing climate.",This study is part of the “100 papers to accelerate the implementation of the UN Sustainable Development Goals” initiative.,"This work was funded by Hamburg University of Applied Sciences, TÉLUQ University.",Scientific Reports,,,,2023-11-03,2023,2023-11-03,,13,1,19030,All OA; Gold,Article,"Leal Filho, Walter; Weissenberger, Sebastian; Luetz, Johannes M.; Sierra, Javier; Simon Rampasso, Izabela; Sharifi, Ayyoob; Anholon, Rosley; Eustachio, Joao Henrique Paulinho Pires; Kovaleva, Marina","Leal Filho, Walter (Department of Natural Sciences, Manchester Metropolitan University, Chester Street, M1 5GD, Manchester, UK; European School of Sustainability Science and Research, Hamburg University of Applied Sciences, Hamburg, Germany); Weissenberger, Sebastian (TÉLUQ University, Quebec City, Canada); Luetz, Johannes M.

This systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted to evaluate the association of these markers with metabolic syndrome (MetS).MethodsWe ran a systematic search through PubMed, Scopus, Embase, Ovid/Medline, and Web of Science on March 15, 2023. No language or date restrictions were applied. The only synthesised effect measure reported was the odds ratio (OR) with its corresponding 95% confidence interval (95% CI). We utilised the random-effects model for the quantitative synthesis.ResultsWe analysed 50 studies (n = 150 519) with different definitions for MetS. Increased ApoB values were associated with MetS (OR = 2.8; 95% CI: 2.44–3.22; p < 0.01, I2 = 99%). Decreased ApoA1 values were associated with MetS (OR = 0.42; 95% CI: 0.38–0.47; p < 0.01, I2 = 99%). Increased values of the ApoB/ApoA1 ratio were associated with MetS (OR = 4.97; 95% CI: 3.83–6.44; p < 0.01, I2 = 97%). Decreased values of Lp(a) were associated with MetS (OR = 0.89; 95% CI: 0.82–0.96; p < 0.01; I2 = 92%).ConclusionsIncreased values of ApoB and ApoB/ApoA1 ratio are associated with MetS, while decreased values of ApoA1 and Lp(a) are associated with MetS. These findings suggest that these lipid markers may serve as potential indicators for identifying subjects at risk of developing MetS.

In our laboratory experiments, the content of Mg2+ ions in biotic aragonite is higher than that in inorganically-precipitated aragonite and we hypothesize that the higher Mg content may enhance the subsequent dolomitization of aragonite. In this study, biotic aragonite was induced by Bacillus licheniformis Y1 at different Mg/Ca molar ratios. XRD data show that only aragonite was precipitated in the media with Mg/Ca molar ratios at 6, 9, and 12 after culturing for 25 days. The EDS and atomic absorption results show that the content of Mg2+ ions in biotic aragonite increased with rising Mg/Ca molar ratios. In addition, our analyses show that the EPS from the bacteria and the organics extracted from the interior of the biotic aragonite contain the same biomolecules, including Ala, Gly, Glu and hexadecanoic acid. The content of Mg2+ ions in the aragonite precipitates mediated by biomolecules is significantly higher than that in inorganically-precipitated aragonite. Additionally, compared with Ala and Gly, the increase of the Mg2+ ions content in aragonite promoted by Glu and hexadecanoic acid is more significant. The DFT (density functional theory) calculations reveal that the energy needed for Mg2+ ion incorporation into aragonite mediated by Glu, hexadecanoic acid, Gly and Ala increased gradually, but was lower than that without acidic biomolecules. The experiments also show that the Mg2+ ion content in the aragonite significantly increased with the increasing concentration of biomolecules. In a medium with high Mg2+ concentration and with bacteria, after 2 months, micron-sized dolomite rhombs were precipitated on the surfaces of the aragonite particles. This study may provide new insights into the important role played by biomolecules in the incorporation of the Mg2+ ions into aragonite. Moreover, these experiments may contribute towards our understanding of the dolomitization of aragonite in the presence of bacteria.",,"This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (41972108, 42072136, and 42102134).",Frontiers in Microbiology,,,,2023-01-26,2023,2023-01-26,,14,,1078430,All OA; Gold,Article,"Han, Zuozhen; Meng, Ruirui; Zhao, Hui; Gao, Xiao; Zhao, Yanyang; Han, Yu; Liu, Fang; Tucker, Maurice E.; Deng, Jiarong; Yan, Huaxiao","Han, Zuozhen (Shandong Provincial Key Laboratory of Depositional Mineralization and Sedimentary Minerals, College of Earth Science and Engineering, College of Chemical and Biological Engineering, Shandong University of Science and Technology, Qingdao, China; Laboratory for Marine Mineral Resources, Center for Isotope Geochemistry and Geochronology, Qingdao National Laboratory for Marine Science and Technology, Qingdao, China); Meng, Ruirui (Shandong Provincial Key Laboratory of Depositional Mineralization and Sedimentary Minerals, College of Earth Science and Engineering, College of Chemical and Biological Engineering, Shandong University of Science and Technology, Qingdao, China; Laboratory for Marine Mineral Resources, Center for Isotope Geochemistry and Geochronology, Qingdao National Laboratory for Marine Science and Technology, Qingdao, China); Zhao, Hui (Shandong Provincial Key Laboratory of Depositional Mineralization and Sedimentary Minerals, College of Earth Science and Engineering, College of Chemical and Biological Engineering, Shandong University of Science and Technology, Qingdao, China; Laboratory for Marine Mineral Resources, Center for Isotope Geochemistry and Geochronology, Qingdao National Laboratory for Marine Science and Technology, Qingdao, China); Gao, Xiao (Shandong Provincial Key Laboratory of Depositional Mineralization and Sedimentary Minerals, College of Earth Science and Engineering, College of Chemical and Biological Engineering, Shandong University of Science and Technology, Qingdao, China; Laboratory for Marine Mineral Resources, Center for Isotope Geochemistry and Geochronology, Qingdao National Laboratory for Marine Science and Technology, Qingdao, China); Zhao, Yanyang (Shandong Provincial Key Laboratory of Depositional Mineralization and Sedimentary Minerals, College of Earth Science and Engineering, College of Chemical and Biological Engineering, Shandong University of Science and Technology, Qingdao, China; Laboratory for Marine Mineral Resources, Center for Isotope Geochemistry and Geochronology, Qingdao National Laboratory for Marine Science and Technology, Qingdao, China); Han, Yu (School of Geosciences, China University of Petroleum, Qingdao, China); Liu, Fang (College of Chemical Engineering, China University of Petroleum, Qingdao, China; State Key Laboratory of Petroleum Pollution Control, Beijing, China); Tucker, Maurice E.

Based on EM and fertilizer publications on the Scopus database, all the 17 papers reviewed provided no detailed information on the Halal-status of the biofertilizers inoculated with EM. The impacts of Halal-certified biofertilizers will trigger the Halal certification in food products by (a) catering for the increasing Halal food demand due to expectedly Muslim population expansion, (b) contributing to the sustainable buying behaviour of Halal products' consumers in the future, (c) catering for the increasing number of Muslim travellers around the world, (d) becoming a positive driver for higher production of more Halal foods that can enhance food safety, human health and well-being, and (e) creating a cost-effective and increasing food marketability. The later three points (c, d and e) play a very important role in a country's societal well-being and economic growth and development. Although Halal-status is not a must for the world's food marketing, Halal-certified biofertilizer for the Halal-status of food carries the greatest potential to enter the ever-expanding Muslim markets. Finally, it is postulated that the successful usage of EM using Halal-based sources for biofertilizer production will result in two major outcomes from the points of United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals # 9 (Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure) and # 12 (Responsible Consumption and Production).

Therefore, this research aims to analyze scientific articles linked to key perspectives of the concept under discussion. Due to the scope of the objective of systematizing the existing scientific literature on sustainable consumption in Scopus and Web of Science, a systematic review was carried out, including 104 scientific articles considering criteria that respond to the questions posed. It is concluded that sustainable consumption is a complex and nebulous concept whose theoretical fragmentation gives it breadth but generates overlapping concepts. Likewise, the link between the consumer and the circular economy and the difficulties behind such interaction was denoted. The complexity of being a green consumer in current times and the aspects that comprise it were also covered, and the importance, role, and tools of the government in sustainable consumption.

This condition has prompted the Peruvian mining industry to advance in managing alternatives to the conventional surface disposal of mine tailings. A promising and increasingly popular management strategy for mine tailings in Peru is their disposal inside underground mines. This article presents: site-specific conditions, advantages/disadvantages, and lessons learned from practical experiences of mine tailings disposal in underground mines in Peru. In addition, some techniques are highlighted, such as (i) hydraulic fill, (ii) cemented hydraulic fill, and (iii) cemented paste backfill. Finally, this article concludes that the responsible disposal of mine tailings in underground mines is a green mining solution that reduces negative socio-environmental impacts, limiting the generation of acid rock drainage (ARD) and the leaching of metals due to the decrease in contact with oxygen and rainfall, thus mitigating the contamination of surface and underground waters, reducing the footprint of affectation in the territory, and eliminating the emission of particulate matter in the environment.",,"The research is funded by the Research Department of Catholic University of Temuco, Chile and by the Research Department of Universidad Privada del Norte, Peru.",Sustainability,,,,2023-08-26,2023,2023-08-26,,15,17,12912,All OA; Gold,Article,"Cacciuttolo, Carlos; Marinovic, Alex","Cacciuttolo, Carlos (Civil Works and Geology Department, Catholic University of Temuco, Temuco 4780000, Chile); Marinovic, Alex (Facultad de Ingeniería, Universidad Privada del Norte, Cajamarca 06001, Peru;, alex.marinovic@upn.edu.pe)","Cacciuttolo, Carlos (Temuco Catholic University)","Cacciuttolo, Carlos (Temuco Catholic University); Marinovic, Alex (Private University of the North)",8,8,,,https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/15/17/12912/pdf?version=1693291259,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1163638097,40 Engineering; 4019 Resources Engineering and Extractive Metallurgy; 41 Environmental Sciences; 4104 Environmental Management,12 Responsible Consumption and Production

As Africa’s fastest growing population with over 200 million people, Nigeria is responsible for leading the continent’s environmental sustainability goal. Nigeria has seen a sizable number of crude oil spillages that have contaminated its soils and groundwater resources, and several of these contaminated sites are to be cleaned up yet. There needs to be more scientific data to design an effective cleanup and to manage the soil and groundwater resources effectively. So far, the only extensive crude oil-contaminated site remediation project documented is on Ogoniland in the Niger Delta region of Nigeria. However, this project resulted in less effective, albeit temporary, cleanup solutions. This review presents a state-of-the-art synthesis of research on soil and groundwater contamination by crude oil. It includes sections on processes, measurements, predictions, and management, as well as an analysis of the state and challenges in Nigeria. In-depth field, laboratory, and computer models for crude oil contamination investigation have been developed with over 60 years of significant research. However, studies and case projects in Nigeria have relied on point sampling to determine the concentration of crude oil contaminants in soil and groundwater. This method offers limited information on the solute concentration and hydraulic distribution, which regulates pollutant mobility within the subsurface. The absence of baseline and high-resolution subsurface characterization data has also resulted in a need for more process-based knowledge to direct the development of site-specific remediation strategies. As a result, it is challenging to design a conceptual model that is detailed enough to help with predictions of the flow dynamics of crude oil contaminants in the unsaturated and saturated zones. It is anticipated that this review will stimulate further multidisciplinary research through site evaluation and monitoring to provide reliable information that can be used to develop appropriate model-based remediation solutions.",The authors wish to thank the African Union for providing financial support (scholarship) through the Pan African University Initiative.,This review paper was funded in part by the African Union.,Frontiers in Environmental Science,,,,2023-05-09,2023,2023-05-09,,11,,1137496,All OA; Gold,Article,"Adeniran, Margaret A.; Oladunjoye, Michael A.; Doro, Kennedy O.","Adeniran, Margaret A.

For this purpose, statistical methodologies such as Composite Central Design (CCD), Response Surface Methodology (RSM), and a Multi-Objective Optimization were used to find an efficient mix design that meets the strength and workability criteria using the highest RHA content in partial replacement of cement. The design optimization results show that replacing 24.9% by weight of cement with RHA in a hydraulic concrete mix produces the highest flexural strength (4.2 MPa) of the combinations proposed in the composite central design. This strength could even be applicable for high traffic level (NT3) road, demonstrates that the use of RHA as SCM in concrete mixes for pavements may be feasible.",Declaration of competing interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

Not only should the economic and technological aspects be considered, but also the socio-environmental impact. In this sense, the development of composites with the incorporation of waste has been highlighted, aiming not only for better and/or cheaper materials, but also optimizing the use of natural resources. To obtain better results using industrial agro waste, we need to treat this waste to incorporate engineered composites and obtain the optimal results for each application desired. The objective of this work is to compare the effect of processing coconut husk particulates on the mechanical and thermal behavior of epoxy matrix composites, since we will need a smooth composite in the near future to be applied by brushes and sprayers with a high quality surface finish. This processing was carried out in a ball mill for 24 h. The matrix was a Bisphenol A diglycidyl ether (DGEBA)/triethylenetetramine (TETA) epoxy system. The tests that were performed were resistance to impact and compression, as well as the linear expansion test. Through this work, it can be observed that the processing of coconut husk powder was beneficial, allowing not only positive improvements to the properties of the composite, but also a better workability and wettability of the particulates, which was attributed to the change in the average size and shape of particulates. That means that the composites with processed coconut husk powders have improved impact strength (46 up to 51%) and compressive strength (88 up to 334%), in comparison with unprocessed particles.",We would like to thank FAPERJ and CNPq Brazilian agencies for the financial support.,"This research was funded by FAPERJ and CNPq Brazilian agencies for the financial support, by the grant numbers: E-26/202.229/2018; E-26/203.874/2022; E-26/200.847/2021 and 302976/2022-1.",Polymers,,Carlo Santulli,,2023-02-27,2023,2023-02-27,,15,5,1195,All OA; Gold,Article,"Velasco, David Coverdale Rangel; Lopes, Felipe Perissé Duarte; Souza, Djalma; Lopera, Henry Alonso Colorado; Monteiro, Sergio Neves; Vieira, Carlos Maurício Fontes","Velasco, David Coverdale Rangel (Advanced Materials Laboratory, State University of the North of Rio de Janeiro Darcy Ribeiro—UENF, Av Alberto Lamego, 2000, Campos dos Goytacazes CEP 28013-602, RJ, Brazil); Lopes, Felipe Perissé Duarte (Advanced Materials Laboratory, State University of the North of Rio de Janeiro Darcy Ribeiro—UENF, Av Alberto Lamego, 2000, Campos dos Goytacazes CEP 28013-602, RJ, Brazil); Souza, Djalma (Advanced Materials Laboratory, State University of the North of Rio de Janeiro Darcy Ribeiro—UENF, Av Alberto Lamego, 2000, Campos dos Goytacazes CEP 28013-602, RJ, Brazil); Lopera, Henry Alonso Colorado (CCComposites, Engineering school, Universidad de Antioquia (UdeA), Medellín 050001, Colombia); Monteiro, Sergio Neves (Advanced Materials Laboratory, State University of the North of Rio de Janeiro Darcy Ribeiro—UENF, Av Alberto Lamego, 2000, Campos dos Goytacazes CEP 28013-602, RJ, Brazil); Vieira, Carlos Maurício Fontes (Advanced Materials Laboratory, State University of the North of Rio de Janeiro Darcy Ribeiro—UENF, Av Alberto Lamego, 2000, Campos dos Goytacazes CEP 28013-602, RJ, Brazil)","Lopes, Felipe Perissé Duarte (Advanced Materials Laboratory, State University of the North of Rio de Janeiro Darcy Ribeiro—UENF, Av Alberto Lamego, 2000, Campos dos Goytacazes CEP 28013-602, RJ, Brazil)","Velasco, David Coverdale Rangel (Advanced Materials Laboratory, State University of the North of Rio de Janeiro Darcy Ribeiro—UENF, Av Alberto Lamego, 2000, Campos dos Goytacazes CEP 28013-602, RJ, Brazil); Lopes, Felipe Perissé Duarte (Advanced Materials Laboratory, State University of the North of Rio de Janeiro Darcy Ribeiro—UENF, Av Alberto Lamego, 2000, Campos dos Goytacazes CEP 28013-602, RJ, Brazil); Souza, Djalma (Advanced Materials Laboratory, State University of the North of Rio de Janeiro Darcy Ribeiro—UENF, Av Alberto Lamego, 2000, Campos dos Goytacazes CEP 28013-602, RJ, Brazil); Lopera, Henry Alonso Colorado (University of Antioquia); Monteiro, Sergio Neves (Advanced Materials Laboratory, State University of the North of Rio de Janeiro Darcy Ribeiro—UENF, Av Alberto Lamego, 2000, Campos dos Goytacazes CEP 28013-602, RJ, Brazil); Vieira, Carlos Maurício Fontes (Advanced Materials Laboratory, State University of the North of Rio de Janeiro Darcy Ribeiro—UENF, Av Alberto Lamego, 2000, Campos dos Goytacazes CEP 28013-602, RJ, Brazil)",7,7,,,https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4360/15/5/1195/pdf?version=1677490340,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1155800304,40 Engineering; 4016 Materials Engineering,

One negative effect is the emergence of mental health disorders associated with the presence of discrimination, a relationship for which there is abundant evidence, although there is less research on factors that may alter this effect. (2) Objective: To evaluate the possible mediating role of optimism and intolerance to uncertainty in the relationship between discrimination and mental health. (3) Method: Nine hundred and nineteen adult Colombian migrants residing in Chile, 49.5% were men and 50.5% women, ages from 18 to 65 years, were evaluated. The Discrimination Experience Scale, BDI-IA Inventory, BAI, LOT-R and the Intolerance to Uncertainty Scale were applied. The effects were estimated using structural equation modeling. (4) Results: A mediating effect of both dispositional optimism and intolerance to uncertainty on the relationship between discrimination and mental symptomatology was observed.

Mutations in IMPDH1 have been linked to autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa subtype 10 (adRP-10), a genetic eye disorder. Some of these mutations such as the Asp226Asn (D226N) lead to the assembly of large filamentous structures termed cytoophidia. D226N also gives IMPDH1 resistance to feedback inhibition by GDP/GTP. This study aims to emulate the adRP-10 condition with a long-term expression of IMPDH1-D226N in vitro and explore cytoophidium assembly and cell survival. We also assessed whether the introduction of an additional mutation (Y12C) to disrupt the cytoophidium has an attenuating effect on the toxicity caused by the D226N mutation. Results: Expression of IMPDH1-D226N in HEp-2 cells resulted in cytoophidium assembly in ∼70% of the cells, but the presence of the Y12C mutation disrupted the filaments. Long-term cell survival was significantly affected by the presence of the D226N mutation, with a decrease of ∼40% in the cells expressing IMPDH1-D226N when compared to IMPDH1-WT; however, survival was significantly recovered in IMPDH1-Y12C/D226N, with only a ∼10% decrease when compared to IMPDH1-WT. On the other hand, the IMPDH1 expression level in the D226N-positive cells was <30% of that of the IMPDH1-WT-positive cells and only slightly higher in the Y12C/D226N, suggesting that although cell survival in Y12C/D226N was recovered, higher expression levels of the mutated IMPDH1 were not tolerated by the cells in the long term. Conclusion: The IMPDH1-D226N effect on photoreceptor cell survival may be the result of a sum of problems: nucleotide unbalance plus a toxic long-life cytoophidium, supported by the observation that by introducing Y12C in IMPDH1 the cytoophidium was disrupted and cell survival significantly recovered, but not the sensibility to GDP/GTP regulation since higher expression levels of IMPDH1-D226N were not tolerated.","The authors acknowledge Erwin de la Fuente Ortega from the “Unidad de Microscopia Confocal” de la Universidad Catolica del Norte.

Several studies have reported an association of vitamin B12, folic acid, or homocysteine (Hcy) levels with MetS. This systematic review and meta-analysis assessed the association of vitamin B12, folic acid, and Hcy levels with MetS.
Methods: PubMed, Scopus, Embase, Ovid/Medline, and Web of Science were searched up to February 13, 2023. Cross-sectional, case-control, or cohort studies were included. A random-effects model was performed using the DerSimonian and Laird method to estimate the between-study variance. Effect measures were expressed as odds ratios (OR) with their corresponding 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). Between-study heterogeneity was evaluated using Cochran's Q test and the I2 statistic.
Results: Sixty-six articles (n = 87,988 patients) were included. Higher vitamin B12 levels were inversely associated with MetS (OR = 0.87; 95% CI: 0.81-0.93; p < 0.01; I2 = 90%). Higher Hcy levels were associated with MetS (OR = 1.19; 95% CI: 1.14-1.24; p < 0.01; I2 = 90%). Folate levels were not associated with MetS (OR = 0.83; 95% CI: 0.66-1.03; p = 0.09; I2 = 90%).
Conclusion: Higher vitamin B12 levels were inversely associated with MetS, whereas higher Hcy levels were associated with MetS.

The presence of anti-parietal cell antibodies is indicative of reduced ability to absorb vitamin B12. Thus, this study reviewed the existing studies with the objective of assessing differences in the serum levels of vitamin B12 among patients with and without TD, the frequency of vitamin B12 deficiency in patients with TD, and the presence of anti-parietal cell antibodies in patients with TD.
Methods: A meta-analysis of random-effects model was conducted to calculate pooled frequencies, mean differences (MD), and their respective 95% confidence intervals (CI). We identified 64 studies that met our inclusion criteria (n = 28597).
Results: We found that patients with hypothyroidism had lower vitamin B12 levels than healthy participants (MD: -60.67 pg/mL; 95% CI: -107.31 to -14.03 pg/mL; p = 0.01). No significant differences in vitamin B12 levels were observed between healthy participants and patients with hyperthyroidism (p = 0.78), autoimmune thyroid disease (AITD) (p = 0.22), or subclinical hypothyroidism (SH) (p = 0.79). The frequencies of vitamin B12 deficiency among patients with hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism, SH, and AITD were 27%, 6%, 27%, and 18%, respectively.
Conclusions: Patients with hypothyroidism had lower levels of vitamin B12 than healthy participants. No significant differences were observed between vitamin B12 levels and hyperthyroidism, AITD, or SH.

As an alternative to conventional leaching methods, the use of microorganisms in mineral treatment processes has become widespread in recent decades, due to advantages such as the non-production of emissions or pollution, energy savings, low process costs, products compatible with the environment, and increases in the benefit of low-grade mining deposits. The purpose of this work is to introduce the theoretical foundations associated with modeling the process of bioleaching, mainly the modeling of mineral recovery rates. The different models are collected from models based on conventional leaching dynamics modeling, based on the shrinking core model, where the oxidation process is controlled by diffusion, chemically, or by film diffusion until bioleaching models based on statistical analysis are presented, such as the surface response methodology or the application of machine learning algorithms. Although bioleaching modeling (independent of modeling techniques) of industrial (or large-scale mined) minerals is a fairly developed area, bioleaching modeling applied to rare earth elements is a field with great growth potential in the coming years, as in general bioleaching has the potential to be a more sustainable and environmentally friendly mining method than traditional mining methods.",The authors acknowledge the financial support from ANID 16ENI2-71940 ING2030.

In the search to improve the efficiency in the use of resources, the present work develops models of a semi-autogenous grinding (SAG) mill using statistical analysis and machine learning (ML) techniques (regression, decision trees, and artificial neural networks). The hypotheses studied aim to improve the process's productive indicators, such as production and energy consumption. The simulation of the digital model captures an increase in production of 4.42% as a function of mineral fragmentation, while there is potential to increase production by decreasing the mill rotational speed, which has a decrease in energy consumption of 7.62% for all linear age configurations. Considering the performance of machine learning in the adjustment of complex models such as SAG grinding, the application of these tools in the mineral processing industry has the potential to increase the efficiency of these processes, either by improving production indicators or by saving energy consumption. Finally, the incorporation of these techniques in the aggregate management of processes such as the Mine to Mill paradigm, or the development of models that consider the uncertainty of the explanatory variables, could further increase the performance of productive indicators at the industrial scale.",The authors acknowledge the financial support from ANID Fondecyt 1211498.

754,pub.1154779735,10.3390/su15032086,,,Reducing Urban Traffic Congestion via Charging Price,"Traffic jams are one of the major transportation problems. The United States spends USD billions to mitigate the problem, and not always with good outcomes. This problem increases and has effects on sustainable transport, such as life quality, pollution, perishables, and costs. Large cities reduce traffic jams through congestion charges. This paper aims to reduce urban traffic congestion by estimating the charge through a multivariable model. It studies the main jammed areas in Santiago, Chile. The data came from published surveys.

While some studies show a positive correlation between entrepreneurship education and entrepreneurship, others confirm contradictory results. To contribute to the understanding of the relationship between entrepreneurship education and entrepreneurial intention and to contribute to the literature on this topic in Latin America, this research aimed to determine the influence of entrepreneurship education on the entrepreneurial intention of students from five Latin American universities. The type of research is quantitative, cross-sectional, and explanatory. To carry out the study, a questionnaire was applied to 1213 students from five universities in Colombia, Ecuador, Mexico, and Peru. The sample size was determined with a probabilistic design, and the sample was collected randomly by convenience. The Chi-square test showed a p-value of 0.056 higher than 0.05. Therefore, the null hypothesis indicating that entrepreneurship education is independent of entrepreneurial intention was accepted. Practical and theoretical implications emerge from these findings. While acknowledging the importance of entrepreneurship education, it becomes apparent that supplementary mechanisms enhancing entrepreneurial intentions are essential. The absence of a definitive consensus on the connection between entrepreneurial education and intent emphasizes the need for further exploration.","We thank the Universidad Privada del Norte for the support in the translation process.

With the increase in consumption and the generation of waste, it becomes interesting to search for alternatives friendly to environment. The objective of this work was to evaluate the mechanical properties of composites manufactured using residues: from the wood industry (eucalyptus sawdust), from red ceramic (chamotte), and a vegetable based resin (castor oil-based polyurethane resin) as a matrix. The composites were manufactured in volumetric fractions of 70, 75, 80 and 85 of eucalyptus sawdust; and 0%, 5% and 10% of chamotte, totaling 12 formulations. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analyzes were performed on the eucalyptus sawdust used and on the composites produced with and without chamotte. The results indicates that both for the modulus of elasticity and modulus of rupture, the increase in the volumetric fraction of chamotte incorporated at composites causes an increase of properties in all compositions studied. In perpendicular tensile testing, it obtained values between 1.910 and 3.449 MPa. In the izod impact testing, values between 47.61 and 115.44 J/m were obtained. It was observed on SEM images that with the incorporation of chamotte on composites there was a great reduction in the amount of bubbles and voids presented at polymeric matrix and in some compositions have increased also the mechanical properties. Thus bringing a new option for use and adding value to this residue from the ceramic industry, producing an ecofriendly composite panel.",Declaration of Competing Interest The authors declare the following financial interests/personal relationships which may be considered as potential competing interests: Felipe Perisse Duarte Lopes reports financial support was provided by Carlos Chagas Filho Foundation for Research Support of Rio de Janeiro State.

Industrial waste generated during the production chain of different types of sectors is becoming a major environmental problem. The objective of this work was to produce and evaluate the physical properties of composite panels produced with waste from the wood industry, eucalyptus sawdust, and also with another waste, this time from the red ceramic industry, chamotte, and matrix polyurethane resin based on of castor oil. The composite panels were produced in volumetric fractions of 70, 75, 80, 85 and 90% of eucalyptus sawdust, and a variation of 0, 5 and 10% of chamotte. The tests to evaluate the physical properties were: Density, Moisture Content, Water Absorption and Thickness Swelling. The results showed that as the volumetric fraction of chamotte was incorporated into the composite, the higher the density value was obtained, and that this value decreased as the eucalyptus fiber fraction increased in the formulation. The SEM images revealed that chamotte provided a reduction in the amount of bubbles present in the resin. The moisture content, water absorption and swelling increased as the volumetric fraction of fiber increased, and decreased as the volumetric fraction of chamotte incorporation increased. It is concluded that there is technical feasibility for the use of eucalyptus residue, together with chamotte and castor oil-based polyurethane resin for the manufacture of composites. The perspective after this research is make a partner with a wood panels industry and create a new line of green composites panels made by recycled waste from industry.",Declaration of Competing Interest The authors declare the following financial interests/personal relationships which may be considered as potential competing interests: Felipe Perisse Duarte Lopes reports financial support was provided by Carlos Chagas Filho Foundation for Research Support of Rio de Janeiro State.

244,pub.1154245567,10.3390/su15020895,,,Sustainable e-Learning by Data Mining—Successful Results in a Chilean University,"People are increasingly open to using online education mainly to break the distance and time barriers of presential education. This type of education is sustainable at all levels, and its relevance has increased even more during the pandemic. Consequently, educational institutions are saving large volumes of data containing relevant information about their operations, but they do not know why students succeed or fail. The Knowledge Discovery in Databases (KDD) process could support this challenge by extracting innovative models to identify the main patterns and factors that could affect the success of their students in online education programs. This work uses the CRISP-DM (Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining) methodology to analyze data from the Distance Education Center of the Universidad Católica del Norte (DEC-UCN) from 2000 to 2018. CRISP-DM was chosen because it represents a proven process that integrates multiple methodologies to provide an effective meta-process for data knowledge projects. DEC-UCN is one of the first centers to implement online learning in Chile, and this study analyses 18,610 records in this period. The study applies data mining, the most critical KDD phase, to find hidden data patterns to identify the variables associated with students’ success in online learning (e-learning) programs.

Recently, the use of artificial intelligence techniques, such as Random Forest, has been combined with other techniques, such as models of logical–mathematical reasoning, to generate predictive water quality models. In this study, a rule-based inference technique to generate water quality labels is described, using historical physicochemical parameter data on seven water monitoring stations in Loa River, collected by the Chilean Ministry of the Environment. Next, a predictive model of water quality status was created, using Random Forest, physicochemical parameters, and expert knowledge. The validation of Random Forest results is described using three quality indicators from the machine learning model: accuracy (acc), precision (p), and recall (r). This paper describes dataset preparation, the refinement of the threshold values used for the physicochemical parameters most significant in the class, and the predictive model labeling water quality. The models obtained yielded the following mean values: acc = 0.897, p = 89.73, and r = 0.928. The ML model reported here is novel since no previous studies of this kind predict the water quality of Loa River, located in an extremely arid zone.

For the treatment of wastewater, modern oxidation techniques are desirable due to their excellent performance and simplicity of implementation. In this project, wet impregnation and the hydrothermal technique were applied to synthesize a modified catalyst. Different analysis methods were used to determine its characteristics, including XRD, BET, FT-IR, NH3−TPD, and FE-SEM. The catalyst features a spherical shape, large surface area, high crystallinity, and uniform active phase dispersion. In order to eliminate the methylene blue dye as a modeling effluent, the catalyst’s performance was examined in a heterogeneous quasi-electro-Fenton (EF) reaction. The impact of various performance characteristics, such as catalyst concentration in the reaction medium, solution pH, and current intensity between the two electrodes, was elucidated. According to the results, the best operational circumstances included a pH level of 2, a catalyst concentration of 0.15 g/L, and a current of 150 mA, resulting in the greatest elimination efficiency of 101%. The catalyst’s performance was stable during three consecutive tests. A pseudo-first-order model for the elimination reaction’s kinetics was developed, which showed acceptable agreement with the experimental results. This study’s findings help clarify how well the heterogeneous zeolite catalyst functions in the pseudo-EF reaction. The results revealed the method’s potential to be implemented in wastewater treatment. An artificial neural network model is utilized to predict the removal percentage. The hyperparameter tuning is used to find the best model, and the model achieved an MAE of 1.26% and the R2 was 0.99.","This work was supported by King Khalid University, Abha, Saudi Arabia.

This has caused a rapid expansion of scientific production on DL-AV in recent years, encouraging researchers to conduct systematic literature reviews (SLRs) to organize knowledge on the topic. However, a critical analysis of the existing SLRs on DL-AV reveals some methodological gaps, particularly regarding the use of bibliometric software, which are powerful tools for analyzing large amounts of data and for providing a holistic understanding on the structure of knowledge of a particular field. This study aims to identify the strategic themes and trends in DL-AV research using the Science Mapping Analysis Tool (SciMAT) and content analysis. Strategic diagrams and cluster networks were developed using SciMAT, allowing the identification of motor themes and research opportunities. The content analysis allowed categorization of the contribution of the academic literature on DL applications in AV project design; neural networks and AI models used in AVs; and transdisciplinary themes in DL-AV research, including energy, legislation, ethics, and cybersecurity. Potential research avenues are discussed for each of these categories.

While some products become outdated due to natural causes such as wear and tear or technological advancements, others are strategically designed with a predetermined shelf life to encourage rapid product turnover. Obsolescence is an essential issue in product design because of its impact on product life, efficiency, and sustainability. Although there are approaches to map and measure possible product obsolescence scenarios, it remains a challenge to quantify and diagnose a product's or component's obsolescence potential based on its design attributes. Therefore, this article aims to analyze the existing literature on obsolescence from a product design perspective. It covers its application in methodological design strategies, metrics for measuring obsolescence from early design stages, and identifying understudied research topics, challenges, and trends. On August 15, 2023, a total of 221 articles published between 1983 and 2023 on SCOPUS, Web of Science, and Google Scholar were selected and analyzed using a content-based research approach encompassing three main aspects: objectives and methodologies, strategies and design phases, and metrics for obsolescence analysis. As main findings, this literature review identified several methodological design approaches aimed at resisting and postponing obsolescence, mainly divided into designing long-life products and extending product life. Nevertheless, this study found no formal identification of product design attributes related to the different types of obsolescence, and obsolescence forecasting metrics have focused on defining whether the scenario happens but do not consider what type of obsolescence the product may exhibit. Consequently, it can be challenging to determine the most effective design strategy to reduce obsolescence. This study has limitations, including the potential for researcher bias to affect the systematization of the information.",Declaration of competing interest The authors declare the following financial interests/personal relationships which may be considered as potential competing interests:Lesly Sierra-Fontalvo financial support was provided by Universidad del Norte.,"This research work was supported by Vicerrectoría de Investigación, Creación e Innovación, Universidad del Norte under contract UN-OJ-2022-57,010.",Heliyon,,,,2023-11-04,2023,2023-11-04,2023-11,9,11,e21856,All OA; Gold,Article,"Sierra-Fontalvo, Lesly; Gonzalez-Quiroga, Arturo; Mesa, Jaime A.","Sierra-Fontalvo, Lesly (GIMYP Research Unit, Department of Mechanical Engineering, Universidad del Norte, Km 5 Vía Puerto Colombia, Barranquilla, 080001, Colombia); Gonzalez-Quiroga, Arturo (UREMA Research Unit, Department of Mechanical Engineering, Universidad del Norte, Km 5 Vía Puerto Colombia, Barranquilla, 080001, Colombia); Mesa, Jaime A.

We observed a surprising reduction in the optical band gap from 2.20 to 1.18 eV with increasing calcination temperature from 400 to 500 °C. Raman and X-Ray diffraction measurements indicated slight changes in the lattice parameters induced by the growth process. However, density functional theory calculations of the Rietveld-refined and pristine structures revealed that the observed optical gap reduction could not be explained by structural changes alone. By introducing oxygen vacancies to the refined structures, we could reproduce the reduction of the band gap. Our calculations also showed that the inclusion of oxygen vacancies at the vanadyl position creates a spin-polarized interband state that reduces the electronic band gap and promotes a magnetic response due to unpaired electrons. This prediction was confirmed by our magnetometry measurements, which exhibited a ferromagnetic-like behavior. Our findings suggest that oxygen vacancies play a crucial role in band gap reduction and the promotion of a ferromagnetic-like response in an otherwise paramagnetic material. This provides a promising route to engineer novel devices.","We gratefully acknowledge the support of the Physics Department and the Faculty of Science at Universidad de los Andes, Bogotá, Colombia.

Understanding how best to fill existing gaps and account for biases is necessary to improve our current information most effectively. Two current main approaches for obtaining and improving data include (1) curation of biological collections, and (2) fieldwork. However, the comparative effectiveness of these approaches in improving biodiversity data remains little explored. We used the Flora de Bogotá project to study the magnitude of change in species richness, spatial coverage, and sample coverage of plant records based on curation versus fieldwork. The process of curation resulted in a decrease in species richness (synonym and error removal), but it significantly increased the number of records per species. Fieldwork contributed to a slight increase in species richness, via accumulation of new records. Additionally, curation led to increases in spatial coverage, species observed by locality, the number of plant records by species, and localities by species compared to fieldwork. Overall, curation was more efficient in producing new information compared to fieldwork, mainly because of the large number of records available in herbaria. We recommend intensive curatorial work as the first step in increasing biodiversity data quality and quantity, to identify bias and gaps at the regional scale that can then be targeted with fieldwork. The stepwise strategy would enable fieldwork to be planned more cost-effectively given the limited resources for biodiversity exploration and characterization.","Declaration of competing interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

In the search for new potential drug candidates that can be used as treatments or adjuvants in the control of infections by these pathogenic yeasts, the objective of this research was to evaluate the action of isoespintanol (ISO) against the formation of fungal biofilms, the mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm), and its effect on the integrity of the cell wall. We report the ability of ISO to inhibit the formation of biofilms by up to 89.35%, in all cases higher than the values expressed by amphotericin B (AFB). Flow cytometric experiments using rhodamine 123 (Rh123) showed the ability of ISO to cause mitochondrial dysfunction in these cells. Likewise, experiments using calcofluor white (CFW) and analyzed by flow cytometry showed the ability of ISO to affect the integrity of the cell wall by stimulating chitin synthesis; these changes in the integrity of the wall were also observed through transmission electron microscopy (TEM). These mechanisms are involved in the antifungal action of this monoterpene.","To Homero San Juan, Specialized Diagnostic Center, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla.

These types of studies, which have attracted growing attention in recent years, enhance the scope and rigor of the evaluation. While various frameworks that summarize the justifications for carrying out these types of studies and provide implementation guidance have been published in the last few years in the health sciences, we do not know whether such frameworks have been properly implemented in the social and educational sciences. This review examined the methodological features and reporting practices of mixed methods intervention studies aimed at increasing young people's interest in STEM.
Methods: A systematic search was carried out in APA PsycNET, ERIC, ProQuest, Scopus, and Web of Science, and a hand search in 20 journals. We included peer-reviewed English-language articles that reported intervention studies with a quantitative component measuring outcomes specific to increasing secondary school students' interest in STEM fields, a qualitative component conducted before, during, or after the quantitative component, and evidence of integration of both components. Qualitative content analysis and ideal-type analysis were used to synthesize the findings.
Results: We found 34 studies; the majority published in the last ten years. Several patterns of mixed methods application were described in these studies, illustrating the unique insights that can be gained by employing this methodology. The reporting quality of the included studies was generally adequate, especially regarding the justification for using a mixed methods intervention design and the integration of the quantitative and qualitative components. Nonetheless, a few reporting issues were observed, such as a lack of detail in the presentation of the mixed methods design, an inadequate description of the qualitative sampling and analysis techniques, and the absence of joint displays for representing integration.
Discussion: Authors must pay attention to these issues to ensure that the insights obtained by the use of mixed methods research are effectively communicated.",The authors would like to acknowledge the help of Dick Edelstein in editing the final manuscript.,"This study belonged to a research project led by MS and funded by the Spanish Ministry of Economy, Industry and Competitiveness (MINECO), Spanish State Research Agency (AEI), and European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) grant number (FEM2017-84589-R).",Frontiers in Psychology,,,,2023-01-05,2023,2023-01-05,,13,,956300,All OA; Gold,Article,"Fàbregues, Sergi; Sáinz, Milagros; Romano, María José; Escalante-Barrios, Elsa Lucia; Younas, Ahtisham; López-Pérez, Beatriz-Soledad","Fàbregues, Sergi (Department of Psychology and Education, Universitat Oberta de Catalunya, Barcelona, Spain); Sáinz, Milagros (Internet Interdisciplinary Institute, Universitat Oberta de Catalunya, Barcelona, Spain); Romano, María José (Internet Interdisciplinary Institute, Universitat Oberta de Catalunya, Barcelona, Spain); Escalante-Barrios, Elsa Lucia (Department of Education, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); Younas, Ahtisham (Faculty of Nursing, Memorial University of Newfoundland, St. John’s, IL, Canada); López-Pérez, Beatriz-Soledad (Internet Interdisciplinary Institute, Universitat Oberta de Catalunya, Barcelona, Spain)","Fàbregues, Sergi (Open University of Catalonia); Sáinz, Milagros (Open University of Catalonia)","Fàbregues, Sergi (Open University of Catalonia); Sáinz, Milagros (Open University of Catalonia); Romano, María José (Open University of Catalonia); Escalante-Barrios, Elsa Lucia (Universidad del Norte); Younas, Ahtisham (Memorial University of Newfoundland); López-Pérez, Beatriz-Soledad (Open University of Catalonia)",6,6,,,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.956300/pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1154252387,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 52 Psychology,

Methods: Qualitative study of 20 semi-structured interviews with women from Venezuela who are residents of Barranquilla and who carry out leadership activities in communities or who participate in or benefit from those activities. The interviews included opinions and experiences related to access to VIP, and to SRH in general, as well as suggestions for improving access for migrant women. The relationship between access to these services and the migration process was explored, as well as the role of social organizations.
Results: A lack of information on SRH-related rights was identified as the main access barrier to VIP. Other identified barriers were: attitude towards VIP, excessive steps involved in accessing medical care, difficulties in admission to the social security system, lack of training and care in SRH, and xenophobia in hospitals. The interviewees said they did not understand the legal framework in Colombia and did not know the channels for safe abortion care.
Conclusions: Despite the efforts of institutions and international cooperation, Venezuelan migrant women in Barranquilla are in a situation of vulnerability due to their lack of access to sexual and reproductive health, including voluntary interruption of pregnancy. Implementing strategies for comprehensive care for migrants will improve current health conditions and the effective enjoyment of SRH-related rights.",,"Este trabajo recibió financiamiento del Programa Especial de Investigación, Desarrollo y Capacitación para la Investigación en Reproducción Humana del Programa de las Naciones Unidas para el Desarrollo (PNUD, por su sigla en inglés), el Fondo de Población de las Naciones (UNFPA, por su sigla en inglés), el Fondo para la Infancia de las Naciones Unidas ((UNICEF), la Organización Mundial de la Salud (/OMS) y el Banco Mundial, y por el Programa Especial de Investigación y Capacitación en Enfermedades Tropicales de UNICEF-PNUD-Banco Mundial-OMS, ambos programas copatrocinados por la OMS.",BULL PAN AM HEALTH ORGAN,,,,2023-03-03,2023,2023-03-03,2023-03-03,47,,e49,All OA; Gold,Article,"Quintero, Luz Dary; Osorio, Habid Osorio; Bojorquez-Chapela, Ietza; Isaza, Laura; Acosta-Reyes, Jorge; Fernández-Niño, Julián Alfredo","Quintero, Luz Dary (Departamento de Salud Pública, Universidad del Norte, Puerto Colombia, Colombia, Departamento de Salud Pública.

The present study aimed to determine the influence of the anthropometric profile and physical activity level (PAL) on the postural balance of overweight and obese children. The sample included 387 schoolchildren (216 boys and 171 girls). The variables of the anthropometric profile studied were body mass, biped height, BMI, waist circumference, waist-to-hip ratio (WHR), summation of folds, body composition, and somatotype. PAL was measured using the PAQ-C questionnaire. Static and dynamic postural balance were measured through an open-eye (OE) and closed-eye (CE) posturographic test and the SEBTm, respectively. For static balance, the significant models were for mediolateral velocity (R2 = 0.42 in OA; R2 = 0.24 in OC), anteroposterior velocity (R2 = 0.21 in OA; R2 = 0.27 in OC), and mean velocity (R2 = 0.27 in OA; R2 = 0.46 in OC), where the predictors of low performance were younger age, male sex, overweight/obese nutritional status, greater thickness of skin folds, less tendency to mesomorphy, and greater fat mass. On the other hand, for dynamic postural balance, the significant models were observed in the previous direction (R2 = 0.39), posteromedial (R2 = 0.57), and posterolateral (R2 = 0.56), where the variables that predict a low performance were low PAL, overweight/obese nutritional status, and high WHR. Overweight and obese children presented a deficit in static and dynamic postural balance, enhanced by variables such as gender, age, PAL, and anthropometric characteristics related to adiposity.",,This research was financed by the internal funds of the Academic Vice-Rector for Research and Postgraduate Studies of the Universidad Santo Tomás (Chile) (project number 113200024).,Behavioral Sciences,,,,2023-01-14,2023,2023-01-14,,13,1,73,All OA; Gold,Article,"Guzmán-Muñoz, Eduardo; Mendez-Rebolledo, Guillermo; Núñez-Espinosa, Cristián; Valdés-Badilla, Pablo; Monsalves-Álvarez, Matías; Delgado-Floody, Pedro; Herrera-Valenzuela, Tomás","Guzmán-Muñoz, Eduardo (Escuela de Kinesiología, Facultad de Salud, Universidad Santo Tomás, Talca 3480094, Chile; Escuela de Kinesiología, Facultad de Ciencias de la Salud, Universidad Autónoma de Chile, Talca 3480094, Chile); Mendez-Rebolledo, Guillermo (Escuela de Kinesiología, Facultad de Salud, Universidad Santo Tomás, Talca 3480094, Chile); Núñez-Espinosa, Cristián (Escuela de Medicina, Universidad de Magallanes, Punta Arenas 6200000, Chile; Centro Asistencial Docente y de Investigación, Universidad de Magallanes, Punta Arenas 6200000, Chile); Valdés-Badilla, Pablo (Departamento de Ciencias de la Actividad Física, Facultad de Ciencias de la Educación, Universidad Católica del Maule, Talca 3480094, Chile; Carrera de Entrenador Deportivo, Escuela de Educación.

Thus far, there have been several records of mycovirus infection in Colletotrichum spp., primarily by viruses of the Partitiviridae family. There have also been records of infections by mycoviruses of the Chrysoviridae family. Mycoviruses are (+)ssRNA and dsRNA genome viruses, which may or may not be enveloped. To date, no mycovirus with a DNA genome has been isolated from Colletotrichum spp. Typically, mycoviruses cause latent infections, although hypo- and hypervirulence have also been reported in Colletotrichum spp. In addition to its effects on pathogenic behavior, mycovirus infection can lead to important physiological changes, such as altered morphological characteristics, reduced vegetative growth, and suppressed conidia production. Therefore, research on mycoviruses infecting phytopathogenic fungi can help develop alternative methods to chemical control, which can cause irreversible damage to humans and the environment. From an agricultural perspective, mycoviruses can contribute to sustainable agriculture as biological control agents via changes in fungal physiology, ultimately resulting in the total loss of or reduction in the virulence of these pathogens.","This study was financed by the Coordination for the Improvement of Higher Education Personnel (CAPES), Brazil, (financing Code 001) and the Foundation of Research Support of Amazonas State (FAPEAM 002/2018 – UNIVERSAL AMAZONAS).

Symptoms of anaemia include fatigue and weakness, among others, affecting health and quality of life. Anaemic pregnant women have an increased risk of premature delivery, a low-birthweight infant, and postpartum depression. They are also more likely to have anaemia in the postpartum period which can lead to an ongoing condition and affect subsequent pregnancies. In 2019 nearly 37% of pregnant women globally had anaemia, and estimates suggest that 50–80% of postpartum women in low- and middle-income countries have anaemia, but currently there is no standard measurement or classification for postpartum anaemia.MethodsA rapid landscape review was conducted to identify and characterize postpartum anaemia measurement searching references within three published systematic reviews of anaemia, including studies published between 2012 and 2021. We then conducted a new search for relevant literature from February 2021 to April 2022 in EMBASE and MEDLINE using a similar search strategy as used in the published reviews.ResultsIn total, we identified 53 relevant studies. The timing of haemoglobin measurement ranged from within the immediate postpartum period to over 6 weeks. The thresholds used to diagnose anaemia in postpartum women varied considerably, with < 120, < 110, < 100 and < 80 g/L the most frequently reported. Other laboratory results frequently reported included ferritin and transferrin receptor. Clinical outcomes reported in 32 out of 53 studies included postpartum depression, quality of life, and fatigue. Haemoglobin measurements were performed in a laboratory, although it is unclear from the studies if venous samples and automatic analysers were used in all cases.ConclusionsThis review demonstrates the need for improving postpartum anaemia measurement given the variability observed in published measures. With the high prevalence of anaemia, the relatively simple treatment for non-severe cases of iron deficiency anaemia, and its importance to public health with multi-generational effects, it is crucial to develop common measures for women in the postpartum period and promote rapid uptake and reporting.","The authors thank Vaibhav Patwardhan, Research Officer, Jhpiego India country office for assistance with formatting references.","This work received support from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation as part of the Mother and Newborn Information for Tracking Outcomes and Results (MoNITOR) Advisory Group.

The objective of this study was to identify the epidemiological profile of the population affiliated to the SS in Colombia and to compare the main epidemiological features of the SS to the CS.MethodsFollowing the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) methodology, the search was carried out from 1993, with no other restriction. The information was synthesized into five categories according to the most important risk populations. We estimated combined incidences from epidemiological surveillance data, prevalence ratio, and other measures to estimate the difference between the studied groups. A 95% confidence interval was considered. A random effects model was used weighted by the inverse of the variance of the cumulative incidence calculated for each disease. The risk of bias was assessed using the Joanna Briggs Institute’s critical appraisal tools.ResultsA total of 16,236 articles were identified; 14,972 were excluded after title and abstract screening, 725 articles were verified as full text, and finally 268 articles were included. The relative risk of non-communicable and communicable diseases was lower in the SS than in the CS (RR: 0.37 and 0.72, respectively, p-value < 0.05). However, the risk of presenting obstetric and maternal conditions in the SS versus the CS was RR 1.55 for frequent conditions during early childhood, and for other diseases it was RR 1.28 with a p-value of < 0.05. The use of health services was different by scheme, with less demand, access, and provision being found in health services in the SS.ConclusionsThis study allowed us to conclude that there are differences in the incidence, prevalence, and use of health services between health affiliation schemes (SS and CS) in Colombia, thereby assisting in decision-making for stakeholders.Trial registrationPROSPERO Registration number CRD42021279234.",Not applicable.,"This study is funded by the Ministerio de Hacienda y Crédito Público of Colombia and the Instituto de Evaluación Tecnológica en Salud, through inter-administrative agreement No. 7008-2021.",International Journal for Equity in Health,,,"Female; Pregnancy; Humans; Child, Preschool; Colombia; Insurance, Health; Risk Factors; Incidence; Prevalence",2023-02-07,2023,2023-02-07,,22,1,28,All OA; Gold,Article,"Mora-Moreo, Laura; Estrada-Orozco, Kelly; Espinosa, Oscar; Melgarejo, Lorena Mesa","Mora-Moreo, Laura (Epidemiology, Evidence Synthesis and Technology Management, Instituto de Evaluación Tecnológica en Salud (IETS), Bogotá, Colombia; Department of Health Services Research and Policy, Faculty of Public Health and Policy, London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, London, England); Estrada-Orozco, Kelly (Directorate of Evidence Synthesis and Management of Health Technologies, Institutode Evaluación Tecnológica en Salud (IETS), Bogotá, D.C., Colombia; Health Technologies and Policies Assessment Group, Instituto de Investigaciones Clínicas, Facultad de Medicina, Universidad Nacional de Colombia, Sede Bogotá, Colombia; Instituto de Investigaciones Clínicas, Facultad de Medicina, Fundación Universitaria Sanitas, Bogotá, Colombia); Espinosa, Oscar (Directorate of Analytical, Economic and Actuarial Studies at Instituto de Evaluación Tecnológica en Salud (IETS), Bogotá, D.C., Colombia; Economic Models and Quantitative Methods Research Group, Centro de Investigaciones para el Desarrollo, Universidad Nacional de Colombia, Bogotá, Colombia); Melgarejo, Lorena Mesa (Directorate of Qualitative Methods and Social Research, Instituto de Evaluación Tecnológica en Salud (IETS), Bogotá, D.C., Colombia)","Estrada-Orozco, Kelly (Directorate of Evidence Synthesis and Management of Health Technologies, Institutode Evaluación Tecnológica en Salud (IETS), Bogotá, D.C., Colombia; National University of Colombia; Fundación Universitaria Sanitas)","Mora-Moreo, Laura (Epidemiology, Evidence Synthesis and Technology Management, Instituto de Evaluación Tecnológica en Salud (IETS), Bogotá, Colombia; London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine); Estrada-Orozco, Kelly (Directorate of Evidence Synthesis and Management of Health Technologies, Institutode Evaluación Tecnológica en Salud (IETS), Bogotá, D.C., Colombia; National University of Colombia; Fundación Universitaria Sanitas); Espinosa, Oscar (Directorate of Analytical, Economic and Actuarial Studies at Instituto de Evaluación Tecnológica en Salud (IETS), Bogotá, D.C., Colombia; National University of Colombia); Melgarejo, Lorena Mesa (Directorate of Qualitative Methods and Social Research, Instituto de Evaluación Tecnológica en Salud (IETS), Bogotá, D.C., Colombia)",6,6,,,https://equityhealthj.biomedcentral.com/counter/pdf/10.1186/s12939-022-01818-x,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1155161601,42 Health Sciences; 4202 Epidemiology; 4206 Public Health,3 Good Health and Well Being

Study design: Ecological study.
Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional ecological study based on secondary data analysis. Coverages of the first, second, and third doses of the vaccine against COVID-19 and the HDI were evaluated. The magnitude of the correlations was assessed using Spearman's rank correlation coefficients with their corresponding bootstrapped 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). Scatter plots were also constructed.
Results: A total of 196 provinces were included. There was a moderate correlation between the first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine and the HDI (r = 0.3807 [95% CI 0.2585-0.5030], p < 0.0001). The same direction was found for the second (r = 0.4064 [95% CI 0.2853-0.5276], p < 0.0001) and third dose (r = 0.4435 [95% CI 0.3201-0.5669], p < 0.0001).
Conclusions: A positive correlation was found between COVID-19 vaccination coverage and the HDI, suggesting the presence of inequalities in access to vaccines.

The European Partnership for the Assessment of Risks from Chemicals (PARC) was designed to address many of the challenges that exist for the development and implementation of NAMs in modern chemical risk assessment. PARC's proximity to national and European regulatory agencies is envisioned to ensure that all the research and innovation projects that are initiated within PARC agree with actual regulatory needs. One of the main aims of PARC is to develop innovative methodologies that will directly aid chemical hazard identification, risk assessment, and regulation/policy. This will facilitate the development of NAMs for use in risk assessment, as well as the transition from an endpoint-based animal testing strategy to a more mechanistic-based NAMs testing strategy, as foreseen by the Tox21 and the EU Chemical's Strategy for Sustainability. This work falls under work package 5 (WP5) of the PARC initiative. There are three different tasks within WP5, and this paper is a general overview of the five main projects in the Task 5.2 'Innovative Tools and methods for Toxicity Testing,' with a focus on Human Health. This task will bridge essential regulatory data gaps pertaining to the assessment of toxicological prioritized endpoints such as non-genotoxic carcinogenicity, immunotoxicity, endocrine disruption (mainly thyroid), metabolic disruption, and (developmental and adult) neurotoxicity, thereby leveraging OECD's and PARC's AOP frameworks. This is intended to provide regulatory risk assessors and industry stakeholders with relevant, affordable and reliable assessment tools that will ultimately contribute to the application of next-generation risk assessment (NGRA) in Europe and worldwide.",The authors thank all the Task 5.2 partners for their work on this Task.,This work was carried out in the framework of the European Partnership for the Assessment of Risks from Chemicals (PARC) and has received funding from the European Union’s Horizon Europe research and innovation programme under Grant Agreement No 101057014.

They aim to deny and justify men's sexual assault against women. This study evaluates the mediating effect of modern rape myths on the relationship between gender system justification and attribution of blame to both victim and perpetrator in a fictional case of sexual violence. A total of 375 individuals residing in Chile, 255 women and 120 men, 19-81 years (M = 37.6 SD = 13.06) participated in the study. Results from a Structural Equation Model show that gender system justification is directly related to the attribution of blame to the victim, showing an indirect relationship throughout the modern rape myth. However, gender system justification and attribution of blame to the aggressor are indirectly related, being mediated by modern rape myths. The study of the relationship between the acceptance of modern rape myths, gender-specific system justification, and victim and aggressor blame for rape is a contribution to understanding beliefs justifying sexual violence against women.",We would like to express special gratitude to all the participants for their generous contributions that made this work possible.,This research received no external funding.,International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health,,,Male; Humans; Female; Rape; Crime Victims; Sex Offenses; Social Perception; Attitude,2023-01-17,2023,2023-01-17,,20,3,1663,All OA; Gold,Article,"Murray, Carol; Calderón, Carlos; Bahamondes, Joaquín","Murray, Carol (School of Psychology, Universidad Católica del Norte, Avenida Angamos 0610, Antofagasta 1240000, Chile.); Calderón, Carlos (School of Psychology, Universidad Católica del Norte, Avenida Angamos 0610, Antofagasta 1240000, Chile.); Bahamondes, Joaquín (School of Psychology, Universidad Católica del Norte, Avenida Angamos 0610, Antofagasta 1240000, Chile.)","Murray, Carol (Catholic University of the North)","Murray, Carol (Catholic University of the North); Calderón, Carlos (Catholic University of the North); Bahamondes, Joaquín (Catholic University of the North)",6,6,,,https://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/20/3/1663/pdf?version=1673943216,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1154615891,44 Human Society; 4402 Criminology; 48 Law and Legal Studies; 4804 Law In Context; 4805 Legal Systems,"16 Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions; 5 Gender Equality"

This research is framed within two fundamental aspects: the first one is linked to the proposal of new methods of biogenic synthesis of silver, cuprous oxide, and zinc oxide nanoparticles using organic extracts as reducing agents. The second one is the application of nanomaterials in the impregnation (functionalization) of textiles based on methods called ""in situ"" (within the synthesis), and ""post-synthesis"" (after the synthesis), with subsequent evaluation of their effectiveness in reducing the viral load of SARS-CoV-2. The results show that stable, monodisperse nanoparticles with defined geometry can be obtained. Likewise, the ""in situ"" impregnation method emerges as the best way to adhere nanoparticles.

These conditions are expected to result in the adaptive evolution of protein coding genes encoded in mitochondrial genomes that are vital for the oxidative phosphorylation pathway. In this study, we formally tested for signatures of adaptive evolution on mitochondrial protein coding genes in Tapirus pinchaque and other odd-toed ungulates inhabiting high-elevation environments.ResultsThe AT-rich mitochondrial genome of T. pinchaque is 16,750 bp long. A phylomitogenomic analysis supports the monophyly of the genus Tapirus and families in the Perissodactyla. The ratio of non-synonymous to synonymous substitutions demonstrated that all mitochondrial genes undergo purifying selection in T. pinchaque and other odd ungulates living at high elevations. Over this negative background selection, Branch Models suggested that cox3 and nad6 might be undergoing stronger purifying selection than other mitochondrial protein coding genes. Furthermore, Site Models suggested that one and four sites in nad2 and nad5, respectively, could be experiencing positive selection. However, these results were supported by Likelihood Ratio Tests but not Bayesian Empirical Bayes posterior probabilities. Additional analyses (in DataMonkey) indicated a relaxation of selection strength in nad6, evidence of episodic diversifying selection in cob, and revealed episodic positive/diversifying selection signatures for two sites in nad1, and one site each in nad2 and nad4.ConclusionThe mitochondrial genome of T. pinchaque is an important genomic resource for conservation of this species and this study contributes to the understanding of adaptive evolution of mitochondrial protein coding genes in odd-toed ungulates inhabiting high-altitude environments.",J.A.B thanks Dr. Vincent P.

Three-dimensional printer performance mostly depends on good integration with artificial intelligence (AI) to outperform humans in overcoming complex tasks using 3DPs equipped with AI technology, particularly in producing an object with no smooth surface and a standard geometric shape. Hence, 3DPs also provide an opportunity to improve engineering applications in manufacturing processes. As a result, AM can create more sustainable production systems, protect the environment, and reduce external costs arising from industries’ production activities. Nonetheless, practitioners do not have sufficient willingness since this kind of transformation in production processes is a crucial and irrevocable decision requiring vast knowledge and experience. Thus, presenting a methodological frame and a roadmap may help decision-makers take more responsibility for accelerating the digital transformation of production processes. The current study aims to fill the literature’s critical theoretical and managerial gaps. Therefore, it suggests a powerful and efficient decision model for solving 3DP selection problems for industries. The suggested hybrid FF model combines the Fermatean Fuzzy Stepwise Weight Assessment Ratio Analysis (FF–SWARA) and the Fermatean Ranking of Alternatives through Functional mapping of criterion sub-intervals into a Single Interval (FF–RAFSI) approaches. The novel FF framework is employed to solve a critical problem encountered in the automobile manufacturing industry with the help of two related case studies. In addition, the criteria are identified and categorized regarding their influence degrees using a group decision approach based on an extended form of the Delphi with the aid of the Fermatean fuzzy sets. According to the conclusions of the analysis, the criteria “Accuracy” and “Quality” are the most effective measures. Also, the suggested hybrid model and its outcomes were tested by executing robustness and validation checks. The results of the analyses prove that the suggested integrated framework is a robust and practical decision-making tool.",,This research received no external funding.,Machines,,,,2023-12-20,2023,2023-12-20,,12,1,5,All OA; Gold,Article,"Görçün, Ömer Faruk; Zolfani, Sarfaraz Hashemkhani; Küçükönder, Hande; Antucheviciene, Jurgita; Pavlovskis, Miroslavas","Görçün, Ömer Faruk (Department of Business Administration, Kadir Has University, Istanbul 34083, Turkey;, omer.gorcun@khas.edu.tr); Zolfani, Sarfaraz Hashemkhani (School of Engineering, Universidad Catolica del Norte, Coquimbo 1780000, Chile); Küçükönder, Hande (Department of Numerical Methods, Faculty of Economics and Administrative Sciences, Bartın University, Bartın 74100, Turkey;, hkucukonder@bartin.edu.tr); Antucheviciene, Jurgita (Department of Construction Management and Real Estate, Vilnius Gediminas Technical University, Sauletekio al. 11, LT-10223 Vilnius, Lithuania;, jurgita.antucheviciene@vilniustech.lt, (J.A.);, miroslav.pavlovskis@gmail.com, (M.P.)); Pavlovskis, Miroslavas (Department of Construction Management and Real Estate, Vilnius Gediminas Technical University, Sauletekio al. 11, LT-10223 Vilnius, Lithuania;, jurgita.antucheviciene@vilniustech.lt, (J.A.);, miroslav.pavlovskis@gmail.com, (M.P.))","Zolfani, Sarfaraz Hashemkhani (Catholic University of the North)","Görçün, Ömer Faruk (Kadir Has University); Zolfani, Sarfaraz Hashemkhani (Catholic University of the North); Küçükönder, Hande (Bartin University); Antucheviciene, Jurgita (Vilnius Gediminas Technical University; Department of Construction Management and Real Estate, Vilnius Gediminas Technical University, Sauletekio al. 11, LT-10223 Vilnius, Lithuania;, jurgita.antucheviciene@vilniustech.lt, (J.A.);, miroslav.pavlovskis@gmail.com, (M.P.)); Pavlovskis, Miroslavas (Vilnius Gediminas Technical University; Department of Construction Management and Real Estate, Vilnius Gediminas Technical University, Sauletekio al. 11, LT-10223 Vilnius, Lithuania;, jurgita.antucheviciene@vilniustech.lt, (J.A.);, miroslav.pavlovskis@gmail.com, (M.P.))",6,6,,,https://doi.org/10.3390/machines12010005,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1167230772,40 Engineering; 4014 Manufacturing Engineering,"12 Responsible Consumption and Production; 9 Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure"

An important implication of such stringy effects is that they can alleviate the initial singularity since the Raychaudhuri equation is modified. We investigate if the Universe can undergo an accelerated expansion phase for a specific domain of the equation of state parameter. The stringy effects are encoded in the parameter Γ, which depends not only on the zero-point length but also on the state parameter ω. We construct two dynamical systems depending on whether − 1 < ω ≤ − 1 / 3 and ω ≥ − 1 / 3 , and we classify the equilibrium points of each system.

We use data from Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB), Baryonic Acoustic Oscillations (BAO), Supernovae Type Ia (SNIa), and Redshift space distortion (RSD) probes, in order to impose observational constraints on soft dark energy and soft dark matter. We examine three simple models, corresponding to the minimum extensions of ΛCDM scenario, namely we consider that at large scales the dark sectors have the EoS's of ΛCDM model (dust dark matter and cosmological constant respectively), while at intermediate scales either dark energy or dark matter or both, may have a different EoS according to constant “softness” parameters s d e and s d m . The observational confrontation shows that for almost all datasets the softness parameters deviate from their ΛCDM values, in a prominent way for soft dark energy and mildly for soft dark matter, and thus the data favor soft cosmology. Finally, performing a Bayesian evidence analysis we find that the examined models are certainly preferred over ΛCDM cosmology.","The authors thank the referee for important comments which led to the improvement of the quality of the manuscript.

Here, we evaluate the prospect of using climate velocities (CV) of the metabolic index (Φ) for assessing changes in habitat in the South East Pacific. Our approach is based on a species with mean ecophysiotype (i.e. model species) and the use of a global Earth System Model simulation (CESM-LE) under RCP 8.5 scenario. The SEP is chosen as a case study as it hosts an Oxygen Minimum Zone and seamounts systems sustaining local communities through artisanal fisheries. Our results indicate that CVΦ pattern is mainly constrained by the oxygen distribution and that its sign is affected by contrasting oxygen trends (including a re-oxygenation in the upper OMZ) and warming. We further show that CVΦ is weakly dependent on physiological traits composing Φ, which conveys to this metrics some value for inferring the projected mean displacement and potential changes in viability of metabolic habitat in a region where physiological data are scarce. Based on sensitivity experiments to physiological traits and natural variability, we propose a general method for inferring broad areas of climate change exposure regardless of species-specific Φ. We show in particular that for the model used here, the upper OMZ region can be considered a “safe” area for the species with ecophysiotype close to that of 71 species used to derive the model species. Limitations of the approach and perspectives of this work are also discussed.",We would like to thank Dr. K. von Schuckmann for early discussion on the results. We warmly thank Pr.

Chile is the world’s leading marine seaweed biomass producer when it comes to the exploitation of natural kelp beds. This extraction pressure has persisted for decades and has resulted in a reduction in natural stocks along the benthic ecosystems of the Chilean coast. Over the last three decades, several strategies aimed at restoring seaweed stocks have been implemented (i.e., sexual and asexual reproduction, the use of spore-type propagules or fragments of thalli, and entire thallus transplants). Success rates have varied, but the biological feasibility of such strategies has been demonstrated for several species. However, technological improvements must be achieved to move from small-scale, pilot experiments to cost-effective restocking strategies that are easy to transfer to fisher communities and another end-user, scalable to marine field conditions, and socio-ecologically sustainable. Researchers in other geographic areas have explored similar pathways for developing kelp restocking strategies and have tackled the research gaps regarding its massification. This work summarizes the research activities carried out in recent decades in the search for sustainable strategies to restore algal stocks in Chile.",The authors would like to thank Renata Garretón for her contribution to the elaboration of Figures 1 and 8 of this work.,"This research was funded by the ANID Millennium Science Initiative Program ICN 2019_015, ANID PIA/BASAL FB0002, ANID/BASAL FB210006 and the CNRS International Research Network Diversity and Biotechnology of Marine Algae (contract number 00022).",Frontiers in Marine Science,,,,2023-01-09,2023,2023-01-09,,9,,1062481,All OA; Gold,Article,"Oyarzo-Miranda, Carolina; Otaíza, Ricardo; Bellorín, Alexis; Vega, J.M.

Physical-chemical characterization of the catalysts showed a significant change in morphological and optical properties of the TiO2 thin films after surface modification. We applied the kinetic and isothermal models to the methylene blue (MB) adsorption process on both catalysts. The pseudo-second order model was the best fitting model for the kinetic results; qe (mg/g) was 11.9 for TiO2 thin films and 14.6 for TiO2-AlPOM thin films, and k2 (g mg-1 min-1) was 16.3 × 10-2 for TiO2 thin films and 28.2 × 10-2 for TiO2-AlPOM thin films. Furthermore, the Freundlich model was suitable to describe the isothermal behavior of TiO2, KF (5.42 mg/g), and 1/n (0.312). The kinetics of photocatalytic degradation was fitted using the Langmuir-Hinshelwood model; kap was 7 × 10-4 min-1 for TiO2 and 13 × 10-4 min-1 for TiO2-AlPOM. The comparative study showed that TiO2 thin films reach a 19.6% MB degradation under UV irradiation and 9.1% MB adsorption, while the TiO2-AlPOM thin films reach a 32.6% MB degradation and 12.2% MB adsorption on their surface. The surface modification improves the morphological, optical, and photocatalytic properties of the thin films. Finally, the DFT study supports all the previously shown results.","W.V. and C.D.-U. thank Universidad del Atlántico, Ministry of Economy, Development and Tourism-Chile, grant Nuclei on Catalytic Processes towards Sustainable Chemistry (CSC) ANID-NCN2021_090.

About 40% of the patients with PPGL have a hereditary predisposition. Here we present a case-series of 19 unrelated Colombian patients with a clinical diagnosis of PPGL tumors that underwent germline genetic testing as part of the Hereditary Cancer Program developed at the Instituto Nacional de Cancerología, Colombia (INC-C), the largest reference cancer center in the country. Ten of 19 patients (52.63%) were identified as carriers of a pathogenic/likely pathogenic (P/LP) germline variant in a known susceptibility gene. The majority of the P/LP variants were in the SDHB gene (9/10): one corresponded to a nonsense variant c.268C>T (p.Arg90*) and eight cases were found to be carriers of a recurrent CNV consisting of a large deletion of one copy of exon 1, explaining 42% (8/19) of all the affected cases. Only one additional case was found to be a carrier of a missense mutation in the VHL gene: c.355T>C (p.Phe119Leu).

The aim of this study was to determine the internal structure (dimensionality, measurement invariance and reliability) and association with other variables.
Methods: A total of 470 patients with chronic disease from a Family Medicine Unit at the Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social, IMSS, with a mean age of 51.51 years were included. Participants responded to the Questionnaire of Sociodemographic Variables (Q-SV), SF-36 Health-Related Quality of Life Scale-version 1.1, and MOS-SSS.
Results: Non-parametric (Mokken scaling analysis) and parametric (confirmatory factor analysis) analyses indicated unidimensionality, and three-factor model was not representative. A new 8-item version (MOS-S) was developed, where measurement invariance, equivalence with the long version, reliability, and relationship with the SF-36 were satisfactory.
Conclusion: The MOS-SSS scale is unidimensional, and the shortened version yields valid and reliable scores for measuring social support in patients with chronic disease at the primary health care.","We would like to thank M NB, Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social, IMSS, Unidad de Medicina Familiar 31, Ciudad de México, Mexico.","This work presents some results of the research project HIM/2015/017/SSA.1207 “Effects of mindfulness training on psychological distress and quality of life of the family caregiver,” Main researcher: FT-T, Ph.D. The present research was funded with federal funds for health research and was approved by the Commissions of Research, Ethics and Biosafety [Comisiones de Investigación, Ética y Bioseguridad], Hospital Infantil de México Federico Gómez, National Institute of Health.

Case report,"INTRODUCTION AND IMPORTANCE: Omental torsion as a cause of acute abdominal pain is extremely rare and difficult to diagnose preoperatively given the non-specific clinical picture.
PRESENTATION OF CASE: We report the case of an adult male who went to the emergency room due to abdominal pain, presented clinical symptoms and laboratory findings consistent with acute appendicitis but was diagnosed intraoperatively with omental torsion and associated necrosis, which was successfully treated by laparoscopic omentectomy.
DISCUSSION: It is a rare entity with a low incidence. The symptoms of the cases reported in the literature are usually confused with other abdominal pathologies such as appendicitis or cholecystitis, so preoperative diagnosis continues to be a challenge. The treatment of choice is the laparoscopic approach, since it allows confirming the diagnosis, evaluating the severity of the ischemia, and ruling out other surgical pathologies.
CONCLUSION: It is important to consider omental torsion as another differential diagnosis of acute abdomen, which can be satisfactorily resolved via laparoscopy, thus avoiding the development of complications associated with its natural evolution.","Thanks to the Hospital General Tercer Milenio and the staff that make up the honorable General Surgery service, for their time, dedication and effort in teaching.

The research for alternative raw materials becomes interesting, since most of the resources come from planted forests. In addition, the investigation of new raw materials must take into account environmentally correct solutions, such as the use of alternative natural fibers, use of agro-industrial residues, and resins of vegetable origin. The objective of this study was to evaluate the physical properties of panels manufactured by hot pressing using eucalyptus sawdust, chamotte, and polyurethane resin based on castor oil as raw materials. Eight formulations were designed with variations of 0, 5, 10, and 15% of chamotte, and two variations of resin with 10% and 15% of volumetric fraction. Tests of gravimetric density, X-ray densitometry, moisture content, water absorption, thickness swelling, and scanning electron microscopy were carried out. Through the results it can be noticed that the incorporation of chamotte in the manufacture of the panels increased the water absorption and the swelling in thickness, around 100% and the use of 15% of resin decreased, more than 50%, the values of these properties. X-ray densitometry analyzes showed that the addition of chamotte alters the density profile of the panel.

This study aimed to quantify nutrient accumulation in the fruits, grains, and husks of Robusta coffee genotypes cultivated in the Brazilian Amazon and estimate genetic diversity. The experiment was conducted in Alta Floresta D'Oeste-Rondônia, Brazil. To assess nutrient accumulation, fresh fruits were collected. These were dried, processed, separated into grains and husks, and subjected to chemical analysis. Nutrient accumulation in fruits, grains, and husks, as well as the grain/husk ratio, underwent analysis of variance through the F-test (p < 0.01. For each evaluated trait, the experimental coefficient of 337 variation (CVe), genetic coefficient of variation (CVg), and genotypic determination coefficient (H2) were also estimated. Variability was observed among Robusta coffee genotypes, with VP06, AS4, and AS10 being the most dissimilar. LB080 had the lowest dry fruit weight and the lowest percentage of grains in relation to husks. ZD156 accumulated more K in the grains, while VP06 and AS10 were the genotypes that accumulated more nutrients in the husks.

Thus, it is understood that the sustainable development goals 2015–2030 (SDGs) need to be substantially operationalized in these institutions. Based on this idea, the QualEnv (quality and environment) consortium of universities stands out for having as its main objective the increase in contribution to sustainable development (SD) by universities through the implementation of systematic environmental practices and quality processes in line with the SDGs. The objective of this article is to present how the QualEnv consortium of HEIs adopts the SDGs and demonstrates their contribution to SD. For this purpose, a qualitative analysis was performed based on documentary research, a systematic review of the literature, and notes collected from participant observations. The results show that the adoption of the SDGs in the QualEnv consortium was enhanced by the contribution of the social relations within the partnership, which promoted the exchange of experiences and synergy between participants that promoted improvements in the necessary strategies. Along with the highlighted actions and concentration of different axes with dispersed interventions, a potential for central cohesion and focus on evolution in each SDG was noted. The adoption of the same indicators involves the unification of the actions planned for the SD and the common objective of involving communities more consistently, which impacts mainly SDG 04. This article discusses the practical implications in HEIs and the need to integrate the SDGs into their activities, as it demonstrates how universities belonging to the QualEnv consortium have been creating their own strategies to achieve the 2030 agenda and adopt the SDGs.","The authors would like to acknowledge support from the European Commission, Education Audiovisual and Culture Executive Agency, Erasmus+, in the context of the Qualenv Project: Change the Climate: Assuring the Quality of Environmental Strategies in Latin-American Higher Education—Project 609863-EPP-1-2019-1-PT-EPPKA2-CBHE-JP.

When presenting a high ISQG value, but low PEL, they partially comply with the regulations, which happens with samples SED-1, 2, and 8 for As and SED-5, 6, and 7 for Pb. On the contrary, Cr and Cu do not comply with what is established in samples SED-8 and SED-1 and 8, respectively, whereas, in samples SED-2 and 5, Cu partially complies with the established regulations. The values found for the trace elements present in the abandoned traditional mining area with abundant epithermal deposits prevail over time in soil, water, and sediments.","Acknowledgements The authors would like to thank the Universidad Politécnica de Madrid for their assistance in sampling and data collection in the field, as well as for permitting the access to and use of their laboratories for the analysis and experimental part of this article.

In an attempt to mitigate this emerging infectious disease and provide candidates for marker-assisted selective breeding, we tested here the existence of a genetic component of Argopecten purpuratus scallop resistance to the pathogen Vibrio bivalvicida. Through a dual RNA-seq approach we analyzed the basal transcriptome and the transcriptional response to infection in two resistant and two susceptible families as well as the pathogen transcriptomic response to host colonization. The results highlighted a genetic basis in the resistance of scallop larvae to the pathogen. The Vibrio response was characterized by a general metabolic adaptation to the host environment, along with several predicted virulence factors overexpressed in infected scallop larvae with no difference between resistant and susceptible host phenotypes. On the host side, several biological processes were enriched in uninfected resistant larvae. Within these enriched categories, immune-related processes were overexpressed, while morphogenesis, biomineral tissue development, and angiogenesis were under expressed. Particularly, genes involved in immune recognition and antimicrobial response, such as lipopolysaccharide-binding proteins (LBPs), lysozyme, and bactericidal permeability-increasing protein (BPI) were overexpressed in uninfected resistant larvae. As expected, immune-related biological processes were enriched in Vibrio-infected larvae, but they were more numerous in resistant larvae. Overexpressed immune genes in response to infection included several Toll-like receptors, TNF and NF-κB immune signaling genes, and the antimicrobial peptide Big defensin ApBD1. Results strongly suggest that both a front-loading of immune genes and an enhanced antimicrobial response to infection contribute to the resistance, while pathogen infective strategy does not discriminate between host phenotypes. Overall, early expression of host immune genes appears as a strong determinant of the disease outcome that could be used in marker-assisted selective breeding.",We gratefully acknowledge Claudia Ojeda for technical assistance and Daniel Aguilera from Laboratorio Central de Cultivos Marinos from UCN for scallop procurement and maintenance.,"This study was supported by the Chilean National Fund for Scientific and Technological Development, FONDECYT #1200129 to PS, RR, RF, and KB.

The identification of the problem arose from the empirical analysis, where serious deficiencies in the manual handling and management of the stock of medicines and hospital supplies were evidenced. This deficiency does not allow a timely response to the demand of the logistics and supply chain, causing stock ruptures in health centers. Based on this finding, we asked ourselves how AI was observed as the most efficient tool to solve this difficulty. The results were obtained through surveys of personnel in charge of hospital and pharmacy supplies. The questions focused on the level of training, seniority in positions related to the problem, knowledge of regulations, degree of innovation in the procedures used in logistics and supply chain and procurement. However, a very striking fact was related to the importance of the use of AI, where, very surprisingly, 64.7% considered that it would not help to reduce human errors generated in the areas analyzed.",,This research received no external funding.,International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health,,"Devidas Menon, Tania Stafinski",Humans; Artificial Intelligence; Chile; Health Facilities; Fitness Centers; Pharmaceutical Services,2023-03-09,2023,2023-03-09,,20,6,4839,All OA; Gold,Article,"Bas, Tomas Gabriel; Astudillo, Paula; Rojo, Daniel; Trigo, Angel","Bas, Tomas Gabriel (Escuela de Ciencias Empresariales, Universidad Católica del Norte, Coquimbo 1780000, Chile.); Astudillo, Paula (Escuela de Ciencias Empresariales, Universidad Católica del Norte, Coquimbo 1780000, Chile.); Rojo, Daniel (Escuela de Ciencias Empresariales, Universidad Católica del Norte, Coquimbo 1780000, Chile.); Trigo, Angel (Escuela de Ciencias Empresariales, Universidad Católica del Norte, Coquimbo 1780000, Chile.)","Bas, Tomas Gabriel (Catholic University of the North)","Bas, Tomas Gabriel (Catholic University of the North); Astudillo, Paula (Catholic University of the North); Rojo, Daniel (Catholic University of the North); Trigo, Angel (Catholic University of the North)",5,5,,,https://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/20/6/4839/pdf?version=1678359017,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1156118759,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3509 Transportation, Logistics and Supply Chains; 46 Information and Computing Sciences",12 Responsible Consumption and Production

However, SNS are not without the access gap among elders. Assuming that the data are homogenous within the same population may not be precise in social science research. What is known about the heterogeneous nature of older people? Considering this issue and the lack of research to help reflect the heterogeneity of elderly users of technologies, this study aims to identify segments in the use of SNS by the elderly. Data were collected from older Chilean adults. Cluster analysis suggested different profiles of adult users regarding the Technology Readiness Index. We used a hybrid multigroup partial least squares-structural equation model, including the Pathmox algorithm, to identify segments in the structural model. Based on the technology readiness profiles and the generation, we identified three segments with different determinant effects to explain the intention to use SNS: independent elder, technological-apathetic elder, and technological-eager elder. The contributions from this study are triple. First, this study helps to better understand how the elderly adopt information technology. Second, this study complements the existing corpus of research on using the technology readiness index in the elderly population. Third, we used an innovative method to segment users in the acceptance technology model.",,"This work was funded by ANID/ FONDECYT Regular 1210130.

Outcomes, including changes in insulin sensitivity, weight, body mass index (BMI), waist circumference, and body fat, were analyzed.
Methods: A systematic literature review was conducted. This review is registered in the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO) under the number CRD42021281899. Clinical trials involving individuals who are overweight and obese and comparing HIIT with MICT effects on insulin sensitivity, weight, BMI, body fat percentage, and waist circumference were included. PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, and Scopus databases were searched using controlled vocabulary and free-text terms related to HIIT, obesity, and overweight. The search included studies published until September 2022. The Rob2 tool was used to assess the risk of bias. The results were presented through meta-analyses that provided summary estimators and confidence intervals. Subgroup analyses were conducted to assess the effect of the risk of bias on the outcomes. This research did not receive any specific funding.
Results: Of the 2534 articles, 30 met the eligibility criteria. The intervention duration ranged from 4 to 16 weeks. The observed effects for each outcome were as follows: insulin sensitivity (p = 0.02), weight (p = 0.58), BMI (p = 0.53), waist circumference (p = 0.87), body fat percentage (p = 0.07), body fat mass in kilograms (p = 0.39). The level of evidence obtained was moderate except for waist circumference, which was rated as low. Limitations included heterogeneity in training protocols, measurements, and study duration. Additionally, a risk of bias was identified in these studies.
Conclusion: HIIT and MICT did not significantly differ in their effects on weight, BMI, waist circumference, or body fat mass in adults with overweight and obesity. However, a moderate beneficial effect of HIIT was observed on insulin sensitivity. Therefore, further evidence is required to confirm these findings.",Declaration of competing interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.,"This research did not receive any specific grant from funding agencies in the public, commercial, or not-for-profit sectors.",Heliyon,,,,2023-09-23,2023,2023-09-23,2023-10,9,10,e20402,All OA; Gold,Article,"Sanca-Valeriano, Silvia; Espinola-Sánchez, Marcos; Caballero-Alvarado, José; Canelo-Aybar, Carlos","Sanca-Valeriano, Silvia (Escuela de Medicina, Universidad César Vallejo, Peru); Espinola-Sánchez, Marcos (Facultad de Ciencias de la Salud, Universidad Privada del Norte, Peru); Caballero-Alvarado, José (Facultad de Medicina Humana, Universidad Privada Antenor Orrego, Peru); Canelo-Aybar, Carlos (Iberoamerican Cochrane Centre, Biomedical Research Institute Sant Pau (IIB Sant Pau), Spain)","Sanca-Valeriano, Silvia (Universidad César Vallejo)","Sanca-Valeriano, Silvia (Universidad César Vallejo); Espinola-Sánchez, Marcos (Private University of the North); Caballero-Alvarado, José (Antenor Orrego Private University); Canelo-Aybar, Carlos (Hospital de Sant Pau)",5,5,,,http://www.cell.com/article/S2405844023076107/pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1164286776,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3202 Clinical Sciences; 3210 Nutrition and Dietetics; 42 Health Sciences; 4206 Public Health,

Strains of the two species differ in their toxin profiles and impacts on shellfish resources. D. acuta is considered the major cause of diarrhetic shellfish poisoning (DSP) outbreaks in Southern Chile, but there is uncertainty about the toxicity of D. acuminata, and little information on microscale oceanographic conditions promoting their blooms. During the austral summer of 2020, intensive sampling was carried out in two northern Patagonian fjords, Puyuhuapi (PUY) and Pitipalena (PIT), sharing D. acuminata dominance and D. acuta near detection levels. Dinophysistoxin 1 (DTX 1) and pectenotoxin 2 (PTX 2) were present in all net tow samples but OA was not detected. Although differing in hydrodynamics and sampling dates, D. acuminata shared behavioural traits in the two fjords: cell maxima (>103 cells L-1) in the interface (S ~ 21) between the estuarine freshwater (EFW)) and saline water (ESW) layers; and phased-cell division (µ = 0.3-0.4 d-1) peaking after dawn, and abundance of ciliate prey. Niche analysis (Outlying Mean Index, OMI) of D. acuta with a high marginality and much lower tolerance than D. acuminata indicated an unfavourable physical environment for D. acuta (bloom failure). Comparison of toxin profiles and Dinophysis niches in three contrasting years in PUY-2020 (D. acuminata bloom), 2018 (exceptional bloom of D. acuta), and 2019 (bloom co-occurrence of the two species)-shed light on the vertical gradients which promote each species. The presence of FW (S < 11) and thermal inversion may be used to provide short-term forecasts of no risk of D. acuta blooms and OA occurrence, but D. acuminata associated with DTX 1 pose a risk of DSP events in North Patagonian fjords.",,"This work was funded by ANID-FONDECYT 11170682 from the National Agency of Research and Development (ANID), Chile, and by projects REDES170101 and REDI170575 from ANID International Cooperation Programme.

In the open ocean, this is where marine organisms, ranging from plankton to mesopelagic fish up to megafauna, gather and where most fishing activities concentrate. Fronts are critical ecosystems so that understanding their spatio-temporal variability is essential not only for conservation goals but also to ensure sustainable fisheries. The Mozambique Channel (MC) is an ideal laboratory to study ocean front variability due to its energetic flow at sub-to-mesoscales, its high biodiversity and the currently debated conservation initiatives. Meanwhile, fronts detection relying solely on remotely-sensed Sea Surface Temperature (SST) cannot access aspects of the subsurface frontal activity that may be relevant for understanding ecosystem dynamics. In this study, we used the Belkin and O’Reilly Algorithm on remotely-sensed SST and hindcasts of a high-resolution nested ocean model to investigate the spatial and seasonal variability of temperature fronts at different depths in the MC. We find that the seasonally varying spatial patterns of frontal activity can be interpreted as resulting from main features of the mean circulation in the MC region. In particular, horizontally, temperature fronts are intense and frequent along continental shelves, in islands’ wakes, at the edge of eddies, and in the pathways of both North-East Madagascar Current (NEMC) and South-East Madagascar Current (SEMC). In austral summer, thermal fronts in the MC are mainly associated with the Angoche upwelling and seasonal variability of the Mozambique current. In austral winter, thermal fronts in the MC are more intense when the NEMC and the Seychelles-Chagos and South Madagascar upwelling cells intensify. Vertically, the intensity of temperature fronts peaks in the vicinity of the mean thermocline. Considering the marked seasonality of frontal activity evidenced here and the dynamical connections of the MC circulation with equatorial variability, our study calls for addressing longer timescales of variability to investigate how ocean ecosystem/front interactions will evolve with climate change.",This work was supported by the Mediterranean Institute of Oceanography (MIO) and the French National Institute for Sustainable Development (IRD).

In the first class of theories, we show that by choosing particular models with a shift-symmetric friction term we are able to alleviate the tension by obtaining a smaller effective Newton’s constant at intermediate times, a feature that cannot be easily obtained in modified gravity. In the second class of theories, which involve two extra propagating degrees of freedom, we show that the H0 tension can be alleviated, and the mechanism behind this is the phantom behavior of the effective dark-energy equation-of-state parameter.

Recognizing network anomalies that may point to malicious activity or system flaws is a major issue. Traditional anomalous identification methods frequently need to catch up when dealing with the special traits of IoT environments, including resource limitations and changing network behavior. This paper introduces an innovative approach, the Bat-optimized CNN-BiLSTM model, to enhance the security and efficiency of IoT environments. This model combines the strengths of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for spatial analysis and Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) networks for capturing temporal patterns, thus effectively representing time and space trends in IoT data. To optimize its performance further, researchers have leveraged the Bat algorithm, inspired by natural behaviors, to fine-tune the model. This program effectively searches for the best network anomaly detection parameters by imitating the echo activity of bats. Researchers want to increase detection accuracy by lowering false positives and false negatives using the Bat algorithm to enhance the CNN-BiLSTM model. The experimental findings show that the Bat-optimised CNN-BiLSTM model beats the state-of-the-art anomaly detection methods with 99.43% accuracy and efficiency.",Declaration of Competing Interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.,,Alexandria Engineering Journal,,,,2023-12,2023,,2023-12,84,,333-342,All OA; Gold,Article,"Antonius, Franciskus; Sekhar, J.C.; Rao, Vuda Sreenivasa; Pradhan, Rahul; Narendran, S.; Borda, Ricardo Fernando Cosio; Silvera-Arcos, Susan","Antonius, Franciskus (School of Business and Information Technology STMIK LIKMI, Bandung Indonesia); Sekhar, J.C.

The controller is based on the sliding mode and internal model control concepts. The proposed DSMC has an internal P/PD controller to provide systems with disturbance rejection. An identification method approximates the open-loop unstable nonlinear process to a first-order delayed unstable process (FODUP). The reduced-order model(FODUP) is used to synthesize the new controller. The performance of the controller is stable and satisfactory despite nonlinearities in the operating conditions due to set-point and process disturbance changes. In addition, the performance analysis of the control schemes was evaluated based on various indices and transient characteristics, including the integral of squared error (ISE), the total variation of control effort (TVu), the maximum overshoot (Mp), and the settling time (ts). Finally, the process output and the control action for all controllers are compared using the nonlinear process as the real plant.","The authors thank the USFQ Advanced Control Systems Research Group, Quito, Ecuador.","This research was supported by the Colegio de Ciencias e Ingenieras, Universidad San Francisco de Quito USFQ, through the Poli-Grants Program under Grant 17965.",ChemEngineering,,,,2023-06-02,2023,2023-06-02,,7,3,53,All OA; Gold,Article,"Camacho, Christian; Alvarez, Hernan; Espin, Jorge; Camacho, Oscar","Camacho, Christian (Departamento de Ingeniería de Sistemas y Computación, Universidad Católica del Norte, Antofagasta 1270709, Chile); Alvarez, Hernan (Departamento de Procesos y Energía, Universidad Nacional de Colombia, Medellín 050041, Colombia); Espin, Jorge (School of Aerospace and Mechanical Engineering, The University of Oklahoma, Norman, OK 73019, USA); Camacho, Oscar (Colegio de Ciencias e Ingenierias, Universidad San Francisco de Quito USFQ, Quito 170157, Ecuador)","Camacho, Oscar (Universidad San Francisco de Quito)","Camacho, Christian (Catholic University of the North); Alvarez, Hernan (National University of Colombia); Espin, Jorge (University of Oklahoma); Camacho, Oscar (Universidad San Francisco de Quito)",5,5,,,https://www.mdpi.com/2305-7084/7/3/53/pdf?version=1685684383,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1158592677,"40 Engineering; 4007 Control Engineering, Mechatronics and Robotics; 4010 Engineering Practice and Education; 49 Mathematical Sciences; 4901 Applied Mathematics",

As a result, it is necessary for an eco-friendly and sustainable alternative to managing this type of waste. Therefore, the research aimed to investigate lettuce waste as an alternative substrate to generate bioelectricity in single-chamber microbial fuel cells (scMFCs). It was possible to report voltage and electric current peaks of 0.959 ± 0.026 V and 5.697 ± 0.065 mA on the fourteenth day, values that were attained with an optimum pH of 7.867 ± 0.147 and with an electrical conductivity of 118.964 ± 8.888 mS/cm. Moreover, as time passed the values began to decline slowly. The calculated value of maximum power density was 378.145 ± 5.417 mW/cm2 whose current density was 5.965 A/cm2, while the internal resistance reported using Ohm’s Law was 87.594 ± 6.226 Ω. Finally, it was possible to identify the Stenotrophomonas maltophilia bacterium (99.59%) on a molecular scale, as one of the microorganisms present in the anodic biofilm. The three microbial fuel cells were connected in series and demonstrated that they were capable of lighting an LED bulb, with a voltage of 2.18 V.",,This research received no external funding.,Sustainability,,,,2023-06-30,2023,2023-06-30,,15,13,10339,All OA; Gold,Article,"Rojas-Villacorta, Walter; Rojas-Flores, Segundo; Benites, Santiago M.; Nazario-Naveda, Renny; Romero, Cecilia V.; Gallozzo-Cardenas, Moisés; Delfín-Narciso, Daniel; Díaz, Félix; Murga-Torres, Emzon","Rojas-Villacorta, Walter (Programa de Investigación Formativa e Integridad Científica, Universidad César Vallejo, Trujillo 13001, Peru;, wrojasv@ucv.edu.pe); Rojas-Flores, Segundo (Vicerrectorado de Investigación, Universidad Autónoma del Perú, Lima 15842, Peru;, santiago.benites@autonoma.pe, (S.M.B.);, renny.nazario@autonoma.pe, (R.N.-N.)); Benites, Santiago M.

The primary objective of this study was to develop a novel biogenic synthesis method for titanium dioxide (TiO2) nanoparticles using an aqueous extract of Annona muricata L. as a stabilizing and organic reducing agent. Furthermore, our aim included a comprehensive exploration of the structural, morphological, and optical properties of these nanostructures. The methodology employed in this project was grounded in the biogenic synthesis of TiO2, utilizing the aforementioned extract as a key component. We conducted a comprehensive characterization approach to unravel the formation mechanism and validate the morphology and crystalline structure of the nanomaterial. We successfully synthesized nanoparticles with spherical morphology and an average diameter of 13.41 nm, characterized by their remarkable uniformity and high-quality crystalline structure. Additionally, we assessed the applicability of these nanoparticles in photocatalysis processes aimed at the degradation of organic dyes. Our findings indicated efficient initial activity in the kinetics of methylene blue dye degradation, with a reduction of 59.25 % within the first 30 min of exposure.","Declaration of competing interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

With the definition of the Agenda 2030 and the role of cities in achieving sustainable development goals, much work has been devoted to the definition of evaluation frameworks and indicators to assess policies and plans and support decision-making in the transition to sustainable urban environments. Therefore, there is currently a wide range of indicator frameworks for the sustainability assessment of human settlements. However, considering the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the urban sustainability paradigm, the need to reassess the relevance of existing assessment frameworks in the post-pandemic context has been highlighted. Thus, this article aims to illustrate a selection of indicators to evaluate urban sustainability in developing countries’ post-pandemic contexts, using Colombia as a case study. This work comprises the characterization of the post-pandemic relevance of a set of sustainability indicators through the participation of stakeholders associated with the development process of social housing in urban environments in Colombia. Within a Delphi process, the initial indicators were taken from local and international sustainability frameworks validated before the pandemic. Further, a final selection was made through the evaluation of a survey from a sample of 45 stakeholders, and different participatory mechanisms with experts. These results acknowledged the relevance of factors, such as atmospheric conditions, risk management, the performance of public transport systems, and the availability and accessibility to key services, in the achievement of urban sustainability. These results will support the sustainability assessment of the development of post-pandemic recovery policies in Colombia and serve as a reference for other contexts in developing countries.",,This research received no external funding.,Sustainability,,,,2023-02-03,2023,2023-02-03,,15,3,2830,All OA; Gold,Article,"Escorcia Hernández, Jhon Ricardo; Torabi Moghadam, Sara; Lombardi, Patrizia","Escorcia Hernández, Jhon Ricardo (Interuniversity Department of Regional and Urban Studies and Planning, Politecnico di Torino, 10125 Torino, Italy); Torabi Moghadam, Sara (Interuniversity Department of Regional and Urban Studies and Planning, Politecnico di Torino, 10125 Torino, Italy); Lombardi, Patrizia (Interuniversity Department of Regional and Urban Studies and Planning, Politecnico di Torino, 10125 Torino, Italy)","Escorcia Hernández, Jhon Ricardo (Polytechnic University of Turin)","Escorcia Hernández, Jhon Ricardo (Polytechnic University of Turin); Torabi Moghadam, Sara (Polytechnic University of Turin); Lombardi, Patrizia (Polytechnic University of Turin)",5,5,,,https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/15/3/2830/pdf?version=1675840618,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1155172873,41 Environmental Sciences; 4104 Environmental Management; 44 Human Society; 4406 Human Geography,11 Sustainable Cities and Communities
169,pub.1157388012,10.3389/feart.2023.1114001,,,Evolution of the magmatic-hydrothermal system at Lastarria volcano (Northern Chile) between 2006 and 2019: Insights from fluid geochemistry,"One of the major problems in the volcanic surveillance is how data from several techniques can be correlated and used to discriminate between possible precursors of volcanic eruptions and changes related to non-eruptive processes. Gas chemical surveys and measurements of SO2 emission rates performed in the past (2006–2019) at Lastarria volcano in Northern Chile have revealed a persistent increment of magmatic sourced gas emissions since late November 2012, following a 13 years period of intense ground uplift. In this work, we provide new insights into the gas-chemical evolution of Lastarria’s fumarolic discharges obtained from direct sampling (2006–2019) and SO2 emission rates using UV camera and DOAS instruments (2018–2019) and link these to pre-existing information on ground deformation (1998–2016) in order to determine the origin of observed degassing and ground deformation processes. We revise the four mechanisms originally proposed as alternatives by Lopez et al. (Geosphere, 2018, 14 (3), 983–1007) to explain the changes observed in the fluid geochemistry and ground deformation between 2009 and 2012, in order to explain major changes in gas-geochemistry over an extended period between 1998 and 2019. We hypothesize that a continuous sequence of processes explains the evolution in the fluid geochemistry of fumarolic discharges. Two mechanisms are responsible of the changes in the gas composition during the studied period, corresponding to a 1) deep magma chamber (7–15 km depth) pressurized by volatile exsolution (1998–2020), which is responsible of the large-scale deformation; followed by 2) a crystallization-induced degassing (2001–2020) and pressurization of the hydrothermal system (2003-early November 2012), where the former process induced the changes in the gas composition from hydrothermal-dominated to magmatic-dominated, whereas the last produced the small-scale deformation at Lastarria volcano. The changes in the gas composition since late November 2012, which were strongly dominated by magmatic volatiles, produced two consecutive processes: 1) acidification (late November 2012–2020) and 2) depletion (2019–2020) of the hydrothermal system. In this work we have shown that a long-term surveillance of the chemistry of fluid discharges provides valuable insights into underlying magmatic/volcanic processes, and consequently, for forecasting future eruptions.",,"SL was funded by Beca Doctorado Nacional ANID-PCHA/ Doctorado Nacional/21160276 (Agencia Nacional de Investigación y Desarrollo-ANID).

150,pub.1160390594,10.3847/1538-4357/acd4bd,,,Stellar Characterization and Radius Inflation of Hyades M-dwarf Stars from the APOGEE Survey,"We present a spectroscopic analysis of a sample of 48 M-dwarf stars (0.2 M ⊙ < M < 0.6 M ⊙) from the Hyades open cluster using high-resolution H-band spectra from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey/Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment (APOGEE) survey. Our methodology adopts spectrum synthesis with LTE MARCS model atmospheres, along with the APOGEE Data Release 17 line list, to determine effective temperatures, surface gravities, metallicities, and projected rotational velocities. The median metallicity obtained for the Hyades M dwarfs is [M/H] = 0.09 ± 0.03 dex, indicating a small internal uncertainty and good agreement with optical results for Hyades red giants. Overall, the median radii are larger than predicted by stellar models by 1.6% ± 2.3% and 2.4% ± 2.3%, relative to a MIST and DARTMOUTH isochrone, respectively. We emphasize, however, that these isochrones are different, and the fractional radius inflation for the fully and partially convective regimes have distinct behaviors depending on the isochrone. Using a MIST isochrone there is no evidence of radius inflation for the fully convective stars, while for the partially convective M dwarfs the radii are inflated by 2.7% ± 2.1%, which is in agreement with predictions from models that include magnetic fields. For the partially convective stars, rapid rotators present on average higher inflation levels than slow rotators. The comparison with SPOTS isochrone models indicates that the derived M-dwarf radii can be explained by accounting for stellar spots in the photosphere of the stars, with 76% of the studied M dwarfs having up to 20% spot coverage, and the most inflated stars with ∼20%–40% spot coverage.","We thank the referee for comments that improved the paper significantly.

In this context, the result of this review will allow for breaking down the barriers of reductionist silos of knowledge and fostering a multidisciplinary and interdisciplinary dialogue.",This work was supported by the Universidad Católica del Norte (Chile).,,Complexity,,Saikou Diallo,,2023-02-24,2023,,2023-02-24,2023,,1-22,All OA; Gold,Article,"Alvarez, Jorge Tabilo; Ramírez-Correa, Patricio","Alvarez, Jorge Tabilo (Universidad Católica del Norte, Department of Industrial Engineering, Antofagasta 1270709, Chile, ucn.cl); Ramírez-Correa, Patricio (Universidad Católica del Norte, School of Engineering, Coquimbo 1781421, Chile, ucn.cl)","Alvarez, Jorge Tabilo (Catholic University of the North)","Alvarez, Jorge Tabilo (Catholic University of the North); Ramírez-Correa, Patricio (Catholic University of the North)",5,5,,,https://downloads.hindawi.com/journals/complexity/2023/8205320.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1155720477,46 Information and Computing Sciences; 49 Mathematical Sciences,

However, micro-learning has become popular in e-Learning environments as a course design technique due to short attention spans, demand for small chunks of information, and time constraints. Hence, it has been selected for creating reading mobile applications provided to the nature of its learning approach. In order to describe the multiple iterations of design, development, and evaluation of this general framework, a methodology named Design-Based Research (DBR) is implemented. First, the article presents the abstract framework components and a cloud-based software architecture that allows a modular approach to creating such applications. The pathway developed through adapting the iPAC framework, which involves personalization, authenticity, and collaboration, is part of the methodology used to design the app under pedagogical and technological considerations. The process demanded the following phases: analysis and exploration, design and construction, evaluation and reflection, redesign and reconstruction, and final critical reflections. Four applied instruments also validate the framework implementation: The iPAC Rubric, an aphorisms checklist, a pre and post-test, a focus group, and a usability test taken by 28 students in a private university in Colombia. Findings indicated that Design-Based Research (DBR) methodology emerged as an appropriate tool to encounter the needs behind reading applications design due to its sequence of operations yields results successively closer to adequate usability standards and smooth implementation. They also reveal the positive impact of new types of texts on students' motivation and awareness toward other reading strategies and micro-learning. This impact indeed proved the proposed framework's effectiveness for designing micro-learning applications.",,"This work was supported by the Ministry of Sciences of Colombia (MinCiencias).

The catalytic tests were carried out in a MAT-type reactor under typical conditions. The zeolites were subjected to alkaline treatment with NaOH at concentrations ranging from 0.05 to 0.4 mol/L, resulting in the creation of several samples (Z-0.05, Z-0.10, Z-0.20, Z-0.30 and Z-0.40) that were then hydrothermally stabilized (Z-0.05-M, Z-0.10-M, Z-0.20-M, Z-0.30-M and Z-0.40-M) to increase mesoporosity and reduced crystallinity. The increase in mesoporosity was accompanied by an improvement in acidity. Despite Z-0.30-M having higher acidity, Z-0.00-M and Z-0.10-M exhibited the highest activity due to their high crystallinity and microporosity, yielding the highest gas yields. Gasoline was the main product, with maximum yields exceeding 30%. Z-0.20-M produced more aromatic and olefin compounds than the others, resulting in higher quality gasoline. Coke formation followed the trend: Z-0.00-M < Z-0.10-M < Z-0.20-M < Z-0.30-M. The higher intracrystalline mesoporosity in the zeolites favored the formation of a more condensed coke.","Declaration of competing interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

This creates an urgent need to know the families of inhibitors and their concentration levels. This article uses ethylene green to synthesize an ethylene-propylene copolymer. It describes the impact of trace impurities of furan in ethylene green and how this furan influences the loss of properties such as thermal and mechanical properties of the random copolymer. For the development of the investigation, 12 runs were carried out, each in triplicate. The results show an evident influence of furan on the productivity of the Ziegler-Natta catalyst (ZN); productivity losses of 10, 20, and 41% were obtained for the copolymers synthesized with ethylene rich in 6, 12, and 25 ppm of furan, respectively. PP0 (without furan) did not present losses. Likewise, as the concentration of furan increased, it was observed that the melt flow index (MFI), thermal (TGA), and mechanical properties (tensile, bending, and impact) decreased significantly. Therefore, it can be affirmed that furan should be a substance to be controlled in the purification processes of green ethylene.",We acknowledge Dalila Fernandez Viloria.,This research received no external funding.,Polymers,,Cristina Cazan,,2023-05-11,2023,2023-05-11,,15,10,2264,All OA; Gold,Article,"Hernández-Fernández, Joaquín; Puello-Polo, Esneyder; Márquez, Edgar","Hernández-Fernández, Joaquín (Chemistry Program, Department of Natural and Exact Sciences, San Pablo Campus, University of Cartagena, Cartagena 130015, Colombia.; Chemical Engineering Program, School of Engineering, Universidad Tecnológica de Bolivar, Parque Industrial y Tecnológico Carlos Vélez Pombo Km 1 Vía Turbaco, Cartagena 130001, Colombia.; Department of Natural and Exact Science, Universidad de la Costa, Barranquilla 080002, Colombia.); Puello-Polo, Esneyder (Group de Investigación en Oxi/Hidrotratamiento Catalítico Y Nuevos Materiales, Programa de Química-Ciencias Básicas, Universidad del Atlántico, Puerto Colombia 081001, Colombia.); Márquez, Edgar (Grupo de Investigaciones en Química Y Biología, Departamento de Química Y Biología, Facultad de Ciencias Básicas, Universidad del Norte, Carrera 51B, Km 5, Vía Puerto Colombia, Barranquilla 081007, Colombia.)","Hernández-Fernández, Joaquín (University of Cartagena; Universidad Tecnológica de Bolívar; University of the Coast); Márquez, Edgar (Universidad del Norte)","Hernández-Fernández, Joaquín (University of Cartagena; Universidad Tecnológica de Bolívar; University of the Coast); Puello-Polo, Esneyder (University of Atlántico); Márquez, Edgar (Universidad del Norte)",4,4,,,https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4360/15/10/2264/pdf?version=1683779604,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1157965416,34 Chemical Sciences; 3403 Macromolecular and Materials Chemistry,

The data may include sensitive information such as family information, medical records, personal habits, or financial records that, if leaked, can generate problems. For this reason, this paper aims to introduce a protocol for training Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) neural networks via combining federated learning and homomorphic encryption, where the data are distributed in multiple clients, and the data privacy is preserved. This proposal was validated by running several simulations using a dataset for a multi-class classification problem, different MLP neural network architectures, and different numbers of participating clients. The results are shown for several metrics in the local and federated settings, and a comparative analysis is carried out. Additionally, the privacy guarantees of the proposal are formally analyzed under a set of defined assumptions, and the added value of the proposed protocol is identified compared with previous works in the same area of knowledge.",,This research received no external funding and the APC was funded by Universidad de Norte.,Sensors,,"Stefano Giordano, Periklis Chatzimisios, Mike Oluwatayo Ojo",,2023-02-09,2023,2023-02-09,,23,4,1966,All OA; Gold,Article,"Angulo, Eduardo; Márquez, José; Villanueva-Polanco, Ricardo","Angulo, Eduardo (Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla 081007, Colombia.); Márquez, José (Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla 081007, Colombia.); Villanueva-Polanco, Ricardo (Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla 081007, Colombia.)","Villanueva-Polanco, Ricardo (Universidad del Norte)","Angulo, Eduardo (Universidad del Norte); Márquez, José (Universidad del Norte); Villanueva-Polanco, Ricardo (Universidad del Norte)",4,4,,,https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/23/4/1966/pdf?version=1676957891,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1155322626,46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4604 Cybersecurity and Privacy; 4611 Machine Learning,

For the determination and analysis of Irgafos P-168, DSC, HPLC-MS, and FTIR methodologies were used. Solid phase extraction (SPE) proved to be the best technique for extracting Irgafos from wastewater. HPLC-MS and SPE determined the repeatability, reproducibility, and linearity of the method and the SPE of the standards and samples. The relative standard deviations, errors, and correlation coefficients for the repeatability and reproducibility of the calibration curves were less than 4.4% and 4.2% and greater than 0.99955, respectively. The analysis of variance (ANOVA), using the Fisher method with confidence in 95% of the data, did not reveal significant differences between the mentioned parameters. The removal of the antioxidant from the wastewater by SPE showed recovery percentages higher than 91.03%, and the chemical characterization of this antioxidant by FTIR spectroscopy, DSC, TGA, and MS showed it to be structurally the same as the Irgafos P-168 molecule. The recovered Irgafos was added to the polypropylene matrix, significantly improving its oxidation times. An OIT analysis, performed using DSC, showed that the recovered Irgafos-blended polypropylene (PP) demonstrated oxidative degradation at 8 min. With the addition of the Irgafos, the oxidation time was 13 min. This increases the polypropylene's useful life and minimizes the environmental impact of the wastewater.",,This research received no external funding.,Molecules,,Mohamad Nasir Mohamad Ibrahim,,2023-04-02,2023,2023-04-02,,28,7,3163,All OA; Gold,Article,"Hernández-Fernández, Joaquín; Cano, Heidis; Reyes, Ana Fonseca","Hernández-Fernández, Joaquín (Chemistry Program, Department of Natural and Exact Sciences, San Pablo Campus, University of Cartagena, Cartagena 130015, Colombia.; Chemical Engineering Program, School of Engineering, Universidad Tecnológica de Bolivar, Parque Industrial y Tecnológico Carlos Vélez Pombo, Km 1 Vía Turbaco, Turbaco 130001, Colombia.; Department of Natural and Exact Science, Universidad de la Costa, Barranquilla 30300, Colombia.); Cano, Heidis (Department of Civil and Environmental, Universidad de la Costa, Barranquilla 080002, Colombia.); Reyes, Ana Fonseca (Department of Mechanical Engineering, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla 081007, Colombia.)","Hernández-Fernández, Joaquín (University of Cartagena; Universidad Tecnológica de Bolívar; University of the Coast); Reyes, Ana Fonseca (Universidad del Norte)","Hernández-Fernández, Joaquín (University of Cartagena; Universidad Tecnológica de Bolívar; University of the Coast); Cano, Heidis (University of the Coast); Reyes, Ana Fonseca (Universidad del Norte)",4,4,,,https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/28/7/3163/pdf?version=1680427127,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1156943796,34 Chemical Sciences; 3404 Medicinal and Biomolecular Chemistry; 3405 Organic Chemistry,

This approach pivoted on the incorporation of byproducts, with a spotlight on ground glass powder (GP) as a pivotal supplementary cementitious material (SCM). Our goal was twofold: engineering cost-efficient concrete while maintaining environmental integrity. The derived RPC showcased robust mechanical strength and impressive workability. Rigorous evaluations, containing attributes like compressive strength, resistance to chloride ion penetration, ultrasonic pulse speed, and drying shrinkage, highlighted its merits. Notably, the optimized RPC, despite an insignificant decrease in compressive strength at 90 days compared to its traditional counterpart, maintained steady strength augmentation over time. The refinement process culminated in a notable 29% reduction in ordinary Portland cement (OPC) usage and a significant 64% decrease in silica fume (SF), with the optimized mix composition being 590 for cement, 100 for SF, 335 for GP, and 257 kg/m3 for calcium carbonate. Additionally, the optimized RPC stood out due to the enhanced rheological behavior, influenced by the lubricative properties of calcium carbonate and the water conservation features of the glass powder. The reactive properties of SF, combined with GP, brought distinct performance variations, most evident at 28 days. Yet, both mixtures exhibited superior resistance to chloride, deeming them ideal for rigorous settings like coastal regions. Significantly, the RPC iteration, enriched with selective mineral admixtures, displayed a reduced tendency for drying-induced shrinkage, mitigating potential crack emergence.","The authors extend their appreciation to Researcher Supporting Project number (RSPD2023R692), King Saud University, Riyadh, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.

Here we investigated the motives that underlie support for COVID-19 preventive behaviours in a sample of 12,758 individuals from 34 countries. We hypothesized that the associations of empathic prosocial concern and fear of disease with support towards preventive COVID-19 behaviours would be moderated by trust in the government. Results suggest that the association between fear of disease and support for COVID-19 preventive behaviours was strongest when trust in the government was weak (both at individual- and country-level). Conversely, the association with empathic prosocial concern was strongest when trust in the government was high, but this moderation was only found at individual-level scores of governmental trust. We discuss how motivations may be shaped by socio-cultural context, and outline how findings may contribute to a better understanding of collective action during global crises.","We would like to thank Valentina Romo, Jallene Jia En Chua, Melis Yetkin, Emren Burak Ömür, Miguel Landa Blanco, Christine Kraus, Raymond Langley, Youmna Haddad, Abida Sultana, Sadiya Alam Surma, Nishat Tamanna Omi, Asmaul Husna Chara, Monir Hossen, Mohima Akter, Nargees Akter, Khondoker Shahriar Islam, Md Johirul Islam, Joti Saha, Sk.Sabbir Islam Mahi, Tayeba Sultana Sonia, Md.

We evaluated tofacitinib efficacy and safety in the 52-week maintenance study, OCTAVE Sustain, by baseline Mayo endoscopic subscore (MES) following 8-week induction.MethodsThe proportion of patients achieving efficacy endpoints at Week 24 or 52 of OCTAVE Sustain was evaluated by baseline MES following 8-week induction. Using logistic regression, the difference in treatment effect (tofacitinib vs. placebo) between baseline MES (0 vs. 1) for each endpoint was assessed. Adverse events were evaluated.ResultsAt Week 52 of OCTAVE Sustain, a numerically higher proportion of tofacitinib-treated patients achieved remission with OCTAVE Sustain baseline MES of 0 versus 1 (61.9% vs. 36.5% for tofacitinib 5 mg twice daily [BID] and 75.0% vs. 54.2% for tofacitinib 10 mg BID). Similar trends were observed for endoscopic remission and endoscopic improvement. Logistic regression analyses showed a larger treatment effect at Week 52 in patients with baseline MES of 0 versus 1 for clinical response (p = 0.0306) in the tofacitinib 5 mg BID group (other endpoints all p > 0.05); differences were not significant for any endpoint in the 10 mg BID group (all p > 0.05). Infection adverse events were less frequent among patients with baseline MES 0 versus 1.ConclusionsMES may be important in predicting long-term efficacy outcomes for tofacitinib maintenance treatment. Aiming for endoscopic remission during induction with tofacitinib 10 mg BID may allow successful maintenance with tofacitinib 5 mg BID. Safety was consistent with the known tofacitinib safety profile.Trial registration NCT01458574.","The authors would like to thank the patients, investigators, and study teams who were involved in the tofacitinib UC program.

(2) Methods: Data from the third wave of the Children's Worlds Project was used, which was collected by administering self-report measures to representative samples in each country. The sample was composed of 4008 early adolescents from Brazil (22.1%, n = 886), Chile (22.8%, n = 913) and Spain (55.1%, n = 2209). The mean age of the sample was 10.17 years (SD = 0.57), and 51.7% were girls. (3) Results: In terms of subjective happiness, moderate to high means were observed, with higher scores in boys and the Spanish sample. The results showed some differences in leisure time activities among children from Brazil, Chile and Spain. Furthermore, the results highlighted the importance of relaxation time with the family to promote happiness in pre-adolescence across genders and countries. Additionally, playing outdoors and doing homework were also found to be protective factors for subjective happiness. (4) Conclusions: In Brazil, Chile and Spain the most consistent result was the positive effect of spending time relaxing with the family on subjective happiness.","The data used in this publication come from the third wave of Children’s Worlds project: An international survey of children’s lives and well-being (www.isciweb.org, accessed on 1 April 2023).

Methods: A qualitative study was conducted with an interpretive hermeneutic approach, using semi-structured interviews developed in the Metropolitan Area of Aburrá Valley, Bogotá, and the Colombian coffee-growing region.
Results: Fifty-five interviews were conducted. Of the total number of people interviewed, 60% were cisgender men, 31% were cisgender women, and 9% were transgender women. The average age of the participants was 27 years. Sixty-nine percent were irregular migrants in Colombia. Only 11% were affiliated with the health system. It was observed that condom use is inconsistent among sex workers, depending on personal and social factors.
Conclusions: The factors that influence condom use in sex workers of Venezuelan origin in Colombia are determined by various factors, both personal and social. Personal factors relate to knowledge, support networks, and risk perception, while social factors are associated with substance use, stigma and discrimination, and the places where sex work is done. Social factors are the ones that most influence inconsistent condom use in cisgender men and transgender women.",,"Este trabajo ha sido financiado por el Programa Especial de Investigación, Desarrollo y Capacitación para la Investigación en Reproducción Humana (HRP) del PNUD-UNFPA-UNICEF-OMS-Banco Mundial, y por el Programa Especial de Investigación y Capacitación en Enfermedades Tropicales (TDR) de UNICEF-PNUD-Banco Mundial-OMS, ambos programas copatrocinados por la Organización Mundial de la Salud (OMS).",BULL PAN AM HEALTH ORGAN,,,,2023-03-03,2023,2023-03-03,2023-03-03,47,,e2,All OA; Gold,Article,"Pineda, Jair Eduardo Restrepo; Rojas, Soraya Villegas","Pineda, Jair Eduardo Restrepo (Corporación Universitaria Minuto de Dios - UNIMINUTO, Bogotá, Colombia, Corporación Universitaria Minuto de Dios - UNIMINUTO, Bogotá, Colombia.); Rojas, Soraya Villegas (Universidad Tecnológica de Pereira, Risaralda, Colombia, Universidad Tecnológica de Pereira, Risaralda, Colombia)","Pineda, Jair Eduardo Restrepo (Corporación Universitaria Minuto de Dios)","Pineda, Jair Eduardo Restrepo (Corporación Universitaria Minuto de Dios); Rojas, Soraya Villegas (Technological University of Pereira)",4,4,,,https://iris.paho.org/bitstream/10665.2/57086/1/v47e22023.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1155280788,42 Health Sciences; 4206 Public Health,3 Good Health and Well Being

Additionally, the increasing number of clients with mobile devices with high processing capabilities and the prevalence of non-delay tolerant traffic have led to the demand for non-feedback multicast schemes regarding distributed resource management. Current communication platforms lack gradual and dynamic coding control based on the type of data being transmitted. This paper proposes a reliable transmission scheme based on a concatenation of systematic coding and Random Linear Network Coding (RLNC) called Fulcrum coding. This hybrid rateless coding scheme with distributed characteristics allows the implementation of an adaptive resource management system to increase the decoding probability during data reception. The method ultimately results in a higher network throughput and shorter transmission times (RTT) per packet by implementing efficient Forward Error Correction (FEC).",,This work was supported by the Advance in Doctoral Research (The design of next-generation distributed codes and a balance in the performance of multicast networks).,IEEE Access,,,,2023-01-01,2023,2023-05-01,2023-01-01,11,,73839-73849,All OA; Gold,Article,"Julio, Yair Rivera; García, Ismael Gutiérrez; Díaz, José Márquez","Julio, Yair Rivera (Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, 01800, Colombia); García, Ismael Gutiérrez (Department of Mathematics, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, 01800, Colombia); Díaz, José Márquez (Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, 01800, Colombia)","Julio, Yair Rivera (Universidad del Norte)","Julio, Yair Rivera (Universidad del Norte); García, Ismael Gutiérrez (Universidad del Norte); Díaz, José Márquez (Universidad del Norte)",4,4,,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/ielx7/6287639/6514899/10113311.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1157671678,40 Engineering; 4006 Communications Engineering; 46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4613 Theory Of Computation,

Furthermore, there have been limited studies on its measurement invariance across cross-cultural subgroups, genders, and sexual orientations.
AIMS: The present study aimed to examine the fit of different measurement models for the AUDIT and its measurement invariance across a wide range of subgroups by country, language, gender, and sexual orientation.
METHODS: Responses concerning past-year alcohol use from the participants of the cross-sectional International Sex Survey were considered (N = 62,943; Mage: 32.73; SD = 12.59). Confirmatory factor analysis, as well as measurement invariance tests were performed for 21 countries, 14 languages, three genders, and four sexual-orientation subgroups that met the minimum sample size requirement for inclusion in these analyses.
RESULTS: A two-factor model with factors describing 'alcohol use' (items 1-3) and 'alcohol problems' (items 4-10) showed the best model fit across countries, languages, genders, and sexual orientations. For the former two, scalar and latent mean levels of invariance were reached considering different criteria. For gender and sexual orientation, a latent mean level of invariance was reached.
CONCLUSIONS: In line with the two-factor model, the calculation of separate alcohol-use and alcohol-problem scores is recommended when using the AUDIT. The high levels of measurement invariance achieved for the AUDIT support its use in cross-cultural research, capable also of meaningful comparisons among genders and sexual orientations.",,,Comprehensive Psychiatry,,,"Humans; Male; Female; Alcoholism; Cross-Cultural Comparison; Psychometrics; Cross-Sectional Studies; Sexual Behavior; Surveys and Questionnaires; Factor Analysis, Statistical; Reproducibility of Results",2023-09-23,2023,2023-09-23,2023-11,127,,152427,All OA; Gold,Article,"Horváth, Zsolt; Nagy, Léna; Koós, Mónika; Kraus, Shane W; Demetrovics, Zsolt; Potenza, Marc N; Ballester-Arnal, Rafael; Batthyány, Dominik; Bergeron, Sophie; Billieux, Joël; Briken, Peer; Burkauskas, Julius; Cárdenas-López, Georgina; Carvalho, Joana; Castro-Calvo, Jesús; Chen, Lijun; Ciocca, Giacomo; Corazza, Ornella; Csako, Rita; Fernandez, David P; Fujiwara, Hironobu; Fernandez, Elaine F; Fuss, Johannes; Gabrhelík, Roman; Gewirtz-Meydan, Ateret; Gjoneska, Biljana; Gola, Mateusz; Grubbs, Joshua B; Hashim, Hashim T; Islam, Md Saiful; Ismail, Mustafa; Jiménez-Martínez, Martha C; Jurin, Tanja; Kalina, Ondrej; Klein, Verena; Költő, András; Lee, Sang-Kyu; Lewczuk, Karol; Lin, Chung-Ying; Lochner, Christine; López-Alvarado, Silvia; Lukavská, Kateřina; Mayta-Tristán, Percy; Miller, Dan J; Orosová, Oľga; Orosz, Gábor; Ponce, Fernando P; Quintana, Gonzalo R; Quintero Garzola, Gabriel C; Ramos-Diaz, Jano; Rigaud, Kévin; Rousseau, Ann; Scanavino, Marco De Tubino; Schulmeyer, Marion K; Sharan, Pratap; Shibata, Mami; Shoib, Sheikh; Sigre-Leirós, Vera; Sniewski, Luke; Spasovski, Ognen; Steibliene, Vesta; Stein, Dan J; Strizek, Julian; Tsai, Meng-Che; Ünsal, Berk C; Vaillancourt-Morel, Marie-Pier; Van Hout, Marie Claire; Bőthe, Beáta","Horváth, Zsolt (Institute of Psychology, ELTE Eötvös Loránd University, Budapest, Hungary; Centre of Excellence in Responsible Gaming, University of Gibraltar, Gibraltar, Gibraltar.

1601,pub.1162646752,10.3390/su151411341,,,A Blockchain Prototype for Improving Electronic Seals on Container Shipping Operations,"With the widespread use of electronic seals (e-seals), their traceability and security have attracted more and more attention. Moreover, the complexity of shipping operations and container handling justifies the use of technologies to ensure information security in the face of attacks. This work contributes a blockchain-based solution with a simulated prototype for improving electronic seals for containers on terminals in ports. An electronic seal was designed, and a blockchain prototype was constructed for a container data flow. The obtained results from the prototype were evaluated using performance tests. The security issues in the blockchain were also discussed from a strategic perspective based on game theory. Finally, the simulation concluded that the blockchain improves transaction efficiency. No studies were found that integrated blockchain technology with electronic seals. Therefore, this work intends to combine blockchain technology with e-seal to improve the security of transferred data due to its immutable nature.",,This research received no external funding.

The aim of the study is to determine the variation in the levels of depressive and anxious symptomatology in children and adolescents in the North of Chile.
METHODS: A Repeated cross-sectional design (RCS) was used. The sample consisted of a total of 475 students aged 12 to 18 years (high school) from educational establishments in the city of Arica. To evaluate the changes in the mental health of students associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, the same mental health measures applied to students were compared in two waves (2018-2021).
RESULTS: An increase in the symptomatology levels of depression, anxiety, social anxiety, and problems with the family, while a decrease in problems with school and peers was observed.
CONCLUSIONS: The results show that there is an increase in mental health problems associated with the periods of time in which the COVID-19 pandemic transformed the social relation spaces and classrooms of secondary school students. The observed changes point to future challenges, which include that it may be important to improve the coordination and integration of mental health professionals in educational centers and schools.",,"This research was funded by Agencia Nacional de Investigación y Desarrollo de Chile (ANID), grant ANID PIA CIE 160007.",Journal of Clinical Medicine,,"Pierre Alexis Geoffroy, Antonio Gonzalez-Perez",,2023-02-17,2023,2023-02-17,,12,4,1601,All OA; Gold,Article,"Caqueo-Urízar, Alejandra; Atencio-Quevedo, Diego; Ponce-Correa, Felipe; Mena-Chamorro, Patricio; Urzúa, Alfonso; Flores, Jerome","Caqueo-Urízar, Alejandra (Instituto de Alta Investigación, Universidad de Tarapacá, Antofagasta 1520, Arica 1000000, Chile); Atencio-Quevedo, Diego (Escuela de Psicología y Filosofía, Universidad de Tarapacá, Arica 1000000, Chile); Ponce-Correa, Felipe (Escuela de Psicología y Filosofía, Universidad de Tarapacá, Arica 1000000, Chile); Mena-Chamorro, Patricio (Departamento de Psicología, Universidad de la Frontera, Temuco 4811230, Chile); Urzúa, Alfonso (Escuela de Psicología, Universidad Católica del Norte, Antofagasta 1270460, Chile); Flores, Jerome (Escuela de Psicología y Filosofía, Universidad de Tarapacá, Arica 1000000, Chile; Centro de Justicia Educacional (CJE), Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile, Santiago 8940855, Chile)","Caqueo-Urízar, Alejandra (University of Tarapacá)","Caqueo-Urízar, Alejandra (University of Tarapacá); Atencio-Quevedo, Diego (University of Tarapacá); Ponce-Correa, Felipe (University of Tarapacá); Mena-Chamorro, Patricio (University of La Frontera); Urzúa, Alfonso (Catholic University of the North); Flores, Jerome (University of Tarapacá; Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile)",4,4,,,https://www.mdpi.com/2077-0383/12/4/1601/pdf?version=1676612726,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1155508413,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences,3 Good Health and Well Being

Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT) is a program that has provided encouraging results for its treatment. However, scientific evidence about its efficacy is scarce. Therefore, we aimed to describe the scientific production on the components of the DBT program and its therapeutic efficacy in the treatment of people with BPD. Method : A systematic review with relevant keywords was conducted based on studies available in Scopus, Web of Science, and PubMed until June 2023, including studies in English, research on therapeutic intervention, studies with a randomized controlled trial (RCT) design that included people with the diagnosis of BPD. Results: We found 18 RCTs, most of which supported the effectiveness of DBT for BPD. There were a total of 1,755 participants in these studies, most of whom were women. These studies looked for treating self-injurious behaviors, suicidal thoughts or ideations, number of visits to emergency services, and frequency of hospital admissions. Most studies revealed that both short-term DBT and standard DBT improved suicidality in BPD patients with small or moderate effect sizes, lasting up to 24 months after the treatment period. Furthermore, these studies showed that DBT can significantly improve general psychopathology and depressive symptoms in patients with BPD. Improvement of compliance, impulsivity, mood instability, as well as reduction in hospitalization rate are other findings observed in the trials following DBT. Conclusion: Although DBT shows efficacy in the treatment of BPD, heterogeneity in the methodologies employed is highlighted. Therefore, it is necessary to design studies from a homogeneous theoretical and methodological framework.",The authors thank the institutions where they work for encouraging the development of research.,,Iranian Journal of Psychiatry,,,,2023-12-08,2023,2023-12-08,2024-01,19,1,119-129,All OA; Gold,Article,"Hernandez-Bustamante, Milton; Cjuno, Julio; Hernández, Ronald M.; Ponce-Meza, Jacqueline C.","Hernandez-Bustamante, Milton (Universidad Peruana Unión, Lima, Peru.); Cjuno, Julio (Universidad Privada Antenor Orrego, Trujillo, Peru.); Hernández, Ronald M.

1282,pub.1155367079,10.3390/app13042352,,,Effect of Finite Element Method (FEM) Mesh Size on the Estimation of Concrete Stress–Strain Parameters,"In this research, two components were developed jointly: On the one hand, an experimental plan was created to obtain specific variables of the concrete and serve as a reference for the second model, a numerical and computational type created to address the variability in parameters, such as the elasticity and flow of coarse aggregate and mortar. The experimental work reproduced a specific gradation with a 1” nominal maximum size TMN on spheroidal-shaped particles. To address the diversity of limestone in the national territory, rocks were extracted from five calcareous areas of the country, which were transformed through different activities from lamination and turning with different bits to being carved into spheres until the reference gradation formed. The next stage consisted of determining the mechanical and stress–strain properties of both the mortar and coarse aggregate. In the case of mortar, the compressive stress was obtained from 50 mm × 50 mm × 50 mm cubes and the modulus of elasticity from 100 mm × 200 mm cylinders; for the coarse aggregate, the compressive stress was obtained through tests on cylinders of the calcareous rock used to form the spherical aggregate particles. The materials were mixed according to a previous proportioning for f′c = 28 MPa and cast in cylinders of 100 mm × 200 mm. Finally, the compressive stress and the modulus of elasticity in these specimens were determined. Separately, a computational model was created to reproduce the experimental model with the same type of materials and load conditions and thereby estimate the compressive stress and modulus of elasticity of the tested material. This model was developed based on finite elements simulating concrete under a two-phase model, in which the coarse aggregate phase was arranged with spheroidal particles that were assembled with the mortar paste, thus finally reproducing a concrete cylinder of 100 mm × 200 mm. Material properties, taken from experimental work, were assigned to these materials. Initially, work was carried out in the elastic range, obtaining, as a result, the modulus of elasticity Ec, and then the specimen was brought to failure, obtaining, as a result, the maximum compressive stress f′c. To attend to the influence of the effect of the mesh size for modeling on the numerical results of both parameters, several simulations were carried out in which mesh sizes of 4.0, 3.5, 3.0, and 2.5 mm were established for the mortar and the coarse aggregate, respectively, for carrying out the modeling. The results in the computational model showed that the compressive stress turned out to be more sensitive than the modulus of elasticity to the variation in the size of the mesh. For the first, the differences between the 4 mm mesh and the 2.5 mm mesh reached 3%, but for the second, the difference only reached 1% between the results for the same meshes. When the results between the experimental and computational models were compared, we found that the experimental values had the best closeness with results in the 2.5 mm mesh.",,This research received no external funding.,Applied Sciences,,,,2023-02-11,2023,2023-02-11,,13,4,2352,All OA; Gold,Article,"Bracamonte, Alex José; Mercado-Puche, Vicente; Martínez-Arguelles, Gilberto; Pumarejo, Luis Fuentes; Ortiz, Albert R.; Herazo, Luis Carlos Sandoval","Bracamonte, Alex José (Department of Civil Engineering, University of Sucre, Sincelejo 700001, Colombia); Mercado-Puche, Vicente (Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla 080001, Colombia); Martínez-Arguelles, Gilberto (Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla 080001, Colombia); Pumarejo, Luis Fuentes (Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla 080001, Colombia); Ortiz, Albert R.

This systematic review synthesizes and critically analyzes the existing literature on mental disorders in the rural Andean population in Latin America.
Methods: A systematic review with narrative synthesis was carried out following the PRISMA guidelines. We searched nine databases (PubMed/MEDLINE, Scopus, EMBASE, ScienceDirect, Web of Science, Cochrane, Scielo, LILACS, and Latindex), five public prepublication servers (SocArXiv, medRxiv, bioRxiv, SportRXiv, and Preprints), ALICIA, and Google Scholar for articles that included the analysis of mental health problems using data collected from the rural Andean population in Latin America. These were eligible for inclusion. Articles that included Non-Latin American populations (including European or African migrants) and studies conducted prior to the COVID-19 pandemic (since the declaration of national lockdown) were excluded.
Results: A total of 23,761 articles were retrieved, 14 of which met the inclusion requirements. Most were cross-sectional (n = 12) and related to anxiety (n = 9), depression (n = 8), and stress (n = 5). The mental health analysis of 5,976 rural dwellers from four countries in Latin America also included gray literature studies (n = 7) that allowed the quantification of mental health problems in adults (n = 7) and adolescents/children (n = 4). Only one study was multinational, and the quality of publications varied. Despite the high frequency of anxiety, depression, and stress symptoms among rural Latin American populations during COVID-19, published research is very limited. This review found preliminary evidence that the frequency of anxiety (45%), depression (27.6%), and stress (33.1%) in the rural population was associated with pandemic restrictions across countries. Measures of other psychiatric problems, such as distress or suicidal ideation, cannot be estimated.
Conclusion: Regional-wide studies investigating changes in the frequency of symptoms of mental health problems in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic are warranted to inform culturally adapted prevention strategies. This study is limited to a narrative synthesis and may be subject to publication bias.

In mammals, autophagy can participate in the clearance of intracellular pathogens from the cell, and the activity of the toll-like receptors mediates its activation. However, in fish, the modulation of autophagy by these receptors in the muscle is unknown. This study describes and characterizes autophagic modulation during the immune response of fish muscle cells after a challenge with intracellular pathogen Piscirickettsia salmonis. For this, primary cultures of muscle cells were challenged with P. salmonis, and the expressions of immune markers il-1β, tnfα, il-8, hepcidin, tlr3, tlr9, mhc-I and mhc-II were analyzed through RT-qPCR. The expressions of several genes involved in autophagy (becn1, atg9, atg5, atg12, lc3, gabarap and atg4) were also evaluated with RT-qPCR to understand the autophagic modulation during an immune response. In addition, LC3-II protein content was measured via Western blot. The challenge of trout muscle cells with P. salmonis triggered a concomitant immune response to the activation of the autophagic process, suggesting a close relationship between these two processes.","The authors would like to thank German Olivares from the Piscicultura de Río Blanco, Los Andes, Chile for providing the fish for the experiments.","This research was funded by Fondo Nacional de Desarrollo Científico y Tecnológico FONDECYT, postdoctoral grant number 3200172, and FONDECYT, regular grant number 1191763.",Animals,,,,2023-02-28,2023,2023-02-28,,13,5,880,All OA; Gold,Article,"Valenzuela, Cristián A.; Azúa, Marco; Álvarez, Claudio A.; Schmitt, Paulina; Ojeda, Nicolás; Mercado, Luis","Valenzuela, Cristián A.

Methods: 44 adults performed an experimental emotion regulation task in which they were instructed to attend, reappraise, or suppress their emotions while viewing negative and neutral images taken from the International Affective Picture System (IAPS). Afterward, participants rated valence, arousal, and emotional dominance elicited by the images. Additionally, attachment orientations were measured using the ECR-12 questionnaire.
Results: Results showed a relationship between attachment avoidance and the level of arousal during the reappraisal condition; specifically, the higher attachment avoidance levels, the greater the emotional intensity during the implementation of cognitive reappraisal strategy. Such results suggest an association between failing in downregulate intense emotions using cognitive reappraisal when there are higher levels of attachment avoidance. Consistently, we also found that lower dominance during reappraisal was associated with more levels of avoidance.
Conclusion: These results indicate that people with higher levels of attachment avoidance experience difficulties when using the cognitive reappraisal strategy to reduce the emotional impact produced by negative emotional stimuli. Our findings reinforce the idea that avoidant people experience high physiological activation when experience emotions.",We want to thank Professor Tomás Ossandón for his feedback and all the members of his lab Neurodynamics of Cognition at Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile.

It could avoid excessive degradations of active compounds with potential therapeutic agents. In this study, the effect on several relevant bioactive compounds, anti-inflammatory activity, and anti-proliferative activity of broccoli (Brassica oleracea var. italica) were evaluated. Effects of other drying methods, including vacuum drying (VD), convective drying (CD), infrared drying (IRD), and freeze drying (FD), were also comparatively evaluated. The results of all dried samples showed high polyunsaturated fatty acid contents (of up to 71.3%) and essential amino acid contents (of up to 8.63%). The LTVD method stands out above the other drying methods, since it obtained the highest content of total phenols, chlorogenic acid, and ferulic acid. Both the LTVD and CD samples demonstrated high anti-inflammatory and anti-proliferative activities. These CD and LTVD samples were also the most active against the breast carcinoma MDA-MB-23 cell line. Due to the good retention of bioactive compounds via LTVD, the obtained dried broccoli here can be used in a near time as an ingredient for the development of novel natural products with anti-inflammatory and anti-proliferative effects.","The authors gratefully acknowledge the Dirección de Investigación y Desarrollo de la Universidad de La Serena (DIDULS), through the project N°PTE2211115.

Methods: A systematic research involving six electronic databases was conducted using a research strategy that combined MeSH terms with free terms. Article selection and information extraction were performed using a double and independent approach. The Newcastle-Ottawa tool was used to assess the risk of bias in the included articles. The meta-analysis used the random-effects approach, with subgroup analysis and sensitivity analysis for risk of bias also being performed.
Results: We included 101 articles with a total of 31,123 participants. The studies were conducted between 1990 and 2022, with Brazil accounting for the largest number of studies (n = 37). The overall seroprevalence of human toxocariasis was 31.0% (95% CI: 27.0-35.0%, I2 = 99%). The prevalence of the main characteristics observed in seropositive patients were as follows: ocular toxocariasis (30.0%), asymptomatic (26.0%), and presence of dogs at home (68.0%). In addition, the seroprevalence was lower in studies including only adults than in those including children or both. In contrast, no differences in seroprevalences were found between studies conducted in the community and hospital.
Conclusion: The overall seroprevalence of human toxocariasis in Latin America and the Caribbean was high. Notably, our findings showed that the seroprevalence was increased among populations who kept a dog at home but was decreased in populations comprising only adults. Our findings can be used to establish epidemiological surveillance strategies for the prevention and early identification of toxocariasis.",,,Frontiers in Public Health,,,Child; Adult; Humans; Animals; Dogs; Toxocariasis; Latin America; Seroepidemiologic Studies; Caribbean Region; Ethnicity,2023-06-27,2023,2023-06-27,,11,,1181230,All OA; Gold,Article,"Ulloque-Badaracco, Juan R.; Hernandez-Bustamante, Enrique A.; Alarcón-Braga, Esteban A.; Huayta-Cortez, Miguel; Carballo-Tello, Ximena L.; Seminario-Amez, Rosa A.; Rodríguez-Torres, Alejandra; Casas-Patiño, Donovan; Herrera-Añazco, Percy; Benites-Zapata, Vicente A.","Ulloque-Badaracco, Juan R.

This shared emotional experience gives rise, in turn, to more intense emotions, this being one of the explanatory models of the positive psychological effects of collective participation. Through a quasi-longitudinal design of three measurement-times (N = 273, 65.9% women; age: 18-70, M = 39.43, SD = 11.64), the most massive social mobilization that is celebrated in favor of the Basque language in the Basque Country (Korrika) was analyzed. Repeated measures and sequential mediation analyzes supported the model. The effect of participation on social integration was mediated by the increase in emotions of enjoyment through PES; the effect on social acceptance, social contribution, and social actualization was mediated by increased kama muta through PES; the effect on collective empowerment was mediated by the increase in self-transcendent emotions through PES; and the effect on remembered well-being was partially mediated by PES. Finally, it was also verified for the first time that the effect of participation on social integration, social acceptance and social actualization was maintained through PES (but not through emotions) for at least 6-7 weeks after the event ended.

In the present study, we aimed to (i) identify different psychological adjustment profiles among LGBTQ+ young adults during the COVID-19 pandemic and compare LGBTQ+ young adults in relation to (ii) sociodemographic characteristics and COVID-19-related experiences and (iii) the internal and external protective resources associated with each adjustment profile. An online questionnaire was administered to 1699 LGBTQ+ young adults from six countries (Brazil, Chile, Italy, Portugal, Sweden, and the UK). A cluster analysis was conducted, and four profiles of psychological adjustment were identified: unchallenged, resilient, distressed, and at-risk. The at-risk cluster scored lowest in social support (particularly from family). The profiles of participants who experienced the highest levels of pandemic adversity (at-risk and resilient) comprised mostly South American participants, those under lockdown at the time of survey completion, those who self-identified as transgender and non-binary, and those with a plurisexual sexual orientation. Interventions should consider strategies to help young adults maintain support systems and reinforce the value of positive family relationships.

941,pub.1165303914,10.3390/su152115358,,,Augmented Reality and Tourism: A Bibliometric Analysis of New Technological Bets in the Post-COVID Era,"Tourism is a sector of high relevance worldwide, due to the multiple impacts it generates in local, regional, national, continental, and global economies, and it is a key generator of employment and provides sustenance to an innumerable number of people around the world. There have been many challenges at a global level to improve the user experience in a particular tourist place, where technology has played a highly relevant role in strengthening the conditions for tourists to achieve immersion in the culture, gastronomy, and recreation. The objective of this literature review is precisely to know and understand the key contributions that are currently being developed around the implementation of augmented reality as tourist technological support for user experiences. The literature on this topic is quite dispersed in specialized databases; therefore, it constitutes an opportunity to carry out a more detailed exploration of the topic. To address the different developments that have been carried out on tourism and augmented reality, an analysis was carried out based on the fusion of scientometric analysis and the metaphor of the Tree of Science, in which two relevant visions about the data were generated. The first focused on the different scientometric statistics regarding countries, authors, universities, or research or technological development centers that currently generate new applications based on augmented reality for tourism. The second focused on an evolutionary analysis based on the Tree of Science, analyzing the origins of the basic contributions of research and how it has evolved over time. This review indicates that the topic is currently valid and that it has been strengthened even more with the post-pandemic process, where many technological developments have been strengthened that allow people to enjoy tourist and cultural sites even without leaving home.",,This research was funded by the project “Strengthening the Social Appropriation of Culture and Cultural Identity Making Use of Augmented Reality in the Cultural Heritage of the Department of Cesar” financed by the General Royalties System of Colombia for the Department of Cesar.

Heated tobacco products (HTPs) form a category with THR potential due to their ability to deliver nicotine and flavours through heating, not burning, tobacco. By eliminating burning, heated tobacco does not produce smoke but an aerosol which contains fewer and lower levels of harmful chemicals compared to cigarette smoke. In this study we assessed the in vitro toxicological profiles of two prototype HTPs' aerosols compared to the 1R6F reference cigarette using the 3D human (bronchial) MucilAir™ model. To increase consumer relevance, whole aerosol/smoke exposures were delivered repeatedly across a 28 day period (16, 32, or 48 puffs per exposure). Cytotoxicity (LDH secretion), histology (Alcian Blue/H&E; Muc5AC; FoxJ1 staining), cilia active area and beat frequency and inflammatory marker (IL-6; IL-8; MMP-1; MMP-3; MMP-9; TNFα) levels were assessed. Diluted 1R6F smoke consistently induced greater and earlier effects compared to the prototype HTP aerosols across the endpoints, and in a puff dependent manner. Although some significant changes across the endpoints were induced by exposure to the HTPs, these were substantially less pronounced and less frequently observed, with apparent adaptive responses occurring over the experimental period. Furthermore, these differences between the two product categories were observed at a greater dilution (and generally lower nicotine delivery range) for 1R6F (1R6F smoke diluted 1/14, HTP aerosols diluted 1/2, with air). Overall, the findings demonstrate the THR potential of the prototype HTPs through demonstrated substantial reductions in toxicological outcomes in in vitro 3D human lung models.",,,Frontiers in Toxicology,,,,2023-02-16,2023,2023-02-16,,5,,1076752,All OA; Gold,Article,"Chapman, Fiona; Pour, Sarah Jean; Wieczorek, Roman; Sticken, Edgar Trelles; Budde, Jessica; Röwer, Karin; Otte, Sandra; Mason, Elizabeth; Czekala, Lukasz; Nahde, Thomas; O’Connell, Grant; Simms, Liam; Stevenson, Matthew","Chapman, Fiona (Imperial Brands PLC, Bristol, United Kingdom); Pour, Sarah Jean (Reemtsma Cigarettenfabriken GmbH, Hamburg, Germany); Wieczorek, Roman (Reemtsma Cigarettenfabriken GmbH, Hamburg, Germany); Sticken, Edgar Trelles (Reemtsma Cigarettenfabriken GmbH, Hamburg, Germany); Budde, Jessica (Reemtsma Cigarettenfabriken GmbH, Hamburg, Germany); Röwer, Karin (Reemtsma Cigarettenfabriken GmbH, Hamburg, Germany); Otte, Sandra (Reemtsma Cigarettenfabriken GmbH, Hamburg, Germany); Mason, Elizabeth (Imperial Brands PLC, Bristol, United Kingdom); Czekala, Lukasz (Imperial Brands PLC, Bristol, United Kingdom); Nahde, Thomas (Reemtsma Cigarettenfabriken GmbH, Hamburg, Germany); O’Connell, Grant (Imperial Brands PLC, Bristol, United Kingdom); Simms, Liam (Imperial Brands PLC, Bristol, United Kingdom); Stevenson, Matthew (Imperial Brands PLC, Bristol, United Kingdom)","Chapman, Fiona (Imperial Brands (United Kingdom))","Chapman, Fiona (Imperial Brands (United Kingdom)); Pour, Sarah Jean (Imperial Brands (Germany)); Wieczorek, Roman (Imperial Brands (Germany)); Sticken, Edgar Trelles (Imperial Brands (Germany)); Budde, Jessica (Imperial Brands (Germany)); Röwer, Karin (Imperial Brands (Germany)); Otte, Sandra (Imperial Brands (Germany)); Mason, Elizabeth (Imperial Brands (United Kingdom)); Czekala, Lukasz (Imperial Brands (United Kingdom)); Nahde, Thomas (Imperial Brands (Germany)); O’Connell, Grant (Imperial Brands (United Kingdom)); Simms, Liam (Imperial Brands (United Kingdom)); Stevenson, Matthew (Imperial Brands (United Kingdom))",4,4,,,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/ftox.2023.1076752/pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1155424650,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3206 Medical Biotechnology,3 Good Health and Well Being

This study seeks to identify clinical simulation as a didactic scenario based on resources for training rehabilitation professionals. Material and methods A systematic review of the literature was carried out under the methodological recommendations of Cochrane and PRISMA for publication. Experimental, quasi-experimental, pilot study, randomized controlled trial, and post-observational studies were included. The information search was carried out in the Scopus and Pubmed databases, with a quartile between Q1 and Q4, in an observation window between 2018 and 2022, without age, gender and language restrictions. Results Of the studies analysed, 16 met the established eligibility criteria. It was possible to recognize that the training in clinical simulation was generally oriented to the clinical practices of undergraduate students for the area of physiotherapy with 62.5%. The type of simulation most used was the standardized patient (31.25%). The evaluation instruments in the studies were varied depending on the objective of the investigation and type of simulation.

To obtain an overall landscape view of the effects of IFN-γ from brain-resident cells on the cerebral protective immunity, in the present study we employed NanoString nCounter assay and quantified mRNA levels for 734 genes in myeloid immunity in the brains of T and B cell-deficient, bone marrow chimeric mice with and without IFN-γ production by brain-resident cells in response to reactivation of cerebral T. gondii infection. Our study revealed that IFN-γ produced by brain-resident cells amplified mRNA expression for the molecules to activate the protective innate immunity including 1) chemokines for recruitment of microglia and macrophages (CCL8 and CXCL12) and 2) the molecules for activating those phagocytes (IL-18, TLRs, NOD1, and CD40) for killing tachyzoites. Importantly, IFN-γ produced by brain-resident cells also upregulated cerebral expression of molecules for facilitating the protective T cell immunity, which include the molecules for 1) recruiting effector T cells (CXCL9, CXCL10, and CXCL11), 2) antigen processing (PA28αβ, LMP2, and LMP7), transporting the processed peptides (TAP1 and TAP2), assembling the transported peptides to the MHC class I molecules (Tapasin), and the MHC class I (H2-K1 and H2-D1) and Ib molecules (H2-Q1, H-2Q2, and H2-M3) for presenting antigens to activate the recruited CD8+ T cells, 3) MHC class II molecules (H2-Aa, H2-Ab1, H2-Eb1, H2-Ea-ps, H2-DMa, H2-Ob, and CD74) to present antigens for CD4+ T cell activation, 4) co-stimulatory molecules (ICOSL) for T cell activation, and 5) cytokines (IL-12, IL-15, and IL-18) facilitating IFN-γ production by NK and T cells. Notably, the present study also revealed that IFN-γ production by brain-resident cells also upregulates cerebral expressions of mRNA for the downregulatory molecules (IL-10, STAT3, SOCS1, CD274 [PD-L1], IL-27, and CD36), which can prevent overly stimulated IFN-γ-mediated pro-inflammatory responses and tissue damages. Thus, the present study uncovered the previously unrecognized the capability of IFN-γ production by brain-resident cells to upregulate expressions of a wide spectrum of molecules for coordinating both innate and T cell-mediated protective immunity with a fine-tuning regulation system to effectively control cerebral infection with T. gondii.",The authors appreciate the service and assistance in flow cytometry and NanoString assay provided by Markey Shared Resource Facility at University of Kentucky supported by P30CA177558.,"The study was supported in part by the funding from the National Institutes of Health (AI152597, AI095032, and AI136821).",Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology,,,"Animals; Mice; Toxoplasma; Interleukin-18; Persistent Infection; CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes; Immunity, Cellular; Interferon-gamma",2023-02-15,2023,2023-02-15,,13,,1110508,All OA; Gold,Article,"Suzuki, Yasuhiro; Lutshumba, Jenny; Chen, Kuey Chu; Abdelaziz, Mohamed H.; Sa, Qila; Ochiai, Eri","Suzuki, Yasuhiro (Department of Microbiology, Immunology and Molecular Genetics, University of Kentucky College of Medicine, Lexington, KY, United States); Lutshumba, Jenny (Department of Microbiology, Immunology and Molecular Genetics, University of Kentucky College of Medicine, Lexington, KY, United States); Chen, Kuey Chu (Department of Pharmacology and Nutritional Science, University of Kentucky College of Medicine, Lexington, KY, United States; Genomics Core Laboratory, University of Kentucky College of Medicine, Lexington, KY, United States); Abdelaziz, Mohamed H.

Such programs are indispensable because, as explained in the paper, in “panic buying” environments, supply chains are frequently unable to rapidly increase the amounts of critical supplies delivered to points of sales. Thus, reducing the demand is the only option to mitigate shortages. To reach this goal, this research assesses the potential of a novel FDM initiative that relies on Trusted Change Agents (TCAs) to convince individuals to limit their purchases of critical supplies, and outlines a comprehensive FDM program with initiatives spanning the entire disaster management cycle. The research: analyzes survey data to gain insight into the reasons people participate in “panic buying;” establishes that the term “panic buying” is a misnomer—as the instances of true “panic” are extremely rare—and suggests the term “Disaster Related Buying Behaviors” (DRBBs)” to better describe the phenomena; creates a data-driven taxonomy of objectives and motivating reasons for DRBBs; estimates a Structural Equation Model (SEM) to assess the strengths of the interconnections between reasons, themes, and objectives pursued by individuals who enact DRBBs; assesses the impacts of TCA appeals; identifies the initiatives needed, together with the timing and sequencing, to be conducted at the various stages of the disaster management cycle; identifies the stakeholders that ought to be involved in the executions of these initiatives; and puts these elements together to outline a comprehensive FDM program.","Declaration of Competing Interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

Environmental and genetic factors that interfere with the neurulation process promote neural tube defects (NTDs). Connexins (Cxs) are transmembrane proteins that form gap junctions (GJs) and hemichannels (HCs) in vertebrates, allowing cell-cell (GJ) or paracrine (HCs) communication through the release of ATP, glutamate, and NAD+; regulating processes such as cell migration and synaptic transmission. Changes in the state of phosphorylation and/or the intracellular redox potential activate the opening of HCs in different cell types. Cxs such as Cx43 and Cx32 have been associated with proliferation and migration at different stages of CNS development. Here, using molecular and cellular biology techniques (permeability), we demonstrate the expression and functionality of HCs-Cxs, including Cx46 and Cx32, which are associated with the release of ATP during the neurulation process in Xenopus laevis. Furthermore, applications of FGF2 and/or changes in intracellular redox potentials (DTT), well known HCs-Cxs modulators, transiently regulated the ATP release in our model. Importantly, the blockade of HCs-Cxs by carbenoxolone (CBX) and enoxolone (ENX) reduced ATP release with a concomitant formation of NTDs. We propose two possible and highly conserved binding sites (N and E) in Cx46 that may mediate the pharmacological effect of CBX and ENX on the formation of NTDs. In summary, our results highlight the importance of ATP release mediated by HCs-Cxs during neurulation.",,"ANID Fondecyt Regular N° 1231038 (P.A.C.); FONDECYT Inicio 11160562 (P.A.C.); VRID-UdeC 220.033.112-4 (P.A.C.); Fondecyt 11221211 (C.F.B.); Fondecyt 1211095 (G.M.-C.); Fondecyt 1200908 (JF); ANID Fondecyt Regular N° 1211473 (L.B.-G.); Millennium Nucleus for the Study of Pain (MiNuSPain, NCN19_038) (G.E.Y. and Claudio Coddou).

A non-experimental cross-sectional study was conducted using a self-administered survey to a sample of 396 teleworkers in Lima, Peru. The hypothesized model was analyzed using PLS-SEM based structural equation modeling. The results show that FSSB has a direct effect on both job satisfaction in remote work and WFPS and WLB. In addition, it shows that WFPS and WLB have positive effects on job satisfaction in remote work. Also, the results show that WFPS and WLB have a mediating role in the influence of FSSB on job satisfaction in remote work. In conclusion, this study highlights the importance of supervisor behavior, positive work-to-family spillover, and work-life balance in remote workers' job satisfaction.

666,pub.1155392183,10.3389/feart.2023.1111530,,,Adaptation timescales of estuarine systems to human interventions,"Many estuaries and tidal basins are strongly influenced by various human interventions (land reclamations, infrastructure development, channel deepening, dredging and disposal of sediments). Such interventions lead to a range of hydrodynamic and morphological responses (a changing channel depth, tidal amplitude and/or suspended sediment concentration). The response time of a system to interventions is determined by the processes driving this change, the size of the system, and the magnitude of the intervention. A quantitative understanding of the response time to an intervention therefore provides important insight into the processes driving the response. In this paper we develop and apply a methodology to estimate the response timescales of human interventions using available morphological and hydraulic data. Fitting an exponential decay function to data with sufficient temporal resolution yields an adaptation timescale (and equilibrium value) of the tidal range and deposited sediment volumes. The method has been applied in the Dutch Wadden Sea, where two large basins were reclaimed and where long-term and detailed bathymetric maps are available. Exponential fitting the morphological data revealed that closure of a very large part of a tidal basin in the Wadden Sea initially led to internal redistribution and import of coarse and fine sediments, and was followed by a phase of extensive redistribution while only fine-grained sediments are imported. Closure of a smaller part of a smaller basin led to shorter response timescales, and these response timescales are also more sensitive to rising mean sea levels or high waters. The method has also been applied to tidal water level observations in the Scheldt and Ems estuaries. Exponential fits to tidal data reveal that adaptation timescales are shortest at the landward limit of dredging. The adaptation time increases in the landward direction because of retrogressive erosion (Scheldt) or lowering of the hydraulic roughness (Ems).

In this extensive academic production, the one related to the issuing of sustainability reports has been the most abundant, due, among other aspects, to the accessibility of this type of voluntary information issued by companies.  From a position that is generally peripheral to the central core of knowledge production, this research community seems to have tried to integrate itself into the main trends - conventional and alternative - of academic knowledge production and dissemination, marked by a process of homogenisation. However, there are major gaps in knowledge about the impact of this process. In an attempt to make a contribution in this respect, the aim of this paper is to carry out a systematic review of the academic literature on sustainability reporting carried out in Spanish in recent decades. The study reveals a development of academic production dominated by descriptive, positivist works, published by authors with academic affiliation in Spanish universities and in journals mostly outside the accounting field.",,,Revista de Contabilidad,,,,2023-01-01,2023,2023-01-01,,26,1,59-78,All OA; Gold,Article,"Alvarez-Etxeberria, Igor; Heras-Saizarbitoria, Iñaki; Boiral, Olivier","Alvarez-Etxeberria, Igor (Universidad del País Vasco); Heras-Saizarbitoria, Iñaki (Universidad del País Vasco); Boiral, Olivier (Université Laval)",,"Alvarez-Etxeberria, Igor (University of the Basque Country); Heras-Saizarbitoria, Iñaki (University of the Basque Country); Boiral, Olivier (Université Laval)",4,4,,,https://revistas.um.es/rcsar/article/download/452071/334741,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1154223236,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 47 Language, Communication and Culture; 4704 Linguistics",12 Responsible Consumption and Production

For this reason, processes associated with these devices are generating new requirements at the level of interconnectivity, security, and scalability. Due to the large volume of devices, this growth process has tested the existing communications infrastructure, deployment architecture, different support services, technical requirements and the intrinsic characteristics of the services offered. In this sense, the use of Edge Computing schemes and TSN (Time-Sensitive Networking), is proposed as a tool for supporting IIoT (Industrial Internet of Things) services to achieve optimization and assurance processes of latency, scalability and interoperability parameters required by critical mission services such as health, transportation and production. In this sense, we propose several strategies for assuring low latency, scalability and interoperability in Edge Computing and TSN networks for critical IIoT services.

Many strategies have been developed to manage patients in critical conditions; however, comprehension of the immune system is a key factor in viral clearance, tissue repairment, and adaptive immunity stimulus. Participation of immunity has been identified as a major factor, along with biomarkers, prediction of clinical outcomes, and antibody production after infection. Immune cells have been proposed not only as a hallmark of severity, but also as a predictor of clinical outcomes, while dynamics of inflammatory molecules can also induce worse consequences for acute patients. For convalescent patients, mild disease was related to higher antibody production, although the factors related to the specific antibodies based on a diversity of antigens were not clear. COVID-19 was explored over time; however, the study of immunological predictors of outcomes is still lacking discussion, especially in convalescent patients. Here, we propose a review using previously published studies to identify immunological markers of COVID-19 outcomes and their relation to antibody production to further contribute to the clinical and laboratorial management of patients.",The authors would like to extend their gratitude to all laboratory staff for their support of this research.,"This work was funded by the Fundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado do Amazonas (FAPEAM) (Pró-Estado Program (#002/2008, #007/2018, and #005/2019), the POSGRAD Program (#005/2022), the PCTI-EMERGESAÚDE/AM—Chamada II Program (#006/2020)), the Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico (CNPq), and the Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior (CAPES)/Consolidação doutorado.

This neglected disease mainly affects populations in developing or underdeveloped countries, causing nearly one million new cases per year. This article focuses on the cutaneous form of the disease. Common antileishmanial medications have several disadvantages, such as low efficiency, high toxicity, several adverse effects, resistant strains, long treatments, and high costs. As a result, first- and second-line treatments are insufficient. Therefore, there is a need for new antileishmanial agents and strategies, most of which utilize nanotechnology. While novel nano-drug delivery devices can transport antileishmanial drugs to target cells, reducing secondary toxic effects, several advances in nanotechnology and photonics pursue activation of leishmanicidal mechanisms once they reach their target. Here is a of recent nanotechnology approaches to the treatment, diagnosis, and prevention of human cutaneous leishmaniasis, including promising techniques still in development.","Declaration of Competing Interest On behalf of all the co-authors of this manuscript, I declare that there are no conflict of interest regarding this review.

Accuracy in this photovoltaic energy forecasting is essential to increase the amount of renewable energy that can be introduced to existing electrical grid systems. The objective of this work is based on developing various computational models capable of making short-term forecasting about the generation of photovoltaic energy that is generated in a solar plant. For the implementation of these models, a hybrid architecture based on recurrent neural networks (RNN) with long short-term memory (LSTM) or gated recurrent units (GRU) structure, combined with shallow artificial neural networks (ANN) with multilayer perceptron (MLP) structure, is established. RNN models have a particular configuration that makes them efficient for processing ordered data in time series. The results of this work have been obtained through controlled experiments with different configurations of its hyperparameters for hybrid RNN-ANN models. From these, the three models with the best performance are selected, and after a comparative analysis between them, the forecasting of photovoltaic energy production for the next few hours can be determined with a determination coefficient of 0.97 and root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.17. It is concluded that the proposed and implemented models are functional and capable of predicting with a high level of accuracy the photovoltaic energy production of the solar plant, based on historical data on photovoltaic energy production.",,,International Journal of Photoenergy,,Kok Keong Chong,,2023-04-18,2023,,2023-04-18,2023,,1-19,All OA; Gold,Article,"Castillo-Rojas, Wilson; Bekios-Calfa, Juan; Hernández, César","Castillo-Rojas, Wilson (Department of Informatics Engineering and Computer Science, University of Atacama, Av.

The traffic flow theory employed in this model is a two-dimensional extension of the Aw-Rascle theory. The flow parameters, including vehicle density, and vertical and horizontal velocities, are described by a system of first-order partial differential equations belonging to the family of hydrodynamic systems. This fluid-dynamics model is expressed in terms of the Euler and Lagrange variables. The admitted Lie point symmetries and the one-dimensional optimal system are determined for both sets of variables. It is found that the admitted symmetries for the two sets of variables form different Lie algebras, leading to distinct one-dimensional optimal systems.

226,pub.1154925310,10.3390/pr11020381,,,Geometallurgical Detailing of Plant Operation within Open-Pit Strategic Mine Planning,"Mineral and metallurgical processing are crucial within the mineral value chain. These processes involve several stages wherein comminution is arguably the most important due to its high energy consumption, and its impact on subsequent extractive processes. Several geological properties of the orebody impact the efficiency of mineral processing and extractive metallurgy; scholars have therefore proposed to deal with the uncertain ore feed in terms of grades and rock types, incorporating operational modes that represent different plant configurations that provide coordinated system-wide responses. Even though these studies offer insights into how mine planning impacts the ore fed into the plant, the simultaneous optimization of mine plan and metallurgical plant design has been limited by the existing stochastic mine planning algorithms, which have only limited support for detailing operational modes. The present work offers to fill this gap for open-pit mines through a computationally efficient adaptation of a strategic mine planning algorithm. The adaptation incorporates a linear programming representation of the operational modes which forms a Dantzig-Wolfe decomposition, nested within a high-performing stochastic mine planning algorithm based on a variable neighborhood descent metaheuristic. Sample calculations are presented, loosely based on the Mount Isa deposit in Australia, in which a metallurgical plant upgrade is evaluated, showing that the upgraded design significantly decreases the requirement on the mining equipment, without significantly affecting the NPV.",Powered@NLHPC: This research was partially supported by the supercomputing infrastructure of the NLHPC (ECM-02).,"This research was partially funded by a scholarship granted by the Chilean National Agency for Research and Development—ANID, grant number 72200205.",Processes,,,,2023-01-26,2023,2023-01-26,,11,2,381,All OA; Gold,Article,"Quelopana, Aldo; Órdenes, Javier; Araya, Rodrigo; Navarra, Alessandro","Quelopana, Aldo (Department of Systems and Computer Engineering, Universidad Católica del Norte, 0610 Angamos, Antofagasta 1270709, Chile; Department of Mining and Materials Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, McGill University, 3610 University Street, Montreal, QC H3A 0C5, Canada); Órdenes, Javier (Department of Mining and Materials Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, McGill University, 3610 University Street, Montreal, QC H3A 0C5, Canada); Araya, Rodrigo (SNC Lavalin Inc., Mining and Metallurgy, 445 René-Lévesque Blvd. West, Montreal, QC H2Z 1Z3, Canada); Navarra, Alessandro (Department of Mining and Materials Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, McGill University, 3610 University Street, Montreal, QC H3A 0C5, Canada)","Navarra, Alessandro (McGill University)","Quelopana, Aldo (Catholic University of the North; McGill University); Órdenes, Javier (McGill University); Araya, Rodrigo (SNC-Lavalin (Canada)); Navarra, Alessandro (McGill University)",4,4,,,https://www.mdpi.com/2227-9717/11/2/381/pdf?version=1676595470,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1154925310,40 Engineering; 4019 Resources Engineering and Extractive Metallurgy,7 Affordable and Clean Energy

We demonstrate that the minimal discrete dark matter mechanism contains the ingredients for explaining this hierarchy. This scenario is characterized by adding new RH neutrinos and SU(2)-doublet scalars to the Standard Model as triplet representations of an A4 flavor symmetry. The A4 symmetry breaking, which occurs at the electroweak scale, leads to a residual ℤ2 symmetry responsible for the dark matter stability and dictates the neutrino phenomenology. Finally, we show that to reproduce the neutrino mixing angles correctly, it is necessary to violate CP in the scalar potential.","Work supported by the Chilean grant Fondecyt Iniciación No. 11201240 (Nu Physics); the Mexican grants CONACYT CB-2017-2018/A1-S-13051 and DGAPA-PAPIIT IN107621; and the Spanish grants PID2020-113775GB-I00 (AEI/10.13039/501100011033) and Prometeo CIPROM/2021/054 (Generalitat Valenciana).

In this sense, environmental performance is now included as a competitive priority throughout the supply chain. Therefore, this study aims to verify, through two case studies, the competitive priorities of two first-tier suppliers from the automotive chain that have adopted lean and green practices. The findings show that the quality priority is the main source of competitive advantage and the focus of the operations that are analyzed here, while the environmental priority is not considered the most important by the companies. However, it is still included as a priority. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that lean practices could generate compatibility for the environmental priority, even indirectly, while trade-offs can arise between priorities. Therefore, the integration between lean and green practices can facilitate the inclusion of the environmental priority into the operations strategy and management systems.",,This research received no external funding.,Machines,,,,2023-01-01,2023,2023-01-01,,11,1,50,All OA; Gold,Article,"Queiroz, Geandra Alves; Filho, Alceu Gomes Alves; Melo, Isotilia Costa","Queiroz, Geandra Alves (Engineering Department, Production Engineering, Universidade do Estado de Minas Gerais (UEMG), Passos 37900-106, Minas-Gerais, Brazil); Filho, Alceu Gomes Alves (Industrial Engineering Department, Federal University of São Carlos, São Carlos 13565-905, São Paulo, Brazil); Melo, Isotilia Costa (Escuela de Ingeniería de Coquimbo (EIC), Universidad Católica del Norte (UCN), Coquimbo 25803-35, Chile)","Queiroz, Geandra Alves (Minas Gerais State University)","Queiroz, Geandra Alves (Minas Gerais State University); Filho, Alceu Gomes Alves (Federal University of São Carlos); Melo, Isotilia Costa (Catholic University of the North)",4,4,,,https://www.mdpi.com/2075-1702/11/1/50/pdf?version=1672587078,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1154188415,40 Engineering; 4003 Biomedical Engineering,12 Responsible Consumption and Production
225,pub.1164184157,10.3390/su151813767,,,Activated Carbon Electrodes for Bioenergy Production in Microbial Fuel Cells Using Synthetic Wastewater as Substrate,"The growing global energy demand drives the need to develop new clean energy technologies. In this context, microbial fuel cells (MFC) are one of the emerging technologies with great potential for eco-friendly energy generation; however, the correct choice of electrode material is a significant limitation in the optimal configuration of MFCs. Therefore, this research evaluated the efficiency of activated carbon (AC) anode electrodes for bioenergy production in MFC using synthetic wastewater as a substrate. Peak values of voltage (1120 ± 0.050 mV), current (4.64 ± 0.040 mA), power density (208.14 ± 17.15 mW/cm2), and current density (5.03 A/cm2) were generated, and the Rint obtained was 214.52 ± 5.22 Ω. The substrate was operated at pH values from 5.31 to 7.66, maximum ORP values (858 mV) were reached, and turbidity was reduced to 25.11 NTU. The SEM-EDS (scanning electron microscopy–energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy) analyses allowed us to observe the morphology and composition of the AC electrodes, revealing a predominance of O, C, Si, Al, Fe, K, and Ca.

225,pub.1157418495,10.3390/math11081936,,,Evaluating Natural Hazards in Cities Using a Novel Integrated MCDM Approach (Case Study: Tehran City),"Tehran, the capital of Iran, is the largest and most populous city in Iran, which is of great importance due to its large population and abundant infrastructure. One of the most critical issues in this city is its need for resilience against all kinds of threats, including natural hazards, because its development was not based on territorial geography. In other words, in developing this 700 square kilometer area, attention has yet to be paid to its different zones. Different zones include the mountains, Shemiranat’s alluvial cone area, the Tehran plain, etc. Main and minor faults, surface and underground water resources of the land, differences in formations between various parts of the land, the microclimate of the land in its multiple aspects, local and synoptic air currents, etc., have not been influential in urban development. The most crucial goal of this study is to identify and screen natural hazards in Tehran to improve this city’s resilience by introducing a novel integrated MCDM method based on ANP and The Combined Compromise Solution method with Maximum Variance (MV-CoCoSo). Therefore, to increase the strength of Tehran against these disasters, the natural hazards of Tehran must first be identified and ranked. In this regard, practical criteria for evaluating Tehran’s resilience were identified using library resources and the formation of expert groups. Then, using the ANP method, the comparative weightings of these effective criteria was investigated. Based on the results obtained, the disaster consequence criterion had the highest importance with a weight of 0.4361, followed by the disaster severity scale criterion with a weight of 0.2371, and the secondary threat possibility criterion (with a weight of 0.1232) was ranked third. Finally, using the MV-CoCoSo method, the natural hazards of Tehran city were classified based on the evaluated criteria. Tehran City’s three significant disasters were earthquakes, floods, and landslides. In addition, two experiments were designed to assess the robustness of the research methodology.",,This research received no external funding.,Mathematics,,,,2023-04-20,2023,2023-04-20,,11,8,1936,All OA; Gold,Article,"Bitarafan, Mahdi; Amini Hosseini, Kambod; Hashemkhani Zolfani, Sarfaraz","Bitarafan, Mahdi (International Institute of Earthquake Engineering and Seismology (IIEES), Tehran 19537-14453, Iran); Amini Hosseini, Kambod (International Institute of Earthquake Engineering and Seismology (IIEES), Tehran 19537-14453, Iran); Hashemkhani Zolfani, Sarfaraz (School of Engineering, Universidad Catolica del Norte, Larrondo 1281, Coquimbo 1780000, Chile)","Amini Hosseini, Kambod (International Institute of Earthquake Engineering and Seismology)","Bitarafan, Mahdi (International Institute of Earthquake Engineering and Seismology); Amini Hosseini, Kambod (International Institute of Earthquake Engineering and Seismology); Hashemkhani Zolfani, Sarfaraz (Catholic University of the North)",4,4,,,https://www.mdpi.com/2227-7390/11/8/1936/pdf?version=1681976844,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1157418495,49 Mathematical Sciences,11 Sustainable Cities and Communities

202,pub.1154827835,10.3389/fclim.2022.1080978,,,The ENSO-induced South Pacific Meridional Mode,"Previous studies have investigated the role of the Pacific meridional mode (PMM), a climate mode of the mid-latitudes in the Northern and Southern Hemisphere, in favoring the development of the El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO). However little is known on how ENSO can influence the development of the PMM. Here we investigate the relationship between ENSO and the South Pacific Meridional Mode (SPMM) focusing on strong SPMM events that follows strong El Niño events. This type of events represents more than 60% of such events in the observational record and the historical simulations of the CESM Large ensemble (CESM-LE). It is first shown that such a relationship is rather stationary in both observations and the CESM-LE. Our analyses further reveal that strong SPMM events are associated with a coastal warming off northern central Chile peaking in Austral winter resulting from the propagation of waves forced at the equator during the development of El Niño events. The time delay between the ENSO peak (Boreal winter) and this coastal warming (Austral winter) can be understood in terms of the differential contribution of the equatorially-forced propagating baroclinic waves to the warming along the coast. In particular, the difference in phase speeds of the waves (the high-order mode the wave the slower) implies that they do not overlap along their propagation south of 20°S. This contributes to the persistence of warm coastal SST anomalies off Central Chile until the Austral summer following the concurrent El Niño event. This coastal warming is favorable to the development of strong SPMM events as the South Pacific Oscillation become active during that season. The analysis of the simulations of the Coupled Intercomparison Project phases 5 and 6 (CMIP5/6) indicates that very few models realistically simulate this ENSO/SPMM relationship and associated oceanic teleconnection.",,"BD received support from ANID (Concurso de Fortalecimiento al Desarrollo Cientifico de Centros Regionales 2020-R20F0008-CEAZA, Anillo Eclipse ACT210071, Núcleo Milenio UPWELL (NCN19_153) and COPAS COASTAL FB210021) and ANR (Grant ANR-18-CE01-0012).

Each aggregation method has its advantages and disadvantages, and the best method to use depends on the specific situation and the goals of the decision-making process. In certain cases, final rankings of alternatives in the decision-making process may depend on the way of combining different attitudes. The focus of this paper is the application and comparative analysis of the aggregation operators, specifically, arithmetic mean (AM), geometric mean (GM), and Dombi Bonferroni mean (DBM), to the process of criteria weights determination in a fuzzy environment. The criteria weights are determined using Fuzzy Multi-Criteria Decision-Making (F-MCDM) methods, such as Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process (F-AHP), Fuzzy Pivot Pairwise Relative Criteria Importance Assessment (F-PIPRECIA), and Fuzzy Full Consistency Method (F-FUCOM), while the final alternative ranking is obtained by Fuzzy Weighted Aggregated Sum Product Assessment (F-WASPAS). A comparison of aggregation operators is done for the real case of location selection problem for a used motor oil transfer station in the regional center of Southern and Eastern Serbia, the city of Niš. The results obtained in this study showed that the views of different experts and application of a certain aggregation approach may have a significant impact on the values of criteria weight coefficients and further on the final ranking of alternatives.

Near-infrared photometry was obtained at the Cerro Armazones Observatory, and parallaxes were taken from the Gaia Early Data Release 3. Relations were determined for the 2MASS JHK s bands and the W JK Wesenheit index. We compare our results with other calibrations available in the literature and obtain very good agreement with the photometry of RR Lyraes from the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) anchored using the distance to the Cloud, which is based on detached eclipsing binaries. We find that the dependence of absolute magnitudes on metallicity of 0.070 ± 0.042 (J band) to 0.087 ± 0.031 (W JK index) mag dex−1 for the population of fundamental pulsators (RRab) is in agreement with previously published phenomenological works. We perform a refined determination of distance to the LMC based on our new calibration and photometry from Szewczyk et al. We study the dependence of the fitted parameters of the fiducial relations and the LMC distance on the systematic parallax offset.","The research leading to these results has received funding from the European Research Council (ERC) under the European Union&#x27;s Horizon 2020 research and innovation program (grant agreement Nos. 695099 and 951549).

Based on the information gathered from these experiences, it seeks to advance the discussion on women's participation in STEM focusing on SDG 5 (gender equality) and SDG 8 (decent work). The main difficulties experienced by women in STEM as discussed in the academic literature were mapped. This provided input to develop a questionnaire containing qualitative and quantitative questions used to conduct interviews with women working in STEM. The sample consisted of highly qualified professionals working in high positions in the hierarchies of multinational companies in the STEM field with experience both in Brazil and abroad. The data collected was analyzed using a mixed-methods approach, including content analysis for qualitative questions and the Grey Relational Analysis for quantitative questions. The results revealed that the lack of flexible work systems, the scarcity of gender-sensitive organizational policies and labor policies, and the prevalence of traditional cultural models are some of the main difficulties faced both in Brazil and abroad by the women interviewed. The need to discuss issues of gender equality and decent work in the early stages of education is important for increasing women’s participation in STEM, which is a critical factor in the development of inclusive organizations and in fully achieving the sustainable development of society. This paper presents a unique perspective of the perceived difficulties faced by executive women who worked in Brazil and in different countries (i.e., Canada, Denmark, France, Germany, Switzerland and the United States). Gender equality in organizations is highly context-dependent, and cross-cultural analysis generates relevant insights to face the challenges and advance the discussion on women’s participation in STEM.",,The authors are grateful for the support of the National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq/Brazil) under the Grants No 304145/2021-1 and No 303924/2021-7.,Discover Sustainability,,,,2023-02-20,2023,2023-02-20,,4,1,11,All OA; Gold,Article,"Kemechian, Tatiane; Sigahi, Tiago F.

Artisanal fisheries and aquaculture have not been exempt from these privatization measures, the implementation of deregulation measures in the fisheries sector, and commoditization strategies oriented mainly to exports. However, little research has been done about these issues jointly in South America. Therefore, the adoption of these measures and the adaptation and transformation of artisanal fishermen to entrepreneurs were studied in the scallop (Argopecten purpuratus) fishery/aquaculture in Tongoy Bay, Chile. We use qualitative research and an analysis of historical archives to describe a series of political-economic changes, stages, and processes involved in the transformation of the sector. The analysis focuses on conflicts, resistance practices, and value regimes between fishers and farmers to explore the different moral economies at play. Our results show that (a) changes in moral economies are neither automatic nor unidirectional; (b) the State, through its economic policy, technological development institutions, and technology transfer actions, does not directly generate expected results; (c) artisanal fishers who have become entrepreneurs understand and justify competitiveness (or lack of it) because some are more entrepreneurial than others; (d) despite the adoption of neoliberal guidelines, aspects of a more traditional moral economy remain, such as the role of family units in the configuration of enterprises; and, finally, (e) artisanal fishers have moved from a traditional moral economy based on collective and historical rights to a neoliberal moral economy based on the individual and his or her capacity for self-improvement, entrepreneurship, and efficient work management.","We thank Manuel Andrade from the Subsecretaria de Pesca y Acuicultura (SUBPESCA), and Luis Espinoza and Caroline Agullo from the Servicio Nacional de Pesca y Acuicultura (SERNAPESCA) for their advice and access to data.

We first formulate an f-NLED cosmological model with a more general function fF$$f \left( {F}\right) $$ and show that all NLED models can be expressed in this framework; then, we investigate in detail two interesting examples of the function fF$$f \left( {F}\right) $$. We present our phenomenological model based on a new Lagrangian for NLED. Solutions to the field equations with the physical properties of the cosmological parameters are obtained. We show that the early Universe had no Big-Bang singularity, which accelerated in the past. We also investigate the qualitative implications of NLED by studying the inflationary parameters, like the slow-roll parameters, spectral index ns$$n_s$$, and tensor-to-scalar ratio r, and compare our results with observational data. Detailed phase-space analysis of our NLED cosmological model is performed with and without matter source. As a first approach, we consider the motion of a particle of unit mass in an effective potential. Our systems correspond to fast-slow systems for physical values of the electromagnetic field and the energy densities at the end of inflation. We analyze a complementary system using Hubble-normalized variables to investigate the cosmological evolution before the matter-dominated Universe.","HBB gratefully acknowledges the financial support from the University of Sharjah.

For its application, a deep knowledge of the problem is necessary since it will facilitate the adequate choice of the references necessary for its resolution. In addition, the application of the methodology to examples of coupled ordinary differential equations is shown, resulting in an interesting tool to teach postgraduate students in the branches of physics, mathematics, and engineering. The first example used for a system of coupled ordinary differential equations is a model of a continuous flow chemical reactor, where it is worth noting; on the one hand, the methodology used to choose the reference (characteristic) time and, on the other, the equivalence between the characteristic times obtained for each one of the species. The following universal curves are obtained, which are validated by comparing them with the results obtained by numerical simulation, where it stands out that the universal solution includes an unknown that must be previously obtained. The resolution of this unknown implies having a deep knowledge of the problem, a common characteristic when using the methodology proposed in this work for different engineering or physicochemical problems. Finally, the second example is a coupled oscillator, where it is worth noting that the appearance of characteristic periods that implicitly or explicitly affect the particles’ movement is striking.",,This research received no external funding.,Mathematics,,,,2023-05-15,2023,2023-05-15,,11,10,2303,All OA; Gold,Article,"Sánchez-Pérez, Juan Francisco; García-Ros, Gonzalo; Conesa, Manuel; Castro, Enrique; Cánovas, Manuel","Sánchez-Pérez, Juan Francisco (Department of Applied Physics and Naval Technology, Universidad Politécnica de Cartagena (UPCT), 30202 Cartagena, Spain;, manuel.conesa@upct.es, (M.C.);, enrique.castro@upct.es, (E.C.)); García-Ros, Gonzalo (Department of Mining and Civil Engineering, Universidad Politécnica de Cartagena (UPCT), 30202 Cartagena, Spain;, gonzalo.garcia@upct.es); Conesa, Manuel (Department of Applied Physics and Naval Technology, Universidad Politécnica de Cartagena (UPCT), 30202 Cartagena, Spain;, manuel.conesa@upct.es, (M.C.);, enrique.castro@upct.es, (E.C.)); Castro, Enrique (Department of Applied Physics and Naval Technology, Universidad Politécnica de Cartagena (UPCT), 30202 Cartagena, Spain;, manuel.conesa@upct.es, (M.C.);, enrique.castro@upct.es, (E.C.)); Cánovas, Manuel (Metallurgical and Mining Engineering Department, Universidad Católica del Norte, Antofagasta 1240000, Chile;, manuel.canovas@ucn.cl)","Sánchez-Pérez, Juan Francisco (Polytechnic University of Cartagena)","Sánchez-Pérez, Juan Francisco (Polytechnic University of Cartagena); García-Ros, Gonzalo (Polytechnic University of Cartagena); Conesa, Manuel (Polytechnic University of Cartagena); Castro, Enrique (Polytechnic University of Cartagena); Cánovas, Manuel (Catholic University of the North)",4,4,,,https://www.mdpi.com/2227-7390/11/10/2303/pdf?version=1684226752,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1158108145,49 Mathematical Sciences,

Water scarcity is one of the most revealing phenomena of these instabilities. This transdisciplinary bibliometric and economic–financial research focuses on analyzing two aspects: first, the feasibility of implementing seawater desalination plants as a solution to water scarcity in northern Chile. Investment and amortization costs of the desalination plants were determined (NPV-IRR-IRP). NPV showed a positive value indicating a recovery of the initial investment and a surplus over profitability. The IRR was higher than the discount rate calculated for NPV, which showed that the investment project was accepted. The IRP indicated that the initial investment of the plant would be recovered in 3.7 years. Second, an innovative and environmentally sustainable solution to the brine (NaCl) waste generated by desalination plants is proposed through the cultivation of Dunaliella salina microalgae tolerant to high brine concentrations to produce β-carotene. The analyzed desalination plants and the sustainable use of brine residues offer interesting economic perspectives to a 10-year projection establishing a surplus over profitability. The SWOT analysis estimates an excellent production of β-carotene through the microalgae and alternatives to the problem of sea pollution by concentrated brine waste.",,This research received no external funding.,Processes,,,,2023-05-30,2023,2023-05-30,,11,6,1668,All OA; Gold,Article,"Bas, Tomas Gabriel; Fariña, Rodrigo; Gallardo, Fernanda; Vilches, Macarena","Bas, Tomas Gabriel (Escuela de Ciencias Empresariales, Universidad Católica del Norte, Coquimbo 1780000, Chile); Fariña, Rodrigo (Escuela de Ciencias Empresariales, Universidad Católica del Norte, Coquimbo 1780000, Chile); Gallardo, Fernanda (Escuela de Ciencias Empresariales, Universidad Católica del Norte, Coquimbo 1780000, Chile); Vilches, Macarena (Escuela de Ciencias Empresariales, Universidad Católica del Norte, Coquimbo 1780000, Chile)","Bas, Tomas Gabriel (Catholic University of the North)","Bas, Tomas Gabriel (Catholic University of the North); Fariña, Rodrigo (Catholic University of the North); Gallardo, Fernanda (Catholic University of the North); Vilches, Macarena (Catholic University of the North)",4,4,,,https://www.mdpi.com/2227-9717/11/6/1668/pdf?version=1685673981,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1158523158,40 Engineering; 4004 Chemical Engineering,6 Clean Water and Sanitation

A better understanding of the vaccine immune response may help to define vaccination strategies against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
Objective: To investigate the long-term immunological response to CoronaVac vaccine and determinants of breakthrough COVID-19 infection.
Methods: A long-term, prospective cohort study involving vaccinated adult and elderly subjects was conducted to investigate the presence of anti-RBD-specific immunoglobulin (Ig)G, anti-nucleocapsid IgG and anti-spike trimeric protein IgG. Antibody level dynamics and risk factors associated with breakthrough COVID-19 infection were investigated.
Results: In total, 3902 participants were included in this study. Vaccination with two doses of CoronaVac and a booster dose increased the levels of anti-RBD-specific IgG, anti-nucleocapsid IgG and anti-spike trimeric IgG significantly. In adults, anti-nucleocapsid IgG and anti-spike trimeric IgG levels decreased significantly 7 months after the second dose. In adults and the elderly, the levels of anti-spike trimeric IgG and anti-RBD IgG decreased significantly 4 and 6 months after the booster dose, respectively. Previous exposure to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) and anti-spike trimeric IgG titres was independently associated with a lower probability of post-vaccination infection.
Conclusions: A significant increase in antibody levels was found after two doses of CoronaVac and a booster dose. Antibody titres declined significantly 7 months post-vaccination in participants who did not receive a booster dose. Higher levels of antibodies and previous SARS-CoV-2 infection were associated with protection against breakthrough COVID-19.","Conflict of interest statement MCB, GJV, NNF, PMMG, GRM, BALF and RTC received research support from Instituto Butantan during the conduct of this study.

Consequently, this often leads to caregivers who are the patient's relatives, which adversely impacts the workforce along with severely diminishing the quality of life for all involved. It is, therefore, highly desirable to develop a fast, effective and reliable sensor to enable early-stage detection in an attempt to reverse disease progression. This research validates the detection of amyloid-beta 42 (Aβ42) using a Silicon Carbide (SiC) electrode, a fact that is unprecedented in the literature. Aβ42 is considered a reliable biomarker for AD detection, as reported in previous studies. To validate the detection with a SiC-based electrochemical sensor, a gold (Au) electrode-based electrochemical sensor was used as a control. The same cleaning, functionalization and Aβ1-28 antibody immobilization steps were used on both electrodes. Sensor validation was carried out by means of Cyclic Voltammetry (CV) and Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) aiming to detect an 0.5 µg·mL-1 Aβ42 concentration in 0.1 M buffer solution as a proof of concept. A repeatable peak directly related to the presence of Aβ42 was observed, indicating that a fast SiC-based electrochemical sensor was constructed and may prove to be a useful approach for the early detection of AD.","Bianca I.

According to the SIMCE test carried out in 2015, 45% of 8th year students in Chile were overweight. Moreover, international studies have shown that being overweight is associated with the development of chronic illnesses, negatively affecting cognitive mechanisms and processes. Nevertheless, there is little to no evidence that analyzes the relationship between physical fitness and executive functions in students, at a national level. The aim was to analyze the relationship between cardiorespiratory, musculoskeletal, and motor fitness, and performance in an executive functions test, in students from a public school in the south of Chile. A qualitative, descriptive -correlational, non-experimental, and cross-sectional approach was used. In total, 100 students between 9 and 12 and 11 months of age from a public school in the south of Chile completed the physical fitness assessments through the ALPHA fitness test, and 81 students completed the executive function assessments through the ENFEN test. It was evidenced that students who achieved a longer duration of time and a later stage in the Course Navette test, more centimeters in the standing broad jump (SBJ) test, and a shorter duration in the 4 × 10 shuttle run obtained a better score in the gray trail test. Additionally, students who presented a stronger dominant handgrip scored higher in the colored trail tests. We conclude that students who show a higher level of physical fitness also present a better development of executive functions such as working memory and inhibitory control. In addition, these results suggest physical condition is a factor to consider for better cognitive and school performance.","The authors would like to thank and acknowledge the support of all the educational communities involved in this study: school administrators, teachers, students, parents, and legal guardians.",This research received no external funding.,Behavioral Sciences,,,,2023-02-20,2023,2023-02-20,,13,2,191,All OA; Gold,Article,"Alonso-Cabrera, Jesús; Salazar, Franco; Benavides-Ulloa, Jorge; Parra-Rizo, María Antonia; Zapata-Lamana, Rafael; Diaz-Vargas, Caterin; Vásquez-Gómez, Jaime; Cigarroa, Igor","Alonso-Cabrera, Jesús (Departamento de Matemáticas y Estadística, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla 081008, Colombia); Salazar, Franco (Escuela de Kinesiología, Facultad de Salud, Universidad Santo Tomás, Los Ángeles 4440000, Chile); Benavides-Ulloa, Jorge (Escuela de Kinesiología, Facultad de Salud, Universidad Santo Tomás, Los Ángeles 4440000, Chile); Parra-Rizo, María Antonia (Faculty of Health Sciences, Valencian International University (VIU), 46002 Valencia, Spain; Department of Health Psychology, Faculty of Social and Health Sciences, Campus of Elche, Miguel Hernandez University (UMH), 03202 Elche, Spain); Zapata-Lamana, Rafael (Escuela de Educación, Universidad de Concepción, Los Ángeles 4440000, Chile); Diaz-Vargas, Caterin (Escuela de Educación, Universidad de Concepción, Los Ángeles 4440000, Chile); Vásquez-Gómez, Jaime (Centro de Investigación de Estudios Avanzados del Maule (CIEAM), Universidad Católica del Maule, Talca 3460000, Chile; Laboratorio de Rendimiento Humano, Grupo de Estudios en Educación, Actividad Física y Salud (GEEAFyS), Universidad Católica del Maule, Talca 3460000, Chile); Cigarroa, Igor (Escuela de Kinesiología, Facultad de Salud, Universidad Santo Tomás, Los Ángeles 4440000, Chile)","Cigarroa, Igor (Universidad Santo Tomás)","Alonso-Cabrera, Jesús (Universidad del Norte); Salazar, Franco (Universidad Santo Tomás); Benavides-Ulloa, Jorge (Universidad Santo Tomás); Parra-Rizo, María Antonia (Valencian International University; Miguel Hernandez University); Zapata-Lamana, Rafael (University of Concepción); Diaz-Vargas, Caterin (University of Concepción); Vásquez-Gómez, Jaime (Catholic University of the Maule; Catholic University of the Maule); Cigarroa, Igor (Universidad Santo Tomás)",3,3,,,https://www.mdpi.com/2076-328X/13/2/191/pdf?version=1676961087,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1155620923,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3202 Clinical Sciences; 52 Psychology; 5202 Biological Psychology; 5203 Clinical and Health Psychology,

Normally, such cases would be left undecided, while on the other hand, timely taxonomic decisions are required. We argue that morphological, chorological, and ecological data can be informative to illuminate patterns of speciation. Their use can provide a first step in testing taxon concepts at species level. We focused on five cases of nested singletons in trees of the genus Casearia. We employed PCA and cluster analysis to assess phenotypic differentiation. Using geocoordinates, we calculated niche space differentiation based on 19 bioclim variables, by means of PCA and niche equivalency and similarity tests and generated dot maps. We found that the singletons were morphologically distinctive in two of the five cases (Casearia selloana and C. manausensis), relatively distinctive in two other cases (C. zizyphoides and C. mariquitensis), and partially overlapping in the last case (C. grandiflora). For two cases (C. mariquitensis and C. selloana), ecological niche space was broadly overlapping, in two cases it was found broadly nested (C. grandiflora and C. zizyphoides), and in one case narrowly nested (C. manausensis), but in no case niche differentiation was observed. Niche overlap, similarity and equivalency showed corresponding patterns. Given these data, one would interpret C. selloana and C. manausensis as presumably well-distinguished taxa, their narrow distribution ranges suggesting recently emerging lineages. The other three cases are not clearcut. Morphological data would suggest particularly C. grandiflora conspecific with C. arborea, but differences in the distribution are intriguing. Our approach would reject the notion of potential synonymy based on nested phylogenetic placement for at least two of the five cases. The other case also shows no complete lack of differentiation which would support synonymy.","ACKNOWLEDGMENTS We are thankful to Mac H.

We studied the effects of nifurtimox administered by two different treatment regimens on the T. cruzi calcium-binding flagellar protein F29 in children diagnosed with Chagas disease measured using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) technique (ELISA F29).
METHODS AND PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: In a phase 3, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, historically controlled study (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02625974), blood samples obtained from children diagnosed with Chagas disease and treated with nifurtimox for either 60 days or 30 days were analyzed using an ELISA with an F29 recombinant protein as the antigen, as well as conventional serological tests (recombinant ELISA and indirect hemagglutination assay). In an exploratory approach, serological response to nifurtimox treatment was evaluated for 4 years post-treatment. In both treatment groups, the number of patients with negative ELISA F29 values increased over the period of observation. The incidence rate of negative seroconversion using ELISA F29 was 22.94% (95% CI: 19.65%, 26.63%) in the 60-day treatment group and 21.64% (95% CI: 17.21%, 26.86%) in the 30-day treatment group. In the subpopulation of patients who tested seropositive for F29 before nifurtimox treatment, 88 patients (67.7%) in the 60-day regimen and 39 patients (59.1%) in the 30-day regimen were F29 seronegative at 4 years post-treatment. All patients who had a positive ELISA F29 test at baseline and seroconverted to negative measured by conventional serology reached seronegativity in ELISA F29 earlier than in conventional serology.
CONCLUSIONS: The results demonstrate a serological response to treatment with nifurtimox measured by the ELISA F29 test in children diagnosed with Chagas disease. The F29-based ELISA can be considered a potential early marker of response to antitrypanosomal therapy for Chagas disease.

It is the causative agent of the primary amoebic meningoencephalitis. Focused on our interest to develop promising lead structures for the development of antiparasitic agents, this study was aimed at identifying new anti-Naegleria marine natural products from a collection of chamigrane-type sesquiterpenes with structural variety in the levels of saturation, halogenation and oxygenation isolated from Laurencia dendroidea. (+)-Elatol (1) was the most active compound against Naegleria fowleri trophozoites with IC50 values of 1.08 μM against the ATCC 30808™ strain and 1.14 μM against the ATCC 30215™ strain. Furthermore, the activity of (+)-elatol (1) against the resistant stage of N. fowleri was also assessed, showing great cysticidal properties with a very similar IC50 value (1.14 µM) to the one obtained for the trophozoite stage. Moreover, at low concentrations (+)-elatol (1) showed no toxic effect towards murine macrophages and could induce the appearance of different cellular events related to the programmed cell death, such as an increase of the plasma membrane permeability, reactive oxygen species overproduction, mitochondrial malfunction or chromatin condensation. Its enantiomer (-)-elatol (2) was shown to be 34-fold less potent with an IC50 of 36.77 μM and 38.03 μM. An analysis of the structure-activity relationship suggests that dehalogenation leads to a significant decrease of activity. The lipophilic character of these compounds is an essential property to cross the blood-brain barrier, therefore they represent interesting chemical scaffolds to develop new drugs.",,"This work was funded by Project PID2019-109476RB-C21 (BIOALGRI) (Spanish Ministry of Science, Madrid, Spain), Proyecto Intramural Especial CSIC [Ref. 202280I032]; N.N. was funded by the Agustín de Betancourt Programme (Cabildo de Tenerife, TFinnova Programme supported by MEDI and FDCAN funds).

OBJECTIVES: To quantify the burden of cardiometabolic risk factors in South American children (0-21 years) and identify knowledge gaps.
METHODS: We systematically searched PubMed, Google Scholar, and the Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences Literature via Virtual Health Library from 2000-2021 in any language. Two independent reviewers screened and extracted all data.
RESULTS: 179 studies of 2,181 screened were included representing 10 countries (n = 2,975,261). 12.2% of South American children experienced obesity, 21.9% elevated waist circumference, 3.0% elevated fasting glucose, 18.1% high triglycerides, 29.6% low HDL cholesterol, and 8.6% high blood pressure. Cardiometabolic risk factor definitions varied widely. Chile exhibited the highest prevalence of obesity/overweight, low HDL, and impaired fasting glucose. Ecuador exhibited the highest prevalence of elevated blood pressure. Rural setting (vs. urban or mixed) and indigenous origin protected against most cardiometabolic risk factors.
CONCLUSIONS: South American children experience high rates of obesity, overweight, and dyslipidemia. International consensus on cardiometabolic risk factor definitions for children will lead to improved diagnosis of cardiometabolic risk factors in this population, and future research should ensure inclusion of unreported countries and increased representation of indigenous populations.",,The authors received no specific funding for this work.,PLOS ONE,,Patricia Khashayar,Adult; Humans; Child; Overweight; Cardiometabolic Risk Factors; Risk Factors; Body Mass Index; Blood Glucose; Obesity; Hypertension; Waist Circumference; Dyslipidemias; Chile; Cardiovascular Diseases,2023-11-22,2023,2023-11-22,,18,11,e0293865,All OA; Gold,Article,"Singleton, Carolyn M.

This technology is potentially used for metals like Li, Cu, Ca, Mg, Na, K, Sr, and others that are mostly obtained from natural brine sources through a combination of pumping, solar evaporation, and solvent extraction steps. As the future demand for metals for the electronic industry increases, new forms of marine mining processing alternatives are being implemented. Unfortunately, both land and marine mining, such as off-shore and deep sea types, have great potential for severe environmental disruption. In this context, a green alternative is the mixing entropy battery, which is a promising technique whereby the ions are captured from a saline natural source and released into a recovery solution with low ionic force using intercalation materials such as Prussian Blue Analogue (PBA) to store cations inside its crystal structure. This new technique, called ""electrochemical ion pumping"", has been proposed for water desalination, lithium concentration, and blue energy recovery using the difference in salt concentration. The raw material for this technology is a saline solution containing ions of interest, such as seawater, natural brines, or industrial waste. In particular, six main ions of interest-Na+, K+, Mg2+, Ca2+, Cl-, and SO42--are found in seawater, and they constitute 99.5% of the world's total dissolved salts. This manuscript provides relevant information about this new non-evaporative process for recovering metals from aqueous salty solutions using hexacianometals such as CuHCF, NiHCF, and CoHCF as electrodes, among others, for selective ion removal.","This work was partially carried out by Felipe M.

The operation of these functionalities causes topological changes on the network that must be identified since these affect protection, volt/var control, and state estimation, among others. This paper presents a data-driven topology detector for self-healing strategies in Active Distribution Networks (ADN). This approach uses machine learning (ML) techniques to obtain a trained model as a topology detector. The ML models are integrated into the Intelligent Electronic Device (IED) of ADN so that using the voltage and current signals measured locally determine the network’s topology. A features selection and tuning technique based on a multiverse optimizer are proposed to improve the ML model accuracy. This approach allows it to be implemented in decentralized architectures since each IED detects the system’s topology from local measurements and does not depend on the availability of the communication system. The proposed topology detector was validated on a modified IEEE 123 nodes test feeder considering six topology changes, five DER outages, and five load variations. The results obtained show accuracy values above 96%, which evidences a highlighted potential for real-life applications.","This work was supported by Universidad del Norte, Colombia, and Departamento Administrativo de Ciencia, Tecnología e Innovación — COLCIENCIAS (now Colombian Ministry of Science, Technology, and Innovation - Minciencias) by call contest “Convocatoria 852 — Conectando conocimiento de 2019” — Project Integra2023, code 111085271060, contract 80740-774-2020.",,Energy Reports,,,,2023-05,2023,,2023-05,9,,377-385,All OA; Gold,Article,"Marin-Quintero, J.; Orozco-Henao, C.; Mora-Florez, J.","Marin-Quintero, J.

A Student’s t-test was applied to compare the effectiveness of SBL with traditional instruction, and performance values were analyzed using minimum, maximum, and average statistics. The focus was on how effectively SBL encouraged an inquiry-based approach in students and their understanding of a country’s objectives, and how this translated into their academic success. The results indicated that the implementation of simulations significantly boosted the students’ understanding, thereby leading to improved learning outcomes.

Three groups of Cu2O, ZnO, and Ag/Cu2O nanoparticles were synthesized and characterized physicochemically and confronted to P. aeruginosa and C. albicans to determine their antibacterial effect. Statistical analyses were performed using Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) (p < 0.001). The structures of Cu2O, ZnO, and Ag/Cu2O nanoparticles were spherical, sized 6 nm, 10 nm, and 50 nm for Ag, Cu2, and Zn metals, respectively. Furthermore, a 100% antibacterial and antifungal effect against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Candida albicans was observed for Cu2O, ZnO, and Ag/Cu2O nanoparticles respectively. It is concluded from these findings that the nanoparticles synthesized by biogenic and chemical route had a good size between 6 and 50 nm and that Cu2O, ZnO, and Ag/Cu2O nanoparticles presented an excellent antibacterial (100% growth inhibition) effect against P. aeruginosa and C. albicans (p < 0.001) compared to the control.","Our special acknowledgment to Luisa Juárez, Daniel Delfín, and Renny Nazario of the Universidad Privada del Norte for their support and assistance in the experimental development of the textile impregnation with nanomaterials; and to the National Nanotechnology Laboratory (LANOTEC CeNAT-Costa Rica), for the transmission electron microscopy (TEM) characterization.","Universidad Privada del Norte, project UPN-20201002.",Scientific Reports,,,Humans; Pseudomonas aeruginosa; Candida albicans; Zinc Oxide; Nanoparticles; Anti-Bacterial Agents,2023-12-06,2023,2023-12-06,,13,1,21478,All OA; Gold,Article,"Rojas-Jaimes, J.; Asmat-Campos, David","Rojas-Jaimes, J.

Nevertheless, not all people with obesity develop depression.
OBJECTIVE: To determine the factors associated with depressive symptoms among people aged 15 or older with obesity from the National Demographic and Family Health Survey (ENDES in Spanish 2019-2021).
METHODS: Cross-sectional analytical study. The outcome of interest was the presence of depressive symptoms, assessed using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9). Crude (cPR) and adjusted (aPR) prevalence ratios were estimated using GLM Poisson distribution with robust variance estimates.
RESULTS: The prevalence of depression symptoms was 6.97%. In the multivariate analysis, a statistically significant association was found between depressive symptoms and female sex (PRa: 2.59; 95% CI 1.95-3.43); mountain region (PRa: 1.51; 95% CI 1.18-1.92); wealth index poor (PRa: 1.37; 95% CI 1.05-1.79, medium (PRa: 1.49; 95% CI 1.11-2.02), and rich (PRa: 1.65; 95% CI 1.21-2.26); daily tobacco use (PRa: 2.05, 95% CI 1.09-3.87); physical disability (PRa: 1.96, 95% CI 1.07-3.57); and a history of arterial hypertension (PRa: 2.05; 95% CI 1.63-2.55).
CONCLUSION: There are several sociodemographic factors (such as being female and living in the Andean region) and individual factors (daily use of tobacco and history of hypertension) associated with depressive symptoms in Peruvian inhabitants aged 15 or older with obesity. In this study, the COVID-19 pandemic was associated with an increase in depressive symptoms.",,This research received no external funding.,International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health,,,Humans; Female; Male; Depression; Peru; Cross-Sectional Studies; Pandemics; COVID-19; Obesity; Hypertension; Surveys and Questionnaires; Prevalence,2023-01-18,2023,2023-01-18,,20,3,1816,All OA; Gold,Article,"Vera-Ponce, Víctor Juan; Torres-Malca, Jenny Raquel; Ramos, Willy; Rojas, Rubén Espinoza; Valencia, Jamee Guerra; Loayza-Castro, Joan A.; Zuzunaga-Montoya, Fiorella E.; Zeñas-Trujillo, Gianella Zulema; Cruz-Ausejo, Liliana; De La Cruz-Vargas, Jhony A.","Vera-Ponce, Víctor Juan (Instituto de Investigaciones en Ciencias Biomédicas, Universidad Ricardo Palma, Lima 15039, Peru); Torres-Malca, Jenny Raquel (Instituto de Investigaciones en Ciencias Biomédicas, Universidad Ricardo Palma, Lima 15039, Peru; Facultad de Psicología, Universidad Tecnológica del Perú, Lima 15046, Peru); Ramos, Willy (Instituto de Investigaciones en Ciencias Biomédicas, Universidad Ricardo Palma, Lima 15039, Peru; Instituto de Investigaciones Clínicas, Universidad Nacional Mayor de San Marcos, Lima 15001, Peru); Rojas, Rubén Espinoza (Instituto de Investigaciones en Ciencias Biomédicas, Universidad Ricardo Palma, Lima 15039, Peru); Valencia, Jamee Guerra (Instituto de Investigaciones en Ciencias Biomédicas, Universidad Ricardo Palma, Lima 15039, Peru; Facultad de Ciencias de la Salud, Universidad Privada del Norte, Lima 15314, Peru); Loayza-Castro, Joan A.

In this work, we first attempted to describe different algorithms to estimate neural complexity in a simple manner understandable for psychiatrists, psychologists, and neuroscientists. Then, we reviewed the findings of the brain complexity analysis in psychiatric disorders and their clinical implications. Method : A non-systematic comprehensive literature search was conducted for original studies on the complexity analysis of neurophysiological signals such as electroencephalogram, magnetoencephalogram, and blood-oxygen-level-dependent obtained from functional magnetic resonance imaging or functional near infrared spectroscopy. The search encompassed online scientific databases such as PubMed and Google Scholar. Results: Complexity measures mainly include entropy-based methods, the correlation dimension, fractal dimension, Lempel-Ziv complexity, and the Lyapunov exponent. There are important differences in the physical notions between these measures. Our literature review shows that dementia, autism, and adult ADHD exhibit less complexity in their neurophysiologic signals than healthy controls. However, children with ADHD, drug-naïve young schizophrenic patients with positive symptoms, and patients with mood disorders (i.e., depression and bipolar disorder) exhibit higher complexity in their neurophysiologic signals compared to healthy controls. In addition, contradictory findings still exist in some psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia regarding brain complexity, which can be due to technical issues, large heterogeneity in psychiatric disorders, and interference of typical factors. Conclusion: In summary, complexity analysis may present a new dimension to understanding psychiatric disorders. While complexity analysis is still far from having practical applications in routine clinical settings, complexity science can play an important role in comprehending the system dynamics of psychiatric disorders.",The authors thank the institutions where they work for encouraging the development of research.,,Iranian Journal of Psychiatry,,,,2023-09-18,2023,2023-09-18,2023-10,18,4,493-502,All OA; Gold,Article,"Hernández, Ronald Miguel; Ponce-Meza, Jacqueline Cynthia; Saavedra-López, Miguel Ángel; Ugaz, Walter Antonio Campos; Chanduvi, Roxana Monteza; Monteza, Walter Campos","Hernández, Ronald Miguel (Universidad Privada Norbert Wiener, Lima, Perú.); Ponce-Meza, Jacqueline Cynthia (Universidad Privada del Norte, Lima, Perú.); Saavedra-López, Miguel Ángel (Universidad Continental, Huancayo, Perú.); Ugaz, Walter Antonio Campos (Universidad Nacional Pedro Ruiz Gallo, Lambayeque, Perú.); Chanduvi, Roxana Monteza (Universidad Católica Santo Toribio de Mogrovejo, Chiclayo, Perú.); Monteza, Walter Campos (Universidad de San Martin de Porres, Lima, Perú.)","Hernández, Ronald Miguel (Universidad Norbert Wiener)","Hernández, Ronald Miguel (Universidad Norbert Wiener); Ponce-Meza, Jacqueline Cynthia (Private University of the North); Saavedra-López, Miguel Ángel (Universidad Continental); Ugaz, Walter Antonio Campos (Universidad Nacional Pedro Ruíz Gallo); Chanduvi, Roxana Monteza (Universidad Católica Santo Toribio de Mogrovejo); Monteza, Walter Campos (Universidad de San Martín de Porres)",3,3,,,https://doi.org/10.18502/ijps.v18i4.13637,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1164390369,52 Psychology; 5202 Biological Psychology,

Among the new detection proposals, the use of peptides mimetics has surged as an alternative to avoid the use of antibodies, of which there has been a shortage during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the use of peptides in detection systems still presents some questions to be answered, mainly referring to their stability under different environmental conditions. In this work, we synthesized an ACE2 peptide mimic and evaluated its stability in different pH, salinity, polarity, and temperature conditions. Further, the same conditions were assessed when using the ability of the peptide mimic to detect the recombinant SARS-CoV-2 spike protein in a biotin-streptavidin-enzyme-linked assay. Finally, we also tested the capacity of the peptide to detect SARS-CoV-2 from patients' samples. The results indicate that the peptide is structurally sensitive to the medium conditions, with relevance to the pH, where basic pH favored its performance when used as a SARS-CoV-2 detector. Further, the proposed peptide mimic was able to detect SARS-CoV-2 comparably to RT-qPCR results. Therefore, the present study promotes knowledge advancement, particularly in terms of stability considerations, in the application of peptide mimics as a replacement for antibodies in detection systems.",,"This research was funded by Joint Biotechnology Research Projects at COVID-19, ANID CHILE—CONCYTEC PERÚ, grant number covbio0011.",Biosensors,,,"Humans; COVID-19; SARS-CoV-2; Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2; RNA, Viral; Pandemics; Peptides; Protein Binding",2023-04-13,2023,2023-04-13,,13,4,473,All OA; Gold,Article,"Santana, Paula A; Álvarez, Claudio A; Valenzuela, Santiago; Manchego, Alberto; Guzmán, Fanny; Tirapegui, Cristian; Ahumada, Manuel","Santana, Paula A (Instituto de Ciencias Químicas Aplicadas, Facultad de Ingeniería, Universidad Autónoma de Chile, el Llano Subercaseaux 2801, San Miguel, Santiago 8910272, Chile.); Álvarez, Claudio A (Laboratorio de Fisiología y Genética Marina, Centro de Estudios Avanzados en Zonas Áridas, Larrondo 1281, Coquimbo 1780000, Chile.; Facultad de Ciencias del Mar, Universidad Católica del Norte, Larrondo 1281, Coquimbo 1780000, Chile.); Valenzuela, Santiago (Instituto de Ciencias Químicas Aplicadas, Facultad de Ingeniería, Universidad Autónoma de Chile, el Llano Subercaseaux 2801, San Miguel, Santiago 8910272, Chile.); Manchego, Alberto (Laboratorio de Microbiología, Facultad de Medicina Veterinaria y Parasitología Veterinaria, Universidad Nacional Mayor de San Marcos, Lima 3673, Peru.); Guzmán, Fanny (Núcleo Biotecnología Curauma, Pontificia Universidad Católica de Valparaíso, Valparaíso 2373223, Chile.); Tirapegui, Cristian (Instituto de Ciencias Químicas Aplicadas, Facultad de Ingeniería, Universidad Autónoma de Chile, el Llano Subercaseaux 2801, San Miguel, Santiago 8910272, Chile.); Ahumada, Manuel (Escuela de Biotecnología, Facultad de Ciencias, Ingeniería y Tecnología, Universidad Mayor, Camino La Piramide 5750, Huechuraba, Santiago 8910272, Chile.; Centro de Nanotecnología Aplicada, Facultad de Ciencias, Ingeniería y Tecnología, Universidad Mayor, Camino La Piramide 5750, Huechuraba, Santiago 8910272, Chile.)","Álvarez, Claudio A (Laboratorio de Fisiología y Genética Marina, Centro de Estudios Avanzados en Zonas Áridas, Larrondo 1281, Coquimbo 1780000, Chile.; Catholic University of the North); Ahumada, Manuel (Universidad Mayor; Universidad Mayor)","Santana, Paula A (Universidad Autónoma de Chile); Álvarez, Claudio A (Laboratorio de Fisiología y Genética Marina, Centro de Estudios Avanzados en Zonas Áridas, Larrondo 1281, Coquimbo 1780000, Chile.; Catholic University of the North); Valenzuela, Santiago (Universidad Autónoma de Chile); Manchego, Alberto (National University of San Marcos); Guzmán, Fanny (Pontificial Catholic University of Valparaiso); Tirapegui, Cristian (Universidad Autónoma de Chile); Ahumada, Manuel (Universidad Mayor; Universidad Mayor)",3,3,,,https://www.mdpi.com/2079-6374/13/4/473/pdf?version=1681371393,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1157237434,31 Biological Sciences; 34 Chemical Sciences; 3401 Analytical Chemistry,3 Good Health and Well Being

Our aim was to compare the subjective well-being, life satisfaction, mental status, and social support of representative samples of adults living in segregated settlements (colonies) and identifying as Roma with those of the general population in Hungary.
Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted with random samples of 417 individuals from the general Hungarian adult population (55.6% female, mean age = 43.89 ± 12.61 years) and 394 adults living in segregated settlements (colonies) (73.9% female, mean age = 42.37 ± 12.39 years). Demographic questions were used as well as the WHO Well-Being Index (WBI-5), the single item Life Satisfaction Scale, the 12-item version of the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12), and the Oslo Social Support Scale (OSSS-3).
Results: Residents of colonies reported significantly lower levels of subjective well-being and life satisfaction than the general population. The proportion of individuals at high risk for mental morbidity was more than twice as high among colony dwellers (16.4%) as in non-colony dwellers (7.6%). Similar unfavorable differences were seen at the expense of self-identified Roma compared to self-identified Hungarians but no difference was found in terms of social support either by type of residence or ethnicity. 32.2% of colony-dwellers self-identified themselves as Hungarian. Mental health assessed by principal component was directly determined by settlement type of permanent residence, age, educational attainment, employment, financial status, and social support but not ethnic identity.
Conclusion: The study based on representative data shows that residents of segregated settlements are in worse mental health than those not living in colonies; that housing segregation is not limited to Roma people, and that housing conditions and financial status are major social determinants of mental health for which data must be collected to avoid using self-reported Roma identity as a proxy measure of socioeconomic deprivation.",,"The project was co-financed by the European Union under European Regional Development Fund (GINOP-2.3.2-15-2016-00005), as well as by the Hungarian Academy of Sciences (MTA11010 and TK2016-78).

Thus, our study aimed to assess the factors associated with not receiving the primary series and booster dose of the COVID-19 vaccine among Venezuelan migrants in Peru.
METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study based on secondary data analysis of the 2022 Venezuelan Population Residing in Peru Survey. Our population included Venezuelan migrants and refugees over 18 years old living in Peru with complete information for the variables of interest. Two outcome variables were assessed: not receiving the primary series and not receiving the booster dose of the COVID-19 vaccine. Crude and adjusted prevalences were calculated with 95% confidence intervals.
RESULTS: A total of 7,727 Venezuelan adults were included in our study, of whom 6,511 completed the primary series. The overall COVID-19 vaccination coverage of the primary series was 84.17%, whilst the coverage of the booster dose was 28.06%. Being younger, uninsured, illegally-staying, and having a low educational level were associated with both outcomes.

The selection and identification of data involved a systematic search resulting in 1245 articles for bibliometric analysis after applying the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Strategic diagrams, overlay graphs, and evolution maps were used to analyze the trends and themes in different periods. The analysis reveals the emergence and evolution of various themes and their interconnections. In the early periods, the focus was on energy market issues, distributed generation, and the control of Distributed Energy Resources. Themes such as microgrids, renewable energy, electric vehicles, and economic analysis have gained prominence over time. The present study also identified the introduction of new concepts such as prosumers, collaborative networks, and dynamic power plants in later periods. The performance analysis for the last period (2022) highlighted the centrality and density of themes such as power plants, renewable power plants, battery energy storage systems, and robust optimization. These themes are considered both fundamental and transverse in the research field. This study discusses the importance of VPPs and battery energy storage systems in addressing grid intermittency issues and providing auxiliary market services. The analysis also emphasized the management of the demand side and the integration of electric vehicles and Building Energy Management Systems in VPPs. Therefore, future directions for VPP research include innovative structures and topologies, big-data analysis, and diversified optimization techniques. This study provides insights into the evolution and current state of research in the field of VPPs and identifies areas for further exploration and development.",Declaration of competing interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.,No specific grants were received from any funding agency for this study.,Heliyon,,,,2023-09-09,2023,2023-09-09,2023-09,9,9,e19962,All OA; Gold,Article,"Zarate-Perez, Eliseo; Grados, Juan; Rubiños, Santiago; Solis-Tipian, Martin; Cuzcano-Rivas, Abilio; Astocondor-Villar, Jacob; Grados-Espinoza, Herbert","Zarate-Perez, Eliseo (Departmento de Ingeniería, Universidad Privada del Norte (UPN), Av.

FASD are the most common environmentally induced birth defect and are highly variable. The genetics of an individual influence the severity of their FASD phenotype. However, the genes that sensitize an individual to ethanol-induced birth defects are largely unknown. The ethanol-sensitive mouse substrain, C57/B6J, carries several known mutations including one in Nicotinamide nucleotide transhydrogenase (Nnt). Nnt is a mitochondrial transhydrogenase thought to have an important role in detoxifying reactive oxygen species (ROS) and ROS has been implicated in ethanol teratogenesis. To directly test the role of Nnt in ethanol teratogenesis, we generated zebrafish nnt mutants via CRISPR/Cas9. Zebrafish embryos were dosed with varying concentrations of ethanol across different timepoints and assessed for craniofacial malformations. We utilized a ROS assay to determine if this could be a contributing factor of these malformations. We found that exposed and unexposed mutants had higher levels of ROS compared to their wildtype counterparts. When treated with ethanol, nnt mutants experienced elevated apoptosis in the brain and neural crest, a defect that was rescued by administration of the antioxidant, N-acetyl cysteine (NAC). NAC treatment also rescued most craniofacial malformations. Altogether this research demonstrates that ethanol-induced oxidative stress leads to craniofacial and neural defects due to apoptosis in nnt mutants. This research further supports the growing body of evidence implicating oxidative stress in ethanol teratogenesis. These findings suggest that antioxidants can be used as a potential therapeutic in the treatment of FASD.","We would like to thank Mary Swartz (lab manager) and Angela Martinez, Cadianna Garcia, Kathryn Thompson, and Nika Sarraf (fish facility technicians) for their support of this research.

Here, we aimed to investigate whether arcuate fasciculus (AF) development is associated with pre-reading language skills in young children with PAE.
Methods: A total of 51 children with confirmed PAE (25 males; 5.6 ± 1.1 years) and 116 unexposed controls (57 males; 4.6 ± 1.2 years) underwent longitudinal diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), for a total of 111 scans from participants with PAE and 381 scans in the unexposed control group. We delineated the left and right AF and extracted mean fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD). Pre-reading language ability was assessed using age-standardized phonological processing (PP) and speeded naming (SN) scores of the NEPSY-II. Linear mixed effects models were run to determine the relationship between diffusion metrics and age, group, sex, and age-by-group interactions, with subject modeled as a random factor. A secondary mixed effect model analysis assessed the influence of white matter microstructure and PAE on pre-reading language ability using diffusion metric-by-age-by-group interactions, with 51 age- and sex-matched unexposed controls.
Results: Phonological processing (PP) and SN scores were significantly lower in the PAE group (p < 0.001). In the right AF, there were significant age-by-group interactions for FA (p < 0.001) and MD (p = 0.0173). In the left AF, there was a nominally significant age-by-group interaction for MD that failed to survive correction (p = 0.0418). For the pre-reading analysis, a significant diffusion-by-age-by-group interaction was found for left FA (p = 0.0029) in predicting SN scores, and for the right FA (p = 0.00691) in predicting PP scores.
Discussion: Children with PAE showed altered developmental trajectories for the AF, compared with unexposed controls. Children with PAE, regardless of age, showed altered brain-language relationships that resembled those seen in younger typically developing children. Our findings support the contention that altered developmental trajectories in the AF may be associated with functional outcomes in young children with PAE.",We acknowledge the contributions of the APrON Study Team.

Nowadays, it has become crucial to identify novel plant larvicides with an eco-friendly impact. The components of essential oils from Croton linearis Jacq. (EO-Cl), Lantana involucrata L. (EO-Li), Ocimum sanctum var. cubensis M. Gómez. (EO-Os), and Zanthoxylum pistaciifolium Griseb. (syn. Zanthoxylum flavum subsp. pistaciifolium (Griseb.) Reynel (EO-Zp) were determined using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis. Larvicidal and adulticidal bioassays against Aedes aegypti, Anopheles albitarsis and Culex quinquefasciatus, were performed according to the World Health Organization standard methods. A high diversity of compounds was identified in the four oils, with a total of 152 compounds (33-70 components). EO-Cl, EO-Li, and EO-Os were classified as active against both insect forms, larvae and adults. Lantana involucrata showed the best results, with LC50 values from 33.8 to 41.7 mg/L. In most of the cases, it was not possible to associate the main compounds with the measured activity, supporting the hypothesis about probable synergistic interactions among major and minor compounds. The results indicate EO-Cl, EO-Os, and EO-Li as good eco-friendly insecticides with potential.",Authors gratefully acknowledge the Arthropoda Laboratory of the Federal University of Amapá and the Chemical Analysis Laboratory of the Toxicology and Biomedicine Centre (TOXIMED).,This research received no external funding.,Plants,,,,2023-11-29,2023,2023-11-29,,12,23,4009,All OA; Gold,Article,"García-Díaz, Jesús; Souto, Raimundo Nonato Picanço; Escalona-Arranz, Julio César; Dos Anjos Ferreira, Ricardo Marcelo; Da Costa, Tiago Silva; González-Fernández, Rosalia; Heredia-Díaz, Yamile; Chil-Núñez, Idelsy; de la Vega, Jorge; Monzote, Lianet; de Carvalho Queiroz, Margareth Maria; Setzer, William N.","García-Díaz, Jesús (Department of Basic-Biomedical Sciences, Faculty of Nursing-Health Technology, University of Medical Sciences, Carretera del Caney Km 2 1/2, Santiago de Cuba 90100, Cuba;, jgadi1990@gmail.com; Pharmacy Department, Natural and Exacts Sciences Faculty, Oriente University, Avenida Patricio Lumumba s/n, Santiago de Cuba 90500, Cuba;, yherediad@gmail.com, (Y.H.-D.);, idelsychil@gmail.com, (I.C.-N.)); Souto, Raimundo Nonato Picanço (Laboratory of Arthropoda, Department of Biology and Health Sciences, Universidade Federal do Amapá, Rodovia Jucelino Kubitschek, Km 02, Macapá 68902-280, AP, Brazil;, nonatoiepa@hotmail.com, (R.N.P.S.);, rmaferreira@unifap.br, (R.M.D.A.F.)); Escalona-Arranz, Julio César (Pharmacy Department, Natural and Exacts Sciences Faculty, Oriente University, Avenida Patricio Lumumba s/n, Santiago de Cuba 90500, Cuba;, yherediad@gmail.com, (Y.H.-D.);, idelsychil@gmail.com, (I.C.-N.); Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Faculty of Sciences, Universidad Católica del Norte, Angamos, Antofagasta 0610, Chile); Dos Anjos Ferreira, Ricardo Marcelo (Laboratory of Arthropoda, Department of Biology and Health Sciences, Universidade Federal do Amapá, Rodovia Jucelino Kubitschek, Km 02, Macapá 68902-280, AP, Brazil;, nonatoiepa@hotmail.com, (R.N.P.S.);, rmaferreira@unifap.br, (R.M.D.A.F.)); Da Costa, Tiago Silva (Laboratório de Arthropoda, Universidade Federal do Amapá, Campus Universitário Marco Zero do Equador, Rodovia Juscelino Kubitschek de Oliveira, Km 02, Bairro Zerão, Macapá 68902-280, AP, Brazil;, tiago_sc@hotmail.com; Programa de Pós-Graduação em Biodiversidade Tropical (PPGBIO), Universidade Federal do Amapá (UNIFAP), Macapá 68903-419, AP, Brazil); González-Fernández, Rosalia (Toxicology and Biomedicine Centre (TOXIMED), University of Medical Science, Autopista Nacional Km 1½ s/n, Santiago de Cuba 90400, Cuba;, rosaliagonzalez.9110@gmail.com, (R.G.-F.);, jitodelavega@gmail.com, (J.d.l.V.)); Heredia-Díaz, Yamile (Pharmacy Department, Natural and Exacts Sciences Faculty, Oriente University, Avenida Patricio Lumumba s/n, Santiago de Cuba 90500, Cuba;, yherediad@gmail.com, (Y.H.-D.);, idelsychil@gmail.com, (I.C.-N.)); Chil-Núñez, Idelsy (Pharmacy Department, Natural and Exacts Sciences Faculty, Oriente University, Avenida Patricio Lumumba s/n, Santiago de Cuba 90500, Cuba;, yherediad@gmail.com, (Y.H.-D.);, idelsychil@gmail.com, (I.C.-N.); Laboratory of Arthropoda, Department of Biology and Health Sciences, Universidade Federal do Amapá, Rodovia Jucelino Kubitschek, Km 02, Macapá 68902-280, AP, Brazil;, nonatoiepa@hotmail.com, (R.N.P.S.);, rmaferreira@unifap.br, (R.M.D.A.F.)); de la Vega, Jorge (Toxicology and Biomedicine Centre (TOXIMED), University of Medical Science, Autopista Nacional Km 1½ s/n, Santiago de Cuba 90400, Cuba;, rosaliagonzalez.9110@gmail.com, (R.G.-F.);, jitodelavega@gmail.com, (J.d.l.V.)); Monzote, Lianet (Department of Parasitology, Institute of Tropical Medicine “Pedro Kourí”, Apartado Postal No. 601, Marianao 13, La Habana 10400, Cuba;, monzote@ipk.sld.cu; Research Network Natural Products against Neglected Diseases (ResNetNPND), 48149 Münster, Germany); de Carvalho Queiroz, Margareth Maria (Laboratory of Medical and Forensic Entomology, Instituto Oswaldo Cruz, IOC/FIOCRUZ, Rio de Janeiro 21040-360, RJ, Brazil;, mmcqueiroz@ioc.fiocruz.br; Programa de Pós-Graduação—Mestrado Profissional em Ciências Ambientais, Universidade de Vassouras—FUSVE, Av.

On the other hand, the written communication competence (CE_PRO) generates a minor contribution to the model. In addition, the most relevant result of the research is the design and validation of a tool to estimate educational efficiency using the efficiency analysis tree (EAT) and data enveloping analysis (DEA) models. The proposed tool allows the generation of specific targets to increase the level of efficiency of universities through the nodes of the decision tree, which contributes to the spectrum of knowledge on models for educational management. In conclusion, this research presents a tool for the management of educational processes through the analysis of efficiency using EAT, estimating the efficiency of universities and setting the foundations for forecasting future efficiency scenarios.",,,International Journal of Electrical and Computer Engineering (IJECE),,,,2023-08-01,2023,2023-08-01,,13,4,4412-4421,All OA; Gold,Article,"Zuluaga-Ortiz, Rohemi; Camelo-Guarin, Alicia; Delahoz-Domínguez, Enrique","Zuluaga-Ortiz, Rohemi (Universidad del Sinú); Camelo-Guarin, Alicia (Escuela Militar de Cadetes Jose Maria Cordova); Delahoz-Domínguez, Enrique (Universidad Tecnológica de Bolívar)",,"Zuluaga-Ortiz, Rohemi (Universidad del Sinú); Camelo-Guarin, Alicia (Escuela Militar de Cadetes Jose Maria Cordova); Delahoz-Domínguez, Enrique (Universidad Tecnológica de Bolívar)",3,3,,,https://ijece.iaescore.com/index.php/IJECE/article/download/29304/16721,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1156934009,40 Engineering; 46 Information and Computing Sciences,4 Quality Education

This work aimed to study the corrosion of reinforced A630-420H steel when exposed to a 0.5 M NaCl solution. Although this carbon steel is the most widely used material for reinforced concrete structures in Chile, there is limited research on its resistance to corrosion when in contact with saline solutions. The electrochemical reactions and their roles in the corrosion rate were studied using linear sweep voltammetry, weight loss, scanning electron microscopy, and X-ray diffraction techniques. This analysis is unique as it used the superposition model based on mixed potential theory to determine the electrochemical and corrosion parameters. The outcomes of this study show that A630-420H steel has a higher corrosion rate than those of the other commercial carbon steels studied. This fact can be attributed to the competition between the cathodic oxygen reduction reaction and hydrogen evolution reaction, which also depends on the environmental conditions, exposure time, stabilization of the corrosion products layer, and presence of chloride ions. Additionally, the results under mechanical stress conditions show a brittle fracture of the corrosion product oriented longitudinally in the direction of the bend section, where the presence of pores and cracks were also observed. The corrosion products after corrosion were mainly composed of magnetite and lepidocrocite oxide phases, which is in concordance with the electrochemical results.","The authors wish to thank the Departamento de Ingeniería en Metalurgia of the Universidad de Atacama, Chile, for the XRD and SEM analyses (projects: EQM 130125, EQUV 003, EQUR 16002, and DIUDAQUIP-2017) and Maria P.

In this work, the removal of clay suspensions has been investigated using an electroflotation (EF) process with titanium electrodes. The results show that EF is a viable and novel alternative for removing ultrafine particles of kaolinite-type clay present in sedimentation tank overflows with low salt concentrations (<0.1 mol/L) in copper mining facilities based on the saline water splitting concept. Maximum suspended solid removal values of 91.4 and 83.2% in NaCl and KCl solutions, respectively, were obtained under the experimental conditions of the constant applied potential of 20 V/SHE, salinity concentration of 0.1 mol/L, and electroflotation time of 10 and 20 min in NaCl and KCl solutions, respectively. Furthermore, the visual evidence of particle aggregation by flocculation during the experiments indicates a synergy between EF and electrocoagulation (EC) that enhances the removal of ultrafine particles of kaolinite.","The authors thank Renato Acosta-Flores and the Scientific Equipment Unit (MAINI) from Universidad Católica del Norte, Antofagasta, Chile, for the FE-SEM analyses, and the authors thank the support of ANID through Fondecyt program grant no. 11230550.",This research received no external funding.,Molecules,,,,2023-05-08,2023,2023-05-08,,28,9,3954,All OA; Gold,Article,"Madrid, Felipe M Galleguillos; Arancibia-Bravo, María P; Sepúlveda, Felipe D; Lucay, Freddy A; Soliz, Alvaro; Cáceres, Luis","Madrid, Felipe M Galleguillos (Centro de Desarrollo Energético Antofagasta, Universidad de Antofagasta, Antofagasta 1240000, Chile.); Arancibia-Bravo, María P (Departamento de Química, Universidad Católica del Norte, Antofagasta 1240000, Chile.); Sepúlveda, Felipe D (Departamento de Ingeniería en Minas, Universidad de Antofagasta, Antofagasta 1240000, Chile.); Lucay, Freddy A (Escuela de Ingeniería Química, Pontificia Universidad Católica de Valparaíso, Valparaíso 2374631, Chile.); Soliz, Alvaro (Departamento de Ingeniería en Metalurgia, Universidad de Atacama, Copiapó 1531772, Chile.); Cáceres, Luis (Departamento de Ingeniería Química y Procesos de Minerales, Universidad de Antofagasta, Antofagasta 1240000, Chile.)","Madrid, Felipe M Galleguillos (University of Antofagasta); Arancibia-Bravo, María P (Catholic University of the North)","Madrid, Felipe M Galleguillos (University of Antofagasta); Arancibia-Bravo, María P (Catholic University of the North); Sepúlveda, Felipe D (University of Antofagasta); Lucay, Freddy A (Pontificial Catholic University of Valparaiso); Soliz, Alvaro (University of Atacama); Cáceres, Luis (University of Antofagasta)",3,3,,,https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/28/9/3954/pdf?version=1683533875,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1157874235,34 Chemical Sciences; 3404 Medicinal and Biomolecular Chemistry; 3405 Organic Chemistry,

In the course of this, two not yet reported halophilic strains designated ATCHAT and ATCH28T were isolated from hypersaline, alkaline surface waters of Salar de Llamará and Laguna Lejía, respectively. The alkaline environment limits iron bioavailability, suggesting that native organisms produce abundant siderophores to sequester iron.
Methods: Both strains were characterized by polyphasic approach. Comparative analysis of the 16S rRNA gene sequences revealed their affiliation with the genus Halomonas. ATCHAT showed close similarity to Halomonas salicampi and Halomonas vilamensis, while ATCH28T was related closest to Halomonas ventosae and Halomonas salina. The ability of both strains to secrete siderophores was initially assessed using the chromeazurol S (CAS) liquid assay and subsequently further investigated through genomic analysis and NMR. Furthermore, the effect of various media components on the siderophore secretion by strain ATCH28T was explored.
Results: The CAS assay confirmed the ability of both strains to produce iron-binding compounds. Genomic analysis of strain ATCHAT revealed the presence of a not yet reported NRPS-dependant gene cluster responsible for the secretion of siderophore. However, as only small amounts of siderophore were secreted, further investigations did not lie within the scope of this study. Via NMR and genomic analysis, strain ATCH28T has been determined to produce desferrioxamine E (DFOE). Although this siderophore is common in various terrestrial microorganisms, it has not yet been reported to occur within Halomonas, making strain ATCH28T the first member of the genus to produce a non-amphiphilic siderophore. By means of media optimization, the produced quantity of DFOE could be increased to more than 1000 µM.
Discussion: Phenotypic and genotypic characteristics clearly differentiated both strains from other members of the genus Halomonas. Average nucleotide identity (ANI) values and DNA-DNA relatedness indicated that the strains represented two novel species. Therefore, both species should be added as new representatives of the genus Halomonas, for which the designations Halomonas llamarensis sp. nov. (type strain ATCHAT = DSM 114476 = LMG 32709) and Halomonas gemina sp. nov. (type strain ATCH28T = DSM 114418 = LMG 32708) are proposed.",,"This study was conducted as part of the SIDEREC project, supported by the ERA-MIN 2 call (German grant number 033RU01 0A and Chilean grant number Nº51-ANID).",Frontiers in Microbiology,,,,2023-06-12,2023,2023-06-12,,14,,1194916,All OA; Gold,Article,"Hintersatz, Christian; Singh, Shalini; Rojas, Luis Antonio; Kretzschmar, Jerome; Wei, Sean Ting-Shyang; Khambhati, Khushal; Kutschke, Sabine; Lehmann, Falk; Singh, Vijai; Jain, Rohan; Pollmann, Katrin","Hintersatz, Christian (Department of Biotechnology, Helmholtz Institute Freiberg for Resource Technology, Helmholtz-Zentrum Dresden-Rossendorf, Dresden, Germany); Singh, Shalini (Department of Biotechnology, Helmholtz Institute Freiberg for Resource Technology, Helmholtz-Zentrum Dresden-Rossendorf, Dresden, Germany); Rojas, Luis Antonio (Department of Chemistry, Universidad Católica del Norte, Antofagasta, Chile); Kretzschmar, Jerome (Department of Actinide Thermodynamics, Institute of Resource Ecology, Helmholtz-Zentrum Dresden-Rossendorf, Dresden, Germany); Wei, Sean Ting-Shyang (Department of Biogeochemistry, Institute of Resource Ecology, Helmholtz-Zentrum Dresden-Rossendorf, Dresden, Germany); Khambhati, Khushal (Department of Biosciences, School of Science, Indrashil University, Mehsana, India); Kutschke, Sabine (Department of Biotechnology, Helmholtz Institute Freiberg for Resource Technology, Helmholtz-Zentrum Dresden-Rossendorf, Dresden, Germany); Lehmann, Falk (Department of Biotechnology, Helmholtz Institute Freiberg for Resource Technology, Helmholtz-Zentrum Dresden-Rossendorf, Dresden, Germany); Singh, Vijai (Department of Biosciences, School of Science, Indrashil University, Mehsana, India); Jain, Rohan (Department of Biotechnology, Helmholtz Institute Freiberg for Resource Technology, Helmholtz-Zentrum Dresden-Rossendorf, Dresden, Germany); Pollmann, Katrin (Department of Biotechnology, Helmholtz Institute Freiberg for Resource Technology, Helmholtz-Zentrum Dresden-Rossendorf, Dresden, Germany)","Jain, Rohan (Helmholtz-Zentrum Dresden-Rossendorf)","Hintersatz, Christian (Helmholtz-Zentrum Dresden-Rossendorf); Singh, Shalini (Helmholtz-Zentrum Dresden-Rossendorf); Rojas, Luis Antonio (Catholic University of the North); Kretzschmar, Jerome (Helmholtz-Zentrum Dresden-Rossendorf); Wei, Sean Ting-Shyang (Helmholtz-Zentrum Dresden-Rossendorf); Khambhati, Khushal (Indrashil University); Kutschke, Sabine (Helmholtz-Zentrum Dresden-Rossendorf); Lehmann, Falk (Helmholtz-Zentrum Dresden-Rossendorf); Singh, Vijai (Indrashil University); Jain, Rohan (Helmholtz-Zentrum Dresden-Rossendorf); Pollmann, Katrin (Helmholtz-Zentrum Dresden-Rossendorf)",3,3,,,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2023.1194916/pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1159721051,31 Biological Sciences; 3105 Genetics; 3107 Microbiology,

Moreover, these systems provide essential ecosystem services (e.g., recreation, food provisioning, protection against natural hazards). The present study focuses on the socio-ecological system at the delta of the Magdalena River in the central Caribbean Region in Colombia. This research seeks to assess the multidimensional sustainability of the Magdalena river-mouth system (MRm-SES) to improve the knowledge basis for its integrated management. To do so, an assessment tool named “Circles of Coastal Sustainability” (CCS) was used to evaluate the system splitting it into four domains (environmental, social, economic and governance) that were divided into 5 categories each. These domains were evaluated through a total of 52 indicators distributed like this: 16 for the Environmental domain, 16 for the Economic domain, 12 for the Social and Cultural domain and, 8 for the Governance domain. The results show that the overall sustainability of the MRm-SES is classified as “Satisfactory.” None of the domains is in “Excellent” or “Bad” conditions. However, the evaluation of the categories shows that four (4) of them have “Poor” conditions (i.e., Social Benefits, Demographics, Economic Security, and Resources Management). Hence, it is recommended to put those categories at the centre of the discussion to define management strategies (e.g., Preserving and restoring habitats; tackling sources of pollution and excessive sediment; local reduction of net Greenhouse Gas and adaptation to climate change; participation of local communities in the management design and implementation), without disregarding the interrelation with the other categories and dimensions. Finally, it is argued that despite all the improvement opportunities, the CCS is a valuable tool to evaluate and communicate with different stakeholders (academic community, managers and decision-makers, local communities, etc.), to improve the sustainability of coastal systems in Colombia and the world.","The authors thank Natalia M.

The discourses of 13 workers between 25 and 62 years old were obtained through individual and group interviews. The findings constitute an axis of the research Fondecyt 1180079 carried out in Antofagasta, the region with the highest mining production in Chile and the third largest in the world. The conclusions reveal notions of bodily habitus, mediated by gender hierarchies, where binary masculinity is accentuated, reproducing the extractive logic of the industry in the workers themselves.

In this study, dehydrated red cabbage was evaluated as a novel source of bio-compounds with neuroprotective capacity. Convective drying was carried out at different temperatures. Total phenolics (TPC), flavonoids (TFC), anthocyanins (TAC), and glucosinolates (TGC) were determined using spectrophotometry, amino acid profile by LC-DAD and fatty acid profile by GC-FID. Phenolic characterization was determined by liquid chromatography-high-resolution mass spectrometry. Cytotoxicity and neuroprotection assays were evaluated in SH-SY5Y human cells, observing the effect on preformed fibrils of α-synuclein. Drying kinetic confirmed a shorter processing time with temperature increase. A high concentration of bio-compounds was observed, especially at 90 °C, with TPC = 1544.04 ± 11.4 mg GAE/100 g, TFC = 690.87 ± 4.0 mg QE/100 g and TGC = 5244.9 ± 260.2 µmol SngE/100 g. TAC degraded with temperature. Glutamic acid and arginine were predominant. Fatty acid profiles were relatively stable and were found to be mostly C18:3n3. The neochlorogenic acid was predominant.

Method: cross-sectional, quantitative, exploratory, correlational, conducted from June 2019 to February 2020. Data on personal characteristics, life habits and working conditions were obtained with the application of a questionnaire. To assess stress, the Nurses’ Stress Inventory (Inventário de Estresse em Enfermeiros) was used and, for suffering, the Pleasure and Suffering Indicators at Work Scale was applied, both in the Brazilian versions. Results: stress was associated with dissatisfaction with remuneration, indicators of suffering and interest in changing jobs and professions. The comparisons between the indicators of suffering and the domains of stress investigation were significant. Conclusion: the stress experienced in nurses' work activity is strongly influenced by low remuneration, leading them to wish to change jobs and professions. Professional burnout and lack of recognition are stressors that drive defense mechanisms, among them, the desire to change jobs.

An energetic trade-off between development-associated demands and immune capacity has been observed. Given that highly unsaturated fatty acids (HUFAs) are essential nutrients for larval development, we evaluated the effect of diets based on microalgae low and high in HUFAs (LH and HH, respectively) on the energetic condition and the immune response of scallop larvae. The results showed that the HH diet increased cellular membrane fluidity in veliger larvae. The routine respiration rate was 64% higher in the HH-fed veligers than in the LH-fed veligers. Additionally, the metabolic capacity tended to be higher in the HH-fed veligers than in the LH-fed veligers after the Vibrio challenge. After the challenge, the HH-fed veligers presented higher transcript induction of ApTLR (immune receptor) and ApGlys (immune effector) genes, and the HH-fed pediveligers presented higher induction of ApLBP/BPI1 (antimicrobial immune effector) gene, than the LH-fed larvae. Furthermore, the HH-fed veligers controlled total Vibrio proliferation (maintaining near basal levels) after the bacterial challenge, while the LH-fed veligers were not able to control this proliferation, which increased three-fold. Finally, the HH-fed larvae showed 20-25% higher growth and survival rates than the LH-fed veligers. Overall, the results indicated that the administration of a HH diet increases cell membrane fluidity and energy metabolic capacity, which in turn enhances immunity and the ability to control Vibrio proliferation. The administration of microalgae high in HUFAs would be a promising strategy for improving scallop larval production efficiency.","We would like to thank the Laboratorio Central de Cultivos Marinos of the UCN for providing the infrastructure for carrying out the experiments, and especially German Lira and Daniel Aguilera for animal maintenance.

OBJECTIVE: To compare hospitalization and mortality rates during the pandemic among chronic hemodialysis (HD) patients and the general population in Lima (Peru).
METHODS: This retrospective cohort included an assessment of the database of chronic HD patients of the health service providers of the social health insurance benefit networks of Lima and Callao between 2019 and 2021. Hospitalization and mortality rates were obtained for every 1,000 individuals, and variations in the percentages of COVID-19 cases and deaths were calculated. These rates were compared with those of the general population data and standardized by age and sex.
RESULTS: An average of 3,937 chronic HD patients were evaluated each month. Of these, 4.8% had COVID-19 and 64.97% were mild cases. The hospitalization rates per 1,000 patients were 19.5, 29.28, and 36.7 in 2019, 2020, and 2021, respectively. The mortality rates per 1,000 patients were 5.9, 9.74, and 11.49 in 2019, 2020, and 2021, respectively. When compared to the standardized general population, the peaks of both rates coincided with the plateaus of the waves during the pandemic. The hospitalization rate for COVID-19 was 12 times higher in HD patients than in the general population, and the mortality rate for COVID-19 was twice as high.
CONCLUSION: HD patients had higher hospitalization and standardized mortality rates than the general population.

This research program is based on a community-based literacies framework that addresses all members (program leaders, graduate students, undergraduate students, and young students) as co-learners. This study explores the largely unknown experiences of undergraduate students in informal learning contexts, which broadly center youth experiences. We took a critically framed approach (i.e., mindful of institutionalized inequities–known as a kind of silencing—for traditionally marginalized populations) in our analysis of interview responses from 11 undergraduate students involved in an afterschool environmental program for young students living in a Latinx neighborhood in central California. Our analysis involved a two-phase process that began with a general thematic exploration of transcribed interviews followed by in-depth, microlevel transcription of salient instances regarding community engagement. Responses suggest that the community-based context enabled a deep engagement founded on shared cultural practices, life experiences, and engaging in disciplinary projects (e.g., building and planting an edible garden). This study is a contribution to the long-needed insights into the importance of community engagement and leadership experiences during undergraduate learning, particularly for traditionally marginalized students.

In the first study, the questionnaires were distributed to a sample of 312 participants aged 18-35 years (M = 23.81; SD = 4.49), and an exploratory factor analysis was performed. A parsimonious and interpretable 6-factor solution that displayed adequate factor loadings and adequate Omega coefficients for both instruments were found. In a second study, the two instruments and other measures of known social network usage correlates and mental health consequences were administered online to 1,418 English-speaking participants aged 18-34 years (M = 21.35; SD = 3.89). Both scales showed good psychometric properties and the factor structure identified in study 1 was reproduced through confirmatory factor analysis. Omega reliability coefficients were adequate. Finally, when performing multi-group CFA along with a French (n = 1,826) and a Spanish (n = 3,040) sample, language and gender invariance were supported. Correlations with other relevant measures indicate good convergent validity of both scales.
Conclusions: The present research provides psychometrically sound instruments for further investigations on Instagram use behaviors.","The authors wish to thank Carlos Romero (PUCP), Cecilia Chau (PUCP), Jaime Miranda, Sandra Romero, Silvia Romero, Samantha Romero, Wendy Van Beggelaer, Joel Anicama, Miguel Flores Galindo, Jenny Canales, Fiorella Alvarado, Alejandro Loayza and the CORSCI-IRWG-UCLouvain for their invaluable help distributing the questionnaires or facilitating the contact with partner universities.",This study was funded through the scholarship “Coopération au développement” of the Conseil de l’Action Internationale of the Université catholique de Louvain awarded to SMRS.,Journal of Behavioral Addictions,,,Humans; Cross-Cultural Comparison; Psychometrics; Reproducibility of Results; Surveys and Questionnaires; Qualitative Research,2023-02-06,2023,2023-02-06,2023-03-30,12,1,105-127,All OA; Gold,Article,"Saletti, Silvana Melissa Romero; Van den Broucke, Stephan; Billieux, Joël; Karila, Laurent; Kuss, Daria J.; Espejo, José Manuel Rivera; Sheldon, Pavica; Lang, Cathryne P.; Zimmer-Gembeck, Melanie J.; Zollo, Palmyra; Courboin, Clara; Diez, Dominica; Madison, T.

Fish is also very susceptible to spoilage and contamination by microorganisms throughout the food chain, which may be part of the usual microbiota or incorporated into food derived from inadequate hygiene practices in the food industry. Fish has been associated worldwide with disease outbreaks derived from consumption, where various bacteria and/or metabolites (biogenic amines) are some of the main casual agents. Citrobacter sp. is considered a pathogen in fish, as well as in humans, derived from the consumption of contaminated food, generating infections or histamine poisoning as it is part of the generating microbiota. Therefore, the objective of this document is to provide information on Citrobacter sp. through a general perspective on animal health and the safety of fish and fish products. Diseases derived from Citrobacter sp. contamination are included, as well as control, prevention, and sanitary legislation actions to promote animal health and the safety of foods of aquatic origin and the protection of public health.","Alejandro De Jesús Cortés Sánchez and Luis Daniel Espinosa-Chaurand acknowledge financial support given by the National Council of Humanities, Sciences and Technologies of Mexico (CONAHCYT) to “researcher” position at UAML and CIBNOR.

Two different waste/Portland-cement ratios (7.5/92.5 and 80/20) were studied. Density and compressive strength decreased when different wastes were added in every proportion. Additions of 7.5% of both shells reduce the density to about 2.5% and the compressive strength to 20%, while 80% reduces the density to 20% and the compressive strength to 90%, while the addition of biomass fly ash decreases the density and compressive strength in a higher proportion than shells. The durability against acid attack is increased when the three wastes are used, and this increase is higher when the waste dosage is increased (up to 15 times more when 80% biomass ash is used). With respect to leaching, scallop and eggshells can be used as a component of hydraulic road binder, but olive pomace ash presents leaching values higher than the limits of different regulations (Se, Pb, Ni, Mo, Cu, and As). From a radiological perspective, all road-base binders present an activity concentration index lower than 1, except when olive pomace ash was used, and the binders showed higher values of 40K due to the high potassium content of fly ash.",,,Applied Sciences,,,,2023-01-27,2023,2023-01-27,,13,3,1644,All OA; Gold,Article,"Peceño, B.; Hurtado-Bermudez, S.; Alonso-Fariñas, B.; Villa-Alfageme, M.; Más, J.

However, the problems caused by economic development are also increasing, on the one hand, there is the contradiction between supply and demand caused by resource consumption and shortage of resources; on the other hand, there also is contradiction between the great pollution and destruction in the ecological environment and the public's increasingly demanding ecological environment. Especially, the contradiction between the ecological environment and the social environment has become the focus of attention of the Chinese public. Therefore, the ecological environment protection becomes the current consensus either from the national level or the social level, how to manage and protect the ecological environment is also a question of the current social thinking. The common practice of ecological environment protection is to control and protect, at the same time, governance is to restore the damaged environment. There are many means for protection, such as energy conservation, emission reduction, monitoring and so on. Energy saving and emission reduction not only mean that the consumption of resources is reduced, but also mean that the discharge of pollutants and destroy the ecological environment are reduced. And monitoring refers to the existing ecological environment monitoring; the change of ecological environment is detected by real-time observation, so that counter measures are made according to the changes.",Declaration of competing interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.,,Measurement Sensors,,,,2023-06,2023,,2023-06,27,J.

A dcMFC was constructed with Cu and Zn electrodes, where organic waste and microalgae were placed in the anodic and cathodic chambers, respectively. Also, electrochemical parameters were measured for 35 days. Finally, possible electrogenic microorganisms were isolated and identified. It was possible to generate maximum values of current (6.04414 ± 0.2145 mA) and voltage (0.77328 ± 0.213 V). The maximum conductivity value was 134.1636 ± 7.121 mS/cm, while the internal resistance value was 83.784 ± 7 . 147 Ω . The values of power and current density reached were 584.45 ± 19.14 mW/cm 2 and 5.983 A/cm 2, respectively. The optimal operating pH was 4.59 ± 0.14. From the microbial growth on the anode, the yeast Yarrowia phangngaensis (1) and Pseudomonas stutzeri (2) were identified, which may be involved in the transfer of electrons to the electrode. In conclusion, it was possible to generate clean energy in a laboratory-scale dcMFC when pepper waste and Spirulina sp. were used. These results are promising because organic waste can generate sustainable and environmentally friendly energy.","Declaration of competing interest The authors declare the following financial interests/personal relationships which may be considered as potential competing interests: Segundo Jonathan Rojas Flores reports financial support, administrative support, article publishing charges, statistical analysis, travel, and writing assistance were provided by Autonomous University of Peru.

This center is known for its privileged location, saving up to 30% of fuel in launches. Its operationalization is an offshoot of the Technological Safeguards Agreement, which is important for the Brazilian Space Program due to greater space sector investments and environmentally relevant projects. In 2003, a major fire at the Alcântara Space Center destroyed a rocket and killed 21 workers, halting Brazilian Space Program activities. Recently, our research group reported serious environmental consequences of this accident, i.e., extremely high amounts of Rubidium (Rb) in apex predatory sharks near the Alcântara Space Center. This element is used in fuels and in space propulsion systems and is potentially toxic, displaying bioaccumulating and biomagnifying capabilities. The observed concentrations are the highest ever detected in any living organism (up to 24.65 mg kg-1 dry weight). The launch base is located on the Brazilian Amazon Coast, and population recruitment impacts may compromise biota conservation and biodiversity. Local shark meat consumption is also worrying, as consumers may be exposed to Rb, whose effects in humans are unknown. We, therefore, indicate an urgent need for biomonitoring efforts in the area, as the Alcântara Space Center is about to operate at its maximum capacity.","Financial support to NW and JN through the Fundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Maranhão (FAPEMA - BEPP-02106/18; BPD-04215/17; AQUIPESCA-06605/16) and the Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior (CAPES) through a Post-doctoral Fellowship.

In particular, due to the spin of the baryonic and dark matter particles and its coupling to gravity, they probe an effective spin-dependent metric, which can be calculated semi-classically in the Mathisson-Papapetrou-Tulczyjew-Dixon formalism. Hence, the usual field equations give rise to modified Friedmann equations, in which the extra terms can be identified as an effective dark-energy sector. Additionally, we obtain an effective interaction between the matter and dark-energy sectors. In the case where the spin-gravity coupling switches off, we recover standard ΛCDM cosmology. We perform a dynamical system analysis and we find a matter-dominated point that can describe the matter era, and a stable late-time solution corresponding to acceleration and dark-energy domination. For small values of the spin coupling parameter, deviations from ΛCDM concordance scenario are small, however for larger values they can be brought to the desired amount, leading to different dark-energy equation-of-state parameter behavior, as well as to different transition redshift from acceleration to deceleration. Finally, we confront the model predictions with Hubble function data.","Declaration of Competing Interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

Participatory budgeting is an innovative tool for citizen participation that facilitates spaces for collective decision-making in budget administration. The work focuses on two objectives. Firstly, the construction of an operational framework of dimensions and indicators to measure the participatory quality designed in the participatory budget regulations through which to compare and understand their characteristics and institutional mechanisms. Secondly, to apply the framework to the processes initiated from 2015 to 2020 in municipalities located in Spain. The object of study is the regulation because it institutionalizes the rules, the relationships between agents and the conception of the model of local citizen participation. The research shows, firstly, that the construction of specific indicators to measure the participatory quality of participatory budget regulations allows for the comparison of a wide range of experiences in dimensions of special interest such as social inclusion, decision-making, institutional commitment, information flow, deliberation, and community capacity. The design of regulations is characterized by the configuration of participation models with low intensity, inclusiveness, and citizen influence.

The aim of this study was to analyze the impact of applying the flipped classroom on academic results and attitudes towards mathematics, with an experimental group of 227 students and a control group of 215 students. The academic results were measured at each of the stages indicated in the course syllabus, T1, partial exam, T2 and final exam; attitudes towards mathematics were also assessed at cognitive, procedural and affective levels at the end of the university semester. The Kolmogorov-Smirnov normality test was applied and yielded a value of p = 0.00, indicating that the grades obtained by the students did not follow a normal distribution. With the data obtained, the Mann-Whitney U test was performed, obtaining a p = 0.00 value (α = 0,052 tails). p < α makes us conclude that there are statistically significant differences between the scores of the experimental group compared to the control group. The results show a significant improvement in the academic performance and positive attitudes of students who took the course using the flipped classroom compared to those who did not use this methodology.",,,International Journal of Engineering Pedagogy (iJEP),,,,2023-09-20,2023,2023-09-20,,13,6,76-89,All OA; Gold,Article,"Beltozar-Clemente, Saul; Iparraguirre-Villanueva, Orlando; Zapata-Paulini, Joselyn; Cabanillas-Carbonell, Michael","Beltozar-Clemente, Saul (Departamento de Ciencias, Universidad Privada del Norte, Lima, Peru); Iparraguirre-Villanueva, Orlando (Facultad de Ingeniería y Arquitectura, Universidad Autónoma del Perú, Lima, Peru); Zapata-Paulini, Joselyn (Escuela de Posgrado, Universidad Continental, Lima, Peru); Cabanillas-Carbonell, Michael (Vicerrectorado de Investigación, Universidad Norbert Wiener, Lima, Peru)",,"Beltozar-Clemente, Saul (Private University of the North); Iparraguirre-Villanueva, Orlando (Universidad Autónoma del Perú); Zapata-Paulini, Joselyn (Universidad Continental); Cabanillas-Carbonell, Michael (Universidad Norbert Wiener)",3,3,,,https://online-journals.org/index.php/i-jep/article/download/40763/13893,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1164228272,40 Engineering; 4010 Engineering Practice and Education,4 Quality Education

During the monitoring activities of the Mediterranean mussel (Mytilus galloprovincialis) in Campania region (Italy), the presence of typical trophozoites of Perkinsus sp. was observed in mussels from farms and natural banks. Simultaneously, following mussel mortality in the Spanish waters of Catalonia, histopathological studies revealed the presence of the same parasite. Although perkinsosis is an endemic disease in clams in Italy (with prevalence from 40 to 80%), there are no reports to date of its presence in Mediterranean mussels and of the effect on this species. For this study, histopathology, Ray’s Fluid Thioglycollate Medium (RFTM), and molecular diagnostics with conventional Polimerase Chain Reaction (PCR) and qPCR were performed. In samples from Italy, histopathology in the mussel from one farm revealed a prevalence of 26% in February 2019, 40% in February 2020, 16% in November 2020, and 23% in April 2021. In a natural bank, Perkinsus was also detected in May 2020 but in lower prevalence. In Spain, in July 2020, the presence of the parasite was 20% in one site and 10% in a second site and related to animal mortality. In both areas, Perkinsus sp. elicited multiple inflammatory capsules of different size or infiltrates at the level of the digestive gland and gonad. Molecular diagnostics of the Internal Transcriber Spacer (ITS) region of the rDNA (ITS1, 5.8S, and ITS2) showed a 97% similarity of P. olseni from Italy with samples from New Zealand, Australia, and Uruguay and in bivalves such as Pitar rostrata, Astrovenus sp., and Haliotis sp., whereas in Spain the identity was 99% samples from South Korean venerids such as Anadara granosa. Phylogenetic analysis group together P. olseni from Italian and Spanish mussels but place them distant from other P. olseni described in the clams from Europe (Italy, France, and Spain). Direct impact of transboundary animal diseases in aquaculture constitutes a serious consequence for export living animals and their products, as well for international trade. This compromises food security, also causing a high socioeconomic impact on aquaculture exporting nations. P. olseni is a generalist pathogen able to infect different bivalve species, possibly passing from clams to oysters and mussels. Recognized international organizations should take this into account in the view of possible cross-infection. Other studies are needed to define pathogen virulence in this species.",,UNINA GRANT.,Frontiers in Marine Science,,,,2023-02-24,2023,2023-02-24,,10,,1116837,All OA; Gold,Article,"Carella, Francesca; Tejedor, Margarita Fernandez; Villari, Grazia; Andree, Karl Blyth; De Vico, Gionata","Carella, Francesca (Department of Biology, University of Naples Federico II, Naples, Italy); Tejedor, Margarita Fernandez (Institute of Agrifood Research and Technology (IRTA), la Ràpita, Spain); Villari, Grazia (Department of Biology, University of Naples Federico II, Naples, Italy); Andree, Karl Blyth (Institute of Agrifood Research and Technology (IRTA), la Ràpita, Spain); De Vico, Gionata (Department of Biology, University of Naples Federico II, Naples, Italy)","Carella, Francesca (University of Naples Federico II)","Carella, Francesca (University of Naples Federico II); Tejedor, Margarita Fernandez (Institute of Agrifood Research and Technology); Villari, Grazia (University of Naples Federico II); Andree, Karl Blyth (Institute of Agrifood Research and Technology); De Vico, Gionata (University of Naples Federico II)",3,3,,,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmars.2023.1116837/pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1155711169,31 Biological Sciences; 3103 Ecology; 37 Earth Sciences; 3705 Geology; 3708 Oceanography,

245,pub.1165303260,10.3390/fire6110416,,,The Incorporation of Ladle Furnace Slag in Fire Insulating Gypsum-Based Materials,"Ladle slag, a byproduct of steel manufacturing, exhibits inherent reactivity and undergoes hydration when exposed to water. Nevertheless, these reaction byproducts often remain metastable, leading to microstructural alterations when incorporated into cementitious materials, thereby limiting the recycling potential of ladle slag. This study explores the fire insulating capacity and the physical, mechanical, and leaching characteristics of gypsum-based materials with substantial quantities of ladle slag in instead of gypsum. The mechanical strength of the specimens declines as the ladle slag content increases. Nevertheless, the percentage decrease in compressive strength at various temperatures (300 °C, 500 °C, and 700 °C) is less pronounced when higher amounts of ladle slag are used. Fire-resistant properties, assessed using the EN 1363-1 standards, diminish with increasing slag proportions; although the inclusion of ladle slag introduces certain endothermic processes that positively affect the fire insulating capacity, resulting in a 20% reduction when 60%wt of slag is employed. Notably, no gas emissions were observed during the fire test, indicating the absence of environmental hazards. In conclusion, ladle slag does not pose a leaching threat to the environment, making it a viable and sustainable alternative to gypsum in gypsum-based materials.",,This research was funded by the Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovación of Spain under project number PID2019-110928RB-C33.,Fire,,,,2023-10-27,2023,2023-10-27,,6,11,416,All OA; Gold,Article,"Peceño, Begoña; Pérez-Soriano, Eva M.; Luna-Galiano, Yolanda; Leiva, Carlos","Peceño, Begoña (Escuela de Prevención de Riesgos y Medioambiente, Facultad de Ciencias del Mar, Universidad Católica del Norte, Larrondo 1281, Coquimbo 1781421, Chile;, begopc@ucl.cl); Pérez-Soriano, Eva M.

In recent years, computer science has advanced exponentially, helping significantly to identify and classify text extracted from social networks, specifically Twitter. This work aims to identify, classify and analyze tweets related to real natural disasters through tweets with the hashtag #NaturalDisasters, using Machine learning (ML) algorithms, such as Bernoulli Naive Bayes (BNB), Multinomial Naive Bayes (MNB), Logistic Regression (LR), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Decision Tree (DT), Random Forest (RF). First, tweets related to natural disasters were identified, creating a dataset of 122k geolocated tweets for training. Secondly, the data-cleaning process was carried out by applying stemming and lemmatization techniques. Third, exploratory data analysis (EDA) was performed to gain an initial understanding of the data. Fourth, the training and testing process of the BNB, MNB, L, KNN, DT, and RF models was initiated, using tools and libraries for this type of task. The results of the trained models demonstrated optimal performance: BNB, MNB, and LR models achieved a performance rate of 87% accuracy; and KNN, DT, and RF models achieved performances of 82%, 75%, and 86%, respectively.

Effective communication strategies are crucial for the success of such initiatives. The citizen science program Plastic Pirates investigated the plastic pollution of rivers and implemented a variety of communication strategies with participating schoolchildren, teachers, and youth groups (e.g., sport associations, scouts or educational vacation programs, representing approximately 6% of participating groups). These were continuously revised and adapted since its start in 2016. Without time-efficient communication and strategies to keep track of conversations, it would not have been possible to achieve the scientific and educational goals of the program, i.e., to help teachers increase the environmental awareness and scientific literacy of their schoolchildren, and to produce peer-reviewed articles based on the collected citizen science data. Communication within the Plastic Pirates program was divided into four distinct phases: 1) recruiting and motivating participants, 2) coordination and guidance of participants, 3) data reception and revision, and 4) sharing updates and results. Some of the obstacles that had to be overcome to achieve successful communication were e.g., time constraints to obtaining scientific data from the participants, the time lag between the active involvement of the participants and the actual data analysis and publication of results, and limited personnel resources available for communication efforts. Our recommendations for other citizen science practitioners include regular and transparent communication with the participants regarding their contribution, the use of adequate and various communication channels, shifting the workload from the participants to the coordinating team of a citizen science initiative, as well as offering feedback on the research findings to the citizen scientists, thereby disseminating the results of the program.","This article would not exist without the enthusiastic participation of schoolchildren, teachers, and other volunteers of the program, their contribution is the core of the success of the Plastic Pirates!

An ideal mechanism has the highest Nu and the lowest entropy S g e n . As part of this research, a large dataset of fluid flow via tubes has been collected experimentally. As well as the inclusion of nanoparticles, analyses are included as well. By using deep learning algorithms, the Nusselt number and total entropy generation are predicted. In both models, the mean absolute error was lower than 5%. To determine the most accurate model, hyperparameter tuning is performed. That is adjusting all the settings in the neural network to attain the best results. The results of the predictive models are compared against experimental and benchmark results. The study incorporates a massive optimization strategy to fine-tune the predictive capabilities of the models. Furthermore, the model's predictive abilities are evaluated through the use of the coefficient of determination R 2 . For water and nanofluids flowing through circular, square, and rectangular cross-sections, the proposed models can predict Nu and S g e n . The results showed remarkable agreement with the experimental results. The models showed an MAE of not higher than 1.33%, which is a great achievement. Also, empirical correlations are proposed for both parameters, and double factorial optimization is implemented. The results showed that to achieve the best results, the Re should be higher than 1600, and the nanoparticle concentration should be 3%. A thorough justification of selected cases is presented as well.","Declaration of competing interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

For a school citizen science program to be successful, an adequate communication strategy needs to achieve a balance between learning objectives and the generation of scientific knowledge. In this community case study, we report on the communication strategies of an international network, namely, the citizen science program Científicos de la Basura (Litter Scientists), which collaborates with schoolteachers and schoolchildren to investigate anthropogenic litter on marine beaches and in rivers. The program has been active in Chile since 2007, and as of 2018, it had expanded to the 11 countries from the central and southern East Pacific. More than 40 teachers and collaborators from these countries work in this network making an effort to connect the research activities with the learning objectives of the school curriculum. The communication between the coordination team and the teachers includes three main elements (1 - design and planning; 2 - training and research; 3 - evaluation and sharing), with the following activities: (1a) regular internal communication within the coordination team to design, motivate and supervise adequate research projects, (1b) communication with teachers to design appropriate learning materials (co-creation) and get their feedback on the planned research activities, (2a) sharing the final research plan and transfer methodological skills through regular training of the teachers, (2b) responding to methodological questions by the teachers about the sampling, and coordinate data collection and validation, (3a) guiding teachers and schoolchildren in the evaluation and interpretation of their research results, and (3b) encouraging teachers and schoolchildren to communicate their scientific findings to the wider community. Intense internal communication and regular exchange with teachers guarantees successful learning and rigorous scientific information. The main challenges for the program are team capacity, socio-economic stability, internet access, and teachers’ workloads. Recommendations to achieve successful communication and good science are efficient team communication skills, customized contacts, collaborative work, guidance of field work, feedback from participants, and promoting the sense of community.",Foremost we would like to thank the teachers who are the pillars of our network. They keep us grounded and continuously guide us to become better communicators. Three reviewers offered many constructive suggestions that helped to improve this manuscript.

The effectiveness of all aspects of disaster management depends on a credible estimation of the prevailing risk. Risk, the product of a hazard’s likelihood and its potential consequences, encompasses the probability of hazard occurrence, the exposure of assets to these hazards, existing vulnerabilities that amplify the consequences, and the capacity to manage, mitigate, and recover from their consequences. This paper employs the multiple criteria decision-making (MCDM) framework, which produces reliable results and allows for the customization of the relative importance of factors based on expert opinions. Utilizing the AROMAN algorithm, the study ranks counties in the state of Arizona according to their wildfire risk, drawing upon 25 factors categorized into expected annual loss, community resilience, and social vulnerability. A sensitivity analysis demonstrates the stability of the results when model parameters are altered, reinforcing the robustness of this approach in disaster risk assessment. While the paper primarily focuses on enhancing the safety of human communities in the context of wildfires, it highlights the versatility of the methodology, which can be applied to other natural hazards and accommodate more subjective risk and safety assessments.",,This research received no external funding.,Fire,,,,2023-11-24,2023,2023-11-24,,6,12,449,All OA; Gold,Article,"Pishahang, Mohammad; Jovcic, Stefan; Zolfani, Sarfaraz Hashemkhani; Simic, Vladimir; Görçün, Ömer Faruk","Pishahang, Mohammad (Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, University of California, Los Angeles, CA 90095, USA;, mh.pishahang@ucla.edu); Jovcic, Stefan (Faculty of Transport Engineering, University of Pardubice, Studentská 95, 532 10 Pardubice, Czech Republic;, stefan.jovcic@upce.cz); Zolfani, Sarfaraz Hashemkhani (School of Engineering, Universidad Catolica del Norte, Larrondo 1281, Coquimbo 1780000, Chile); Simic, Vladimir (Faculty of Transport and Traffic Engineering, University of Belgrade, 11010 Belgrade, Serbia;, vsima@sf.bg.ac.rs; Department of Industrial Engineering and Management, College of Engineering, Yuan Ze University, Taoyuan City 320315, Taiwan); Görçün, Ömer Faruk (Department of Business Administration, Faculty of Economics, Administration, and Social Sciences, Kadir Has University, Fatih, Istanbul 34083, Turkey;, omer.gorcun@khas.edu.tr)","Zolfani, Sarfaraz Hashemkhani (Catholic University of the North)","Pishahang, Mohammad (University of California, Los Angeles); Jovcic, Stefan (University of Pardubice); Zolfani, Sarfaraz Hashemkhani (Catholic University of the North); Simic, Vladimir (University of Belgrade; Yuan Ze University); Görçün, Ömer Faruk (Kadir Has University)",3,3,,,https://www.mdpi.com/2571-6255/6/12/449/pdf?version=1700818390,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1166334416,41 Environmental Sciences; 4104 Environmental Management,11 Sustainable Cities and Communities

The objective of this study was to validate the psychometric characteristics of the e-RetailTest scale, created to measure consumer attitudes towards online shopping in developing countries, particularly in the Peruvian market. The e-RetailTest evaluates five variables present in the online purchase process: (a) quality of web design, (b) risk when making a purchase, (c) customer service, (d) security and (e) satisfaction, with a total of twenty items using a Likert scale. A total of 422 valid responses were collected from Peruvian consumers who had had online shopping experience in the retail sector. Statistically, we worked with the AFE exploratory factor analysis and the AFC confirmatory factor analysis. The results suggest that this first version of the e-RetailTest presents adequate psychometric evidence to measure the attitude of consumers towards online purchases in the retail sector in the Peruvian market.

211,pub.1165303636,10.3390/min13111372,,,Selective Leaching of Arsenic from Copper Concentrates in Hypochlorite Medium,"The selective leaching of arsenic using sodium hypochlorite was evaluated in order to reduce its concentration in a copper concentrate. The best conditions achieved in the synthetic concentrate were applied to the industrial concentrate. First, the individual behaviors of pure samples of enargite and chalcopyrite were evaluated under a hypochlorite medium. The enargite reaction is significantly faster than chalcopyrite, allowing for greater selectivity to ClO− (0.1–0.3 M), pH 12–12.5; 20 to 40 °C, reaction time <60 min. Under these conditions, the reagent consumption for pure compounds approaches the stoichiometric consumption and presents a selectivity factor of 5/1. Furthermore, concentrate leaching in a sodium hypochlorite medium, containing enargite, releases arsenic ions into the solution, while copper and iron remain in the solid phase, as CuO and Fe(OH)3, respectively. A novel copper concentrate cleaning process by selective leaching is proposed, which transforms unacceptable copper concentrate for smelters (>0.5%As) into clean concentrates (<0.2%As) or low penalty concentrates (0.2 < %As < 0.5). The estimated consumption for the cleaning process is in the order of 0.4–0.6 kg Cl2 equivalent per kg of concentrate.","The authors wish to thank the ‘‘Serveis Cientifico tecnics’’ of the University of Barcelona as well as the Center for Mineral Characterization MAINI of the University Católica del Norte, for their support, and contributions.",This research received no external funding.,Minerals,,,,2023-10-27,2023,2023-10-27,,13,11,1372,All OA; Gold,Article,"Hernández, Maria Cecilia; Benavente, Oscar; Roca, Antoni; Melo, Evelyn; Quezada, Víctor","Hernández, Maria Cecilia (Metallurgical and Mining Engineering Department, Universidad Católica del Norte, Antofagasta 1240000, Chile;, obenaven@ucn.cl, (O.B.);, emelo@ucn.cl, (E.M.);, vquezada@ucn.cl, (V.Q.)); Benavente, Oscar (Metallurgical and Mining Engineering Department, Universidad Católica del Norte, Antofagasta 1240000, Chile;, obenaven@ucn.cl, (O.B.);, emelo@ucn.cl, (E.M.);, vquezada@ucn.cl, (V.Q.)); Roca, Antoni (Department of Materials Science and Physical Chemistry, Universitat de Barcelona, 08007 Barcelona, Spain;, roca@ub.edu); Melo, Evelyn (Metallurgical and Mining Engineering Department, Universidad Católica del Norte, Antofagasta 1240000, Chile;, obenaven@ucn.cl, (O.B.);, emelo@ucn.cl, (E.M.);, vquezada@ucn.cl, (V.Q.)); Quezada, Víctor (Metallurgical and Mining Engineering Department, Universidad Católica del Norte, Antofagasta 1240000, Chile;, obenaven@ucn.cl, (O.B.);, emelo@ucn.cl, (E.M.);, vquezada@ucn.cl, (V.Q.))","Hernández, Maria Cecilia (Catholic University of the North; Metallurgical and Mining Engineering Department, Universidad Católica del Norte, Antofagasta 1240000, Chile;, obenaven@ucn.cl, (O.B.);, emelo@ucn.cl, (E.M.);, vquezada@ucn.cl, (V.Q.))","Hernández, Maria Cecilia (Catholic University of the North; Metallurgical and Mining Engineering Department, Universidad Católica del Norte, Antofagasta 1240000, Chile;, obenaven@ucn.cl, (O.B.);, emelo@ucn.cl, (E.M.);, vquezada@ucn.cl, (V.Q.)); Benavente, Oscar (Catholic University of the North; Metallurgical and Mining Engineering Department, Universidad Católica del Norte, Antofagasta 1240000, Chile;, obenaven@ucn.cl, (O.B.);, emelo@ucn.cl, (E.M.);, vquezada@ucn.cl, (V.Q.)); Roca, Antoni (University of Barcelona); Melo, Evelyn (Catholic University of the North; Metallurgical and Mining Engineering Department, Universidad Católica del Norte, Antofagasta 1240000, Chile;, obenaven@ucn.cl, (O.B.);, emelo@ucn.cl, (E.M.);, vquezada@ucn.cl, (V.Q.)); Quezada, Víctor (Catholic University of the North; Metallurgical and Mining Engineering Department, Universidad Católica del Norte, Antofagasta 1240000, Chile;, obenaven@ucn.cl, (O.B.);, emelo@ucn.cl, (E.M.);, vquezada@ucn.cl, (V.Q.))",3,3,,,https://www.mdpi.com/2075-163X/13/11/1372/pdf?version=1698394175,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1165303636,40 Engineering; 4019 Resources Engineering and Extractive Metallurgy,
204,pub.1160661825,10.1016/j.indic.2023.100280,,,Developing a country's sustainability indicator: An analysis of the effect on trade openness,"Several proposals have been put forward for measuring sustainability performance at the country-level, in addition to the considerable debate surrounding which pillars (or dimensions) should form part of this sustainability and which variables should make up these pillars. To date, no clear consensus has been reached regarding which sustainability measures are the most appropriate when seeking to reflect not only a country's economic development but also its environmental, social, and governance aspects. To provide an alternative to the existing indicators developed by private agencies, this study proposes an index to measure sustainability at the country-level, considering the Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) pillars. In addition, this indicator will serve as a counterpoint to the majority of current sustainability indicators, some of which involve a strong component in per capita income, or which are over-represented in economic terms. In a second stage –and in order to apply the indicator– this study analyses how sustainability at the country-level, and its ESG pillars, influence trade openness through a study of panel data from 47 countries. The results indicate that applying a disaggregated index in its dimensions (pillars) shows both the positive and negative effects that sustainability can have on the variable studied. A non-disaggregated index only reflects the joint effect, which might be insignificant in certain cases. This study contributes to the existing literature as well as to current understanding of how to measure national sustainability and its implications for macroeconomic variables, and it also provides a clear method for future research.",Declaration of competing interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

This explanation is achieved through the utilization of both tree-level and radiative seesaw mechanisms. In this model, the tiny masses of the light active neutrinos are generated via a three-loop radiative inverse seesaw mechanism, with Dirac and Majorana submatrices arising at one-loop level. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first example of the inverse seesaw mechanism being implemented with both submatrices generated at one- loop level. The model contains a global U(1)X symmetry which, after its spontaneous breaking, allows for the stabilization of the Dark Matter (DM) candidates. We show that the electroweak precision observables, the electron and muon anomalous magnetic moments as well as the Charged Lepton Flavor Violating decays, μ → eγ, are consistent with the current experimental limits. In addition, we analyze the implications of the model for the 95 GeV diphoton excess recently reported by the CMS collaboration and demonstrate that such anomaly could be easily accommodated. Finally, we discuss qualitative aspects of DM in the considered model.","A.E.C.H, I.S. and S.K. are supported by ANID-Chile FONDECYT 1210378, ANID-Chile FONDECYT 1230391, ANID-Chile FONDECYT 1180232, ANID-Chile FONDECYT 3150472, ANID-Chile FONDECYT 1230160, ANID PIA/APOYO AFB220004 and Proyecto Milenio-ANID: ICN2019_044.

The 5G network has great potential to contribute significantly to the achievement of SDG8, offering faster and more reliable connectivity, which opens up new possibilities for innovation, operational efficiency, and job creation. The present study aimed to investigate the role of 5G technologies concerning decent work and economic growth (SDG8). As part of the method, 265 articles extracted from main databases such as Scopus, IEEExplore, and ScienceDirect were analyzed using the PRISMA methodology, resulting in 74 relevant articles after applying the inclusion and exclusion criteria. As a result, a greater contribution to the use of the 5G network was identified in sectors such as manufacturing, health, and transportation, generating greater economic growth and job creation. It was also found that the technological applications with the greatest contributions are “Internet of Things” and “Artificial intelligence”. Finally, it was concluded that the results of this review are useful for future research on technologies that support 5G networks, contributing to economic growth and equitable and sustainable decent work in a wide range of sectors and rural areas.",,This research received no external funding.,Sustainability,,,,2023-11-09,2023,2023-11-09,,15,22,15776,All OA; Gold,Article,"Beltozar-Clemente, Saul; Iparraguirre-Villanueva, Orlando; Pucuhuayla-Revatta, Félix; Sierra-Liñan, Fernando; Zapata-Paulini, Joselyn; Cabanillas-Carbonell, Michael","Beltozar-Clemente, Saul (Dirección de Cursos Básicos, Universidad Científica del Sur, Lima 15097, Peru;, sbeltozar@cientifica.edu.pe); Iparraguirre-Villanueva, Orlando (Facultad de Ingeniería y Arquitectura, Universidad Autónoma del Perú, Lima 15842, Peru;, oiparraguirrev@autonoma.edu.pe); Pucuhuayla-Revatta, Félix (Facultad de Ingeniería, Universidad Tecnológica del Perú, Lima 15306, Peru;, c18883@utp.edu.pe); Sierra-Liñan, Fernando (Facultad de Ingeniería, Universidad Privada del Norte, Lima 15306, Peru;, fernando.sierra@upn.edu.pe); Zapata-Paulini, Joselyn (Escuela de Posgrado, Universidad Continental, Lima 15311, Peru); Cabanillas-Carbonell, Michael (Escuela Técnica Superior de Ingenieros de Telecomunicación, Universidad Politécnica de Madrid, 28040 Madrid, Spain;, ma.cabanillas@alumnos.upm.es)","Zapata-Paulini, Joselyn (Universidad Continental)","Beltozar-Clemente, Saul (Scientific University of the South); Iparraguirre-Villanueva, Orlando (Universidad Autónoma del Perú); Pucuhuayla-Revatta, Félix (Universidad Tecnológica del Perú); Sierra-Liñan, Fernando (Private University of the North); Zapata-Paulini, Joselyn (Universidad Continental); Cabanillas-Carbonell, Michael (Technical University of Madrid)",3,3,,,https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/15/22/15776/pdf?version=1699520054,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1165829627,44 Human Society; 4404 Development Studies,"8 Decent Work and Economic Growth; 9 Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure"

The effect of GB misorientation on the mechanical properties, fracture resistance, and crack propagation are evaluated under monotonic and cyclic load conditions. The J-integral and the crack tip opening displacement (CTOD) are assessed to establish the effect of the GB misorientation angle on the fracture resistance. The simulations reveal that the misorientation angle plays a significant role in the mechanical response of Al bicrystals.

We aimed to examine the differences in the gene expression profiles in peripheral blood at hospital admission between patients with CAP who died during hospitalization and those who survived. (2) Methods: This is a multicenter study of nonimmunosuppressed adult patients who required hospitalization for CAP. Whole blood samples were obtained within 24 h of admission for genome-expression-profile analysis. Gene expression profiling identified both differentially expressed genes and enriched gene sets. (3) Results: A total of 198 samples from adult patients who required hospitalization for CAP were processed, of which 13 were from patients who died. Comparison of gene expression between patients who died and those who survived yielded 49 differentially expressed genes, 36 of which were upregulated and 13 downregulated. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) identified four positively enriched gene sets in survivors, mainly associated with the interferon-alpha response, apoptosis, and sex hormone pathways. Similarly, GSEA identified seven positively enriched gene sets, associated with the oxidative stress, endoplasmic reticulum stress, oxidative phosphorylation, and angiogenesis pathways, in the patients who died. Protein-protein-interaction-network analysis identified FOS, CDC42, SLC26A10, EIF4G2, CCND3, ASXL1, UBE2S, and AURKA as the main gene hubs. (4) Conclusions: We found differences in gene expression profiles at hospital admission between CAP patients who died and those who survived.

This study aims to compare the distribution of empathy levels, about functionality or dysfunction, and the three styles, which can be derived from family functioning in the families of Argentine medical students. Previously providing evidence of the validity of the family functioning measure. As well as provide evidence of the validity of the measure of family functioning.
METHODS: Ex post facto design: 306 Argentine medical students who had already taken the Jefferson Scale of Empathy-Spanish Edition (JSE-S) and the abbreviated Spanish Family Adaptability and Cohesion Evaluation Scale (FACES-20). A gender-weighted linear regression analysis was made, establishing an ANOVA and multiple comparisons via DMS to determine the effect of functional and dysfunctional families' balanced, intermediate and extreme functioning styles concerning empathy.
RESULTS: Students who presented dysfunction in familial cohesion and adaptability showed measures of empathy greater than those classified as functional. Differences of cohesion were statistically significant in compassionate care, perspective taking and general empathy. These components were significantly higher in students from families classified as extreme than balanced ones. Students classified within families with either extreme or dysfunctional styles showed greater levels of empathy than more adaptive and functional ones, except in the 'walking in patient's shoes' component where differences were not observed.
CONCLUSIONS: Individual resilience as an intervening variable in the presence of empathy is discussed.
IMPLICATIONS: The study of empathy, its associated variables, and the conditions of its development remains a central theme in relation to students and professionals of the health sciences. To achieve an effective professional practice, it is necessary to develop human capacities such as empathy and personal resilience.",,This research received no external funding.,Behavioral Sciences,,Luis Vivanco,,2023-04-24,2023,2023-04-24,,13,5,356,All OA; Gold,Article,"Ulloque, María J.; Villalba, Silvina; Foscarini, Gabriela; Quinteros, Susana; Calzadilla-Núñez, Aracelis; Reyes-Reyes, Alejandro; Díaz-Narváez, Víctor","Ulloque, María J.

Alternative routes can be provided by recent discoveries of a time-reversal symmetry breaking anomalous Hall effect (AHE) in noncollinear magnets and altermagnets, but hitherto reported bulk materials are not polar. Here, the authors report the observation of a spontaneous AHE in doped AgCrSe2 , a layered polar semiconductor with an antiferromagnetic coupling between Cr spins in adjacent layers. The anomalous Hall resistivity 3  μ Ω  c m $\mu \Omega \, \textnormal {cm}$  is comparable to the largest observed in compensated magnetic systems to date, and is rapidly switched off when the angle of an applied magnetic field is rotated to ≈80° from the crystalline c-axis. The ionic gating experiments show that the anomalous Hall conductivity magnitude can be enhanced by modulating the p-type carrier density. They also present theoretical results that suggest the AHE is driven by Berry curvature due to noncollinear antiferromagnetic correlations among Cr spins, which are consistent with the previously suggested magnetic ordering in AgCrSe2 . The results open the possibility to study the interplay of magnetic and ferroelectric-like responses in this fascinating class of materials.","Acknowledgements The authors thank B. Doucot, P.D.C.

Although residential environments provide natural experimental conditions to observe these relationships, the complexity of measuring sensory perceptions and their subsequent interpretation constitutes a challenge. This study aims to identify the influence of socio-demographics and residential location characteristics on three latent variables: noise-Sensitivity, sound-Pleasantness, and visual-Liveability in a Latin American city. The methodology is replicable and relies on a digital survey that displays environments in 360-format video and uses sound immersion techniques; it was applied to a sample of household heads in Quito, Ecuador. Based on an efficient experimental design, we selected different residential environments according to acoustic-visual attributes and the proximity to residential, commercial, and recreational land uses. Structural Equation Models (SEM) were estimated using mediating variables. Our results reveal the influence of noise-Sensitivity on sound-Pleasantness and, indirectly, on visual-Liveability. Further analysis shows that the impact of sound and visual perception changes with different socio-demographics and residential location characteristics.","This research was accomplished thanks to collaboration of the Universidad Técnica del Norte and the co-funding project SOA.MCA.19.05- provided the Universidad de Las Américas in Ecuador and the Civil Engineering programme at Universidad del Norte in Barranquilla, Colombia.

Hemoperfusion (HPF) can remove inflammatory cytokines and can reduce the negative effects of cytokine storm in COVID-19. We compared the mortality rate, inflammatory response, and acute kidney injury (AKI) prevalence among patients suffering from respiratory insufficiency secondary to COVID-19 treated with and without HPF with HA330 cartridge.
Methods: Mortality rate, serum creatinine, and ferritin values were compared between patients suffering from respiratory insufficiency secondary to COVID-19 who received conventional treatment and another group of patients who additionally received four sessions of HPF with HA330.
Results: Of 116 patients suffering from acute respiratory insufficiency secondary to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), one group (n: 84) received support treatment and the other group (n: 32) additionally received HPF with HA330 cartridge. Both groups had no renal disease and similar age and comorbidities at admission, except for obesity and mechanical ventilation requirement, which were significantly higher in the HPF group. Mortality rate (61% vs. 31%, P: 0.008), serum creatinine (1.4 vs. 0.5 mg/dl, P < 0.001), and post-HPF serum ferritin (2868 vs. 1675, P < 0.001) were significantly lower in the HPF group.
Conclusion: Mortality rate, serum ferritin, and AKI were significantly reduced in critical COVID-19 patients who received HPF with HA330 cartridge than in those who did not receive it. These results were obtained despite the HPF group risk factors, such as obesity and mechanical ventilation, worsening its prognosis.",,Financial support and sponsorship Nil.,Indian Journal of Nephrology,,,,2023-08-04,2023,2023-08-04,2024,34,1,56-58,All OA; Gold,Article,"Barriga-Moreno, Adriana P.; Lozano-Sanchez, Marcela; Barón-Alvarez, Rafael A.; Cordoba, Juan P.; Aroca-Martinez, Gustavo; Dianda, Daniela; Gonzalez-Torres, Henry; Musso, Carlos G.","Barriga-Moreno, Adriana P.

Juan de Acosta, Atlántico, a city located on the Caribbean coast of Colombia, is home to the world's second-largest HD pedigree. Here, we include 291 descendants of this pedigree with at least one family member with HD. Blood samples were collected, and genomic DNA was extracted. We quantified the HTT CAG expansion using an amplicon sequencing protocol. The genetic heterogeneity was measured as the ratio of the mosaicism allele's read peak and the slippage ratio of the allele's read peak from our sequence data. The statistical and bioinformatic analyses were performed with a significance threshold of p < 0.05. We found that the average HTT CAG repeat length in all participants was 21.91 (SD = 8.92). Of the 291 participants, 33 (11.3%, 18 females) had a positive molecular diagnosis for HD. Most affected individuals were adults, and the most common primary and secondary alleles were 17/7 (CAG/CCG) and 17/10 (CAG/CCG), respectively. The mosaicism increased with age in the participants with HD, while the slippage analyses revealed differences by the HD allele type only for the secondary allele. The slippage tended to increase with the HTT CAG repeat length in the participants with HD, but the increase was not statistically significant. This study analyzed the genetic and molecular features of 291 participants, including 33 with HD. We found that the mosaicism increased with age in the participants with HD, particularly for the secondary allele. The most common haplotype was 17/7_17/10. The slippage for the secondary allele varied by the HD allele type, but there was no significant difference in the slippage by sex. Our findings offer valuable insights into HD and could have implications for future research and clinical management.","We express our highest appreciation to all individuals who voluntarily participated in this study.

METHODS: Multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled trial in 658 adults with prediabetes treated for 1 year with metformin, linagliptin, their combination or placebo. Endpoints are small fiber peripheral neuropathy (SFPN) risk estimated by foot electrochemical skin conductance (FESC < 70 μSiemens) and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR).
RESULTS: Compared to the placebo, the proportion of SFPN was reduced by 25.1% (95% CI:16.3-33.9) with metformin alone, by 17.3% (95% CI 7.4-27.2) with linagliptin alone, and by 19.5% (95% CI 10.1-29.0) with the combination linagliptin/metformin (p < 0.0001 for all comparisons). eGFR remained +3.3 mL/min (95% CI: 0.38-6.22) higher with the combination linagliptin/metformin than with the placebo (p = 0.03). Fasting plasma glucose (FPG) decreased more with metformin monotherapy -0.3 mmol/L (95%CI: -0.48; 0.12, p = 0.0009) and with the combination metformin/linagliptin -0.2 mmol/L (95% CI: -0.37; -0.03) than with the placebo (p = 0.0219). Body weight (BW) decreased by -2.0 kg (95% CI: -5.65; -1.65, p = 0.0006) with metformin monotherapy, and by -1.9 kg (95% CI: -3.02; -0.97) with the combination metformin/linagliptin as compared to the placebo (p = 0.0002).
CONCLUSIONS: in people with prediabetes, a 1 year treatment with metformin and linagliptin, combined or in monotherapy, was associated with a lower risk of SFPN, and with a lower decrease in eGFR, than treatment with placebo.","Members of the e-PREDICE Consortium: Steering Committee: Jaakko Tuomilehto, Rafael Gabriel, Jaana Lindström, Jesús Egido, Andrea Natali, José Carlos Pastor, Michael Brainin, Marcus Lind, Luis Silva, Peter Schwartz, Aleksandra Gilis-Januszewska.

The diagnosis of Diabetes Mellitus supposes an impact for the patient, since it requires a modification in the lifestyle, which demands a great capacity for adaptation and modification of habits. The aim of the study was to determine whether personality factors and health status influence resilience and coping strategies in a sample of healthy and diabetic subjects.
Methodology: The sample included a total of 401 subjects (201 patients with Diabetes and 200 without pathology). The instruments applied for data collection were: Sociodemographic data questionnaire, the Resilience Scale, the Coping Strategies Questionnaire and The ""Big Five"" factor taxonomy. The data collection period was approximately 2 years (between February 2018 and January 2020).
Results: Certain personality factors, such as Emotional Stability, Integrity, Conscientiousness and Extraversion, were positively related to Resilience. Additionally, Emotional Stability, Integrity, and Extraversion were positively associated with Rational Coping. On the other hand, emotional stability, agreeableness and extraversion were negatively related to emotional coping. In relation to health status, the absence of pathology is related to the use of rational strategies more than to the diagnosis of diabetes. Therefore, the participants in this study present different psychological patterns depending on personality and health status.
Conclusions: The present study shows that the subjects of the sample present different psychological patterns depending on Personality and health status.",,,Frontiers in Public Health,,,"Humans; Healthy Volunteers; Adaptation, Psychological; Diabetes Mellitus; Health Status; Personality",2023-03-02,2023,2023-03-02,,11,,1074613,All OA; Gold,Article,"Rivera-Picón, Cristina; Benavente-Cuesta, María Hinojal; Quevedo-Aguado, María Paz; Juárez-Vela, Raúl; Martinez-Tofe, Jesús; Sánchez-González, Juan Luis; Rodríguez-Muñoz, Pedro Manuel","Rivera-Picón, Cristina (Faculty of Health Sciences, Nursing, Pontifical University of Salamanca, Salamanca, Spain); Benavente-Cuesta, María Hinojal (Faculty of Health Sciences, Nursing, Pontifical University of Salamanca, Salamanca, Spain); Quevedo-Aguado, María Paz (Faculty of Health Sciences, Nursing, Pontifical University of Salamanca, Salamanca, Spain); Juárez-Vela, Raúl (Nursing Department, Faculty of Health Sciences, Research Group GRUPAC, University of La Rioja, Logroño, Spain); Martinez-Tofe, Jesús (Nursing Department, Faculty of Health Sciences, Research Group GRUPAC, University of La Rioja, Logroño, Spain); Sánchez-González, Juan Luis (Faculty of Nursing and Physiotherapy, University of Salamanca, Salamanca, Spain); Rodríguez-Muñoz, Pedro Manuel (Faculty of Nursing and Physiotherapy, University of Salamanca, Salamanca, Spain; Department of Nursing, Instituto Maimónides de Investigación Biomédica de Córboda, Córdona, Spain)","Martinez-Tofe, Jesús (University of La Rioja)","Rivera-Picón, Cristina (Pontifical University of Salamanca); Benavente-Cuesta, María Hinojal (Pontifical University of Salamanca); Quevedo-Aguado, María Paz (Pontifical University of Salamanca); Juárez-Vela, Raúl (University of La Rioja); Martinez-Tofe, Jesús (University of La Rioja); Sánchez-González, Juan Luis (University of Salamanca); Rodríguez-Muñoz, Pedro Manuel (University of Salamanca; Department of Nursing, Instituto Maimónides de Investigación Biomédica de Córboda, Córdona, Spain)",2,2,,,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpubh.2023.1074613/pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1155874160,42 Health Sciences; 4203 Health Services and Systems,3 Good Health and Well Being

METHOD: comparative, correlational and cross-sectional design. The sample used (n=271) constituted 40.9% of the total number of nursing professionals. Psychometric properties of the Jefferson Scale of Empathy for Health Professionals were studied. Descriptive statistics were calculated: mean and standard deviation. The association between empathy and age was estimated using regression equations and statistical significance of the regression coefficients, after evaluating the type of curve using variance analysis.
RESULTS: the underlying model of three dimensions of empathy was identified. The values of the descriptive statistics observed were relatively low in empathy and its dimensions. Empathy levels were not associated with the age range. No differences in empathy were found between the types of work schedules. Variability was found in the dimensions: ""compassionate care"" and ""Walking on the patient's shoes"".
CONCLUSION: these results show that the levels of empathy observed may imply a deficient performance in empathetic care for patients. (1) The levels of empathy are low in the nursing professionals studied. (2) These levels are not associated with age and type of work performed. (3) Low levels of empathy could imply a negative alteration of humanized attention.",,,Revista Latino-Americana de Enfermagem,,,"Humans; Empathy; Cross-Sectional Studies; Hospitals, Public; Health Personnel; Nurses; Surveys and Questionnaires",2023-12,2023,2023-12,,31,,e3968,All OA; Gold,Article,"Pontón, Yolanda Dávila; Narváez, Víctor Patricio Díaz; Andrade, Bernardo Montero; Terán, Joseline Janeth López; Reyes-Reyes, Alejandro; Calzadilla-Núñez, Aracelis","Pontón, Yolanda Dávila (Universidad del Azuay, Facultad de Medicina, Cuenca, Ecuador., Universidad del Azuay, Facultad de Medicina, Cuenca, Ecuador); Narváez, Víctor Patricio Díaz (Universidad Andres Bello, Facultad de Odontología, Santiago, Región Metropolitana, Chile., Universidad Andres Bello, Facultad de Odontología, Santiago, Región Metropolitana, Chile); Andrade, Bernardo Montero (Universidad del Azuay, Facultad de Medicina, Cuenca, Ecuador., Universidad del Azuay, Facultad de Medicina, Cuenca, Ecuador); Terán, Joseline Janeth López (Universidad del Azuay, Facultad de Medicina, Cuenca, Ecuador., Universidad del Azuay, Facultad de Medicina, Cuenca, Ecuador); Reyes-Reyes, Alejandro (Universidad Santo Tomás, Facultad de Ciencias Sociales y Comunicación, Concepción, Región del Bío Bio, Chile., Universidad Santo Tomás, Facultad de Ciencias Sociales y Comunicación, Concepción, Región del Bío Bio, Chile); Calzadilla-Núñez, Aracelis (Universidad Bernardo O’Higgins, Departamento de Investigaciones, Santiago, Región Metropolitana, Chile., Universidad Bernardo O’Higgins, Departamento de Investigaciones, Santiago, Región Metropolitana, Chile)","Narváez, Víctor Patricio Díaz (Andrés Bello National University)","Pontón, Yolanda Dávila (University of Azuay); Narváez, Víctor Patricio Díaz (Andrés Bello National University); Andrade, Bernardo Montero (University of Azuay); Terán, Joseline Janeth López (University of Azuay); Reyes-Reyes, Alejandro (Universidad Santo Tomás); Calzadilla-Núñez, Aracelis (Universidad Bernardo O'Higgins)",2,2,,,https://www.scielo.br/j/rlae/a/8FkSJ6JkWg58PxTBYQn8RTw/?lang=es&format=pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1163040558,42 Health Sciences; 4203 Health Services and Systems; 4205 Nursing,

Therefore, the aim of the present study was to evaluate the factors associated with knowledge of pharmacological management of pregnant women in dental students of a Peruvian university located in the capital and province.MethodsThis analytical, cross-sectional, prospective and observational study assessed 312 Peruvian dental students from third to fifth year of study between February and April 2022. A validated questionnaire of 10 closed questions was used to measure knowledge about pharmacological management in pregnant women. A logit model was used to assess the influence of the variables: gender, age, year of study, marital status, place of origin and area of residence. A significance of p < 0.05 was considered.ResultsThe 25.96, 55.13 and 18.91% of the dental students showed poor, fair and good knowledge about pharmacological management in pregnant women; respectively. In addition, it was observed that students under 24 years of age and those from the capital were significantly (p < 0.05) 44% less likely to have poor knowledge of pharmacological management in pregnant women compared to those aged 24 years or older (OR = 0.56; CI: 0.34–0.92) and those from the province (OR = 0.56; CI: 0.32–0.98); respectively. Finally, those in their third and fourth year of study were significantly three times more likely to have poor knowledge (OR = 3.17; CI: 1.68–5.97 and OR = 3.88; CI: 2.07–7.31; respectively) compared to fifth year dental students.ConclusionThe knowledge of dental students about pharmacological management in pregnant women was predominantly of fair level. In addition, it was observed that being under 24 years of age and being from the capital city were protective factors against poor knowledge, while being a third- and fourth-year student was a risk factor. Finally, gender, marital status and area of residence were not influential factors in the level of knowledge.","We thank the Social Responsibility team of the San Juan Bautista Private University, Academic Program of Stomatology, Lima and Ica, Peru, for their constant support in the preparation of this manuscript.",Self-financed.,BMC Medical Education,,,"Humans; Female; Pregnancy; Young Adult; Adult; Pregnant Women; Logistic Models; Students, Dental; Peru; Cross-Sectional Studies; Prospective Studies; Surveys and Questionnaires; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice",2023-02-04,2023,2023-02-04,,23,1,89,All OA; Gold,Article,"Flores-Montalvo, Elizabeth; Córdova-Limaylla, Nancy; Ladera-Castañeda, Marysela; López-Gurreonero, Carlos; Echavarría-Gálvez, Alí; Cornejo-Pinto, Alberto; Cervantes-Ganoza, Luis; Cayo-Rojas, César","Flores-Montalvo, Elizabeth (Universidad Privada San Juan Bautista, School of Stomatology, Av.

The main objective of the study is to assess the effectiveness of CRDPT in detecting HDP.
Methods: This is a systemic review and meta-analysis of published studies on the effectiveness of CRDPT in the detection of HDP. The study was conducted in line with the PRISMA-DTA guidelines. The PICOS framework was used to search for relevant articles using Medline, PubMed, Google Scholar, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library databases. The articles were screened against a set of inclusion and exclusion criteria and analysed using the Review Manager 5.4 software.
Results: A title, abstract and full article screening was conducted on 18,153 potential articles based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria. The screening yielded five articles for meta-analysis. The total number of normotensive pregnant women (n = 3,380) in the included studies was five times higher than the total number of women with pre-eclampsia (n = 535). A difference between the HDP and normotensive group was noted. This is indicated by a significantly decreased in the effectiveness of CRDPT in detecting HDP as compared to normotensive group [Risk Ratio (RR) = 6.32 (2.17, 18.43) p < 0.00001]. The included studies had a high nature of heterogeneity (I 2 = 98%, p < 0.00001) partially due to different study designs included in the analysis and different regions where studies were conducted given that none of these studies were conducted in African countries where HDP is prominent.
Conclusions: According to results generated from 5 studies in this meta-analysis, it was found that CRDPT might not be effective in the detection of hypertensive disorder of pregnancy. Moreover, more research, especially in African women where hypertensive disorders of pregnancy are prevalent, are re-quired to ascertain these findings.

The few studies that focused on Northern Nigeria mostly examined individual correlates, but largely ignored the community correlates. Also, the persistence of armed insurgencies in the region calls for more research attention. This study examines the utilization and the associated individual and community factors of insecticide-treated nets in Northern Nigeria.MethodsThe study adopted a cross-sectional design. Data were extracted from the 2021 Nigeria Malaria Indicator Survey (NMIS). A weighted sample size of 6873 women was analysed. The outcome variable was the utilization of insecticide-treated nets. The explanatory variables selected at the individual/household level were maternal age, maternal education, parity, religion, sex of head of household, household wealth, and household size. The variables selected at the community level were the type of place of residence, geo-political zone of residence, the proportion of children under five who slept under a bed net, the proportion of women aged 15–49 who heard malaria media messages, and the community literacy level. Two variables, namely, the number of mosquito bed nets in the household, and the number of rooms used for sleeping were included for statistical control. Three multilevel mixed-effect regression models were fitted.ResultsThe majority of childbearing women (71.8%) utilized insecticide-treated nets. Parity and household size were the significant individual/household characteristics associated with the utilization of insecticide-treated nets. The proportion of under-five children in the community who slept under mosquito bed nets, and the geopolitical zone of residence were significant community correlates of the use of insecticide-treated nets. In addition, the number of rooms for sleeping, and the number of mosquito bed nets in the households were significantly associated with the utilization of insecticide-treated nets.ConclusionParity, household size, number of sleeping rooms, number of treated bed nets, geo-political zone of residence, and proportion of under-five children sleeping under bed nets are important associated factors of the utilization of insecticide-treated nets in Northern Nigeria. Existing malaria preventive initiatives should be strengthened to target these characteristics.",The authors express gratitude to MEASURE DHS and National Malaria Elimination Programme (Nigeria) for granting permission to access the 2021 NMIS datasets.,Not applicable.,Malaria Journal,,,Female; Humans; Pregnancy; Cross-Sectional Studies; Family Characteristics; Insecticide-Treated Bednets; Insecticides; Malaria; Mosquito Control; Nigeria; Adolescent; Young Adult; Adult; Middle Aged,2023-06-16,2023,2023-06-16,,22,1,184,All OA; Gold,Article,"Solanke, Bola Lukman; Soladoye, Daniel Alabi; Birsirka, Ibrahim Adamu; Abdurraheem, Anifat; Salau, Omowumi Romoke","Solanke, Bola Lukman (Department of Demography and Social Statistics, Obafemi Awolowo University, Ile-Ife, Nigeria); Soladoye, Daniel Alabi (Department of Demography and Social Statistics, Obafemi Awolowo University, Ile-Ife, Nigeria); Birsirka, Ibrahim Adamu (Department of Sociology, Bayero University, Kano, Nigeria); Abdurraheem, Anifat (Department of Sociology, Federal University, Dutsin-ma, Nigeria); Salau, Omowumi Romoke (Department of Clinical Nursing Services, UHD Trust, Royal Bournemouth Dorset, Bournemouth, UK)","Solanke, Bola Lukman (Obafemi Awolowo University)","Solanke, Bola Lukman (Obafemi Awolowo University); Soladoye, Daniel Alabi (Obafemi Awolowo University); Birsirka, Ibrahim Adamu (Bayero University Kano); Abdurraheem, Anifat (Federal University Dutsin-Ma); Salau, Omowumi Romoke (Department of Clinical Nursing Services, UHD Trust, Royal Bournemouth Dorset, Bournemouth, UK)",2,2,,,https://malariajournal.biomedcentral.com/counter/pdf/10.1186/s12936-023-04620-4,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1159886402,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3207 Medical Microbiology,3 Good Health and Well Being

Escherichia coli is a commensal bacterium of the gut microbiota in humans and animals; however, some strains cause infections and are resistant to antibiotics. One of the most common ways of acquiring pathogenic E. coli strains is through food. This review analyzes multidrug-resistant E. coli isolated from food, emphasizing Latin America and Mexico, and the mobile genetic elements (MGEs) responsible for spreading antibiotic resistance determinants among bacteria in different environments and hosts. We conducted a systematic search of the literature published from 2015 to 2022 in open access databases and electronic repositories. The prevalence of 11 E. coli pathotypes was described, with diarrheagenic E. coli pathotypes being the most frequently associated with foodborne illness in different Latin American countries, highlighting the presence of different antibiotic resistance genes mostly carried by IncF-type plasmids or class 1 integrons. Although the global incidence of foodborne illness is high, there have been few studies in Mexico and Latin America, which highlights the need to generate updated epidemiological data from the ""One Health"" approach, which allows monitoring of the multidrug-resistance phenomenon in E. coli from a common perspective in the interaction of human, veterinary, and environmental health.",The authors would like to thank Pepper St. Clair and Sage Chavez from the Department of Biology and Chemistry at California State University Monterey Bay for native English editing.,"This work was supported by the Consejo Nacional de Humanidades, Ciencias y Tecnologías (CONAHCYT) [Grant: CB-2017-2018/A1-S-22136].

Worldwide, most cases are registered in the African Meningitis Belt (AMB). The role of particular socioepidemiological features is essential for understanding disease dynamics and optimizing policy-making.
Objective: To identify socioepidemiological macro-determinants that contribute to explaining the differences in BM incidence between AMB and the rest of Africa.
Methods: Country-level ecologic study based on the cumulative incidence estimates of the Global Burden of Disease study and reports of the MenAfriNet Consortium. Data about relevant socioepidemiological features were extracted from international sources. Multivariate regression models were implemented to define variables associated with the classification of African countries within the AMB and the incidence of BM worldwide.
Results: Cumulative incidences at the AMB sub-regions were 111.93 (west), 87.23 (central), 65.10 (east), and 42.47 (north) per 100,000 population. A pattern of common origin with continuous exposition and seasonality of cases was observed. Socio-epidemiological determinants contributing to differentiating the AMB from the rest of Africa were household occupancy (OR 3.17 CI 95% 1.09-9.22, p = 0.034) and malaria incidence (OR 1.01 CI 95% 1.00-1.02, p = 0.016). BM cumulative incidence worldwide was additionally associated with temperature and gross national income per capita.
Conclusion: Socioeconomic and climate conditions are macro-determinants associated with BM cumulative incidence.

This study aimed to examine the variables associated with suicide risk and determine their predictive capacity. The specific objectives were: (1) to analyze the relationship between suicide risk and model variables and (2) to design an artificial neural network (ANN) with predictive capacity for suicide risk. The sample comprised 337 youths aged 18-33 years. An ex post facto design was used. The results showed that emotional attention, followed by problem solving and perfectionism, were variables that contributed the most to the ANN's predictive capacity. The ANN achieved a hit rate of 85.7%, which is much higher than chance, and with only 14.3% of incorrect cases. This study extracted relevant information on suicide risk and the related risk and protective factors via artificial intelligence. These data will be useful for diagnosis as well as for psycho-educational guidance and prevention.

This study aimed to predict the potential mechanism of LMQXM for ADHD using network pharmacology and molecular docking, which were then validated using animal experiments. Methods: Network pharmacology and molecular docking techniques were used to predict the core targets and potential pathways of LMQXMQ for ADHD, and KEGG pathway enrichment analysis revealed the potential significance of dopamine (DA) and cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) signaling pathways. To verify the hypothesis, we conducted an animal experiment. In the animal experiment, the young spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs) were randomly divided into the model group (SHR), the methylphenidate hydrochloride group (MPH, 4.22 mg/kg), and 3 LMQXM groups (low-dose (LD) group, 5.28 ml/kg; medium-dose (MD) group, 10.56 ml/kg; and high-dose (HD) group, 21.12 ml/kg), and administered by gavage for 4 weeks; the WKY rats were set as the control group. The open field test and Morris water maze test were used to evaluate the behavioral performance of rats, high performance liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC-MS) was used to analyze DA levels in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and striatum of rats, ELISA was used to detect cAMP concentrations in the PFC and striatum, and immunohistochemistry and qPCR were used to analyze positive cell expression and mRNA expression for indicators related to DA and cAMP pathways. Results: The results showed that beta-sitosterol, stigmasterol, rhynchophylline, baicalein, and formononetin might be key components of LMQXM for ADHD and that these components bind well to the core targets, DA receptors (DRD1 and DRD2). Furthermore, LMQXM might act through the DA and cAMP signaling pathways. In the animal experiment, we found that MPH and LMQXM-MD controlled hyperactivity and improved learning and memory in SHRs, while LMQXM-HD only controlled hyperactivity in SHRs; meanwhile, MPH and LMQXM-MD upregulated DA and cAMP levels, mean optical density (MOD) of cAMP, and MOD and mRNA expression of DRD1 and PKA in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and striatum of SHRs, while LMQXM-LD and LMQXM-HD upregulated DA and cAMP levels in the striatum, MOD of cAMP in the PFC, and mRNA expression of PKA in the PFC. However, we did not find a significant regulatory effect of LMQXM on DRD2. Conclusion: To sum up, this study demonstrated that LMQXM may increase DA levels mainly by activating the cAMP/PKA signaling pathway through DRD1, thereby controlling the behavioral disorders of SHRs, which is most effective at moderate doses, and this may be a key mechanism for LMQXM in the treatment of ADHD.",The authors would like to thank all the reviewers who participated in the review and ZJ and ZX’s strong support for ADHD research.,This study was funded by the Shanghai “13th Five-Year Plan” Clinical Key Specialty TCM Pediatrics Project (shslczdzk04102) and the Shanghai Three-Year Action Plan to Further Accelerate the Development of Chinese Medicine Inheritance and Innovation (2021-2023) Project (ZY (2021-2023)-0206-01).,Frontiers in Pharmacology,,,,2023-03-17,2023,2023-03-17,,14,,1144907,All OA; Gold,Article,"Li, Xuejun; Xiao, Zhen; Pu, Wenyan; Jiang, Zhiyan; Wang, Shumin; Zhang, Yixing","Li, Xuejun (Pediatrics, Longhua Hospital Affiliated to Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Shanghai, China; Longhua Clinical Medical College, Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Shanghai, China); Xiao, Zhen (Pediatrics, Longhua Hospital Affiliated to Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Shanghai, China); Pu, Wenyan (Pediatrics, Longhua Hospital Affiliated to Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Shanghai, China; Longhua Clinical Medical College, Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Shanghai, China); Jiang, Zhiyan (Pediatrics, Longhua Hospital Affiliated to Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Shanghai, China); Wang, Shumin (Pediatrics, Longhua Hospital Affiliated to Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Shanghai, China; Longhua Clinical Medical College, Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Shanghai, China); Zhang, Yixing (Pediatrics, Longhua Hospital Affiliated to Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Shanghai, China; Longhua Clinical Medical College, Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Shanghai, China)","Xiao, Zhen (Longhua Hospital Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine); Jiang, Zhiyan (Longhua Hospital Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine)","Li, Xuejun (Longhua Hospital Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine; Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine); Xiao, Zhen (Longhua Hospital Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine); Pu, Wenyan (Longhua Hospital Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine; Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine); Jiang, Zhiyan (Longhua Hospital Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine); Wang, Shumin (Longhua Hospital Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine; Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine); Zhang, Yixing (Longhua Hospital Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine; Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine)",2,2,,,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fphar.2023.1144907/pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1156286333,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3214 Pharmacology and Pharmaceutical Sciences,

Results: The prevalence of adolescent pregnancy among sexually active adolescents in Peru was 30.9% (95%CI: 29.4-32.4%). In the multivariable analysis; being 17-19 years (aPR: 1.48; 95%CI:1.33-1.64), being married or cohabitant (aPR: 4.01; 95%CI: 3.48-4.61) and belonging to the Quechua ethnicity group (aPR: 1.16; 95%CI: 1.07-1.25), were associated with a higher prevalence. Conversely, the following factors were associated with a lower prevalence of pregnancy: being employed (aPR: 0.81; 95%CI: 0.76-0.86), being currently studying (aPR: 0.43; 95%CI: 0.38-0.49), belonging to the second (aPR: 0.91; 95%CI: 0.85-0.97), third (aPR: 0.81; 95%CI: 0.74-0.89), fourth (aPR: 0.79; 95%CI: 0.69-0.91) and fifth (aPR: 0.59; 95%CI: 0.47-0.75) wealth quintile, initiating sexual relations in middle adolescente (aPR: 0.76; 95%CI: 0.69-0.83) or late adolescence (aPR: 0.40; 95%CI: 0.35-0.46), perceiving a future pregnancy as a problem (aPR: 0.77; 95%CI: 0.72-0.83) and having knowledge of the moment in the cycle when pregnancy can occur (aPR: 0.84; 95%CI: 0.77-0.92).
Conclusions: Approximately three out of ten adolescents who initiated a sexual life had at least one pregnancy. Age, marital status, employment, education, wealth, ethnicity, age at first intercourse, knowledge of when in the cycle she may become pregnant, and perception of future pregnancy were associated with adolescent pregnancy. To decrease the prevalence of teenage pregnancy in Peru, it is imperative to enhance national policies concerning family planning and provide comprehensive sex education targeted at adolescents.",,The author(s) declared that no grants were involved in supporting this work.,F1000Research,,,Pregnancy; Female; Humans; Adolescent; Pregnancy in Adolescence; Peru; Prevalence; Cross-Sectional Studies; Health Surveys,2023-10-02,2023,2023-10-02,,11,,566,All OA; Gold,Article,"Caira-Chuquineyra, Brenda; Fernandez-Guzman, Daniel; Meza-Gómez, Adria; Luque-Mamani, Beatriz Milagros; Medina-Carpio, Shawny Luz; Mamani-García, Carlos S.; Romani-Peña, Marilia; Díaz-Vélez, Cristian","Caira-Chuquineyra, Brenda (Facultad de Medicina, Universidad Nacional de San Agustin de Arequipa, Arequipa, Arequipa, 04001, Peru); Fernandez-Guzman, Daniel (Escuela Profesional de Medicina Humana, Universidad Nacional de San Antonio Abad del Cusco, Cusco, 0800, Peru); Meza-Gómez, Adria (Facultad de Medicina, Universidad Nacional de San Agustin de Arequipa, Arequipa, Arequipa, 04001, Peru); Luque-Mamani, Beatriz Milagros (Facultad de Medicina, Universidad Nacional de San Agustin de Arequipa, Arequipa, Arequipa, 04001, Peru); Medina-Carpio, Shawny Luz (Facultad de Medicina, Universidad Nacional de San Agustin de Arequipa, Arequipa, Arequipa, 04001, Peru); Mamani-García, Carlos S.

Moreover, chronic stress can affect sleep. A unidirectional relationship has been established between burnout and sleep, and it is known that white-collar workers with burnout syndrome have sleep fragmentation and marked daytime sleepiness.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to assess the relationships between burnout and sleep quality in elementary school teachers in Mexico.
METHODS: We collected data from more than 400 teachers who completed tests. Correlation analyses controlled for anxiety and depression, and Poisson logistic regression analyses were performed to examine the relationships of burnout with sleep quality, depression, and anxiety.
RESULTS: There was a significant correlation between burnout syndrome (mainly in the dimension of emotional exhaustion) and sleep disturbances; significant correlations were also observed with other burnout, depression, and anxiety dimensions. The strength of the correlations decreased after controlling for depression and anxiety.
CONCLUSIONS: The symptoms of burnout syndrome in teachers can overlap with sleep disorders, so it is necessary to make a differential diagnosis to differentiate burnout syndrome from depression and anxiety, among others.",We sincerely acknowledge the teachers for their participation in this research.,This research received no external funding.,International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health,,"Anthony Montgomery, Igor Portoghese, Renato Pisanti, Chiara Consiglio, Amal K.

This paradigm allows the interpretation and study of phenomena from their own complexity. In public health, qualitative research has gained ground, as it allows the study of subjective aspects of the health-disease process.
Objective: To describe and analyze qualitative research on health issues published in Colombian journals between 2011 and 2021.
Materials and methods: A descriptive study on qualitative health research published in Colombian journals between 2011 and 2021 was carried out.
Results: Eighty-one articles were included. The journal with the highest number of publications was the Revista de Salud Pública (44.4%). The year with the highest
production corresponded to 2019 and the main design was the fundamental theory (17.3%). In 79% of the articles, women were the main author and nursing was the most frequent profession of undergraduate training. The most frequent topic was HIV/AIDS (12.3%), followed by cancer (11.1%). In 24.6% of the studies, a software was used for the analysis.
Conclusions: Qualitative research in public health has had a variable dynamic in scientific production between 2011 and 2021. Despite its benefits, the adoption of computer programs for qualitative analysis is rare. Nursing stands out as the area that concentrates the largest number of qualitative studies in public health with contributions on topics such as COVID-19 and HIV/AIDS.",,Ninguna persona o entidad ha contribuido financieramente en el desarrollo de este artículo.,Biomédica,,,Humans; COVID-19; Retrospective Studies,2023-03-30,2023,2023-03-30,,43,1,69-82,All OA; Gold,Article,"Rodríguez-Gómez, Rodolfo","Rodríguez-Gómez, Rodolfo (Asesor metodológico en investigación en salud, Bogotá, D.C., Colombia, Bogotá, D.C., Colombia)","Rodríguez-Gómez, Rodolfo (Asesor metodológico en investigación en salud, Bogotá, D.C., Colombia, Bogotá, D.C., Colombia)","Rodríguez-Gómez, Rodolfo (Asesor metodológico en investigación en salud, Bogotá, D.C., Colombia, Bogotá, D.C., Colombia)",2,1,,,https://revistabiomedica.org/index.php/biomedica/article/download/6476/5194,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1157585001,42 Health Sciences; 4203 Health Services and Systems,3 Good Health and Well Being

METHOD: research with a qualitative approach, based on the Grounded Theory, conducted with 11 professors of the nursing course of a public university in the central region of Brazil in 2020 and 2021. Online semi-structured interviews were analyzed partially in the light of the Constructivist Grounded Theory.
RESULTS: factors that lead lecturer to experience violence are characterized by institutional culture, gender, professor's perception of violence, and the triggers that drive students to commit violence. Social status and inequalities lead to positions of domination and, consequently, create a fertile ground for violence.
FINAL CONSIDERATIONS: analyzing violence under Bourdieu's theory, it is clear that student violence towards lecturer and the reports contained in this study deserve pedagogical reflection.

The methodology focused on a non-experimental type of exploratory level, qualitative method and historical-interpretive approach through documentary analysis. The theoretical development allows us to glimpse the participation of chemistry in the multidisciplinary, interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary dimensions; to be used in secondary and higher education institutions, avoiding continuous and dogmatic monodisciplinary learning. As a result of the investigation, it was found that history and chemistry have a fundamental and convergent dimension, the epistemological dimension. The historical evolution of chemistry accounts for the ways of accessing knowledge and categorizing it as valid knowledge. Therefore, it is concluded that the epistemology of chemistry has a causal relationship with the corresponding paradigm, and in the current era, chemistry is part of the logical positivist paradigm, by complying with the epistemological and epistemological characteristics of the same and in the prevalence of empirical testing.",,,Sophía,,,,2023-01-13,2023,2023-01-13,,,34,291-313,All OA; Gold,Article,"Vélez-Jiménez, Dolores; Mora-Rojas, Celso Obdulio","Vélez-Jiménez, Dolores (Universidad Iberoamericana); Mora-Rojas, Celso Obdulio (Universidad Del Norte)",,"Vélez-Jiménez, Dolores (Universidad Iberoamericana); Mora-Rojas, Celso Obdulio (Universidad del Norte)",2,2,,,https://sophia.ups.edu.ec/index.php/sophia/article/download/6321/6423,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1154521452,39 Education; 50 Philosophy and Religious Studies; 5002 History and Philosophy Of Specific Fields,

However, in some places, in situ measurements are not always available. In this paper, active power predictions for the city of Santa Marta-Colombia using a nonlinear autoregressive exogenous model (NARX) network were performed. The network was trained with a reliable dataset from a wind farm located in Turkey, because the meteorological data from the city of Santa Marta are unavailable or unreliable on certain dates. Three training and testing cases were designed, with different input variables and varying the network target between active power and wind speed. The dataset was obtained from the Kaggle platform, and is made up of five variables: date, active power, wind speed, theoretical power, and wind direction; each with 50,530 samples, which were preprocessed and, in some cases, normalized, to facilitate the neural network learning.

This paper proposes the utilization and control of repurposed EVBs in Community Energy Storage Systems (CESSs) in Low-Voltage (LV) distribution networks. A real-time Community Energy Management System (CEMS) is proposed for the control of the CESS, which uses repurposed EVBs and a power electronic interface comprised of a four-quadrant ac/dc converter and a bidirectional dc/dc converter together with the corresponding controllers. To assess the capability of the controller in providing CESS services in the form of active and reactive power control in an LV residential distribution network, four case studies are carried out using Hardware-in-the-Loop (HIL) simulations. The HIL simulations use an actual battery pack and a four-quadrants converter system. The impact of the proposed controller on the repurposed EVBs’ cycling performance is evaluated using a Rainflow Counting Algorithm (RCA). The distribution transformer Loss of Life (LoL) is also estimated. The HIL simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed real-time CEMS in slowing down the degradation of the battery and LoL of the distribution transformer, while improving the LV distribution system’s voltage profile.","The authors would like to thank the University of Waterloo, Waterloo, Canada, Qassim University, Qassim, Saudi Arabia, and Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia, for their valuable contributions to this research.",,IEEE Access,,,,2023-01-01,2023,2023-12-25,2023-01-01,11,,146238-146249,All OA; Gold,Article,"Alharbi, Talal; Restrepo, Mauricio; Kazerani, Mehrdad; Bhattacharya, Kankar","Alharbi, Talal (Department of Electrical Engineering, College of Engineering, Qassim University, Buraydah, Qassim, 52571, Saudi Arabia); Restrepo, Mauricio (Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, 081007, Colombia); Kazerani, Mehrdad (Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Waterloo, Waterloo, ON, N2L 3G1, Canada); Bhattacharya, Kankar (Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Waterloo, Waterloo, ON, N2L 3G1, Canada)","Alharbi, Talal (Qassim University)","Alharbi, Talal (Qassim University); Restrepo, Mauricio (Universidad del Norte); Kazerani, Mehrdad (University of Waterloo); Bhattacharya, Kankar (University of Waterloo)",2,2,,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/ielx7/6287639/6514899/10373410.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1167351058,"40 Engineering; 4007 Control Engineering, Mechatronics and Robotics; 4008 Electrical Engineering; 4009 Electronics, Sensors and Digital Hardware; 4010 Engineering Practice and Education",7 Affordable and Clean Energy

In this study, we report the experimental realization of multiferroic states in this family of materials, at room temperature, in bulk single crystals of Te-doped WSe2. We observe the coexistence of ferromagnetism and ferroelectricity, evidenced in the presence of magnetization and piezoresponse force microscopy hysteresis loops.

Researchers can locate the device by analyzing the radio signals used for sending information. However, it is necessary to know the impact of body obstruction on communication links and, therefore, on the localization system. The paper studies this impact by using field tests employing one LoRa node with an omnidirectional antenna in an outdoor parking lot with vegetation. The tests use four LoRa gateways located in the corners of the area to measure the signals with and without body obstruction. The node was located on the subject’s chest to maximize signal obstruction. Results show that signal strength decreases by an average of 3 dB on links with body shadowing. Additionally, the study uses these signals with machine learning and Kalman filter localization algorithms. Finally, the results show that body shadowing affects location accuracy in most methods. These results are useful for IoT researchers that need to locate people carrying LoRaWAN devices but cannot use GPS/GNSS due to energy constraints.",,"This work is part of the R&D and innovation project ONOFRE-3 (Grant PID2020-112675RB-C42), funded by Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovación / Agencia Estatal de Investigación (MCIN/AEI/10.13039/501100011033), and part of the PeaceOfMind project under Grant PID2019-105470RB-C31.",IEEE Access,,,,2023-01-01,2023,2023-01-25,2023-01-01,11,,9521-9528,All OA; Gold,Article,"Marquez, Luz E.; Bahillo, Alfonso; Calle, Maria; De Miguel, Ignacio","Marquez, Luz E.

The University of Sydney, with 16 articles, was the most productive institution and the one with the most citations per publication was Saveetha University (19.7). The author with the most articles and citations related to the topic was George Ajesh with 13 and 136, respectively. Johnson Marre had the highest impact (15.1) and expected citations with respect to the global average (FWCI: 2.49).
CONCLUSIONS: The scientific production on oral health in pregnancy has increased, with a greater preference by authors for scientific journals in the Q1 and Q2 quartile. The United States is the country with the most publications, although Australia has a greater number of institutions among the most productive.

The lack of biotransformation capabilities of many in vitro systems may under- or overestimate the hazard of compounds that are metabolized to more or less active metabolites in vivo. One approach to retrofitting existing bioassays with metabolic competence is the lid-based Alginate Immobilization of Metabolic Enzymes (AIME) method, which adds hepatic metabolism to conventional high-throughput screening platforms. Here, limitations of the lid-based AIME method were addressed by incorporating bioprinting, which involved depositing S9-encapsulated microspheres into standard 384-well plates with requisite cofactors for phase I and II hepatic metabolism. Objectives of this study included: 1) compare the lid-based and AIME bioprinting methods by assessing the enzymatic activity of a common cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzyme, 2) use biochemical assays with the bioprinting method to characterize additional measures of phase I and II metabolic activity, and 3) evaluate the bioprinting method by screening 25 chemicals of known metabolism-dependent bioactivity in the VM7Luc estrogen receptor transactivation (ERTA) assay. A comparison of the two methods revealed comparable precision and dynamic range. Activity of additional CYP enzymes and glucuronidation was observed using the AIME bioprinting method. The ERTA experiment identified 19/21 ER-active test chemicals, 14 of which were concordant with expected biotransformation effects (73.7%). Additional refinement of the AIME bioprinting method has the potential to expand high-throughput screening capabilities in a robust, accessible manner to incorporate in vitro metabolic competence.","The authors thank Todd Zurlinden, Madison Feshuk, and Jason Brown for assistance with running the ToxCast Data Analysis Pipeline, as well as Steven Simmons, Joshua Harrill, John Cowden, and Sid Hunter for technical review and critical reading of the manuscript.",This work was funded by U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.,Frontiers in Toxicology,,,,2023-05-04,2023,2023-05-04,,5,,1196245,All OA; Gold,Article,"Hopperstad, Kristen; Deisenroth, Chad","Hopperstad, Kristen (Center for Computational Toxicology and Exposure, Office of Research and Development, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Durham, NC, United States); Deisenroth, Chad (Center for Computational Toxicology and Exposure, Office of Research and Development, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Durham, NC, United States)","Deisenroth, Chad (Environmental Protection Agency)","Hopperstad, Kristen (Environmental Protection Agency); Deisenroth, Chad (Environmental Protection Agency)",2,2,,,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/ftox.2023.1196245/pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1157764430,34 Chemical Sciences; 3404 Medicinal and Biomolecular Chemistry; 41 Environmental Sciences,

An optimisation analysis was performed using the Hybrid Optimization Model for Multiple Energy Resources (HOMER) software to minimise energy costs and several system architectures were obtained for different operating scenarios. The performance and cash flow of the selected system were included. The results suggest that the combination of traditional technologies for fuel cell power generation could be feasible for a country like Colombia, depending on economic factors such as the Consumer Price Index (CPI), the discount rate, and the availability of renewable resources. The proposed system achieves a Levelized Cost of Electricity (LCOE) of $0.112/kWh, comparable to state-of-the-art systems in the literature.

The research proposed in our study used mixed methods: quantitative analyses made it possible to statistically formulate two epistemological profiles for the NOS views of the participating teachers; qualitative analyses allowed characterizing those views, which proved to be eclectic, in the framework of the proposed epistemological profiles. On the basis of the results obtained, which show that subjects under study hold views on what science is that are inadequate from the point of view of the current curriculum prescriptions, we argue in favor of introducing an explicit meta-scientific component from the very beginning of pre-service teacher education and we present ideas along this line.

The work developed is based on a quasi-experimental longitudinal research methodology, in which three key phases are addressed; the first phase corresponds to the systematic review of the literature, which allows the identification of the key components of the proposed GCMS+ system. The second phase of the methodology focused on the modelling of the GCMS+ system, which visually and descriptively describes the structural components, flows, and control mechanisms. The third phase of the methodology focuses on the validation of the GCMS+ system proposed from the discussed literature and contrasting the position of the authors, which is identified through a conceptual discussion.

The task is to reveal in Rancière’s aesthetic visions the dominant motivation for freeing the world from the visible for a specific moment form of ordering social existence. However, it is evident that contrary to the statement of the return of politics, the way Rancière interprets it says otherwise – the usual political means are actually helpless, which is called «tragedy». However, at the same time, the attitude to change is preserved and implemented differently. Methodology. The article uses the method of in-depth reflective reading, which involves a critical-analytical explication, which concerns not so much the work itself, but those features of the anthropological situation, which are evidenced by the topic of the theoretical study. The method of dialectical-logical analysis is also significant – working with concepts that imply a subtle distinction and mutual transformation. Scientific novelty. Contrary to theses about «the end of philosophy», Rancière’s concept of politics has the features of a philosophical discourse: first, the formulation of the question itself has been typical of philosophy since the time of Kant: «how is politics possible»; secondly, the reading of his texts confirms the presence of such content, which is missed by generally accepted usage, which is related precisely to the search for truth, characteristic of philosophical discourse since antiquity. The semantic analysis of the concepts La mésentente and Le partage du sensible testifies: the very morphological structure of these concepts indicates the specific «positive negativity» of the first; in the second philosophy, there is a connection with dialogic philosophy and the philosophy of Marx, which synthesizes Hegel and Feuerbach. The lexeme partage orients to the thinking that corresponds to identity through disrupted identity; that is, the unity of the self (or the integrity of society) includes otherness rather than excluding it. The ambivalence of the lexeme sensible appears as a means by which politics is understood not as a phenomenon of state and power structures but as the primary basis of human existence for the constitution of a common cause. La mésentente and Le partage du sensible are synthesized as Dissensus. Conclusion.

The results might help determine immunization strategies.
DESIGN AND METHODS: Unlike previous studies, we analyzed NAbs in a random sample of 110 IgG positive sera from individuals who participated in a population-based seroprevalence transversal study, carried out in May 2022 in two Chilean cities, a country with high vaccination coverage.
RESULTS: Our findings indicate that 98.2% of individuals had NAbs against Wuhan, 65.5% against Omicron, and 32.7% tested positive for Wuhan but not Omicron. Factors influencing protective immunity included a prior natural infection and the number of vaccines received. NAbs titers against the original virus were high, demonstrating vaccine effectiveness in the population. However, the level of antibodies decreased when measuring NAbs against Omicron, particularly among older individuals, indicating a decline in vaccine protection. Previous COVID-19 episodes acted as a natural booster, increasing NAbs titers against both virus strains.
CONCLUSIONS: Protective immunity against the original Wuhan SARS-CoV-2 virus is reduced when compared to Omicron variant.

The results linked to the phytosynthesis of ZnONP indicate a novel method of fabricating nanostructured material, nanoparticles with spherical morphology and an average size of 30 nm. The assays were made based on the viral viability of avian coronavirus according to the mortality of SPF embryonated eggs and a Real-Time PCR for viral load estimation. This was a model to evaluate the sanitizing effects against coronaviruses since they share a very similar structure and chemistry with SAR-CoV-2. The influence of the type of textile treatment evidenced the potential effect of the sanitizing UV light, which achieved 100% of embryo viability. The response of the ZnONP + UV nebulization showed a notorious influence of photoactivation according to the exposure time, and the 60-s treatment achieved a decrease of 88.9% in viral viability, compared to 77.8% and 55.6% corresponding to the 120 and 180-s treatments, respectively. Regarding the decrease in viral load between the types of treatments, UV 180 s reduced 98.42% and UV 60 s + ZnONP reduced 99.46%, respectively.

In the framework of hyperbolic diffusion, the non-local Fisher's information with the x-parameter is related to the local Fisher's information with the t-parameter. A perturbation theory is presented to calculate Shannon's entropy of the telegrapher's equation at long times, as well as a toy model to describe the system as an attenuated wave in the ballistic regime (short times).","M.O.C. acknowledges the funding provided by Secretaría de Ciencia Técnica y Postgrado, Universidad Nacional de Cuyo.",This research received no external funding.,Entropy,,,,2023-12-06,2023,2023-12-06,,25,12,1627,All OA; Gold,Article,"Cáceres, Manuel O.; Nizama, Marco; Pennini, Flavia","Cáceres, Manuel O.

The present research has a double objective: on the one hand, it seeks to validate the psychometric properties of the TPACK-ES scale in the Spanish context; and on the other hand, to analyse the perceptions of self-efficacy in the model of Primary and Secondary Education teachers in initial training. A total of 303 university students with a mean age of 23.12 ± 3.21 years, enrolled in a university in the north of Spain, agreed to participate in this study. The results obtained confirm the heptafactorial structure of the model, its internal consistency, structural stability and adaptation to optimal fit indices. Likewise, statistically significant differences are identified in the TK and TPK dimensions, in structuring variables of the model and in the PK (pedagogical knowledge), PCK (pedagogical knowledge of content), TPK (pedagogical technological knowledge) and TPACK dimensions, depending on the level of teacher training and the gender of the future teacher.

In this sense, the present study aimed to examine the association between love, jealousy, satisfaction, and violence in young couples through network analysis. A total of 834 young people and adults between 18 and 38 years of age (Mean = 20.97, SD = 2.39) participated; 646 women (77.50%) and 188 men (22.50%), who completed the Sternberg's love scale (STLS-R), Brief Jealousy Scale (BJS), Relationship Assessment Scale (RAS) and Woman Abuse Screening Tool (WAST-2). A partial unregularized network was estimated using the ggmModSelect function. The Bridge Strength index was calculated because the aim was to identify the bridge nodes between the variables under study. The results reveal that two nodes of the love variable, Commitment, and Intimacy, had a direct and moderate relationship with the Satisfaction node. The latter is the central node in the network. However, in the male group, the most intense associations are in Satisfaction-Intimacy, Violence-Passion, Jealousy-Commitment. It is concluded that there are relevant connections between the nodes of the network, which invite further research on couple relationships after the COVID-19 pandemic.",,The author(s) received no specific funding for this work.,PLOS ONE,,Beatriz Talavera-Velasco,Adult; Humans; Male; Female; Adolescent; Jealousy; Interpersonal Relations; Love; Pandemics; COVID-19; Spouse Abuse; Personal Satisfaction,2023-05-05,2023,2023-05-05,,18,5,e0285555,All OA; Gold,Article,"Ventura-León, José; Lino-Cruz, Cristopher","Ventura-León, José (Facultad de Ciencias de la Salud, Universidad Privada del Norte, Lima, Perú); Lino-Cruz, Cristopher (Facultad de Psicología, Universidad Peruana de Ciencias Aplicadas, Lima, Perú)","Ventura-León, José (Private University of the North)","Ventura-León, José (Private University of the North); Lino-Cruz, Cristopher (Peruvian University of Applied Sciences)",2,2,,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0285555&type=printable,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1157794587,52 Psychology; 5205 Social and Personality Psychology,

This research aimed to determine the influence of corn starch percentage on the physicomechanical and microstructural properties of a diatomite-based porous ceramic. The starch consolidation casting technique was applied to fabricate a diatomite-based thermal insulating ceramic with hierarchical porosity. Diatomite mixtures with 0%, 10%, 20%, 30%, and 40% starch were consolidated. The results show that starch content significantly influences apparent porosity, and this, in turn, influences several parameters, such as thermal conductivity, diametral compressive strength, microstructure, and water absorption of diatomite-based ceramics. The porous ceramic processed by the starch consolidation casting method corresponding to the mixture of diatomite with 30% starch obtained the best properties, with a thermal conductivity of 0.0984 W/m·K, an apparent porosity of 57.88%, a water absorption of 58.45%, and a diametral compressive strength of 35.18 kg/cm2 (3.45 MPa).

Spinitectus petterae was described from North African catfish, Clarias gariepinus (Burchell), whereas S. polli infects squeakers, Synodontis spp. During parasitological surveys in the Vaal River system (Orange River catchment), Spinitectus specimens were collected from C. gariepinus. These systems are adjacent but not connected. Therefore, this study aimed to identify the specimens collected using morphological and molecular techniques. The morphological study included light and scanning electron microscopy of whole specimens and excised spicules. Specimens were genetically characterised using 18S rDNA, 28S rDNA and cox1 mtDNA. Additionally, immature specimens of S. petterae were collected near the type locality. Morphological characteristics were most similar to S. petterae from C. gariepinus, whereas genetic data were dissimilar to all available data for the genus. Additional morphological characteristics noted for S. petterae in the present study were the details of the left and right spicule structure and the porous structures on the pseudolabia. Specimens from the Vaal River system differed from those originally described as S. petterae by additional spines posterior to the third ring, lacking caudal alae and variable total body and male oesophagus length. Based on 18S rDNA, haplotypes from the type locality varied only slightly from the study material, supporting the morphological identification. However, 28S rDNA and, more conspicuously, cox1 mtDNA displayed substantial variation between specimens from these localities, which needs further investigation. Haplotypes generated in the present study were highly dissimilar to those characterised for S. petterae from Tanzania and Egypt. Nevertheless, the nematodes collected from C. gariepinus in the Vaal River system are considered S. petterae. This study expands the geographical distribution and adds additional morphological and genetic information for S. petterae, contributing to the limited knowledge of African species of Spinitectus.",,,Folia Parasitologica,,,"Animals; Male; Catfishes; Rivers; Rhabditida; Microscopy, Electron, Scanning; Spiruroidea; DNA, Ribosomal",2023-01-10,2023,2023-01-10,,70,,,All OA; Gold,Article,"Austin, Lucinda; Dos Santos, Quinton Marco; Avenant-Oldewage, Annemarie","Austin, Lucinda (Department of Zoology, University of Johannesburg, Johannesburg, South Africa.); Dos Santos, Quinton Marco (Department of Zoology, University of Johannesburg, Johannesburg, South Africa.); Avenant-Oldewage, Annemarie (Department of Zoology, University of Johannesburg, Johannesburg, South Africa.)",,"Austin, Lucinda (University of Johannesburg); Dos Santos, Quinton Marco (University of Johannesburg); Avenant-Oldewage, Annemarie (University of Johannesburg)",2,2,,,http://folia.paru.cas.cz/doi/10.14411/fp.2023.002.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1154365739,"30 Agricultural, Veterinary and Food Sciences; 3005 Fisheries Sciences",

This manuscript discloses the corrosion behavior of titanium electrodes using a superposition model based on mixed potential theory and the evaluation of the superficial performance of the Ti electrodes operated to 4 V/SHE solar electroflotation in contact with a solution of 0.5 M NaCl. Additionally provided is an electrochemical analysis of Ti electrodes regarding HER, ORR, OER, and CER that occur during the solar saline EF process. The non-linear superposition model by mixed potential theory gives electrochemical and corrosion parameters that complement the information published in scientific journals, the corrosion current density and corrosion potential in these conditions is 0.069 A/m2 and -7.27 mV, respectively. The formation of TiO2 and TiOCl on the anode electrode was visualized, resulting in a reduction of its weight loss of the anode electrode.","This work was partially done by Felipe M.

The aim of the study was to evaluate self-medication as a factor associated with the purchase of brand-name and over-the-counter (OTC) drugs in older adults in Peru.
Methods: A secondary analysis was performed using an analytical cross-sectional design of data from a nationally representative survey from 2014 to 2016. The exposure variable was self-medication, defined as the purchase of medicines without a prescription. The dependent variables were purchases of brand-name and OTC drugs, both as a dichotomous response (yes/no). Information of sociodemographic variables, health insurance, and the types of drugs purchased by the participants was collected. Crude prevalence ratios (PR) were calculated and adjusted using generalized linear models of the Poisson family, considering the complex sample of the survey.
Results: In this study, 1,115 respondents were evaluated, with a mean age of 63.8 years and a male proportion of 48.2%. The prevalence of self-medication was 66.6%, while the proportions of purchases of brand-name and OTC drugs were 62.4% and 23.6%, respectively. The adjusted Poisson regression analysis revealed an association between self-medication and the purchase of brand-name drugs (adjusted PR [aPR]=1.09; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.01-1.19). Likewise, self-medication was associated with the purchase of OTC medications (aPR=1.97; 95%CI: 1.55-2.51).
Conclusions: This study evidenced a high prevalence of self-medication in Peruvian older adults. Two-thirds of the surveyed people bought brand-name drugs, whereas one-quarter bought OTC drugs. Self-medication was associated with a greater likelihood of buying brand-name and OTC drugs.",Not applicable.,,Canadian Geriatrics Journal,,,,2023-03-02,2023,2023-03-02,,26,1,187-199,All OA; Gold,Article,"Herrera-Añazco, Percy; Mougenot, Benoit; Benites-Meza, Jerry K.; Barturén-Alvarado, Luz C.; Zumarán-Nuñez, Carlos J.; Boyd-Gamarra, Maria A.; Runzer-Colmenares, Fernando M.; Benites-Zapata, Vicente A.","Herrera-Añazco, Percy (Facultad de Ciencias de la Salud, Universidad Privada del Norte, Trujillo, Peru; Red Internacional en Salud Colectiva y Salud Intercultural, Mexico City, Mexico); Mougenot, Benoit (Facultad de Ciencias Empresariales, Universidad San Ignacio de Loyola, Lima, Peru; Centro de Excelencia en Investigaciones Económicas y Sociales en Salud, Universidad San Ignacio de Loyola, Lima, Peru); Benites-Meza, Jerry K.

METHODS: Nine videotaped medical consultations with students, conducted at the health centre of a higher education institution in northern Chile, were analysed, drawing on the thematic analysis to organize the most salient themes.
RESULTS: Three major themes were identified in the analysis, along with their subthemes: (1) experiencing overpowering symptoms, including variable, multiple, and severe symptoms; (2) facing medical, social, and academic barriers; (3) engaging in self-management behaviours, such as self-medication, self-treatment, changing therapies, and non-compliance.
CONCLUSION: As the healthcare system is mostly ineffective in diagnosing students with invisible disabilities as well as providing them with long-lasting help, the students often have to manage their conditions by themselves, without much success. It seems essential to promote the development of stronger links between health providers and universities to allow for early disability detection and awareness-raising programs within educational institutions. Further research should focus on strategies promoting effective support mechanisms to decrease barriers and increase the inclusion of these individuals.",,The work was supported by the Agencia Nacional de Investigación y Desarrollo [Fondecyt 11191027].,International Journal of Qualitative Studies on Health and Well-Being,,,Humans; Chile; Universities; Disabled Persons; Students; Qualitative Research; Referral and Consultation,2023-06-10,2023,2023-06-10,2023-12-31,18,1,2221905,All OA; Gold,Article,"Sowińska, Agnieszka; Tudela, Rosa Pezoa","Sowińska, Agnieszka (Department of Experimental Linguistics, Nicolaus Copernicus University, Torun, Poland (Country of Residence); Universidad Católica Del Norte, Escuela de Inglés, Antofagasta, Chile); Tudela, Rosa Pezoa (Universidad Católica Del Norte, Escuela de Inglés, Antofagasta, Chile; Faculty of Arts, Cultures, Languages and Linguistics, University of Auckland, Auckland, New Zealand (Country of Residence))","Sowińska, Agnieszka (Nicolaus Copernicus University; Catholic University of the North)","Sowińska, Agnieszka (Nicolaus Copernicus University; Catholic University of the North); Tudela, Rosa Pezoa (Catholic University of the North; University of Auckland)",2,2,,,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/17482631.2023.2221905?needAccess=true&role=button,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1159702821,42 Health Sciences; 4203 Health Services and Systems,4 Quality Education

A sociodemographic survey, the Mpox Fear Scale, was used. Conspiracy Beliefs about Mpox was assessed using three questions created specifically for this study. For inferential purposes, simple ordinal regressions (""crude models"") were performed between each factor and the outcome. ResultsRegarding their intention to be vaccinated against Mpox, more than 60% expressed clear approval. Being non-heterosexual, having greater emotional fear of Mpox, and perceiving some potential for this disease to become the next pandemic were related to greater intention to vaccinate. On the other hand, being older, having low perceived usefulness of COVID-19 vaccines, and having higher conspiracy beliefs about Mpox were associated with lower intention to vaccinate. ConclusionThe study provides initial information for future research seeking to better analyze Mpox vaccination intention. In addition, cross-sectional data are provided that can be used to develop public health policies that target subgroups with low prevalence of intention to vaccinate against Mpox.",No,No funding received.,Psicologia: Reflexão e Crítica,,,,2023-12-18,2023,2023-12-18,,36,1,39,All OA; Gold,Article,"Caycho-Rodríguez, Tomás; Valencia, Pablo D.; Ventura-León, José; Carbajal-León, Carlos; Vilca, Lindsey W.; Gallegos, Miguel; Reyes-Bossio, Mario; Noe-Grijalva, Martin; Delgado-Campusano, Mariel; del Carpio Toia, Águeda Muñoz; Torales, Julio; Barria-Asenjo, Nicol A.","Caycho-Rodríguez, Tomás (Facultad de Psicología, Universidad Científica del Sur, Lima, Peru); Valencia, Pablo D.

We have previously shown that ethanol-exposed astrocytes alter neuronal neurite outgrowth in an in vitro co-culture system and that ethanol alters the astrocyte-produced extracellular matrix (ECM) in vitro, with similar alterations in vivo. In this study, we utilized the translating ribosome affinity purification (TRAP) procedure in Aldh1l1-EGFP/Rpl10a transgenic mouse primary cortical astrocyte cultures to transcriptionally and translationally profile the astrocyte response to ethanol. We found a large number of differences between the total RNA pool and the translating RNA pool, indicating that the transcriptional state of astrocytes may not always reflect the translational state of astrocytes. In addition, there was a considerable overlap between ethanol-dysregulated genes in the total RNA pool and the translating RNA pool. Comparisons to published datasets indicate the in vitro model used here is most similar to PD1 or PD7 in vivo cortical astrocytes, and the ethanol-regulated genes showed a significant overlap with models of chronic ethanol exposure in astrocytes, a model of third-trimester ethanol exposure in the hippocampus and cerebellum, and an acute model of ethanol exposure in the hippocampus. These findings will further our understanding of the effects of ethanol on astrocyte gene expression and protein translation and how these changes may alter brain development and support the use of in vitro astrocyte cultures as models of neonatal astrocytes.",,"This study was supported by NIH P60AA010760, R01AA029486, and U01AA029965, VA Merit Review Award I01BX001819, and by facilities and resources at the Portland VA Health Care System.

This allows us to systematically investigate the influence of the isomeric positional effect on their structures. The organic ligands were obtained by saponification from their respective ester precursors ethyl-5-methyl-1-(pyridin-3-ylmethyl)-1H-1,2,3-triazole-4-carboxylate (P1) and ethyl-5-methyl-1-(pyridin-4-ylmethyl)-1H-1,2,3-triazole-4-carboxylate (P2), resulting in their corresponding sodium salt forms, 3-MPTC, and 4-MPTC. The structure of the Zn(II) CPs determined by single-crystal X-ray diffraction reveals that both CPs have 2D supramolecular hydrogen bond networks. The 2D supramolecular network of [Zn(L1)]n (1) is built up by hydrogen bond interactions between oxygen and hydrogen atoms between neighboring n-methylpyridyltriazole molecules, whereas in [Zn(L2)·4H2O]n (2) the water molecules link 1D polymeric chains forming a 2D supramolecular aggregate. The structures of 1 and 2 clearly show that the isomeric effect in the semi-rigid ligands plays a vital role in constructing the Zn(II) coordination polymers, helped by the presence of the methylene spacer group, in the final structural conformation. The structures of 1 and 2 significantly affect their luminescent properties. Thus, while 2 shows strong emission at room temperature centered at 367 nm, the emission of 1 is quenched substantially.","The authors thank ANID for their support with the financial support from “Fondo Nacional de Desarrollo Científico y Tecnológico [FONDECYT (Chile), grant no. 1170256, 1210689 and 3190500, FONDEQUIP EQM 130021 180024 (I.

Functional diversity in these complexes depends on the type of RCOR included, which modulates the catalytic activity of the complex. Here, we studied the duplicative history of the RCOR and LSD gene families and analyzed the evolution of their interaction. We found that RCOR genes are the product of the two rounds of whole-genome duplications that occurred early in vertebrate evolution. In contrast, the origin of the LSD genes traces back before to the divergence of animals and plants. Using bioinformatics tools, we show that the RCOR and LSD1 interaction precedes the RCOR repertoire expansion that occurred in the last common ancestor of jawed vertebrates. Overall, we trace LSD1-RCOR complex evolution and propose that animal non-model species offer advantages in addressing questions about the molecular biology of this epigenetic complex.","This work was supported by Fondo Nacional de Desarrollo Científico y Tecnológico from Chile (FONDECYT 1210471) and Millennium Nucleus of Ion Channel Associated Diseases (MiNICAD), Iniciativa Científica Milenio, Ministry of Economy, Development and Tourism from Chile to J.C.O., Fondo Nacional de Desarrollo Científico y Tecnológico from Chile (FONDECYT 1191152) to M.E.A. and Postdoctorado ANID 3230704 to M.O.-C.

Scleractinian corals are an example of this – they are key species in both shallow and deep ecosystems. However, what evolutionary processes resulted in current depth distribution of the marine fauna is a long-standing question. Various conflicting hypotheses have been proposed, but few formal tests have been conducted. Here, we use global spatial distribution data to test the bathymetric origin and colonization trends across the depth gradient in scleractinian corals. Using a phylogenetic approach, we infer the origin and historical trends in directionality and speed of colonization during the diversification in depth. We also examine how the emergence of photo-symbiosis and coloniality, scleractinian corals’ most conspicuous phenotypic innovations, have influenced this process. Our results strongly support an offshore-onshore pattern of evolution and varying dispersion capacities along depth associated with trait-defined lineages. These results highlight the relevance of the evolutionary processes occurring at different depths to explain the origin of extant marine biodiversity and the consequences of altering these processes by human impact, highlighting the need to include this overlooked evolutionary history in conservation plans.","This work was funded by the ANID doctoral fellowship 21170577 (ANC).

Students produce this genre in the university classroom for diverse academic and professional purposes. Despite its relevance, empirical rhetorical-discursive descriptions of the value of student writing are still scarce in Spanish. Thus, we describe the rhetorical-discursive organization of the laboratory report genre in this subdiscipline.
Methods: To fulfil this purpose, we followed a methodological design based on Swalesian Genre Analysis and used a corpus of ninety-eight texts. The sample was collected in a self-compiled form through consultation with teachers and students in the university classroom. The application of this method allowed us to determine the macro-moves, moves, and rhetorical steps of the genre, its communicative functions, and textual features.
Results: The resulting rhetorical model consisted of four macro-moves, twelve moves and seventeen steps. This model shows the highly dynamic and mesogeneric nature of this genre, the new functions of multimodal artefacts, and the genre's presence across the curriculum. To know about the teachers' and students' views on the process of training professional writers in engineering, the rhetorical model was complemented with an ethnographic phase (in the terms proposed by Swales: corroboration process with a couple of members of the community) before and after collecting the textual corpus.
Discussion: Finally, the implications for genre theory, Spanish language theory and pedagogy of the Spanish language and genre pedagogy are discussed.",,"The author(s) declare financial support was received for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.

This educational proposal seeks to separate the medial arts for transforming the dilemma of critical and medial literacy, and to establisha new relationship between the critical pedagogy and the social education.

However, heterogeneous social and environmental conditions shape this freshwater management challenge at subnational scales. We have noticed different interpretations of this challenge. To map the debate, understand the diverse interpretations, and frame political choices, we conducted semi-structured interviews with institutional and non-institutional stakeholders for performing discourse analysis in an Andean watershed where mountaintop gold mining, midstream farmers, and the downstream Cajamarca city coexist. One discourse dominates the debate on protecting the freshwater supply and argues the importance of river impoundment, municipal storage capacity, and institutional leadership. The other two discourses revolve around protecting the mountain aquifer. The second discourse does so with a fatalistic view of headwaters protection and rural support. The third discourse partially shifts the debate towards the need for improving rural capacity building and (ground)water inventories. To understand evolutions in society, it is crucial to understand these three discourses, including the types of knowledge that actors present as legitimate, the attributed roles to all stakeholders, and the kinds of worldviews informing each discourse.

So3.2b, an Antarctic strain with bioactivity against Rhizoctonia solani","Introduction: Phytopathogenic fungi are a considerable concern for agriculture, as they can threaten the productivity of several crops worldwide. Meanwhile, natural microbial products are acknowledged to play an important role in modern agriculture as they comprehend a safer alternative to synthetic pesticides. Bacterial strains from underexplored environments are a promising source of bioactive metabolites.
Methods: We applied the OSMAC (One Strain, Many Compounds) cultivation approach, in vitro bioassays, and metabolo-genomics analyses to investigate the biochemical potential of Pseudomonas sp. So3.2b, a strain isolated from Antarctica. Crude extracts from OSMAC were analyzed through HPLC-QTOF-MS/MS, molecular networking, and annotation. The antifungal potential of the extracts was confirmed against Rhizoctonia solani strains. Moreover, the whole-genome sequence was studied for biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) identification and phylogenetic comparison.
Results and Discussion: Molecular networking revealed that metabolite synthesis has growth media specificity, and it was reflected in bioassays results against R. solani. Bananamides, rhamnolipids, and butenolides-like molecules were annotated from the metabolome, and chemical novelty was also suggested by several unidentified compounds. Additionally, genome mining confirmed a wide variety of BGCs present in this strain, with low to no similarity with known molecules.

Currently, cells are produced on demand and have a limited shelf-life as conventional cryopreservation is primarily designed for stock keeping. We present a study on bulk cryopreservation of the human iPSC lines UKKi011-A and BIONi010-C-41. By increasing cell concentration and volume, compared to conventional cryopreservation routines in cryo vials, one billion cells were frozen in 50 mL cryo bags. Upon thawing, the cells were immediately seeded in scalable suspension-based bioreactors for expansion to assess the stemness maintenance and for neural differentiation to assess their differentiation potential on the gene and protein levels. Both the conventional and bulk cryo approach show comparative results regarding viability and aggregation upon thawing and bioreactor inoculation. Reduced performance compared to the non-frozen control was compensated within 3 days regarding biomass yield. Stemness was maintained upon thawing in expansion. In neural differentiation, a delay of the neural marker expression on day 4 was compensated at day 9. We conclude that cryopreservation in cryo bags, using high cell concentrations and volumes, does not alter the cells' fate and is a suitable technology to avoid pre-cultivation and enable time- and cost-efficient therapeutic approaches with bulk cell numbers.",,This research was funded by the Innovative Medicines Initiative 2 Joint Undertaking (JU) under the ‘EBiSC2’ grant agreement (No. 821362).

939,pub.1157163298,10.16993/tellusa.214,,,A Stochastic Covariance Shrinkage Approach in Ensemble Transform Kalman Filtering,"The Ensemble Kalman Filters (EnKF) employ a Monte-Carlo approach to represent covariance information, and are affected by sampling errors in operational settings where the number of model realizations is much smaller than the model state dimension. To alleviate the effects of these errors EnKF relies on model-specific heuristics such as covariance localization, which takes advantage of the spatial locality of correlations among the model variables. This work proposes an approach to alleviate sampling errors that utilizes a locally averaged-in-time dynamics of the model, described in terms of a climatological covariance of the dynamical system. We use this covariance as the target matrix in covariance shrinkage methods, and develop a stochastic covariance shrinkage approach where synthetic ensemble members are drawn to enrich both the ensemble subspace and the ensemble transformation. We additionally provide for a way in which this methodology can be localized similar to the state-of-the-art LETKF method, and that for a certain model setup, our methodology significantly outperforms it.",,,Tellus A Dynamic Meteorology and Oceanography,,,,2023,2023,,2023,75,1,159-171,All OA; Gold,Article,"Popov, Andrey A.; Sandu, Adrian; Nino-Ruiz, Elias D.; Evensen, Geir","Popov, Andrey A.

Our aim was to characterize the temporal response of hyperarid soil AD microbial communities to ex situ simulated rainfall (5% g water/g dry soil for 4 weeks) without nutrient amendment. We conducted replicated microcosm experiments with surface soils from two previously well-characterized AD hyperarid locations near Yungay at 1242 and 1609 masl (YUN1242 and YUN1609) with distinct microbial community compositions and average soil relative humidity levels of 21 and 17%, respectively. The bacterial and archaeal response to soil wetting was evaluated by 16S rRNA gene qPCR, and amplicon sequencing. Initial YUN1242 bacterial and archaeal 16S rRNA gene copy numbers were significantly higher than for YUN1609. Over the next 4 weeks, qPCR results showed significant increases in viable bacterial abundance, whereas archaeal abundance decreased. Both communities were dominated by 10 prokaryotic phyla (Actinobacteriota, Proteobacteria, Chloroflexota, Gemmatimonadota, Firmicutes, Bacteroidota, Planctomycetota, Nitrospirota, Cyanobacteriota, and Crenarchaeota) but there were significant site differences in the relative abundances of Gemmatimonadota and Chloroflexota, and specific actinobacterial orders. The response to simulated rainfall was distinct for the two communities. The actinobacterial taxa in the YUN1242 community showed rapid changes while the same taxa in the YUN1609 community remained relatively stable until day 30. Analysis of inferred function of the YUN1242 microbiome response implied an increase in the relative abundance of known spore-forming taxa with the capacity for mixotrophy at the expense of more oligotrophic taxa, whereas the YUN1609 community retained a stable profile of oligotrophic, facultative chemolithoautotrophic and mixotrophic taxa. These results indicate that bacterial communities in extreme hyperarid soils have the capacity for growth in response to simulated rainfall; however, historic variations in long-term hyperaridity exposure produce communities with distinct putative metabolic capacities.","We thank Daniel Laubitz of the Microbiome Core at the Steele Children’s Research Center, University of Arizona for adaptations of the amplicon sequencing library preparation protocol to maximize the sequencing potential of the low DNA samples from the Atacama Desert.","This research was partially supported by funding from BHP Minerals Americas Project 32002137 (2016-2020), and by the ANID Fondecyt Project N° 1231507.

These values allow for a clear understanding of the smelted product's expected quality, catering for any required chemical upgrading of the raw material or modification in the furnace's set-point if the calcine has undesired characteristics. Offline tests for calcines' chemical composition can take several days, potentially delaying the whole operation. A data-driven approach to chemical composition classification using on-line data is proposed by combining clustering classification through a mixed Principal Component Analysis (PCA) model, data processing and standardization process, with a Machine Learning classification algorithm, i.e. Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost). This allows for an online prediction of calcines' chemical composition based on the furnace's current operating conditions. The proposed method's accuracy scored mean values between 82.1% and 85.9%, which is encouraging in comparison with other proposed methods.","Declaration of Competing Interest The authors declare the following financial interests/personal relationships which may be considered as potential competing interests: Jorge Sofrony reports financial support was provided by Cerro Matoso S.A.

Intense animal crowding in aquaculture promotes animal morbidity especially in the absence of straightforward methods for monitoring their health. Here, we used bacterial 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing to measure bacterial population dynamics during P. salmonis infection. We observed a complex bacterial community consisting of a previously undescribed core pathobiome. Notably, we detected Aliivibrio wodanis and Tenacibaculum dicentrarchi on the skin ulcers of salmon infected with P. salmonis, while Vibrio spp. were enriched on infected gills.

These data provide evidence to study the characteristics of online communication. Recently, researchers have been interested in the study of the structural characteristics of online communication networks for a better understating of the communication processes underlying the flow of messages from one individual to another on the Internet. This article shows an application of Social Network Analysis (SNA) with data mining techniques to study the structural characteristics of online communication networks. The data corresponds to a corpus of 46,301 tweets published between 2009 and 2015 about the financial crisis of the National University of Colombia, identified with the hashtag #crisisunal. The communication networks were built from the mentions between users with the @ symbol, for a total of 3,124 users connected by 4,143 edges, which structural properties were analyzed using R. The indicators analyzed were the size of the network, diameter, degree centrality, reciprocity and betweenness centrality. The results suggest that communication networks on Twitter present a non-continuous growth, a preferential attachment to the most connected users, vulnerable connections, little reciprocity in the exchange of messages and limited control of information.",,,EMPIRIA: Revista de Metodología de Ciencias Sociales,,,,2023-01-09,2023,2023-01-09,,,57,165-188,All OA; Gold,Article,"Campis, Eliana Sanandres","Campis, Eliana Sanandres ()",,"Campis, Eliana Sanandres ()",2,2,,,https://revistas.uned.es/index.php/empiria/article/download/36434/27233,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1154422515,"47 Language, Communication and Culture; 4701 Communication and Media Studies",

Some strategies of the indigenous communities are exposed to situate their territorial discourse, as a place of enunciation that has been developed in the constant exercise of their urban-rural spatial self-determination. To do this, the cultural, political and symbolic practices of the people from the ""Pastos"" are analyzed, documented in secondary historical and anthropological sources, to reveal them as elements of their ""decolonial praxis"" that constantly redefine the local urban-territorial phenomenon.

The objective of this study was to analyze the scientific production on forestry topics that originated in Mexico and were published in Mexican journals from 1996 to 2019 and to identify the causes that determine the impact factor of such publications and the space-time evolution of forestry research in Mexico. In addition, to analyze whether researchers tend to publish in journals published by their affiliation institutions. The study considered 2384 scientific articles from seven journals belonging to category VI of Biotechnology and Agricultural Sciences listed in the Journals Classification System by the National Council of Science and Technology that publishes forestry topics. Bibliometric indicators were generated through text mining and analysis of co-authorship networks. It was found that forestry research in Mexico from 1996 to 2019 presented exponential growth in the number of publications. Forestry scientific production was concentrated in the center of the country. It was dominated by researchers from three of 122 institutions: Instituto Nacional de Investigaciones Forestales, Agrícolas y Pecuarias (13.88%), Colegio de Postgraduados (12.50%), and Universidad Autonoma Chapingo (10.44%). The journals with the highest number of publications were: Revista Mexicana de Ciencias Forestales (26.51%), Revista Chapingo Serie Ciencias Forestales y del Ambiente (20.34%), and Madera y Bosques (18.88%). Results show that forestry researchers in Mexico published mostly in journals edited by their affiliation institutions, which restricts constructive criticism of peer review and increases academic endogamy. Also showed the need to generate more forestry research for the southeast of the country on topics such as climate change, carbon capture, forest biometry, and remote perception, which are relevant aspects when we consider that no published research evaluated the development of the forestry sector in Mexico.","This study is part of Project number 364.

791,pub.1157874499,10.3390/soc13050119,,,Everyday Virtuality: A Multimodal Analysis of Political Participation and Newsworthiness,"Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, digital interactions ceased to be “just another form of communication”; indeed, they became the only means of social interaction, mediated and driven by information and communication technologies (ICTs). Consequently, working in a digital context switched from being a phenomenon to be studied to the primary means of socializing and the primary workspace for researchers. This study explores four different methodologies to question how discursive interactions related to power and newsworthiness may be addressed in digital contexts. The multimodal approach was reviewed through the affordances of critical discourse analysis, issue ownership and salience, morphological discourse analysis, and protest event analysis. It starts by theoretically addressing concepts of multimodality and phenomenology by focusing on the implications of both perspectives. It examines publications and interactions in digital contexts in Ecuador from March 2017 to December 2020 within three political phenomena. The results of the analysis of these publications and interactions suggest that when analyzing political participation and newsworthiness, the virtual becomes a subjective space. Moreover, qualitative research is one of the primary ways to combine multimodality with other forms of discourse analysis. This paper concludes that perceptions, practices, and meanings assigned to social online representations can be better analyzed through multimodality, which tackles the intertwined characteristics of virtual discourses.",,This project received funding from the Research Department of Pontificia Universidad Católica del Ecuador under project number PEP QINV0353-IINV522010100.,Societies,,,,2023-05-06,2023,2023-05-06,,13,5,119,All OA; Gold,Article,"Yepez-Reyes, Veronica; Cevallos, Patricio; Carrillo-Andrade, Andrea; Cruz-Silva, Jorge; López-Paredes, Marco; González-Quincha, Alejandra","Yepez-Reyes, Veronica (OdeCom, Pontificia Universidad Católica del Ecuador, Quito 171105, Ecuador); Cevallos, Patricio (OdeCom, Pontificia Universidad Católica del Ecuador, Quito 171105, Ecuador); Carrillo-Andrade, Andrea (OdeCom, Pontificia Universidad Católica del Ecuador, Quito 171105, Ecuador); Cruz-Silva, Jorge (OdeCom, Pontificia Universidad Católica del Ecuador, Quito 171105, Ecuador); López-Paredes, Marco (OdeCom, Pontificia Universidad Católica del Ecuador, Quito 171105, Ecuador); González-Quincha, Alejandra (OdeCom, Pontificia Universidad Católica del Ecuador, Quito 171105, Ecuador)","Yepez-Reyes, Veronica (Pontificia Universidad Católica del Ecuador); López-Paredes, Marco (Pontificia Universidad Católica del Ecuador)","Yepez-Reyes, Veronica (Pontificia Universidad Católica del Ecuador); Cevallos, Patricio (Pontificia Universidad Católica del Ecuador); Carrillo-Andrade, Andrea (Pontificia Universidad Católica del Ecuador); Cruz-Silva, Jorge (Pontificia Universidad Católica del Ecuador); López-Paredes, Marco (Pontificia Universidad Católica del Ecuador); González-Quincha, Alejandra (Pontificia Universidad Católica del Ecuador)",2,2,,,https://www.mdpi.com/2075-4698/13/5/119/pdf?version=1683374968,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1157874499,"36 Creative Arts and Writing; 3605 Screen and Digital Media; 47 Language, Communication and Culture; 4701 Communication and Media Studies",

Non-electrolyzed HOCl water was developed through mixing at a specific ratio based on hypochlorite and mineral supplements, which revealed a high oxidizing power. In this study, we investigated the effects of non-electrolyzed HOCl water on Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection in C57BL/6 mice over 10 weeks. Mice were divided into three groups: normal control (NC) group supplied with purified water (PW) without infection, PW + H. pylori group supplied with PW after H. pylori infection, and HOCl + H. pylori group supplied with HOCl after H. pylori infection. Our findings demonstrated that the HOCl + H. pylori group greatly inhibited WBC and its differential counts, including total white blood cell (WBC), neutrophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, and eosinophils, when compared to the PW + H. pylori group. Accordingly, the amount of reactive oxygen species and calcium activity significantly decreased in the HOCl + H. pylori group compared to the PW + H. pylori group in both serum and stomach lysates. In contrast, HOCl water treatment enhanced GPx activity compared to PW treatment after H. pylori infection in both serum and stomach lysates. Accordingly, the levels of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, IL-1β, and TNF-α cytokine levels were significantly decreased in the HOCl + H. pylori group compared to those in the PW + H. pylori group in the stomach lysate; however, there was no significant difference in serum. In addition, the expression levels of Bax, MMP-3, MMP-9, and TLR-4 were found to decrease after HOCl water treatment, whereas the expression level of Bcl-2 was found to be enhanced after HOCl water treatment in the stomach lysate. Taken together, our results suggest that drinking non-electrolyzed HOCl water has positive anti-oxidative, anti-inflammatory, and anti-apoptotic effects in H. pylori-infected mice through redox and immune regulation.",,This study received no external funding.,Processes,,,,2023-05-12,2023,2023-05-12,,11,5,1474,All OA; Gold,Article,"Rahman, Habibur; Bajgai, Johny; Cho, Yoojin; Fadriquela, Ailyn; Sharma, Subham; Thuy, Trinh Thi; Cho, Syung Hyun; Jeong, Yun Ju; Goh, Seong Hoon; Kim, Yundeok; Kim, Cheol-Su; Lee, Kyu-Jae","Rahman, Habibur (Department of Convergence Medicine, Wonju College of Medicine, Yonsei University, Wonju 26426, Republic of Korea, subhamsharma047@gmail.com, (S.S.);); Bajgai, Johny (Department of Convergence Medicine, Wonju College of Medicine, Yonsei University, Wonju 26426, Republic of Korea, subhamsharma047@gmail.com, (S.S.);); Cho, Yoojin (Department of Chemical Biology, University of California, Berkeley, CA 94720, USA); Fadriquela, Ailyn (Department of Laboratory Medicine, Yonsei University Wonju College of Medicine, Yonsei University, Wonju 26426, Republic of Korea); Sharma, Subham (Department of Convergence Medicine, Wonju College of Medicine, Yonsei University, Wonju 26426, Republic of Korea, subhamsharma047@gmail.com, (S.S.);); Thuy, Trinh Thi (Department of Convergence Medicine, Wonju College of Medicine, Yonsei University, Wonju 26426, Republic of Korea, subhamsharma047@gmail.com, (S.S.);); Cho, Syung Hyun (Corporate Research Institute, NUGA MEDICAL Co., Ltd., 9, Bongeunsa-ro 68-gil, Gangnam-gu, Seoul 06153, Republic of Korea); Jeong, Yun Ju (Department of Convergence Medicine, Wonju College of Medicine, Yonsei University, Wonju 26426, Republic of Korea, subhamsharma047@gmail.com, (S.S.);); Goh, Seong Hoon (Department of Convergence Medicine, Wonju College of Medicine, Yonsei University, Wonju 26426, Republic of Korea, subhamsharma047@gmail.com, (S.S.);); Kim, Yundeok (Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Hematology-Oncology, Wonju Severance Christian Hospital, Wonju 26426, Republic of Korea); Kim, Cheol-Su (Department of Convergence Medicine, Wonju College of Medicine, Yonsei University, Wonju 26426, Republic of Korea, subhamsharma047@gmail.com, (S.S.);); Lee, Kyu-Jae (Department of Convergence Medicine, Wonju College of Medicine, Yonsei University, Wonju 26426, Republic of Korea, subhamsharma047@gmail.com, (S.S.);)","Kim, Yundeok (Wonju Severance Christian Hospital); Lee, Kyu-Jae (Yonsei University)","Rahman, Habibur (Yonsei University); Bajgai, Johny (Yonsei University); Cho, Yoojin (University of California, Berkeley); Fadriquela, Ailyn (Yonsei University); Sharma, Subham (Yonsei University); Thuy, Trinh Thi (Yonsei University); Cho, Syung Hyun (Nuga Medical (South Korea)); Jeong, Yun Ju (Yonsei University); Goh, Seong Hoon (Yonsei University); Kim, Yundeok (Wonju Severance Christian Hospital); Kim, Cheol-Su (Yonsei University); Lee, Kyu-Jae (Yonsei University)",2,2,,,https://www.mdpi.com/2227-9717/11/5/1474/pdf?version=1684132321,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1158011474,40 Engineering; 4004 Chemical Engineering,

Constructing Virtual Reality (VR) narratives can then be understood as a process of inscribing text in space, and consuming them as a process of “reading” the space. Our research objective is to explore the meaning-making process afforded by spatial narratives—to test whether VR facilitates traditional ways of weaving complex, multiple narrative strands and provides new opportunities for leveraging space. We argue that, as opposed to the linear space of a printed book, a VR narrative space is similar to the physical space of a museum and can be analyzed on three distinct levels: (1) the architecture of the space itself, (2) the collection, and (3) the individual artifacts. To provide a deeper context for designing VR narratives, we designed and implemented a testbed called RealityMedia to explore digital remediations of traditional narrative devices and the spatial, immersive, and interactive affordances of VR. We conducted task-based user study using a VR headset and follow-up qualitative interviews with 20 participants. Our results highlight how the three semantic levels (space, collection, and artifacts) can work together to constitute meaningful narrative experiences in VR.",,,Frontiers in Virtual Reality,,,,2023-06-22,2023,2023-06-22,,4,,1155700,All OA; Gold,Article,"Jang, So-Youn; Park, Jisu; Engberg, Maria; MacIntyre, Blair; Bolter, Jay D.","Jang, So-Youn (Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, United States); Park, Jisu (Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, United States); Engberg, Maria (Department of Computer Science and Media Technology, Malmö University, Malmö, Skåne, Sweden); MacIntyre, Blair (Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, United States); Bolter, Jay D.

Our objective was to characterize the theses for obtaining a medical degree in Peru.
Methods: An observational and descriptive study evaluating the theses for obtaining a medical degree of 2019, evaluated in January 2022 from 22 universities that are full members of the Peruvian Association of Faculties of Medicine. Characteristics of the universities and theses were evaluated, including the evaluation of a institutional research ethics committee, the aligment with a national research priority, and publication status in a scientific journal. The absolute and relative frequencies of the study variables were described.
Results: A total of 1838 theses were evaluated. Most of the theses were written by a single student (66.16%). The most common study design was the descriptive cross-sectional type (42.33%). We found that 53.86% of the theses responded to a national research priority, the most common being ""maternal, perinatal and neonatal health"" (26.01%). Of the total, 56.75% did not indicate whether they had the approval of an institutional research ethics committee. Only 40 theses (2.19%) were published in a scientific journal (14 in indexed journals).
Conclusion: Two-thirds of the theses conducted by medical students in Peru are descriptive studies. Half respond to national research priorities. Four out of ten theses were approved by an institutional research ethics committee. The number of published theses is low. The results show shortcomings in university institutional policies that encourage ethical compliance and research development.",,,Medwave,,,"Infant, Newborn; Humans; Cross-Sectional Studies; Peru",2023-04-17,2023,2023-04-17,,23,03,e2630-e2630,All OA; Gold,Article,"Angulo-Fernandez, Kevyn Javier; Herrera-Añazco, Percy; Soto-Ordoñez, Suly; Bendezu-Quispe, Guido","Angulo-Fernandez, Kevyn Javier (Universidad Peruana de Ciencias Aplicadas, Lima, Perú.); Herrera-Añazco, Percy (Universidad Privada del Norte, Trujillo, Perú.); Soto-Ordoñez, Suly (Instituto de Evaluación de Tecnologías en salud e Investigación, Lima, Perú.); Bendezu-Quispe, Guido (Centro de Investigación Epidemiológica en Salud Global, Universidad Privada Norbert Wiener, Lima, Perú.)",,"Angulo-Fernandez, Kevyn Javier (Peruvian University of Applied Sciences); Herrera-Añazco, Percy (Private University of the North); Soto-Ordoñez, Suly (Instituto de Evaluación de Tecnologías en salud e Investigación, Lima, Perú.); Bendezu-Quispe, Guido (Universidad Norbert Wiener)",2,2,,,https://www.medwave.cl/medios/investigacion/estudios/2630/medwave_2022_2630.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1157327754,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3215 Reproductive Medicine; 42 Health Sciences,3 Good Health and Well Being

Based on the educational model of concept maps (CMs), proposed by Novak and Cañas (2008), and adapted to medicine by Daley and Torre (2010), we are currently analyzing the results of a scoping review following the PRISMA extension methodology, specifically for these purposes. Other visual tools, such as knowledge maps (KMs) and mind maps (MMs), used in medical education, were also included. The search was made through the databases EBSCO, PubMed/MEDLINE, PsycINFO, Scopus, and Eric, using the following items: “concept map*”, “knowledge map*”, “mind map*” and “medical education”. Only articles in English were considered and exclusively in medical education, from undergraduate to resident training. The analysis of selected articles included the following features: construction rules (if they followed Novakian instructions), teaching area, student level (undergraduate, postgraduate/residents), and use for assessment. Other features were the capacity to relate basic science knowledge to clinical concepts, the use of maps with other educational methods, such as problem-based learning (PBL), and providing feedback to students. From a quantitative perspective, the use of CMs is dominant in all phases of medical education. A failure to follow Novakian rules was found in around half of the articles labeled as CMs and KMs. As for MMs, which follow different rules for construction and use, they were considered relevant in helping students to summarize and retain information. Simultaneous use with other educational methods was only found with CMs. https://doi.org/10.34105/j.kmel.2023.15.023",,,Knowledge Management & E-Learning An International Journal,,,,2023-09-18,2023,2023-09-18,2023-09-18,15,3,392-419,All OA; Gold,Article,"Oliveira, Beatriz; Fonseca, Marta; Rendas, António; Carreiro-Martins, Pedro; Neuparth, Nuno; |, |","Oliveira, Beatriz (NOVA Medical School, Lisbon); Fonseca, Marta (NOVA Medical School, Lisbon); Rendas, António (NOVA Medical School, Lisbon); Carreiro-Martins, Pedro (NOVA Medical School, Lisbon); Neuparth, Nuno (NOVA Medical School, Lisbon); |, | ()",,"Oliveira, Beatriz (Universidade Nova de Lisboa); Fonseca, Marta (Universidade Nova de Lisboa); Rendas, António (Universidade Nova de Lisboa); Carreiro-Martins, Pedro (Universidade Nova de Lisboa); Neuparth, Nuno (Universidade Nova de Lisboa); |, | ()",2,2,,,http://www.kmel-journal.org/ojs/index.php/online-publication/article/download/554/550,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1162853454,39 Education; 3903 Education Systems; 46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4609 Information Systems,4 Quality Education

This study investigates the impact of sustainable aggregates on abrasion resistance in pervious concrete, specifically electric furnace slag (EFS), ceramic construction waste (CW), and concrete block waste (CBW). Therefore, an experimental program was conceived to assess the abrasion resistance through Cantabro test and to evaluate the density, porosity, permeability, and mechanical performance (compressive and flexural tensile strengths) of pervious concrete. Experimental results indicate that CW and CBW aggregates yield similar abrasion resistance (38% and 36% mass loss) to reference aggregates (38%), while EFS aggregates show significantly higher mass loss (73%). The proportion of fines within the particle size distribution of the sustainable aggregate emerges as a critical factor that influences abrasion resistance. This finding underscores the significance of particle size distribution in enhancing abrasion durability. Furthermore, pervious concrete with sustainable aggregates may display favorable abrasion resistance without compromising hydraulic performance. The study contributes to understanding abrasion resistance in pervious concrete and offers insights into sustainable construction materials.",Declaration of competing interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.,,Results in Engineering,,,,2023-12,2023,,2023-12,20,,101384,All OA; Gold,Article,"Sandoval, Gersson F.B.; Pieralisi, Ricardo","Sandoval, Gersson F.B.

For this purpose, the spectra from 0.5 THz to 10 THz of 5 chocolate samples (50%, 60%, 70%, 80% and 90% of cocoa) were examined. The acquired data matrices were analyzed by using a Fourier Transform, obtaining the dielectric function and the absorbance curve. Based on the latter, samples were classified by using 24 models of mathematical classification, achieving differences of around 93% through the model of Gaussian SVM algorithm with a kernel scale of 0.35 and a one-against-one multiclass method. This was reduced by using a Main Component Analysis, obtaining most of the spectral variations with PC1 (63.8%) and PC2 (36.2%).

In pharmacy programs, lack of academic integrity reaches up to 90%, with socioeconomic, personal, and academic reasons being among the main factors. The objective of this study was to evaluate the factors that influence academic integrity of Chemistry and Pharmacy students at the Universidad Católica del Norte. Methods Descriptive cross - sectional study, which included Pharmacy students, to whom a survey of 31 statements with responses on a Likert-type scale was applied, which allowed us to collect the factors that influence academic integrity. Results Out of a total of 113 students, 60.2% were female, average age of 23.1 ± 3.2 years, and 16 (14.1%) corresponded to the 2020-2021 cohorts. The main motivations to commit dishonest acts perceived by the students were “socioeconomic, socio-cultural and family” reasons as well as “personal characteristics”, such as the fear of losing scholarships, failing a course and fear of career failure. The comparison between 2020-2021 cohorts and the rest of the generations showed significant differences in the ""socioeconomic, sociocultural and family"" grouped perceptions category (p = 0.002). Conclusion Recognizing the causes of academic dishonesty allows us to implement preventive strategies that focus towards the development of an academic integrity based culture and attitudinal skills of self-efficacy in the student body, which contribute to an ethical professional training and performance.",,,Educación Médica,,,,2023-11,2023,,2023-11,24,6,100825,All OA; Gold,Article,"Araya, Patricio; Orellana, Sebastián; Alucema, Alejandrina; Guevara, Zulma; Fernández, Evelyn","Araya, Patricio (Departamento de Ciencias Farmacéuticas, Facultad de Ciencias, Universidad Católica del Norte, Antofagasta, Chile); Orellana, Sebastián (Departamento de Ciencias Farmacéuticas, Facultad de Ciencias, Universidad Católica del Norte, Antofagasta, Chile); Alucema, Alejandrina (Departamento de Ciencias Farmacéuticas, Facultad de Ciencias, Universidad Católica del Norte, Antofagasta, Chile); Guevara, Zulma (Centro de Innovación Metodológica y Tecnológica (CIMET), Vicerrectoría Académica, Universidad Católica del Norte, Antofagasta, Chile); Fernández, Evelyn (Centro de Innovación Metodológica y Tecnológica (CIMET), Vicerrectoría Académica, Universidad Católica del Norte, Antofagasta, Chile)","Araya, Patricio (Catholic University of the North)","Araya, Patricio (Catholic University of the North); Orellana, Sebastián (Catholic University of the North); Alucema, Alejandrina (Catholic University of the North); Guevara, Zulma (Catholic University of the North); Fernández, Evelyn (Catholic University of the North)",2,2,,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.edumed.2023.100825,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1160497091,42 Health Sciences; 4203 Health Services and Systems,

It contains high concentrations of hazardous heavy metals, such as lead, zinc, aluminum, and iron. Methodology: In this study, bioleaching integrated with an electrokinetic approach for heavy metal remediation from MSW incineration fly ash using Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans and Acidithiobacillus thiooxidans bacteria was tested. Results and discussion: The physicochemical properties of fly ash included a particle size of 26.1 μm, with the presence of heavy metals. A. ferrooxidans and A. thiooxidans produced sulphuric acid (0.0289 M and 0.0352 M) during the proliferation; this acid enhances the bioleaching of heavy metals from fly ash. The results of an integrated approach showed an 85%, 47%, 92%, 85%, 46%, 67% 11%, and 55% removal of the heavy metals K, Na, Ca, Mg, Al, Zn, Pb, and Mg, respectively, in the presence of A. ferrooxidans. Overall, these results evidenced that heavy metals were completely removed from the fly ash using an integrated approach. Therefore, this integrated approach can be used as an effective heavy metal removal method for treating fly ash in MSW.","The authors acknowledge Researchers Supporting Project (RSP 2023R465), King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, for funding this research.

In this sense, the objective of this research is to analyze the actions of corporate social responsibility implemented in the banking sector in Latin America and the Caribbean, taking Bancolombia, Banco de Crédito e Inversiones, and Banco General as a reference. The methodology used was qualitative, cross-sectional, and non-experimental. This was carried out based on a documentary analysis of the annual reports of the aforementioned companies, ranked in the top CSR positions, according to the Merco Ranking. As a result, it was determined that the companies most predominantly carry out social responsibility actions based on the internal dimension, with 26% regarding the adoption of equitable salaries and 28% regarding the quality of the job. On the other hand, the external dimension shows that 25% of corporate actions emphasize the potential for responsible investment. Finally, it was found that the CSR actions and resources allocated by the aforementioned banks in 2021 were used for business sustainability, seen from the promotion of employee stability and satisfaction in the company, as well as responsible investment, evaluating the social, economic, and environmental impact. In this sense, CSR activities that have an impact on an external context stand out with greater importance despite the percentage differences between dimensions, since their impact is identified from the investment in employee training and development programs; the contributions to local and regional economic development based on job creation, as well as the reduction of polluting gas emissions, conversation and environmental education.",,,Humanities and Social Sciences Communications,,,,2023-08-14,2023,2023-08-14,,10,1,503,All OA; Gold,Article,"Mesta-Cabrejos, Valeria Fernanda; Huertas-Vilca, Karla Stefanny; Wong-Aitken, Higinio Guillerno; Cordova-Buiza, Franklin","Mesta-Cabrejos, Valeria Fernanda (Universidad Privada del Norte, Trujillo, Peru); Huertas-Vilca, Karla Stefanny (Universidad Privada del Norte, Trujillo, Peru); Wong-Aitken, Higinio Guillerno (Universidad Privada del Norte, Lima, Peru); Cordova-Buiza, Franklin (Research, Innovation and Social Responsibility Department, Universidad Privada del Norte, Lima, Peru; Faculty of Business Sciences, Universidad Continental, Huancayo, Peru)","Cordova-Buiza, Franklin (Private University of the North; Universidad Continental)","Mesta-Cabrejos, Valeria Fernanda (Private University of the North); Huertas-Vilca, Karla Stefanny (Private University of the North); Wong-Aitken, Higinio Guillerno (Private University of the North); Cordova-Buiza, Franklin (Private University of the North; Universidad Continental)",2,2,,,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41599-023-01950-1.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1163266335,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3507 Strategy, Management and Organisational Behaviour; 50 Philosophy and Religious Studies; 5001 Applied Ethics",8 Decent Work and Economic Growth

The raw materials underwent chemical, mineralogical, physical, dilatometric, thermal and microstructural characterization. Specimens were produced using a ceramic mass (0%) and incorporated up to 30% of glass waste in powder form, in granulometry 40, 100, 200 and 325 mesh. Specimens produced by uniaxial pressing (35 MPa) and fired at different temperatures (800–1050 °C). After firing, the properties of linear shrinkage, water absorption and flexural strength were evaluated. The microstructure was evaluated by optical microscopy. Analyzing the results, it is possible to observe that the raw materials have similar chemical composition and their application in ceramic materials is a highly viable option, and can also act as a flux, improving properties, in addition to reducing the firing temperature. The incorporation of waste reduced the water absorption and significantly increased the resistance of the pieces, mainly in the granulometry of 200 mesh and 325 mesh. In addition to improving the quality of red ceramics, incorporating glass from powder packaging is a highly advantageous alternative for recycling, as glass can take thousands of years to decompose in the environment.","Declaration of Competing Interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

In this study, we investigated the diversity, composition and functional prediction of microbiota of reared Seriolella violacea (palm ruff) in the same cohort sampled at different times (7-, 8- and 9-month-old). Microbial community structure analyses, using 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing, revealed that the intestinal microbiota was dominated by the phyla Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, Fusobacteria and Tenericutes. At the genus level, Candidatus Arthromitus was the most abundant in all sampled timepoints, representing in average 78% of the bacterial community (ranging from 18 to 98%), corresponding to segmented filamentous bacteria, which are interesting because they have been associated with the maturation of immune responses in the gut and protecting the host from bacterial infections. The comparisons of the intestinal microbiota among the three groups showed differences in abundance of bacterial taxa and also in alpha diversity indexes (Shannon and Simpson), as well as beta diversity metrics (weighted and unweighted UniFrac).

For this aim, it is taken into account that the fluid in the core and the envelope follow the relativistic polytropic equation of state. We find that the phase transition and a stiffer fluid in the core will reflect in the total mass, radius, speed of sound, core radius, radial stability with a slow and rapid conversion at the interface, and tidal deformability. We also investigate the dimensionless tidal deformability Λ1$$\varLambda _1$$ and Λ2$$\varLambda _2$$ for a binary neutron stars system with chirp mass equal to GW170817. Finally, we contrast our results with observational data to show the role that phase transition and a stiffer core fluid could play in the study of neutron stars.","JDVA would like to thank the Universidad Privada del Norte and Universidad Nacional Mayor de San Marcos for funding—RR N∘005753-2021-R/UNMSM under project number B21131781.

This study is one of the first in which the analysis of the topic goes beyond the high-tech sectors. It is based on a survey of representatives of Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) dedicated to the production of Leather and Footwear in Peru. The main findings were that the Absorption Capability dimension had a positive relationship coefficient with the understanding of the benefits of and barriers to technology transfers, while the Networking Diversity dimension presented a negative relationship coefficient. Likewise, this study shows that the main barriers to technology transfer were the fear of information leaks and the lack of training.

The goal of ROOT problems is to find the optimal solution for several environments at the same time. Although significant contributions to ROOT have been published in the past, it is not clear to what extent progress has been made in terms of the type of problem addressed. In particular, we believe that there is confusion regarding what it actually means to solve a ROOT problem. To overcome these limitations, the objective of this paper is twofold. On the one hand, to provide a characterization framework of ROOT problems in terms of their most relevant features, and on the other hand, to organize existing contributions according to it. As a result, from an initial set of 186 studies, the characterization framework was applied to 35 of them, allowing to identification of some important gaps and proposing new research opportunities. We have also experimentally addressed the effect of available information on ROOT problems, concluding that there is indeed a significant impact on the performance of the algorithm and that the proposed classification is appropriate to characterize the complexity of ROOT problems. To help identify further research opportunities, we have implemented an interactive dashboard with the results of the review conducted, which is available online.",,"The authors acknowledge support from project PID2020-112754GB-I00, MCIN/AEI 347 /10.13039/501100011033, Ministry of Science and Innovation, Spain.",Electronics,,,,2023-11-11,2023,2023-11-11,,12,22,4609,All OA; Gold,Article,"Novoa-Hernández, Pavel; Puris, Amilkar; Pelta, David A.","Novoa-Hernández, Pavel (Departamento de Ciencias de la Computación e Inteligencia Artificial, Universidad de Granada, 18071 Granada, Spain;, dpelta@ugr.es; Escuela de Ciencias Empresariales, Universidad Católica del Norte, Coquimbo 1780000, Chile); Puris, Amilkar (Facultad de Ciencias de la Ingeniería, Universidad Técnica Estatal de Quevedo, Quevedo 120550, Ecuador); Pelta, David A.

The influence of the constituent mixing ratio and the temperature of curing on the heat conductivity and compressive strength of the geopolymer was investigated. Specimens were formed according to a 10-level mix design with three replicates and subjected to curing at 40 °C and 80 °C. Heat conductivity and compressive strength were determined in accordance with established standards. The simplex lattice method was used to obtain the response surfaces, contour plots, and tracking curves. The geopolymers under study displayed a reduction in heat conductivity and an increase in compressive strength when the curing temperature was raised. The optimal mixing ratio to achieve a balance between the compressive strength and thermal conductivity of the geopolymers investigated was 0.50 MK and 0.50 RHA. Diatomite’s thermal insulation contribution is neutralized when crystals from the geopolymer gel fill the pore volume. The mixture’s optimal results were achieved when cured at 80 °C, demonstrating a thermal conductivity of 0.10 W/m·K and a compressive strength of 5.37 MPa.",We are grateful to the Universidad Privada del Norte and the Universidad Nacional de Trujillo for their logistical and technical cooperation with this project.,This research received no external funding.,Buildings,,,,2023-12-31,2023,2023-12-31,,14,1,112,All OA; Gold,Article,"Alvarado, Cinthya; Martínez-Cerna, Daniel; Alvarado-Quintana, Hernán","Alvarado, Cinthya (Carrera de Ingeniería Civil, Facultad de Ingeniería, Universidad Privada del Norte, Trujillo 13011, Peru); Martínez-Cerna, Daniel (Laboratorio de Materiales Cerámicos, Universidad Nacional de Trujillo, Trujillo 13011, Peru;, dmartinezc@unitru.edu.pe); Alvarado-Quintana, Hernán (Departamento de Ingeniería de Materiales, Universidad Nacional de Trujillo, Trujillo 13011, Peru;, halvarado@unitru.edu.pe)","Alvarado, Cinthya (Private University of the North)","Alvarado, Cinthya (Private University of the North); Martínez-Cerna, Daniel (National University of Trujillo); Alvarado-Quintana, Hernán (National University of Trujillo)",2,2,,,https://www.mdpi.com/2075-5309/14/1/112/pdf?version=1704015588,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1167560383,33 Built Environment and Design; 3302 Building; 40 Engineering; 4005 Civil Engineering,

An Empirical Study in the Financial Sector,"Digital transformation has become a notorious topic in the financial sector, as its implementation brings about a positive change in the user experience. Its relevance is seen in how scientists study it from different points of view, while it attracts the interest of financial institutions, as the understanding resulting from the research can improve the implementation of plans in the new digital era. Therefore, the objective of this study is to determine the impact of digital transformation on consumer behaviour in the financial sector. A quantitative explanatory level approach was used. The study population was finite, consisting of bank customers, considering a simple random probability sample of 385. The technique used was the survey and a questionnaire as a validated and reliable instrument. Digital transformation has been shown to have a significant impact on consumer behaviour in the financial sector, tested by Chi-square and ordinal logistic regression (χ2 = 0.000 < 0.05; Wald coefficient = 29.162 = 0.000; Nagelkerke’s R2 = 0.381), confirming that consumer behaviour is driven by digitisation activities.

These seabed minerals are a good alternative source of Co and Mn due to the decrease in the grade of mineral deposits on the earth’s surface. For the treatment of manganese nodules, acid-reducing leaching is apparently the most attractive, due to its low cost compared to other processes, short operational times, and it is more friendly to the environment. In this investigation, the extraction of Mn and Co from manganese nodules from two different locations was studied in acid media and by reusing a steel slag obtained from a steel smelting process. An ANOVA analysis was performed to determine the most appropriate Manganese Nodule/Fe(res) ratio and time to dissolve Co and Mn from the nodules. Effect of temperature on the process was evaluated, and then a residue analysis was carried out. Finally, it was discovered that the best results were obtained when working at 60 °C in a time of 15 min, obtaining extractions of approximately 98% Mn and 55% Co. Additionally, the formation of polluting elements was not observed, nor the precipitation of Mn and Co species in the studied residues.","Pedro Robles thanks project Fondecyt 1221702 for supporting this investigation and the Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Valparaiso for the support provided.

This problem has increased due to ignorance, misinformation, indifference, and lack of solidarity on the part of the population who favors this discouraging situation. Taking advantage of the current technological immersion, in which we live, the development of a mobile application was proposed as a pedagogical resource to raise awareness among educational institutions about the glacial retreat of the Peruvian Andean snow-capped mountains, showing the current situation of some of the snow-capped mountains of the Andes that have suffered a greater impact, implementing augmented reality technology to obtain an interactive link. To provide greater detail of the situation, previous studies were carried out on glacial retreats in two Peruvian snow-capped mountains over the last 40 years, where it was found that, of the snow-capped mountains considered, Chicon had a decrease of 32.5% of its glacier cover, and Pumahuanca had a decrease of 56.9%. Such results are exposed within the application to provide realistic data on the glacial conditions of both Peruvian snow-capped mountains, as well as the consequences and conservation techniques to mitigate and cope with deglaciation.

213,pub.1155699364,10.3390/app13052812,,,Advanced Unified Earthquake Catalog for North East India,"Northeast India is one of the world’s most seismically active regions. The event data included in this research for the period 1737–2012 is mostly obtained from worldwide database agencies such as ISC, NEIC, and GCMT. Historical seismicity is collected from published and unpublished documents and some earthquake events are collected from the Indian Meteorological Department Bulletins. As the Mw scale is developed and validated in the southern California region and overestimates the smaller magnitude earthquakes, therefore, recent literature suggested an improved version of the seismic moment magnitude scale (Mwg) applicable for the entire globe considering both long- and short-period frequency-spectra using modern instrumental data. To update the earthquake catalog of Northeast India, we prepared empirical relationships between different magnitudes to Mwg using robust statistical General Orthogonal Regression. A procedure is also suggested for converting different earthquake sizes towards seismic moment scale. The Magnitude of Completeness (Mc) and the Gutenberg–Richter (GR) recurrence parameter values for the declustered homogenized catalog in four time periods, namely 1737–1963, 1964–1990, 1964–2000, and 1964–2012, have been computed. Our analysis suggests that the use of the Mwg scale improves seismicity parameters ‘b’ up to 30%, ‘a’ up to 17%, and ‘Mc’ up to 18% for the Northeast India region. A complete unified earthquake catalog in terms of advanced seismic moment magnitude scale could help understand seismicity and earthquake engineering studies of the region.","We thank the Reviewers for their constructive comments, which largely improve the quality of this contribution.",This research was supported by FONDECYT Grant 11200618.,Applied Sciences,,,,2023-02-22,2023,2023-02-22,,13,5,2812,All OA; Gold,Article,"Pallavi; Das, Ranjit; Joshi, Sandeep; Meneses, Claudio; Biswas, Tinku","Pallavi (School of Computing and IT, Manipal University Jaipur, Jaipur 303007, India); Das, Ranjit (Computer Science Department, Universidad Catolica del Norte, Antofagasta 1249004, Chile); Joshi, Sandeep (School of Computing and IT, Manipal University Jaipur, Jaipur 303007, India); Meneses, Claudio (Computer Science Department, Universidad Catolica del Norte, Antofagasta 1249004, Chile); Biswas, Tinku (Earthquake Engineering Department, Indian Institute of Technology Roorkee, Roorkee 247667, India)","Das, Ranjit (Catholic University of the North)","Pallavi (Manipal Academy of Higher Education); Das, Ranjit (Catholic University of the North); Joshi, Sandeep (Manipal Academy of Higher Education); Meneses, Claudio (Catholic University of the North); Biswas, Tinku (Indian Institute of Technology Roorkee)",2,2,,,https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3417/13/5/2812/pdf?version=1677114726,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1155699364,37 Earth Sciences; 3706 Geophysics; 3709 Physical Geography and Environmental Geoscience,
213,pub.1165019856,10.3390/math11204321,,,Normalization Method as a Potent Tool for Grasping Linear and Nonlinear Systems in Physics and Soil Mechanics,"To address physical problems that require solving differential equations, both linear and nonlinear analytical methods are preferred when possible, but numerical methods are utilized when necessary. In this study, the normalization technique is established, which is a simple mathematical approach that requires only basic manipulation of the governing equations to obtain valuable information about the solution. The methodology of this technique involves adopting appropriate references to obtain the dimensionless form of the governing equation, after which the terms of the equation are balanced, obtaining the dimensionless monomials governing the solution. Thorough knowledge of the physical processes involved is necessary to find the best references. The main advantages of this technique are the simplicity of the methodology, the acquisition of valuable information about the solution without the need for complex mathematical calculations, and its applicability to nonlinear problems. However, it is important to consider the difficulty in selecting appropriate references in more complex scenarios. This study applies this normalization methodology to different scenarios, showing how choosing appropriate references lead to the independent dimensionless monomials.

The main goal of this study is to carry out a mining approach of the prospective areas of Colombia with strategic minerals for energy transition and climate change, analyzing the geospatial location, mining rights, mineral extraction, and royalty collection. Open data from SGC, ANM, and SIMCO geoportals were consulted. The prospective areas totaled 311,535.2 km2, equivalent to 27.3% of Colombia, and were located mainly in the Andes Mountains. The total area of mining rights and applications with strategic minerals for the energy transition is 112,802.2 km2 or 9.9% of Colombia, representing 5731 rights and 3939 applications. From 2012 to 2023, 448,330 tons of nickel, 172.9 tons of silver, and 171.6 tons of copper were mined in Colombia, which has contributed USD 513,140,286 as royalties to the state.

This study aimed to assess the combining abilities of preselected popcorn lines for agronomic and root traits under well-watered and water-stressed conditions. A circulating diallel analysis was conducted to investigate the effects of the general and specific combining abilities of 10 lines and their respective hybrids for various traits, including productivity, popping expansion, expanded popcorn volume, 100-grain weight, ear length, ear width, support root angle, crown root angle, number of support roots, number of crown roots, density of support roots, and density of crown roots. Non-additive action genes predominantly influenced the agronomic traits under both water conditions. In contrast, the root traits displayed a greater proportion of additive action gene expression under both conditions, despite being significantly affected by the environment. Lines L61, L71, and L76 demonstrated positive and high effects for general combining ability. The hybrids L65/L76, L71/L76, and L61/L75, in addition to exhibiting satisfactory effects of their specific combining ability, also displayed the most favorable phenotypic responses for most agronomic and root traits, making them ideal candidates for inclusion in popcorn breeding programs aiming to develop drought-tolerant genotypes.","The authors gratefully acknowledge the financial support of the CAPES, FAPERJ, CNPq, and UENF institutions.",This study was financed in part by Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior—Brazil (CAPES)—Finance Code 001.,Stresses,,,,2023-08-10,2023,2023-08-10,,3,3,586-604,All OA;

Several studies have shown the benefits of their application to help improve various aspects of the mineral value chain. Nevertheless, quantitatively assessing new technologies using a holistic approach is vital to evaluate whether the potential localized benefits ultimately translate to an overall increase in project net present value (NPV). This study develops an integrated system-wide methodology for open-pit mines, supporting the technoeconomic assessment of implementing new technology that impacts strategic and operational timeframes. The first part of the framework relies on a state-of-the-art mine plan optimization algorithm that incorporates geological uncertainty. The resulting outputs are then fed into the discrete event simulation portion of the framework (second part) to maximize plant throughput using alternate modes of operation (blending strategy) and operational stockpiles to deal with unexpected changes in ore feed attributes.

The findings showed; Land uses have a directional pattern with random distribution and a cluster. The functional radius also indicates a lack of desirable access for residents to land uses. On the other hand, the lack of per capita confirms the results of the functional radius of the land uses. Because the district is facing a per capita shortage in all uses and functional scales. The results of subjective evaluations also showed that residents lack ease of access to land uses. Also, the optimal access to land uses from the residents’ perspectives has been contrary to the standards of urban development plans. What has been quite evident is that spatial injustice in the distribution of land uses and the presence of disparities in access to land uses have had a negative impact on the livability of the district. Our results underscore the importance of a comprehensive examination of livability based on the spatial justice of land uses.

However, most reviews have focused on definitions and methodological approaches given the growing interest in conceptualizing and measuring. This research aims to study and describe the evolution and origin of EP indicators in Ibero-American countries, given the similarity of their climatic, cultural, and socioeconomic characteristics. A review was made using the SALSA (Search, Appraisal, Synthesis, and Analysis) analytical framework, finding 61 articles, 150 assessments, and 49 indicators and cataloging them considering their evolution, initial (n = 7), expansion (n = 12), and multidimensional (n = 30) stages.

185,pub.1154393477,10.3390/math11020337,,,A Formulation for the Stochastic Multi-Mode Resource-Constrained Project Scheduling Problem Solved with a Multi-Start Iterated Local Search Metaheuristic,"This research introduces a stochastic version of the multi-mode resource-constrained project scheduling problem (MRCPSP) and its mathematical model. In addition, an efficient multi-start iterated local search (MS-ILS) algorithm, capable of solving the deterministic MRCPSP, is adapted to deal with the proposed stochastic version of the problem. For its deterministic version, the MRCPSP is an NP-hard optimization problem that has been widely studied. The problem deals with a trade-off between the amount of resources that each project activity requires and its duration. In the case of the proposed stochastic formulation, the execution times of the activities are uncertain. Benchmark instances of projects with 10, 20, 30, and 50 activities from well-known public libraries were adapted to create test instances. The adapted algorithm proved to be capable and efficient for solving the proposed stochastic problem.",,This research was funded by Universidad Panamericana (grant number UP-CI-2022-GDL-11-ING).,Mathematics,,,,2023-01-09,2023,2023-01-09,,11,2,337,All OA; Gold,Article,"Ramos, Alfredo S.; Miranda-Gonzalez, Pablo A.; Nucamendi-Guillén, Samuel; Olivares-Benitez, Elias","Ramos, Alfredo S.

The functions attributed to bivalves depend on the life habits of a species (epi- or infauna) and their abundance and biomass. To properly quantify and assess these functions, detailed information the distribution, abundance and biomass at the ecosystem scale is critical. Amongst others, this requires an understanding on how environmental conditions shape special patterns in distribution. In this study we investigate this fundamental information on the Swedish west coast, an area where this information is lacking. A survey which was designed to representatively sample both epi- and infaunal bivalves from randomized locations in various habitat types was conducted. Specifically, abundance and biomass of all species were recorded in the intertidal (0-0.5 m) and the shallow subtidal zone (0.5-2 m). The sites were distributed over an offshore gradient and at two exposure levels. This sampling structure allowed to extrapolate the results to an ecosystem level though information on the areal extent of these habitats using GIS layers. It was found that even though there exist a great variability among sites, in general epifaunal bivalves outweigh infaunal bivalves approximately 3 to 1. In terms of abundance, the ratio is more or less reversed and infaunal species occur in greater numbers. Most bivalves were found at an intermediate level of exposure, but due to the areal extend of the sheltered inner-archipelago this was the most important habitat for bivalve abundance and biomass. It was also found that invasive epifaunal oyster Magallana gigas and the invasive infaunal clam Ensis leei both dominated their respective groups in terms of biomass. Though the survey was relatively small, these results serve as a valuable insight of the relative importance of epi- and infaunal bivalves in this region. This gives understanding on which species and habitats are particularly important for ecosystem functions and services related to bivalves. This also provide a starting baseline for attempts to quantify ecosystem services provided by certain species or groups of bivalves in the future.",,,Frontiers in Marine Science,,,,2023-01-24,2023,2023-01-24,,10,,1105999,All OA; Gold,Article,"Greeve, Youk; Bergström, Per; Strand, Åsa; Lindegarth, Mats","Greeve, Youk (Tjärnö Marine Laboratory, Department of Marine Sciences, University of Gothenburg, Strömstad, Sweden); Bergström, Per (Tjärnö Marine Laboratory, Department of Marine Sciences, University of Gothenburg, Strömstad, Sweden); Strand, Åsa (IVL Swedish Environmental Research Institute, Kristineberg Center, Fiskebäckskil, Sweden); Lindegarth, Mats (Tjärnö Marine Laboratory, Department of Marine Sciences, University of Gothenburg, Strömstad, Sweden)","Greeve, Youk (University of Gothenburg)","Greeve, Youk (University of Gothenburg); Bergström, Per (University of Gothenburg); Strand, Åsa (IVL - Swedish Environmental Research Institute); Lindegarth, Mats (University of Gothenburg)",2,2,,,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmars.2023.1105999/pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1154790400,31 Biological Sciences; 3103 Ecology,

However, limited records of the pools and flows of molten sulfur have been reported: therefore, questions remain regarding the physicochemical processes behind this phenomenon. A suite of new sulfur flows, some of which active, was identified at the Lastarria volcano (northern Chile) and studied using satellite imagery, in situ probing, and temperature and video recording. This finding provides a unique opportunity to better understand the emplacement mechanisms and mineral and chemical compositions of molten sulfur, in addition to gaining insight into its origin. Molten sulfur presented temperatures of 124–158°C, with the most prolonged sulfur flow reaching 12 m from the source. Photogrammetric tools permitted the identification of levees and channel structures, with an estimated average flow speed of 0.069 m/s. Field measurements yielded a total volume of 1.45 ± 0.29 m3 of sulfur (equivalent to ∼2.07 tons) mobilized during the January 2019 event for at least 408 min. Solidified sulfur was composed of native sulfur with minor galena and arsenic- and iodine-bearing minerals. Trace element analysis indicated substantial enrichment of Bi, Sb, Sn, Cd, as well as a very high concentration of As (>40.000 ppm). The January 2019 molten sulfur manifestations in Lastarria appear to be more enriched in As compared to the worldwide known volcanoes with molten sulfur records, such as the Shiretoko-Iozan and Poás volcanoes. Furthermore, their rheological properties suggest that the “time of activity” in events such as this could be underestimated as flows in Lastarria have moved significantly slower than previously thought. The origin of molten sulfur is ascribed to the favorable S-rich chemistry of fumarolic gases and changes in host rock permeability (fracture opening). Molten sulfur in Lastarria correlates with a peak in activity characterized by high emissions of SO2 and other acid species, such as HF and HCl, in addition to ground deformation. Consequently, molten sulfur was framed within a period of volcanic unrest in Lastarria, triggered by changes in the magmatic-hydrothermal system. The appearance of molten sulfur is related to physicochemical perturbations inside the volcanic system and is perhaps a precursor of eruptive activity, as observed in the Poás and Turrialba volcanoes.","We thank the “Unidad de Equipamiento Científico” (MAINI), hosted at Universidad Católica del Norte, for their valuable support during scanning electron microscopy analysis.

174,pub.1160355776,10.3389/fmars.2023.1155932,,,On the interpretation of changes in the subtropical oxygen minimum zone volume off Chile during two La Niña events (2001 and 2007),"Oxygen minimum zones (OMZs) are extended oceanic regions for which dissolved oxygen concentration is extremely low. They are suspected to be expanding in response to global warming. However, currently, the mechanisms by which OMZ varies in response to climate variability are still uncertain. Here, the variability of the subtropical OMZ off central Chile of a regional coupled physical–biogeochemical regional model simulation was analyzed for the period 2000–2008, noting that its fluctuations were significant despite the relatively weak amplitude of the El Niño/Southern Oscillation (ENSO). In particular, the interannual variability in the OMZ volume (OMZVOL, defined as the volume with dissolved oxygen concentration (DO) ≤ 45μM) was approximately 38% larger than that of the seasonal cycle, with maximum and minimum anomalies of OMZVOL taking place during two cold La Niña (LN) years (2001 and 2007). The model analyses further reveal that these anomalies resulted from a combined effect of changes in (1) the oxygen-poor waters poleward transport by the Peru–Chile undercurrent (PCUC), (2) the intensity of quasi-zonal jets influencing the transport of water to and from the OMZ, and (3) the zonal DO transport related to mesoscale eddy activity. Specifically, the interannual variability of the PCUC modulated primarily the DO contents of the OMZ core [(DO) ≤ 20μM] and secondarily the OMZVOL, while cross-shore DO transport by the zonal jets and the eddy fluxes played a major role in ventilating and shaping the offshore extent of the OMZ. When the OMZVOL was maximum (minimum), the PCUC transport was slightly increased (reduced), which was associated with a reduction (increase) in the ventilation of the OMZ through negative (positive) anomalies of zonal advection and DO eddy fluxes. Our results demonstrate that significant natural interannual variability in the subtropical OMZ off Chile originates from the interplay between oceanic equatorial teleconnection (PCUC transport) and local non-linear dynamics (the zonal jets and mesoscale eddies).",,"This work was funded by the Chilean Agency for Research and Development (FONDECYT Postdoctoral Project No. 3220768.

The Magellan province in southern South America, constitutes an interesting area to evaluate the effect of glaciations over near-shore marine benthic organisms. Existing data have showed clear signatures of population genetic bottlenecks during glacial maxima followed by recent recolonizations and expansions during the interglacial. Here, we present new population-based analyses in species of the patellogastropod genus Nacella (N. deaurata, N. magellanica, and N. mytilina). The species N. magellanica and N. deaurata inhabit rocky ecosystems while N. mytilina lives closely associated with kelps. The analyzed species exhibit narrow bathymetric ranges and consequently should have been severely affected by recurrent glacial cycles. We performed phylogeographic and demographic analyses in Nacella species including different localities across their respective distributions in the Magellan province including the Falkland/Malvinas Islands (F/M). Genetic analyses showed that all Nacella species exhibited low levels of genetic diversity, the presence of single dominant broadly distributed haplotypes, lack of correlation between geographical and genetic distance, and recent demographic growths, which are evidence supporting rapid postglacial expansions. Such results may have been facilitated by larval and/or rafting-mediated dispersal following the Cape Horn Current System. The three species showed strong and significant differentiation between F/M and southern Pacific margin (SPM) populations including localities across the Strait of Magellan and Cape Horn. Haplotype genealogies and mismatch analyses recognized older and more complex demographic histories in the F/M than in South America. Different glaciological histories between SPM and F/M may be responsible of the marked phylogeographic structure in the analyzed species of Nacella. Alternatively, as previously proposed, the F/M represent a glacial refugium for Nacella species (sink area), as well as a secondary contact zone where endemic haplotypes are found together with recently arrived South American ones. Historical and contemporary processes, contrasting glacial histories between the analyzed areas, as well as life history traits of the analyzed organisms are main factors explaining current phylogeographic patterns of shallow Magellan marine benthic organisms.","Many thanks to Angie Díaz, Jaime Ojeda, Mathias Hüne, Javier Naretto, and Karin Gérard, for field assistance and samplings in southern South America.

As infrastructure approaches end of life, understanding such values is critical to inform decommissioning decisions. This study uses a decade of industry remotely operated vehicle (ROV) imagery to describe fish, invertebrate, and benthic communities on gas field infrastructure. Sampling was conducted over 22 km of flowline, three wells and one manifold in the temperate waters of Bass Strait, south east Australia in depths of 155 to 263 m. A total of 10,343 mobile animals from 69 taxa were observed. A higher diversity of fishes were observed on flowlines (28 taxa) compared to wells (19 taxa). Fish and invertebrate communities observed along flowlines were distinct from those observed on wells/manifold, however, there was also high spatial variability among the different flowlines surveyed and between the three wells and manifold. These differences appear to be driven by habitat and depth preferences of the species observed. Many sand-affiliated species were associated with buried sections of flowlines (Tasmanian giant crab Pseudocarcinus gigas, Balmain bug Ibacus peronii, slender sand burrower Creedia haswelli, red cod Pseudophycis spp., blue grenadier Macruronus novaezelandiae) whilst reef-associated and schooling species were observed on the wells/manifold (jackass morwong Nemadactylus macropterus, redbait Emmelichthys nitidus, splendid perch Callanthias australis). Species of ecological importance were also noted including the Australian fur seal (Arctocephalus pusillus doriferus), long-lived foxfish (Bodianus frenchii), and handfish (Brachionichthyidae spp). This study describes the habitat value of oil and gas infrastructure in a data poor temperate region that is important for understanding how the decommissioning of these structures may affect local marine ecosystems and fisheries. Therefore, it is critical to understand the habitat value of O&G infrastructure to marine life in the Bass Strait and whether decommissioning of these structures affect local marine ecosystems and fisheries. This study shows the complexity of determining temporal change in biodiversity values associated with these O & G structures from historical industry datasets that will be key for informing future decommissioning options. We also provide some guidance on how future quantitative data can be obtained in a systematic way using industry ROV data to better inform ecological investigations and decommissioning options.","We thank Cooper Energy for their project support, in particular Phil Deshon.

151,pub.1166124762,10.3390/min13111450,,,"Soft Computing Application in Mining, Mineral Processing and Metallurgy with an Approach to Using It in Mineral Waste Disposal","In the past two decades, the mining sector has increasingly embraced simulation and modelling techniques for decision-making processes. This adoption has facilitated enhanced process control and optimisation, enabling access to valuable data such as precise granulometry measurements, improved recovery rates, and the ability to forecast outcomes. Soft computing techniques, such as artificial neural networks and fuzzy algorithms, have emerged as viable alternatives to traditional statistical approaches, where the complex and non-linear nature of the mineral processing stages requires careful selection. This research examines the up-to-date use of soft computing techniques within the mining sector, with a specific emphasis on comminution, flotation, and pyrometallurgical and hydrometallurgical processes, and the selection of soft computing techniques and strategies for identifying key variables. From this, a soft computing approach is presented to enhance the monitoring and prediction accuracy for mineral waste disposal, specifically focusing on tailings and spent heap leaching spoils database treatment. However, the accessibility and quality of data are crucial for the long-term application of soft computing technology in the mining industry. Further research is needed to explore the full potential of soft computing techniques and to address specific challenges in mining and mineral processing.",The authors sincerely and gratefully acknowledge the support and guidance provided by the Oulu Mining School from the University of Oulu and the Geological Survey of Finland GTK.,This research received no external funding.,Minerals,,,,2023-11-17,2023,2023-11-17,,13,11,1450,All OA; Gold,Article,"Herrera, Nelson; Gonzalez, María Sinche; Okkonen, Jarkko; Mollehuara, Raul","Herrera, Nelson (Oulu Mining School, University of Oulu, P.O.

To achieve this, it is essential to acquire a set of key competencies throughout different stages of life, among which we find digital competence. This systematic review aims to analyse, through a series of focal points and indicators, the internationally published interventions in the last ten years aimed at improving digital literacy and the acquisition of this competence by students in early childhood education, primary education, and higher education, as well as professionals from various fields. The procedure followed for the selection of the interventions has been documented and graphically represented according to the PRISMA statement, with searches conducted across various databases and journals. In total, 26 studies were selected, covering the period before, during, and after the COVID-19 health lockdown, and the influence of the lockdown on the development of digital competence was examined. The obtained results show the evolution of the selected interventions in terms of general aspects, instructional and evaluative procedures, fidelity, and encountered limitations. The results demonstrate a growing concern for the development of digital competence, amplified by the needs arising during the COVID-19 lockdown and evidenced by an increase in interventions aimed at this goal.

This article presents the first report of a cohort of Venezuelan migrant women entering Colombia through Cúcuta and its metropolitan area. The study aimed to describe the health status and access to healthcare services among Venezuelan migrant women in Colombia with irregular migration status, and to analyze changes in those conditions at a one-month follow-up.
METHODS: We carried out a longitudinal cohort study of Venezuelan migrant women, 18 to 45 years, who entered Colombia with an irregular migration status. Study participants were recruited in Cúcuta and its metropolitan area. At baseline, we administered a structured questionnaire including sociodemographic characteristics, migration history, health history, access to health services, sexual and reproductive health, practice of early detection of cervical cancer and breast cancer, food insecurity, and depressive symptoms. The women were again contacted by phone one month later, between March and July 2021, and a second questionnaire was applied.
RESULTS: A total of 2,298 women were included in the baseline measurement and 56.4% could be contacted again at the one-month follow-up. At the baseline, 23.0% of the participants reported a self-perceived health problem or condition in the past month and 29.5% in the past 6 months, and 14.5% evaluated their health as fair or poor. A significant increase was found in the percentage of women who reported a self-perceived health problem during the past month (from 23.1% to 31.4%; p<0.01); as well as in the share who reported moderate, severe, or extreme difficulty working or performing daily chores (from 5.5% to 11.0%; p = 0.03) and who rated their health as fair (from 13.0% to 31.2%; p<0.01). Meanwhile, the percentage of women with depressive symptoms decreased from 80.5% to 71.2% (p<0.01).
CONCLUSION: This report presents initial information on the health status of Venezuelan migrant women in Colombia, and is a starting point for further longer longitudinal follow-ups to assess changes over time in health conditions.","We thank the health authorities of Cúcuta and Villa del Rosario, the local migrant organizations, and all the women who participated in this study.","This study was possible thanks to the generous support of the people of the United States through the Community Stabilization Activities (CSA) of the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) which funded this survey (https://www.usaid.gov/colombia).

The present cross-sectional study assessed the association between health behaviors of first-semester students and these factors.
METHOD: N = 189 (Mage = 18.79; SD = 1.07; female = 68.8%) first-semester students in Colombia completed an online questionnaire investigating current and expected health behaviors as well as influencing factors. ANCOVAs, bivariate correlations, moderation analyses, and hierarchical regressions were used to analyze the data.
RESULTS: expected food consumption (stronger among participants who live with parents) as well as current and expected heavy drinking and binge drinking (stronger among participants who do not live with parents) were significantly correlated to the respective parental behavior. Current and expected drinking was significantly correlated to partners' drinking. Expected physical activity was correlated with peers' physical activity. Partners' attempts to encourage drinking moderated the association between participants' current and expected drinking with partners' drinking. Time spent with peers was related to heavy drinking and engaging in more physical activity.
CONCLUSION: in Colombia, parents appear to play a significant role in their offspring's health behaviors during their first semester at university, particularly regarding food consumption and alcohol use.

Programmed genome rearrangements in ciliates offer an extreme example, making them a compelling model system to study DNA rearrangements. Currently, available methods for genome annotation are not adequate for highly scrambled genomes. We present a theoretical framework and software implementation for the systematic extraction and analysis of DNA rearrangement annotations from pairs of genome assemblies corresponding to precursor and product versions. The software makes no assumptions about the structure of the rearrangements, and permits the user to select parameters to suit the data. Compared to previous approaches, this work achieves more complete precursor-product mappings, allows for full transparency and reproducibility, and can be adapted to genomic data from different sources.",Portions of this paper reflect results obtained in the PhD dissertation of author Jasper Braun (24).,"NSF [DMS-1800443/1764366 to N.J., L.L.]; N.J. acknowledges partial support from the Simons Foundation and the Southeast Center for Mathematics and Biology.",NAR Genomics and Bioinformatics,,,,2023-10-11,2023,2023-11-02,2023-10-11,5,4,lqad096,All OA; Gold,Article,"Braun, Jasper; Neme, Rafik; Feng, Yi; Landweber, Laura F; Jonoska, Nataša","Braun, Jasper (Department of Mathematics and Statistics, University of South Florida, Tampa, FL 33620, USA; Division of Clinical Pathology, Department of Pathology, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Boston, MA 02215, USA); Neme, Rafik (Departments of Biochemistry and Molecular Biophysics, and Biological Sciences, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032, USA; Department of Chemistry and Biology, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); Feng, Yi (Departments of Biochemistry and Molecular Biophysics, and Biological Sciences, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032, USA); Landweber, Laura F (Departments of Biochemistry and Molecular Biophysics, and Biological Sciences, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032, USA); Jonoska, Nataša (Department of Mathematics and Statistics, University of South Florida, Tampa, FL 33620, USA)","Jonoska, Nataša (University of South Florida)","Braun, Jasper (University of South Florida; Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center); Neme, Rafik (Columbia University; Universidad del Norte); Feng, Yi (Columbia University); Landweber, Laura F (Columbia University); Jonoska, Nataša (University of South Florida)",1,0,,,https://academic.oup.com/nargab/article-pdf/5/4/lqad096/52777182/lqad096.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1165701163,31 Biological Sciences; 3102 Bioinformatics and Computational Biology; 3105 Genetics,

Through the analysis of the global and local reactivity of the reagents, it was determined that the furan acts as an electron donor. In contrast, the titanium of the ZN catalyst acts as an electron acceptor. It is postulated that this difference in reactivity could lead to forming a furan-titanium complex, which blocks the catalyst's active sites and reduces its efficiency for propylene polymerization. Theoretical results showed a high adsorption affinity of furan to the active site of the Ti catalyst, indicating that furan tends to bind strongly to the catalyst, thus blocking the active sites and decreasing the availability for propylene polymerization. The experimental data revealed that the presence of furan significantly reduced the productivity of the ZN catalyst by 10, 20, and 41% for concentrations of 6, 12.23, and 25.03 ppm furan, respectively. In addition, a proportional relationship was observed between the furan concentration and the MFI melt index of the polymer, where the higher the furan concentration, the higher the MFI. Likewise, the presence of furan negatively affected the mechanical properties of polypropylene, especially the impact Izod value, with percentage decreases of 9, 18, and 22% for concentrations of 6, 12.23, and 25.03 ppm furan, respectively.",,This research received no external funding.,International Journal of Molecular Sciences,,Haiyang Gao,,2023-09-21,2023,2023-09-21,,24,18,14368,All OA; Gold,Article,"Hernández-Fernández, Joaquín; Puello-Polo, Esneyder; Marquez, Edgar","Hernández-Fernández, Joaquín (Chemistry Program, Department of Natural and Exact Sciences, San Pablo Campus, University of Cartagena, Cartagena 130015, Colombia; Chemical Engineering Program, School of Engineering, Universidad Tecnológica de Bolivar, Parque Industrial y Tecnológico Carlos Vélez Pombo, Cartagena 130001, Colombia; Department of Natural and Exact Science, Universidad de la Costa, Barranquilla 080002, Colombia); Puello-Polo, Esneyder (Group de Investigación en Oxi/Hidrotratamiento Catalítico Y Nuevos Materiales, Programa de Química-Ciencias Básicas, Universidad del Atlántico, Puerto Colombia 081001, Colombia;, esneyderpuello@mail.uniatlantico.edu.co); Marquez, Edgar (Grupo de Investigaciones en Química Y Biología, Departamento de Química Y Biología, Facultad de Ciencias Básicas, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla 081007, Colombia)","Hernández-Fernández, Joaquín (University of Cartagena; Universidad Tecnológica de Bolívar; University of the Coast); Marquez, Edgar (Universidad del Norte)","Hernández-Fernández, Joaquín (University of Cartagena; Universidad Tecnológica de Bolívar; University of the Coast); Puello-Polo, Esneyder (University of Atlántico); Marquez, Edgar (Universidad del Norte)",1,1,,,https://www.mdpi.com/1422-0067/24/18/14368/pdf?version=1695276711,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1164318726,34 Chemical Sciences; 3403 Macromolecular and Materials Chemistry,

Inclusion of migrants in COVID-19 vaccination is not only ethically necessary from a right-to-health perspective but also technically indispensable for disease control. This study aimed to characterize the inclusion of international migrants, refugees, and asylum seekers in COVID-19 vaccination policies in Latin American countries that have the greatest recent increase in the reception of migrants. We conducted a content analysis of public policy documents issued between March 11, 2020, and June 30, 2022 by the Ministries of Health of seven countries: Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, Mexico and Peru. Documents were located through Ministries of Health web pages, references in scientific literature, and the Pan American Health Organization's Information Platform on Health and Migration in the Americas. A content analysis was performed of the documents that were located, along six dimensions: migrants' right to vaccination, temporality of vaccination, administrative discretion, policies to facilitate access, language or cultural considerations, and normative, ethical or technical justifications provided. Eighty-six public policy documents were reviewed. Their contents showed that none of the countries explicitly excluded migrants from vaccination, nor did they explicitly define restrictions on this population. One barrier that was detected was to require identity documents in order to be vaccinated or to receive a vaccination certificate, which could be difficult for migrants to obtain. Few countries defined actions to facilitate or promote the vaccination of migrants. The documents that mentioned justifications for vaccinating migrants presented reasons that were mainly based on the recognition of the right to health, the principle of non-discrimination and equity. The countries studied generally had inclusive policies but were limited in terms of dealing with potential barriers to access. The lack of mechanisms to guarantee the right to health is a limitation that countries in the region should address.","Declaration of Competing Interest The authors declare the following financial interests/personal relationships which may be considered as potential competing interests: Julián A.

In this study, a method of extraction and recovery of the Millad NX 8000 was developed. The additive was recovered using GC-MS and extracted with an activated carbon column plus glass fiber, using an injection molded sample, obtaining a recovery rate greater than 96%. TGA, DSC, and FTIR were used to evaluate the recovered additive's glass transitions and purity. The thermal degradation of the recovered additive was found to be between 340 and 420 °C, with a melting temperature of 246 °C, adopting the same behavior as the pure additive. In FTIR, the characteristic absorption peak of Millad NX 8000 was observed at 1073 cm-1, which indicates the purity of the extracted compound.

This study characterized the competencies of professionals in the Colombian Caribbean, the circumstances that favor and hinder the development of appropriate care, as well as the preferences, expectations and attitudes toward an educational intervention supported by ICTs.
METHODS: We used a qualitative, phenomenological approach, combining documentary review and data obtained through observation, an online survey and two focus groups involving 55 healthcare professionals (physicians, nurses and psychologists) of varying experience. For the analysis and integration of results, the Capacity, Opportunity, Motivation and Behavior model and the Theoretical Domains Framework were used as references. The Consolidated Criteria for Reporting Qualitative Research (COREQ) checklist guided the reporting of this study.
RESULTS: Competency deficits were found regardless of the profession and experience, which are related to inadequacies in undergraduate and post-graduate training. Structural problems in Colombian society and healthcare service organization were also discovered, which were considered unmodifiable barriers and have been aggravated by the social, economic and health effects of the pandemic. The main modifiable barriers found were as follows: pain underestimation and under-treatment of older adults, as well as stereotypes regarding old age and pain, lack of knowledge of the psychosocial determinants of pain and of techniques for its assessment and treatment, overestimation of pharmacological treatment and failure to update pharmacological and non-pharmacological techniques.
CONCLUSIONS: Recommendations for the design of the educational intervention were established as follows: favoring non-synchronous resources, facilitating synchronous activities of short duration, facilitating permanent access to information and resources and generating incentives for continuing education, such as certification, institutional recognition and encouraging popular recognition.",,The work was supported by the International Association for the Study of Pain [2020 Initiative to Improve Pain Education Grant]; Universidad Cooperativa de Colombia [INV2932],Medical Education Online,,,Aged; Humans; Colombia; Health Personnel; Musculoskeletal Pain; Pandemics; Students; Qualitative Research; Competency-Based Education,2023-02-06,2023,2023-02-06,2023-12-31,28,1,2172755,All OA; Gold,Article,"Martín-Carbonell, Marta; Colorado, Yuli Suárez; Camacho-Rodríguez, Doriam; Expósito-Concepción, Maria Yaquelin; Touchie-Meza, Salín; Daza, Doris Sequeira; Julio, Luz Karinne González","Martín-Carbonell, Marta (Psychology Department, Universidad Cooperativa de Colombia, Santa Marta, Colombia); Colorado, Yuli Suárez (Psychology Department, Universidad Cooperativa de Colombia, Santa Marta, Colombia); Camacho-Rodríguez, Doriam (Nursing Department, Universidad Cooperativa de Colombia, Santa Marta, Colombia); Expósito-Concepción, Maria Yaquelin (Nursing Departament, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); Touchie-Meza, Salín (Medicine Department, Universidad Cooperativa de Colombia, Santa Marta, Colombia); Daza, Doris Sequeira (Nursing Department, Health School, Universidad Central de Chile, Valparaiso, Chile); Julio, Luz Karinne González (Nursing Department, Universidad Cooperativa de Colombia, Santa Marta, Colombia)","Martín-Carbonell, Marta (Cooperative University of Colombia)","Martín-Carbonell, Marta (Cooperative University of Colombia); Colorado, Yuli Suárez (Cooperative University of Colombia); Camacho-Rodríguez, Doriam (Cooperative University of Colombia); Expósito-Concepción, Maria Yaquelin (Universidad del Norte); Touchie-Meza, Salín (Cooperative University of Colombia); Daza, Doris Sequeira (Universidad Central de Chile); Julio, Luz Karinne González (Cooperative University of Colombia)",1,1,,,https://doi.org/10.1080/10872981.2023.2172755,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1155153453,42 Health Sciences; 4203 Health Services and Systems,3 Good Health and Well Being; 4 Quality Education

The treatment of invasive Candida infections is based on the use of fluconazole, but the emergence of resistant isolates has been an increasing concern which has led to the study of alternative drugs with antifungal activity. Sphingolipids have been considered a promising target due to their roles in fungal growth and virulence. Inhibitors of the sphingolipid biosynthetic pathway have been described to display antifungal properties, such as myriocin and aureobasidin A, which are active against resistant Candida isolates. In the present study, aureobasidin A did not display antibiofilm activity nor synergism with amphotericin B, but its combination with fluconazole was effective against Candida biofilms and protected the host in an in vivo infection model. Alterations in treated cells revealed increased oxidative stress, reduced mitochondrial membrane potential and chitin content, as well as altered morphology, enhanced DNA leakage and a greater susceptibility to sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS). In addition, it seems to inhibit the efflux pump CaCdr2p. All these data contribute to elucidating the role of aureobasidin A on fungal cells, especially evidencing its promising use in clinical resistant isolates of Candida species.","The authors thank the Centro Nacional de Biologia Estrutural e Bioimagem (CENABIO, UFRJ, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil) for the facilities and support in the use of SEM equipment.","This study was financed in part by the Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior—Brasil (CAPES)—Finance Code 001; Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e TecnolÓgico (CNPq) Universal-Processo # 408981/2018-0 and Fundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do estado do Rio de Janeiro-CNE (Faperj) Processo # E-26/202974/2017.

Case definitions for the three arboviral infections overlap.
METHODS: A cross-sectional analysis was carried out. A bivariate analysis was made using confirmed CHIKV infection as the outcome. Variables with significant statistical association were included in an agreement consensus. Agreed variables were analyzed in a multiple regression model. The area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was calculated to determine a cut-off value and performance.
RESULTS: 295 patients with confirmed CHIKV infection were included. A screening tool was created using symmetric arthritis (4 points), fatigue (3 points), rash (2 points), and ankle joint pain (1 point). The ROC curve identified a cut-off value, and a score ≥ 5.5 was considered positive for identifying CHIKV patients with a sensibility of 64.4% and a specificity of 87.4%, positive predictive value of 85.5%, negative predictive value of 67.7%, area under the curve of 0.72, and an accuracy of 75%.
CONCLUSION: We developed a screening tool for CHIKV diagnosis using only clinical symptoms as well as proposed an algorithm to aid the primary care physician.",None.,"This work was supported by the Colombian Rheumatology Association (ACTA 169 10 July 2015), Universidad de La Sabana (MED-197-2015), and COLCIENCIAS doctoral scholarship (757-2016).",Tropical Medicine and Infectious Disease,,,,2023-04-03,2023,2023-04-03,,8,4,213,All OA; Gold,Article,"Rueda, Juan C.; Peláez-Ballestas, Ingris; Angarita, Jose-Ignacio; Santos, Ana M.; Pinzon, Carlos; Saldarriaga, Eugenia-Lucia; Rueda, Jorge M.; Forero, Elias; Saaibi, Diego L.; Pavía, Paula X.; Mantilla, Marta Juliana; Rodríguez-Salas, Gustavo; Santacruz, Juan Camilo; Rueda, Igor; Cardiel, Mario H.; Londono, John","Rueda, Juan C.

OD is a common problem in children with congenital Zika virus syndrome (CZS). In this case series, we describe the clinical and acoustic alterations of swallowing in children exposed to the Zika virus during pregnancy in a cohort from Amazonas, Brazil. From July 2019 to January 2020, 22 children were evaluated, 6 with microcephaly and 16 without microcephaly. The mean age among the participants was 35 months (±4.6 months). All children with microcephaly had alterations in oral motricity, mainly in the lips and cheeks. Other alterations were in vocal quality, hard palate, and soft palate. Half of the children with microcephaly showed changes in cervical auscultation during breast milk swallowing. In children without microcephaly, the most frequently observed alteration was in lip motricity, but alterations in auscultation during the swallowing of breast milk were not observed. Regarding swallowing food of a liquid and pasty consistency, the most frequent alterations were incomplete verbal closure, increased oral transit time, inadequacy in capturing the spoon, anterior labial leakage, and increased oral transit time. Although these events are more frequent in microcephalic children, they can also be seen in non-microcephalic children, which points to the need for an indistinct evaluation of children exposed in utero to ZIKV.","We would like to thank the families who agreed to follow us on this path of acceptance, care, and construction of knowledge. We thank the Zika Project’s multidisciplinary team for working with us in monitoring the children.","This work was funded by Fundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado do Amazonas (FAPEAM): Universal Amazonas (#002/2018); the Ministry of Health of Brazil: Programa de Pesquisa para o SUS—PPSUS (#062.01018/2018)—and Departamento de Ciência e Tecnologia—(#51/2019); and Leônidas and Maria Deane Institute (ILMD/Fiocruz Amazônia), in partnership with the Nacional Council for Scientific and Technological Development—CNPq (#400911/2018-3n).

A semistructured survey was conducted among the IT professionals of Colombian companies of different sizes and economic sectors between 2019 and 2022. The survey was designed considering international references, such as ISACA, and following the Kimball methodology to guide the analysis. A total of 252 responses were collected, and 237 records were analyzed. It was concluded that the successful implementation of IT governance can improve efficiency, productivity, decision-making, information security, competitiveness, and customer service quality. However, the Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SME's) face challenges such as a lack of skilled human resources, resistance to change, and high implementation costs. To address these challenges, strategies such as prioritizing investments, focusing on internal talent, communicating benefits and expected results, and investing in the training of the organization's personnel are suggested.",All the authors have read and agreed to the published version of the manuscript.

The influence of the abnormal function of mentalis muscle on the shape and posture of the mandible was evaluated using a finite element approach.
METHODS: Finite element analysis was used to create a three-dimensional representation of a human mandible that represents a dry normal mandible with teeth (33-36 gm/cm2). Pressures were applied directly to the labial surface of the mandible's lower anterior dento-alveolar structure reflecting the normal lips muscle function. While on abnormal swallowing pattern, lip muscle force (300 gm\cm2) had been assumed.
RESULTS: Shape and postural abnormality of the mandible with malocclusion particularly at the anterior dentoalveolar and basal bone region in sagittal direction as well as inward pressure on the mandibular posterior region.
CONCLUSION: Abnormal perioral muscle function throughout growth and development may result in a shape and postural abnormality of the mandible and a companying malocclusion.","The authors would like to express their gratitude to the University of Mosul, College of Dentistry, and College of Engineering for their ongoing support.

The objective of this study was to estimate the effectiveness of vaccines in preventing hospitalization and death from COVID-19 in Colombia under real-life conditions among people aged 18 years and older, according to sex, age, confirmed history of COVID-19 and vaccination series, including the effects of boosters. This investigation was an observational, retrospective, population-based study based on the Colombian cohort ""Esperanza"". A total of 14,213,409 individuals aged 18 years and older were analyzed, who were matched in a 1:1 ratio of vaccinated to unvaccinated. The study groups consisted of unvaccinated individuals, those with a complete series (CS) and individuals with a CS plus booster. The vaccinated individuals received either homologous or heterologous vaccinations with Ad26.COV2-S, BNT162b2, ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, CoronaVac and mRNA-1273 vaccines. Follow-up was conducted between February 2021 and June 2022. Cox proportional hazards models were used, adjusted for potential confounders, to estimate the effectiveness of different vaccination series. For adults aged 18 years and older, the overall effectiveness of the vaccines in preventing hospitalization was 82.7% (95% CI 82.1-83.2) for CS and 80.2% (95%CI 78.7-81.6) for CS + booster. The effectiveness in preventing death was 86.0% (95%CI 85.5-86.5) for CS and 83.1% (95%CI 81.5-84.5) for CS + booster. Effectiveness decreased with age. While all efficacies were high, CoronaVac offered significantly lower protection, although this improved with a booster. Continued mass vaccination is pivotal, especially in low- and middle-income countries. The study highlights both the real-world effectiveness of these vaccines and the challenges in understanding waning immunity and the influence of different VoC(Variants of Concern) on results.",,"This study did not have any formal grant or specific funding.

The quantitative component consisted of an analytical ecological design, where proportions, ratios, measures of central tendency and rates ratios, rate difference, Gini and concentration indices were calculated to measure inequalities. The qualitative component had a phenomenological and interpretive approach. One hundred thirty-one women died in Choco between 2010-2018. The Maternal Mortality Ratio was 224/100.000 live births. The Gini coefficient was 0.35, indicating inequality in the distribution of the number of MM with respect to live births. The health service offers have been concentrated in the private sector in urban areas (77%). The exercise of midwifery has played an important role in maternal and perinatal care processes, especially in territories where the State has been absent. Nevertheless, it occurs in complex circumstances such as the armed conflict, lack of transportation routes, and income deficits, affecting the timelines and care quality for these vulnerable groups. MM in Chocó has been a consequence of deficiencies in the health system and weaknesses in its infrastructure (absence of a high level of maternal-perinatal care). This is in addition to the territory's geographical characteristics, which increase vulnerability and health risks for women and their newborns. In Colombia, as well as in other countries, many maternal and newborn deaths are preventable because their causes are due to social injustices.","Special thanks are due to Manuela Mosquera, Director of Asoredipar Chocó, and Yalile Ricard and Silvia Quiroz of the Technological University of Chocó for their willingness and support for the materialization of this article.","This article was co-funded by the project “Exchange and transfer of formal, traditional and community knowledge for the improvement of maternal and perinatal health with a differential and intercultural approach”, derived from Contract 714–2018 made with the Ministry of Science and Technology of Colombia.

We aimed to systematically review guidelines, and reports of practice and to analyze associations between timing of CC and mother-to-neonate SARS-CoV-2 transmission during the early phases of the pandemic.
METHODS: Major databases were searched from December 1, 2019, to July 20, 2021.
INCLUSION: studies and guidelines describing CC practice in women with SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy until 2 postnatal days, giving birth to live-born neonates.
EXCLUSION: no extractable data. Two reviewers independently screened studies for eligibility and assessed study quality. Pooled prevalence rates were calculated.
RESULTS: Forty-eight studies (1476 neonates) and 40 guidelines were included. Delayed CC was recommended in 70.0% of the guidelines. Nevertheless, delayed CC was reported less often than early CC: 262/1476 (17.8%) vs 511/1476 (34.6%). Neonatal SARS-CoV-2 positivity rates were similar following delayed (1.2%) and early CC (1.3%). Most SARS-CoV-2 transmissions (93.3%) occurred in utero.
CONCLUSION: Delayed CC did not seem to increase mother-to-neonate SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Due to its benefits, it should be encouraged even in births where the mother has a SARS-CoV-2 infection.

The study aimed to generate evidence of the validity of the mental and physical health symptomatology scale in two samples of vulnerable groups: emerging university adults, who report high levels of mental health problems, and migrants, who report high levels of physical and mental health problems. Using non-probability sampling, in the first study, evidence of construct validity of the scale was reported in 652 emerging adults and, in the second, evidence of validity was provided from associations with the depression, stress and anxiety scale (DASS-21) among 283 migrants. The results indicate that in Study 1 the two-factor model had adequate indicators of fit and adequate reliability; only the mental health factor presented evidence of convergent validity. In Study 2, the mental health factor showed positive and large associations with the DASS-21, which decreased when the physical health symptoms factor was considered. These analyses provide evidence of validity for the scale, which is an easy-to-use instrument that allows for the assessment of health from an integral perspective.",The authors would like to thank all the participants who responded to the survey.,This research was funded by Agencia Nacional de Investigación y Desarrollo (ANID) through the program Fondecyt Iniciación Grant No. 11200984 and Grant No. 11181020.

The dataset is named WyoFlex sEMG Hand Gesture and recorded the data of 28 participants between 18 and 37 years old without neuromuscular diseases or cardiovascular problems. The test protocol consisted of sEMG signals acquisition corresponding to ten wrist and grasping movements (extension, flexion, ulnar deviation, radial deviation, hook grip, power grip, spherical grip, precision grip, lateral grip, and pinch grip), considering three repetitions for each gesture. Also, the dataset contains general information such as anthropometric measures of the upper limb, gender, age, laterally of the person, and physical condition. Likewise, the implemented acquisition system consists of a portable armband with four sEMG channels distributed equidistantly for each forearm. The database could be used for the recognition of hand gestures, evaluation of the evolution of patients in rehabilitation processes, control of upper limb orthoses or prostheses, and biomechanical analysis of the forearm.","The authors thank the Instituto Politécnico Nacional for the support provided by the grants SIP20221151, SIP20221150, SIP20231089, SIP20231293, SIP20231030 and SIP20231089.

The Delphi process, with a ≥8 0% pre-defined participants' agreement, included three phases and a Coordinating Group. During the Preparation phase three panels of experts were selected and invited to participate: a) Regional academic/professional Dental Associations (Associations-Panel): n = 12; b) Regional Dental Schools (Dental-Schools-Panel): existing dental schools (n = 263) from the 19 Spanish-speaking regional countries; c) International academic/professional associations Peer Experts (Peer-Panel): n = 4. Based on consensus documents from Europe, Colombia, the Caribbean, USA, Chile and Spain, and updated scientific evidence, the Coordinating Group developed a baseline framework proposal of domains, main competencies (MC) and specific competencies (SC). The Consultation-Agreement and Consensus phases included three rounds of questionnaires with a step-wise sharing of the MC updated version of the consensus framework with the Dental-Schools-Panel and including SC with the Associations-Panel. Diverse communication strategies were used ( e.g ., independent google-form questionnaires and workshops). Consensus was reached after an on-site Associations-Panel workshop and secret voting, followed by an online meeting with the Peers-Panel. A total of 127 academic/professional institutions participated (Associations-Panel: 11, 91.6%; Dental-Schools-Panel: 112, 42.6%, all countries; Peers-Panel: 4, 100%). The baseline Cariology teaching framework of 5 domains, 10 MC and 92 SC underwent modifications after agreements for a final consensus framework consisting of 5 domains, 10 MC and 85 SC. A Core Cariology curriculum framework in Spanish for Latin American Dental Schools was successfully developed and agreed upon with regional dental academic and professional institutions.","This study was funded by LAOHA, Colgate-Palmolive, and Universidad El Bosque contributed.

This is why the Quality of Work Life (QoWL) study has gained relevance in recent years. For this reason, various scales have been developed to evaluate this organizational variable constantly. However, to date, there is no evidence in the scientific literature of a Spanish version that evaluates the validity and reliability of these scales in a Peruvian context. Thus, this study aimed to translate into Spanish and adapt and analyze the validity and reliability of a scale to assess the quality of work life in Peruvian teachers based on Walton's model. For this purpose, 457 regular basic education teachers from a private educational network located in the three regions of Peru were surveyed. The analyses used the Structural Equation Model (SEM) with the AMOS 24 statistical software. Confirmatory Factor Analysis provided an excellent fit model of eight factors and 31 elements (CMIN/DF = 2.351; CFI = 0.955; SRMR = 0.062; RMSEA = 0.054; Pclose = 0.052). It also demonstrated good internal consistency (α = between 0.806 and 0.938; CR = between 0.824 and 0.939; AVE = between 0.547 and 0.794).

However, the underreporting of the disease is an unfortunate reality, with a clear trend towards a decrease in cases since 2019, when the guidelines for its confirmatory diagnosis changed with the requirement of two paired samples. The purpose of this review is to highlight the importance of leptospirosis. While the access to rapid diagnosis is available at practically all levels of care for dengue and malaria, leptospirosis-a doubly neglected disease-deserves recognition as a serious public health problem in Colombia. In this manner, it is proposed that molecular tests are a viable diagnostic alternative that can improve the targeted treatment of the patient and the timeliness of data and case reporting to SIVIGILA, and reduce the underreporting of the disease. Taking advantage of the strengthened technological infrastructure derived from the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic for molecular diagnosis in Colombia, with a network of 227 laboratories distributed throughout the national territory, with an installed capacity for PCR testing, it is proposed that molecular diagnosis can be used as an alternative for early diagnosis. This would allow case confirmation through the public health network in Colombia, and, together with the microagglutination (MAT) technique, the epidemiological surveillance of this disease in this country would be strengthened.",,"This study was supported by the Fogarty International Center and the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, of the National Institutes of Health under Award Number D43 TW010331.

Embracing a healthy way of living is vital in lessening the impact of illnesses and extending one's lifespan. This research delves into the link between the health and eHealth literacy levels of individuals accessing primary healthcare services and investigates how this relates to adopting a health-conscious lifestyle.
METHODS: The approach involves a cross-sectional examination carried out at a healthcare facility in the Madrid region of Spain, focusing on adult patients who are in need of primary care nursing services. Health and eHealth literacy and a healthy lifestyle were measured using the Health Literacy Questionnaire (HLQ), the eHealth Literacy Questionnaire (eHLQ), and the ""PA100"" questionnaire, respectively.
RESULTS: Only some of the dimensions of the HLQ and eHLQ were significantly related to a healthy lifestyle, predominantly with a very low or low relationship. Dimension three of the HLQ and dimension five of the eHLQ acquired more importance and were positioned as positive predictors of a healthy lifestyle.
CONCLUSIONS: This study helps comprehend the relationship between health and eHealth literacy and a healthy lifestyle, which provides information that contributes to understanding the factors that might have a higher impact on lifestyles.",The authors thank the nursing team of the “C.S.

A total of 2,149 workers in Baja California, Mexico's industrial and education-government sectors, were administered an online inventory version. Preliminary analyses were performed, as well as a Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) based on two models proposed by the standard itself: an eight-factor model (8-FM) and a four-factor model (4-FM). Likewise, based on the results and with the recommendations of the specialists, a threefactor model (3-FM) was proposed. In addition, nested model sequencing methods were subsequently applied to validate the invariance between the origin of the activity. The dimensionality of 3-FM was found to have adequate fit values according to a-priori established criteria. It is concluded that the IIAPRF does not have the reliability and validity parameters necessary to support interpretations, uses and consequences based on the theoretical structure established by NOM-035-STPS-2018 and that, although the 3-FM presents better reliability and validity indices, it is not invariant in terms of the origin of the activity. Finally, we discuss the implications and recommend reviewing and adjusting the design of the IIAPRF items to extend the measurement of invariance to other groups of relevance for decision making in the improvement of the work environment.",,,Frontiers in Psychology,,,,2023-01-04,2023,2023-01-04,,13,,1022707,All OA; Gold,Article,"Cano-Gutierrez, Julio César; Pérez-Morán, Juan Carlos; Bernal-Baldenebro, Brando; Arenas-Meneses, Daniela; Vazquez-Lira, Ramsés; Olguín-Tiznado, Jesús Everardo","Cano-Gutierrez, Julio César (Faculty of Engineering, Architecture and Design, Autonomous University of Baja California, Ensenada, Mexico); Pérez-Morán, Juan Carlos (Promoter Network of Diagnostic Evaluation Methods and Educational Innovation, Mexico City, Mexico); Bernal-Baldenebro, Brando (Institute for Educational Research and Development, Autonomous University of Baja California, Ensenada, Mexico); Arenas-Meneses, Daniela (Promoter Network of Diagnostic Evaluation Methods and Educational Innovation, Mexico City, Mexico); Vazquez-Lira, Ramsés (Faculty of Psychology, National Autonomous University of Mexico, Mexico City, Mexico); Olguín-Tiznado, Jesús Everardo (Faculty of Engineering, Architecture and Design, Autonomous University of Baja California, Ensenada, Mexico)","Pérez-Morán, Juan Carlos (Promoter Network of Diagnostic Evaluation Methods and Educational Innovation, Mexico City, Mexico)","Cano-Gutierrez, Julio César (Autonomous University of Baja California); Pérez-Morán, Juan Carlos (Promoter Network of Diagnostic Evaluation Methods and Educational Innovation, Mexico City, Mexico); Bernal-Baldenebro, Brando (Autonomous University of Baja California); Arenas-Meneses, Daniela (Promoter Network of Diagnostic Evaluation Methods and Educational Innovation, Mexico City, Mexico); Vazquez-Lira, Ramsés (National Autonomous University of Mexico); Olguín-Tiznado, Jesús Everardo (Autonomous University of Baja California)",1,1,,,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.1022707/pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1154225775,52 Psychology; 5203 Clinical and Health Psychology,

ABSTRACT Introduction: Self-regulation of learning refers to the modulation of affective, cognitive and behavioral processes throughout a learning experience to reach a desired level of achievement. Students who have a better management of their cognitive and metacognitive skills learn in a better way than those who do not, therefore, it is essential to study at what level university students are capable of learning to learn and to be managers of their learning. Objectives: To analyze the relationship between self-regulation of learning and academic performance in medical students from three universities in the year 2022. Materials and methods: This research followed a quantitative approach; the type of research was observational and descriptive. A previously validated instrument was used to identify types of self-regulation, the Self-Regulation of Learning from Texts (ARATEX-R). Results: No significant relationship was found between the academic profile of medical students and the total ARATEX-R score. When studying the relationship between the dimensions of self-regulation, a relationship was found between academic performance and motivation planning and management, which implies that those who have better planning skills and who are able to manage their motivation have better academic performance. Conclusion: The main dimensions that characterize the self-regulation of learning in medical students were: context management, cognition management and comprehension evaluation.",,,Anales de la Facultad de Ciencias Médicas (Asunción),,,,2023-04-15,2023,2023-04-15,,56,1,32-40,All OA; Gold,Article,"Coronel, Ivn Barrios; Patio, Mara Isabel; Coronel, Jazmn Barrios; Osorio, Hernando Bez; Rbalo, Telmo Ral Aveiro; Pont, Ema Maidana; Alvez, Edis Ortigoza; Arias, Jorge Villalba; Maia, Joo Mauricio Castaldelli; Ventriglio, Antonio; Torales, Julio Csar","Coronel, Ivn Barrios (); Patio, Mara Isabel (); Coronel, Jazmn Barrios (); Osorio, Hernando Bez (); Rbalo, Telmo Ral Aveiro (); Pont, Ema Maidana (); Alvez, Edis Ortigoza (); Arias, Jorge Villalba (); Maia, Joo Mauricio Castaldelli (); Ventriglio, Antonio (); Torales, Julio Csar ()",,"Coronel, Ivn Barrios (); Patio, Mara Isabel (); Coronel, Jazmn Barrios (); Osorio, Hernando Bez (); Rbalo, Telmo Ral Aveiro (); Pont, Ema Maidana (); Alvez, Edis Ortigoza (); Arias, Jorge Villalba (); Maia, Joo Mauricio Castaldelli (); Ventriglio, Antonio (); Torales, Julio Csar ()",1,1,,,http://scielo.iics.una.py/pdf/anales/v56n1/1816-8949-anales-56-01-32.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1157437530,39 Education; 3901 Curriculum and Pedagogy,

The 1990 Caracas declaration proposed a shift towards decentralised community mental health services and interventions based on the recovery approach and emphasis on social determinants of mental health in the Americas. Colombia has adopted these approaches in its legal and practical framework in recent years, but implementation has been uneven. This systematic review aims to contribute to mental health services understanding in Colombia by examining the barriers and facilitators to the implementation of mental health services in Colombia. A search was conducted to explore available peer-reviewed studies on Colombian mental health services across five databases (Medline, PubMed, Scopus, Scielo and BVS) on quantitative and qualitative research papers published in the last ten years and without language restrictions. The Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR) was used to structure the analysis and identify barriers and facilitators during the implementation of mental health services. We adapted the CFIR to attend to gender, race and age informed by the Socio-Political Economy of Global Mental Health framework, given the importance of these factors to the Colombian health landscape. Finally, narrative synthesis was used to summarise the data. 1 530 records were identified, and 12 articles met all inclusion criteria and were included in the analysis. 8 papers described substance use disorders services, 11 involved multidisciplinary healthcare professionals, and 7 were implemented at a local scale. The primary barriers to implementation were the lack of coordination, high workloads, and low funding. Facilitators included the use of protocols, and the involvement of communities, stakeholders, users, and external champions. Findings suggest the continued importance of community and recovery approaches and efforts to improve coordination between multi-sector actors involved in the mental health spaces (e.g., public, and private organisations, users and their families).",,"This paper was conducted in partial fulfilment of GA-AG MSc degree in Global Health and Development at UCL.

RESULTS: 280 surveys were distributed across three periods: before (n=80), during (n=105) and after (n=95) COVID-19 care; 172 surveys were returned. The response rates were 57.5%, 64.8% and 61.1%, respectively. The prevalence of severe burnout was 30.4%, 63.2% and 34.5% before, during and after COVID-19 care (p<0.001). Emotional exhaustion (p<0.001) and depersonalization (p=0.002) symptoms were more prevalent among nurses than among physicians. Severe burnout was more prevalent in women, nurses and night shift staff.
CONCLUSION: the high prevalence of burnout doubled in the first peak of hospital admissions and returned to pre-pandemic levels one month after COVID-19 care ended. Burnout varied by gender, shift and occupation, with nurses among the most vulnerable groups. Focus on early assessment and mitigation strategies are required to support nurses not only during crisis but permanently.","Agradecemos a los Doctores Catalina Casillas-Suárez y Francisco Navarro-Reynoso, y a todo el personal de la unidad de Neumología del Hospital General de México “Dr. Eduardo Liceaga” que atendieron a los pacientes de COVID-19.

OBJETIVE: To evaluate whether there is an association between social support, concern about COVID-19 infection and knowledge about tuberculosis, and non-adherence to antituberculosis treatment.
MATERIALS AND METHODOS: A cross-sectional study was carried out on patients under antituberculosis treatment, from January to March, 2022, in centers located in areas with a high prevalence of tuberculosis in Lima. We used the Morisky Green-Levine questionnaire to assess adherence to treatment as the dependent variable; the independent variables were evaluated using the Medical Outcomes Study Social Support Survey for perceived social support and concern about COVID-19 infection, and the Battle Test to assess patients’ knowledge about their disease. We used Poisson regression with robust variance to evaluate the association between the independent variables and the dependent one.
RESULTS: Out of 101 participants (73.3% male with an average age of 35.1 ± 16 years), 51.5% were non-adherent to antituberculosis treatment. Medium or high level of concern about getting COVID-19 was associated with a higher prevalence of non-adherence to treatment (odds ratio: 1.68; 95 % confidence interval: 1.09-2.57) (adjusted for considered confounding variables).
CONCLUSIONS: Non-adherence is a frequent condition among patients living in an area with a high prevalence of tuberculosis in Lima, especially among those with a higher concern for COVID-19 infection.","Agradecemos al personal de las instituciones en estudio por su colaboración en la realización de esta investigación.

The 4a and 4b structures crystallized in monoclinic and triclinic systems with space groups P21/n and P1̄, respectively. Theoretical calculations were performed at the DFT/B3LYP level for the optimized geometries. The results were in excellent agreement with the experimental data (spectroscopic and XRD). This investigation encompasses molecular modeling studies including Hirshfeld surface analysis, energy framework calculations, and frontier molecular orbital analysis. Intermolecular interactions within the crystal structures of the compounds were explored through Hirshfeld surface analysis, which revealed the notable presence of hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interactions. This insight provides valuable information on the structural stability and potential solubility characteristics of these compounds. The research was extended to docking analysis with eight distinct kinases (BRAF, HER2, CSF1R, MEK2, PDGFRA, JAK, AKT1, and AKT2). The results of this analysis demonstrate that both 4a and 4b interact effectively with the kinase-binding sites through a combination of hydrophobic interactions and hydrogen bonding. Compound 4a had the best affinity for proteins; this is related to the fact that the compound is not rigid and has a small size, allowing it to sit well at any binding site. This study contributes to the advancement of kinase inhibitor research and offers potential avenues for the development of new therapeutic agents for cancer treatment.","The authors acknowledge the Research Group of the Laboratory of Organic Synthesis and Biological Activity of the University of Talca.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A bibliometric study was carried out with the publications indexed in the Scopus database up to 22 September 2022. A search strategy was developed using Boolean operators ""AND"" and ""OR,"" in addition to the MeSH term ""monkeypox virus"" (MPXV) in the subarea of dentistry. The bibliometric indicators were measured objectively with the SciVal program.
RESULTS: Of the publications identified, 40% were indexed in first-quartile journals. India and Brazil are the countries with two published papers, while India has more views than the rest. Banaras Hindu University, Varanasi, Uttar Pradesh, India and Dr. Ram Manohar Lohia Hospital, New Delhi, India are the institutions with the highest number of citations with respect to the world average (FWCI: 2.74). The International Dental Journal has a publication on monkeypox in the field of dentistry. India is the country with the most authors (06) who have published about the study. Samaranayake Lakshman Perera is the most productive and high-impact author.
CONCLUSION: In the area of dentistry, scientific production on monkeypox is still scarce; however, the publications identified are mainly in high-impact indexed journals (Q1 and Q2). It is necessary to prioritize this disease as a line of research, in addition to articulating efforts between dental teams from different institutions.
CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: It is necessary to demonstrate the characteristics of scientific publications on monkeypox in dentistry worldwide in order to have a panoramic view of the dynamics of scientific articles in this area.","The authors wish to thank Universidad San Ignacio de Loyola, Lima, Peru.",Source of support: Nil Conflict of interest: None,The Journal of Contemporary Dental Practice,,,Humans; Mpox (monkeypox); Bibliometrics; Brazil; Dentistry; India,2023-02-07,2023,2023-02-07,2023-02-07,23,9,861-865,All OA; Gold,Article,"Mayta–Tovalino, Frank; Barja–Ore, John; Alvitez–Temoche, Daniel; Mendoza, Roman; Mauricio–Vilchez, Cesar; Munive–Degregori, Arnaldo; Mauricio, Franco","Mayta–Tovalino, Frank (Vicerrectorado de Investigación, Universidad San Ignacio de Loyola, Lima, Peru); Barja–Ore, John (Research Direction, Universidad Privada del Norte, Lima, Peru); Alvitez–Temoche, Daniel (Postgraduate Department, Faculty of Dentistry, Universidad Nacional Federico Villarreal, Lima, Peru); Mendoza, Roman (Postgraduate Department, Faculty of Dentistry, Universidad Nacional Federico Villarreal, Lima, Peru); Mauricio–Vilchez, Cesar (Postgraduate Department, Faculty of Dentistry, Universidad Nacional Federico Villarreal, Lima, Peru); Munive–Degregori, Arnaldo (Academic Department, Faculty of Dentistry, Universidad Nacional Mayor de San Marcos, Lima, Peru); Mauricio, Franco (Postgraduate Department, Faculty of Dentistry, Universidad Nacional Federico Villarreal, Lima, Peru)","Mayta–Tovalino, Frank (Universidad San Ignacio de Loyola)","Mayta–Tovalino, Frank (Universidad San Ignacio de Loyola); Barja–Ore, John (Private University of the North); Alvitez–Temoche, Daniel (Federico Villarreal National University); Mendoza, Roman (Federico Villarreal National University); Mauricio–Vilchez, Cesar (Federico Villarreal National University); Munive–Degregori, Arnaldo (National University of San Marcos); Mauricio, Franco (Federico Villarreal National University)",1,1,,,https://doi.org/10.5005/jp-journals-10024-3406,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1155213688,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3203 Dentistry,

Our investigations employ the full-potential linearized augmented-plane-wave (FP-LAPW) method within the density functional theory (DFT) framework. The impact of varying vanadium composition (x = 0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1) on the structural, electronic, and optical characteristics of wurtzite VxAl1−xN alloys is examined in detail. Our findings reveal a distinct nonlinear relationship between the lattice constant, bulk modulus, and the concentration of vanadium (x) in the VxAl1−xN alloys. An analysis of the electronic band structures and densities of states reveals a metallic behavior in the VxAl1−xN alloys, primarily driven by the V-d states near the Fermi energy. These results shed light on the electronic properties of the alloys, contributing to a deeper understanding of their potential for various applications. Furthermore, we calculate various optical properties, including the real and imaginary dielectric functions, refractive index, energy loss spectrum, and reflectivity. The obtained optical functions provide valuable insights into the optical behavior of the VxAl1−xN alloys.

The decoding of brain movement commands in BCIs relies on signal feature extraction and classification. Herein, the BNCI Horizon 2020 dataset is employed, which consists of electroencephalographic signals from ten participants with subacute and chronic cervical spinal cord injuries. These participants perform or attempt five distinct types of arm and hand movements. To extract signal features, a novel technique is introduced that estimates movement‐related cortical potentials and incorporates them into the processing pipeline. Moreover, a time‐frequency domain representation of the dataset is used as input for the classifier. Given the promising outcomes demonstrated by deep learning models in BCI classification, a pretrained ConvNet AlexNet is adopted to decode the motor tasks. The proposed method exhibits a remarkable average accuracy of 76.0% across all five categories, representing a significant advancement over existing state‐of‐the‐art techniques. Additionally, an in‐depth analysis of the convolutional layers in the model is conducted to gain comprehensive insights into the classification process. By examining the ConvNet filters and activations, the method contributes to a deeper understanding of the electrophysiology that underlies attempted movement.",Acknowledgements This research was supported by the Dirección de Gestión y Desarrollo Académico from the Universidad del Norte through their Ph.D. scholarship program.

The attributes were identified based on studies of high-impact repositories. A hierarchy of the identified attributes was built through the multicriteria decision methods Fuzzy Cognitive Maps and DEMATEL. Additionally, a statistical analysis of clusters was developed to determine the most relevant attributes and apply these results in academic and industrial contexts. The main contribution of this study was the categorization of user-experience quality attributes in augmented reality applications, as well as the grouping proposal. Usability, Satisfaction, Stimulation, Engagement, and Aesthetics were found to be among the most relevant attributes. After carrying out the multivariate analysis, two clusters were found with the largest grouping of attributes, oriented to security, representation, social interaction, aesthetics, ergonomics of the application, and its relationship with the user’s emotions. In conclusion, the combination of the three methods helped to identify the importance of the attributes in training processes. The holistic and detailed vision of the causal, impact, and similarity relationships between the 87 attributes analyzed were also considered. This framework will allow the generation of a baseline for the use of multicriteria methods in research into relevant aspects of Augmented Reality.",The authors thank the universities involved in the project and the Institute of Robotics and Information and Communication Technologies—IRTIC—for allowing the articulation of an interdisciplinary team for the development of the research project.

Fronts thus form dynamical and ephemeral ecosystems where numerous species meet across all trophic levels. Fronts are also targeted by fisheries. Capturing ocean fronts and studying their long-term variability in relation with climate change is thus key for marine resource management and spatial planning. The Mediterranean Sea and the Southwest Indian Ocean are natural laboratories to study front-marine life interactions due to their energetic flow at sub-to-mesoscales, high biodiversity (including endemic and endangered species) and numerous conservation initiatives. Based on remotely-sensed Sea Surface Temperature and Height, we compute thermal fronts (2003–2020) and attracting Lagrangian coherent structures (1994–2020), in both regions over several decades. We advocate for the combined use of both thermal fronts and attracting Lagrangian coherent structures to study front-marine life interactions. The resulting front dataset differs from other alternatives by its high spatio-temporal resolution, long time coverage, and relevant thresholds defined for ecological provinces.","This work was supported by the Mediterranean Institute of Oceanography (MIO) and the French National Institute for Sustainable Development (IRD).

This is achieved by dwelling on the idea of adapting the notion of purity in the case of a thermal Gibbs environment, yielding what we might call the ""purity"" indicator (which we denote by the symbol D in the text). We find it interesting to define an extension of this D-IM indicator in a classical context. This generalization turns out to have useful conceptual consequences when used in conjunction with the classical Shannon entropy S.

This article reviews neural correlates of dyslexia from both electrophysiological and neuroimaging studies. Method : In this brief review, we provide electrophysiological and neuroimaging evidence from electroencephalogram (EEG) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies in dyslexia to understand functional and structural brain changes in this condition. Results: In both electrophysiological and neuroimaging studies, the most frequently reported functional impairments in dyslexia include aberrant activation of the left hemisphere occipito-temporal cortex (OTC), temporo-parietal cortex (TPC), inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), and cerebellar areas. EEG studies have mostly highlighted the important role of lower frequency bands in dyslexia, especially theta waves. Furthermore, neuroimaging studies have suggested that dyslexia is related to functional and structural impairments in the left hemisphere regions associated with reading and language, including reduced grey matter volume in the left TPC, decreased white matter connectivity between reading networks, and hypo-activation of the left OTC and TPC. In addition, neural evidence from pre-reading children and infants at risk for dyslexia show that there are abnormalities in the dyslexic brain before learning to read begins. Conclusion: Advances in comprehending the neural correlates of dyslexia could bring closer translation from basic to clinical neuroscience and effective rehabilitation for individuals who struggle to read. However, neuroscience still has great potential for clinical translation that requires further research.",The authors thank the institutions where they work for encouraging the development of research.,,Iranian Journal of Psychiatry,,,,2023-09-18,2023,2023-09-18,2023-10,18,4,503-509,All OA; Gold,Article,"Hernández-Vásquez, Ronald; García, Ulises Córdova; Barreto, Ana Maritza Boy; Rojas, Milagritos Leonor Rodriguez; Ponce-Meza, Jacqueline; Saavedra-López, Miguel","Hernández-Vásquez, Ronald (Universidad Privada Norbert Wiener, Lima, Perú.); García, Ulises Córdova (Universidad César Vallejo, Lima, Perú.); Barreto, Ana Maritza Boy (Universidad César Vallejo, Lima, Perú.); Rojas, Milagritos Leonor Rodriguez (Universidad César Vallejo, Lima, Perú.); Ponce-Meza, Jacqueline (Universidad Privada del Norte, Lima, Perú.); Saavedra-López, Miguel (Universidad Continental, Cusco, Perú.)","Hernández-Vásquez, Ronald (Universidad Norbert Wiener)","Hernández-Vásquez, Ronald (Universidad Norbert Wiener); García, Ulises Córdova (Universidad César Vallejo); Barreto, Ana Maritza Boy (Universidad César Vallejo); Rojas, Milagritos Leonor Rodriguez (Universidad César Vallejo); Ponce-Meza, Jacqueline (Private University of the North); Saavedra-López, Miguel (Universidad Continental)",1,1,,,https://doi.org/10.18502/ijps.v18i4.13638,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1164390370,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 52 Psychology; 5202 Biological Psychology; 5204 Cognitive and Computational Psychology,

Métodos: Se realizó un estudio cualitativo con un enfoque hermenéutico interpretativo, utilizando como técnica de investigación la entrevista semiestructurada, las cuales fueron aplicadas en el Área Metropolitana del Valle de Aburrá, Bogotá D.C. y el Eje Cafetero colombiano, a través de un sistema de muestreo por conveniencia. Resultados: Se realizaron 55 entrevistas en dichas regiones. El 60% de los entrevistados eran hombres cisgénero, 31% mujeres cisgénero y 9% mujeres transgénero. La edad promedio de los participantes fue de 27 años. Se observó que el uso de sustancias psicoactivas en las y los trabajadores sexuales depende de factores de tipo personal y contextual. Los primeros se relacionan con estrategias de afrontamiento frente al estrés y la ansiedad durante el ejercicio del trabajo sexual, así como al uso lúdico y recreativo de estas sustancias, mientras que los factores contextuales están vinculados con el uso compartido SPA con los clientes y el aumento del rendimiento sexual durante el ejercicio del sexo transaccional. Conclusiones: El consumo de sustancias psicoactivas durante el ejercicio del trabajo sexual es multicausal, y, por lo tanto, es fundamental abordar este asunto de forma integral, considerando la interrelación entre el sujeto, la sustancia que se consume y los contextos sociales y sexuales donde se emplea, permitiendo definir las estrategias más pertinentes y apropiadas para disminuir los impactos sobre la salud de los implicados.",,,Salud Uninorte,,,,2023-09-22,2023,2023-09-22,2023-09-22,39,2,392-404,All OA; Gold,Article,"Restrepo Pineda, Jair Eduardo; Villegas Rojas, Soraya","Restrepo Pineda, Jair Eduardo (); Villegas Rojas, Soraya ()",,"Restrepo Pineda, Jair Eduardo (); Villegas Rojas, Soraya ()",1,1,,,https://rcientificas.uninorte.edu.co/index.php/salud/article/download/14791/214421446766/214421468696,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1164328127,,

Measuring the life expectancy of Portuguese telecommunications companies using generalized log-gamma (GLG) distribution is a new research endeavor. Regarding the new theoretical contributions, original expressions for the moments and mode of the GLG distribution are presented. In this empirical study, data on the entrepreneurial fabric in the Information and Communication sector from 2004 to 2018, when some companies were born or died, were used. In addition to the GLG, three other statistical distributions with two parameters are analyzed: gamma, Weibull, and log-normal. Maximum likelihood parameters and confidence intervals for survival probabilities are estimated and compared. The Akaike information criterion is used to compare the performance of the four estimated models. The results show that GLG distribution is a promising solution to assess the resilience and longevity of a firm.","This work is partially financed by national funds through FCT—Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia under the project UIDB/00006/2020.

The strategy used was to incorporate the source term into the flux function to rewrite the law of balance in a conservative form, in terms of global equilibrium variables that remained constant in space and time under steady states. Subsequently, the conservative variables were recalculated using the equilibrium variables. Recently, this concept was applied to shallow water and the Euler equations of gas dynamics. Numerical tests verified the well-balanced property of the designed scheme and its ability to capture small steady-state perturbations on relatively coarse meshes accurately.","Declaration of Competing Interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

However, the impact of these types of interventions in intermediate levels of proficiency has yet to be conclusive when measured using speech rate as a dependent variable, e.g., word correct per minute. We studied how a listener's comprehension and intelligibility might change when read aloud protocols are used to enhance fluency. To do so, we used a data set that did not present increasing rates in speech rate after 11 weeks of practice (as reported in Rodríguez-Fuentes et al., 2023). We asked a group of independent raters to rank each participant's three (first, middle, and last) performances to assess if they could find differences in the performances over time. Seventy-nine percent of the raters perceived that the third performances were the best of each set they were provided, and that the second performances were better than the first. There was a consistent positive progression in perceived fluency. Also, a qualitative analysis of students' reflections showed significant gains from using read aloud protocols (RAPs) and increased awareness of key areas of fluency development, such as intonation, speech flow (vs. word-by-word reading), and self-confidence, among others.",Declaration of competing interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.,"This research received no specific grant from any funding agency, commercial or not-for-profit sectors.",Ampersand,,,,2023-12,2023,,2023-12,11,,100133,All OA; Gold,Article,"Rodríguez-Fuentes, Rodrigo A.; Calle-Díaz, Luzkarime","Rodríguez-Fuentes, Rodrigo A.

From the beginning, risk factors for the severity and mortality of the disease were considered, as the spread of the virus was related to the living conditions of each population.MethodsIn this ecological study we have evaluated the role of geography, precisely the altitude above sea level in the incidence and mortality of COVID-19 in Peru. Incidence and mortality data were taken from the open-access database of the government of Peru until March 2021. COVID-19 cases and COVID-19 mortality were treated as cases/density population and 1000 x cases/inhabitants while altitude was treated as continuous and as a categorical variable divided in 7 categories. The relationship between COVID-19 cases or deaths for COVID-19 and altitude as continuous variable was determined using Spearman correlation test. Meanwhile when altitude was considered as a categorical variable, Poisson regression or negative binomial analyses were applied.ResultsA significant inverse correlation was found between COVID-19 cases by population density and altitude (r=-0.37 p < 0.001). By altitude categories, the lowest risk for infection was observed between 3,000 and 3,500 m (IRR 0.08; 95% CI 0.05,0.12). Moreover, we found an inverse correlation between altitude and COVID-19 mortality (r=-0.39 p < 0.001). Also, the lowest risk for mortality was observed between 3,000 and 3,500 m (IRR 0.12; 95%CI 0.08; 0.18). Similar results were found when analyses were adjusted for inhabitants and stratified by sex.ConclusionThis study reports an inverse relationship between COVID-19 incidence and mortality with respect to the altitude of residence, particularly, a u-shaped protection is shown, with a highest benefit between 3000 and 3500 m. The possibility of using hypoxia as an alternative treatment requires more complex studies that should allow knowing the physiological and environmental mechanisms of the protective role.",We want to thank Dr. Christopher Curtis for his revision and proofreading of the language.,"P.G-M received funding from CIBERobn CB12/03/30002 (Physiopathology of Obesity and Nutrition), Spain.

Three groups of children were selected: ADHD (n = 42), high-performance (n = 20), and normo- typical development (n = 28). A brief computerized vigilance task (CSAT-R) was applied to compare attentional capacity and reaction time. The participants were divided into those with “attentional dysfunction” and those with “normal attention” to analyze clinical validity. Children with high-performance were clearly differentiated from the other two groups, with large effect sizes. The differences between normo-typical and ADHD groups were only significant in the errors and in a nonparametric index of attentional capacity, but with small effect sizes. The CSAT-R showed good specificity and an acceptable positive predictive value, but low levels of sensitivity, and a poor negative predictive value. Therefore, sustained attention could be a prominent mechanism in children with high capacities. The CSAT-R (and probably most of attentional tasks) would be moderately useful in community settings for ADHD diagnosis, but not to rule it out.",,,Anales de Psicología,,,,2023-04-27,2023,2023-04-27,,39,2,223-230,All OA; Gold,Article,"Servera, Mateu; Sáez, Belén; Rodríguez, Tania Iglesias","Servera, Mateu (Department of Psychology, Research Institute of Health Sciences, University of the Balearic Islands); Sáez, Belén (Department of Psychology, Research Institute of Health Sciences, University of the Balearic Islands, Palma (Spain).

The antibiotic susceptibility patterns of these bacterial isolates play a critical role in guiding effective treatment strategies We aimed to determine the most common bacterial agents causing diabetic foot infections in a tertiary-care hospital in Peru.
Methods: Clinical and microbiological data were collected from 181 patients diagnosed with diabetic foot infections and positive microbiological culture results. All the samples were analyzed with the Vitek 2 compact system and the cut-off points were defined with the CLSI M100 guide. The data were segregated based on mono-microbial or poly-microbial cultures, bacterial types, and antibiotic susceptibility profiles.
Results: A total of 32 bacterial species were identified, predominantly Gram-negative (63%). The most frequent bacterial agents isolated were Staphylococcus aureus (19.9%), Escherichia coli (12.2%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (8.3%), and Proteus vulgaris (6.6%). These bacteria commonly exhibited resistance to Ampicillin, Ciprofloxacin, Levofloxacin, Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and Cefuroxime. E. coli showed the highest antibiotic resistance (19 antibiotics), while Gentamicin, Tobramycin, and Levofloxacin demonstrated the highest sensitivity against the most prevalent bacteria. Gram-negative bacteria also exhibited notable antibiotic-susceptibility to Meropenem, Piperacillin/tazobactam, and Amikacin. Regarding the presence of Extended-Spectrum Beta-Lactamase, 54 isolates tested positive, with 35 (64.8%) and 14 (42.4%) of these being S. aureus and E. coli.
Conclusions: Bacterial agents causing diabetic foot infections pose a constant concern, particularly due to the increasing antibiotic resistance observed. This difficulty in treating the condition contributes to a higher risk of amputation and mortality. Further research on bacterial susceptibility is necessary to determine appropriate dosages for pharmacological treatment and to prevent the overuse of antibiotics.",,"The author(s) declare that no financial support was received for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.",Frontiers in Endocrinology,,,"Humans; Diabetic Foot; Cross-Sectional Studies; Peru; Staphylococcus aureus; Escherichia coli; Levofloxacin; Microbial Sensitivity Tests; Anti-Bacterial Agents; Bacteria; Staphylococcal Infections; Drug Resistance, Microbial; Diabetes Mellitus",2023-12-05,2023,2023-12-05,,14,,1267699,All OA; Gold,Article,"Moya-Salazar, Jeel; Chamana, Jackelina M.; Porras-Rivera, Daniela; Goicochea-Palomino, Eliane A.; Salazar, Carmen R.; Contreras-Pulache, Hans","Moya-Salazar, Jeel (Faculties of Health Science, Universidad Privada del Norte, Lima, Peru); Chamana, Jackelina M.

A rheological analysis was performed to understand the effect of sodium metasilicate on the flow curves of concentrated pulps. The study was carried out in an Anton Paar MCR 102 rheometer, showing that, in a wide range of dosages, the reagent can reduce the yield stress of the slurries, which would result in lower energy costs for transporting the pulps by pumping. To understand the behavior observed experimentally, computational simulation has been used by means of quantum calculations to represent the metasilicate molecule and the molecular dynamics to study the adsorption of metasilicate on the hematite surface. It has been possible to obtain that the adsorption is stable on the surface of hematite, where increasing the concentration of metasilicate increases its adsorption on the surface. The adsorption could be modeled by the Slips model where there is a delay in adsorption at low concentrations and then a saturated value is reached. It was found that metasilicate requires the presence of sodium ions to be adsorbed on the surface by means of a cation bridge-type interaction. It is also possible to identify that it is absorbed by means of hydrogen bridges, but to a lesser extent than the cation bridge. Finally, it is observed that the presence of metasilicate adsorbed on the surface modifies the net surface charge, increasing it and, thus, generating the effect of dispersion of hematite particles which experimentally is observed as a decrease in rheology.",Gonzalo R.

Insufficient awareness of stance, cultural attitudes about it, and poor teaching have been identified as underlying sources of stance-related difficulties. Focusing on stance may thus be a pivotal reading-to-write lens to improve English academic literacy. However, few studies have investigated pre-service teachers’ language awareness and ideologies about different stance markers. The goal of this paper is to describe the stance-focused conceptions and ideologies of a group of sixteen Mexican undergraduate pre-service teachers of English as a Foreign Language (EFL) who are also EFL learners. We used phenomenographic interviews and analysis to achieve this goal. We found three types of conceptions: stylistic, critical, and metaideological. The less sophisticated stylistic conceptions are most prevalent. Only two participants showed metaideological conceptions. Two language ideologies were found: an ideology of linguistic objectivity that dismisses all stance markers and another that values affect markers but dismisses first-person ones. These results imply that pre-service teachers should be made aware of the argumentative and epistemic functions of stance markers and diverse language ideologies about them that circulate across national and disciplinary contexts. In this way, they may deploy stance more effectively in their own literacy practices and become more effective EAP teachers.",,,Indonesian Journal of Applied Linguistics,,,,2023-01-31,2023,2023-01-31,,12,3,706-718,All OA; Gold,Article,"Perales-Escudero, Moises Damian; Cruz, Rosa Isela Sandoval; Faz, Gerardo Bañalez","Perales-Escudero, Moises Damian (Universidad Autónoma del Estado de Quintana Roo); Cruz, Rosa Isela Sandoval (Universidad Autónoma del Estado de Quintana Roo); Faz, Gerardo Bañalez (Universidad Andrés Bello)",,"Perales-Escudero, Moises Damian (Universidad Autónoma del Estado de Quintana Roo); Cruz, Rosa Isela Sandoval (Universidad Autónoma del Estado de Quintana Roo); Faz, Gerardo Bañalez (Andrés Bello National University)",1,1,,,https://ejournal.upi.edu/index.php/IJAL/article/download/45552/22043,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1156232376,"39 Education; 3901 Curriculum and Pedagogy; 47 Language, Communication and Culture; 4703 Language Studies; 4704 Linguistics",4 Quality Education

Structural and numerical alterations in centrosomes are hallmarks of neoplastic cells and contribute to tumorigenesis. We show that a Centrosome Amplification 20 (CA20) gene signature is associated with high expression of the Tripartite Motif (TRIM) family member E3 ubiquitin ligase, TRIM69. TRIM69-ablation in cancer cells leads to centrosome scattering and chromosome segregation defects. We identify Serine/threonine-protein kinase 3 (MST2) as a new direct binding partner of TRIM69. TRIM69 redistributes MST2 to the perinuclear cytoskeleton, promotes its association with Polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1) and stimulates MST2 phosphorylation at S15 (a known PLK1 phosphorylation site that is critical for centrosome disjunction). TRIM69 also promotes microtubule bundling and centrosome segregation that requires PRC1 and DYNEIN.

However, there are controversies regarding the role of fruit consumption in mitigating this disease. The objective of the present study was to analyze the association between fruit intake and body mass index (BMI) and waist circumference (WC) in a representative sample of Peruvians. This is an analytical cross-sectional study. Secondary data analysis was conducted using information from the Demographic and Health Survey of Peru (2019-2021). The outcome variables were BMI and WC. The exploratory variable was fruit intake, which was expressed in three different presentations: portion, salad, and juice. A generalized linear model of the Gaussian family and identity link function were performed to obtain the crude and adjusted beta coefficients. A total of 98,741 subjects were included in the study. Females comprised 54.4% of the sample. In the multivariate analysis, for each serving of fruit intake, the BMI decreased by 0.15 kg/m2 (β = -0.15; 95% CI -0.24 to -0.07), while the WC was reduced by 0.40 cm (β = -0.40; 95% CI -0.52 to -0.27). A negative association between fruit salad intake and WC was found (β = -0.28; 95% CI -0.56 to -0.01). No statistically significant association between fruit salad intake and BMI was found. In the case of fruit juice, for each glass of juice consumed, the BMI increased by 0.27 kg/m2 (β = 0.27; 95% CI 0.14 to 0.40), while the WC increased by 0.40 cm (β = 0.40; 95% CI 0.20 to 0.60). Fruit intake per serving is negatively related to general body adiposity and central fat distribution, while fruit salad intake is negatively related to central distribution adiposity. However, the consumption of fruit in the form of juices is positively associated with a significant increase in BMI and WC.",,This research received no external funding.,Nutrients,,,"Female; Humans; Male; Adiposity; Cross-Sectional Studies; Peru; Fruit; Obesity; Body Mass Index; Waist Circumference; Obesity, Abdominal",2023-02-27,2023,2023-02-27,,15,5,1183,All OA; Gold,Article,"Valencia, Jamee Guerra; Ramos, Willy; Cruz-Ausejo, Liliana; Torres-Malca, Jenny Raquel; Loayza-Castro, Joan A.; Zeñas-Trujillo, Gianella Zulema; Ponce, Norka Rocío Guillen; Zuzunaga-Montoya, Fiorella E.; Valladares-Garrido, Mario J.; Vera-Ponce, Víctor Juan; De La Cruz-Vargas, Jhony A.","Valencia, Jamee Guerra (Instituto de Investigaciones en Ciencias Biomédicas (INICIB), Universidad Ricardo Palma, Lima 15039, Peru; Facultad de Ciencias de la Salud, Universidad Privada del Norte, Lima 15314, Peru); Ramos, Willy (Instituto de Investigaciones en Ciencias Biomédicas (INICIB), Universidad Ricardo Palma, Lima 15039, Peru; Instituto de Investigaciones Clínicas, Universidad Nacional Mayor de San Marcos, Lima 15001, Peru); Cruz-Ausejo, Liliana (Instituto de Investigaciones en Ciencias Biomédicas (INICIB), Universidad Ricardo Palma, Lima 15039, Peru); Torres-Malca, Jenny Raquel (Instituto de Investigaciones en Ciencias Biomédicas (INICIB), Universidad Ricardo Palma, Lima 15039, Peru); Loayza-Castro, Joan A.

Likewise, we can recognize and broaden the knowledge about the dimensions of the peasant life that is born near the paramo and how the communities are related to it through the occupation of making baskets. Based on ethnographic theories, the practice of making baskets is presented herein as an ecologic intertwining, a symmetric involvement between humans and things, that results from a cognitive, embodied and situated phenomenon. Objects like the baskets that are born in rural contexts materialize the relational complexity of the human technical activities and reshape spatialities allowing us to ask some question about the limits of the human, our relationships to the nature and how other species are constituent elements to us. Objects born in the countryside are an overlapping of spatial attributes allowing us to understand these sorts of materialities that have advanced some way to be recognized as handicrafts. However, before reaching such definition, they have a place and a frame of specific relationships to living elements, to the nature and to some technologies that flow through the body and the act of dwelling.",,,Cuadernos de Música Artes Visuales y Artes Escénicas,,,,2023-01-01,2023,2023-01-01,,18,1,48-67,All OA; Gold,Article,"Barajas, Carol Andrea Ruiz","Barajas, Carol Andrea Ruiz (Universidad Pedagógica y Tecnológica de Colombia)",,"Barajas, Carol Andrea Ruiz (Pedagogical and Technological University of Colombia)",1,1,,,https://revistas.javeriana.edu.co/index.php/cma/article/download/36736/ruizbarajas,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1154689058,44 Human Society; 4406 Human Geography,

When people who migrate come into contact with a new culture, they are immersed in a process called acculturation. In this process, people oscillate between maintaining their own culture or acquiring the culture and customs of the host country, resulting in the so-called acculturation strategies. According to Berry’s proposal, there are four main acculturation strategies: assimilation, integration, marginalization and separation. The few existing studies of Latinos in an Anglo-Saxon country relate the use of the integration strategy (biculturalism) with lower cortisol levels. No studies have been found on the subject in Latino migrants in a Latino country.Methoda cross-sectional design was used to analyze the relationship between acculturation strategies and blood cortisol levels, based on the hypothesis that an integration strategy or biculturalism would be linked to lower cortisol levels. The study involved 314 Colombian migrants in Chile, who were evaluated with a scale of acculturation strategies according to the model proposed by Berry, in addition to providing blood samples to analyze cortisol levels.Resultsmigrants who show a preference for leave behind the culture of the country of origin have higher levels of cortisol ng/ml in blood. According to multiple comparisons the mean cortisol value was significantly different between integrated and assimilated subjects, with the mean cortisol of the integrated being significantly lower than that of the subjects typed as marginalized.ConclusionThe patterns of the relationship between biculturalism and cortisol found in Latino migrants in Anglo-Saxon countries are repeated in Latino migrants in a Latino country.

The synthesized compound was characterized by UV-Visible, FT-IR, HRMS, 1H NMR, and 13C NMR spectroscopic studies and X-ray crystallography, revealing that the crystal belongs to a triclinic crystal system with a P1̄ space group, Z = 2. In the present work, we focus on molecular modeling studies such as Hirshfeld surface analysis, energy framework calculations, frontier molecular orbital analysis, natural bond orbital analysis, and NLO properties of a π-conjugate system combining the chalcone and the pyrazole[3,4-b]pyridine scaffolds to describe the in-depth structural analysis thereof. Good agreement was found between the calculated results and experimental data. In addition, Hirshfeld surface analysis of the crystal structure showed that the intermolecular stabilization in the crystal packing comes mainly from H⋯H bond interactions. The chalcone crystal exhibits significant NLO properties suggesting that it could be considered a potential candidate for application in nonlinear optical devices.","A FONDECYT project number 1200531 supported this research.

In early 2020, the spread of the virus left its mark on every affected country, impacting mental health by limiting daily activities and causing fatalities amidst public health strategies to mitigate its impact. The influence of COVID-19 on the quality of life (QoL) may vary between countries, underscoring the need to examine its effects on individuals and families during the mandatory home quarantine. We aimed to assess the QoL of individuals and families during home isolation by COVID-19 lockdown.
Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted from February to May 2020. We included adult partners (≥18 years) of families from Brazil, Colombia, Spain, Japan, Peru, Russia, and Venezuela. Using the 26-item World Health Organization Quality of Life Brief (WHOQOL-BREF) questionnaire we assess the impact of COVID-19 on their partner/family member's QoL.
Results: The survey was completed by 466 participants (mean age = 38.59 ± 13.75 years; females = 298) and 76% worked mostly as health professionals from South America (69.2%), Europe (18.4%), and Asia (12.4%). The WHOQOL-BREF mean score from 38.38 ± 11.55 (range = 22.8-43.4). The average quality of life in South America (41.9 ± 1.2) was significantly higher than that of European countries (30.9 ± 11.5) (p = 0.002). The social relations dimension was the only one with values close to 100 (mean = 83.3) in 6/7 evaluated countries, where only Spain had a low score (41 ± 33.12). Women had a slightly lower quality of life than men, but it was not significant (40.2 ± 8.8 vs. 41.5 ± 9.9, p = 0.354), while we found differences in the overall QoL between young and older, and by employment type (p < 0.05). According to family structure, we found differences on QoL between nuclear and siblings' families (p = 0.024).
Conclusion: Families from seven countries of three continents reported poor QoL during the first outbreak of COVID-19. The pandemic scenario has dramatically weakened the QoL in 3/4 dimensions, where social relationships have remained high. It is important to fully address the impact of this reduced QoL on families after several waves of infection and to provide comprehensive support in the post-COVID future.","The authors thank all participants and family members who participated in this study.

The present study in a coastal destination with cultural characteristics aims to (i) establish the dimensions of perceived value, (ii) determine the relationship between perceived value and satisfaction, and (iii) identify the relationship between perceived value and loyalty in variables such as return, recommendation, and word of mouth in a cultural coastal destination. This quantitative research used a sample of 384 valid questionnaires collected in Huanchaco, Peru, a city next to the Pacific Ocean, being a coastal destination with cultural potential. Factor analysis and multiple regression were applied for data analysis. The results show three dimensions of value perceived by tourists in coastal destinations: emotional and social value, economic value, and functional value. Of these, emotional and social value is the most salient predictor of tourist satisfaction and loyalty. These results will serve as management guides for cultural coastal destination managers and contribute to the academic literature.",,The authors received no specific funding for this work.,PLOS ONE,,Hironori Kato,Travel; Peru; Personal Satisfaction; Tourism; Emotions,2023-08-01,2023,2023-08-01,,18,8,e0286923,All OA; Gold,Article,"Regalado-Pezúa, Otto; Carvache-Franco, Mauricio; Carvache-Franco, Orly; Carvache-Franco, Wilmer","Regalado-Pezúa, Otto (ESAN Graduate School of Business, Universidad ESAN, Lima, Peru); Carvache-Franco, Mauricio (Universidad Espíritu Santo, Samborondón, Ecuador); Carvache-Franco, Orly (Facultad de Economía y Empresa, Universidad Católica de Santiago de Guayaquil, Guayaquil, Ecuador); Carvache-Franco, Wilmer (Facultad de Ciencias Sociales y Humanísticas, Escuela Superior Politécnica del Litoral, ESPOL, Guayaquil, Ecuador)","Carvache-Franco, Wilmer (Escuela Superior Politecnica del Litoral)","Regalado-Pezúa, Otto (Esan University); Carvache-Franco, Mauricio (Universidad de Especialidades Espíritu Santo); Carvache-Franco, Orly (Catholic University of Santiago de Guayaquil); Carvache-Franco, Wilmer (Escuela Superior Politecnica del Litoral)",1,1,,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0286923&type=printable,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1162924311,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3504 Commercial Services; 3506 Marketing; 3508 Tourism",

The molecular mechanisms underlying FASD are incompletely characterized. Alternative splicing, including the insertion of microexons (exons of less than 30 nucleotides in length), is highly prevalent in the nervous system. However, whether ethanol exposure can have acute or chronic deleterious effects in this process is poorly understood. In this work, we used the bioinformatic tools VAST-TOOLS, rMATS, MAJIQ, and MicroExonator to predict alternative splicing events affected by ethanol from available RNA sequencing data. Experimental protocols of ethanol exposure included human cortical tissue development, human embryoid body differentiation, and mouse development. We found common genes with predicted differential alternative splicing using distinct bioinformatic tools in different experimental designs. Notably, Gene Ontology and KEGG analysis revealed that the alternative splicing of genes related to RNA processing and protein synthesis was commonly affected in the different ethanol exposure schemes. In addition, the inclusion of microexons was also affected by ethanol. This bioinformatic analysis provides a reliable list of candidate genes whose splicing is affected by ethanol during nervous system development. Furthermore, our results suggest that ethanol particularly modifies the alternative splicing of genes related to post-transcriptional regulation, which probably affects neuronal proteome complexity and brain function.",We thank Dr. Guillermo Parada and Dr. Manuel Irimia for critical discussions of the project.,"ANID Doctoral Fellowship number 21200775 (CFB) Fondo Postdoctorado Universidad Católica del Norte Nº 0003 (MOC) Grant FONDECYT 1191152 (MEA) PEW Biomed Innovation-2021-A-18047 (PH) Agencia Nacional de Investigación y Desarrollo (ANID) – Millennium Science Initiative Program NCN19_168, Grant FONDECYT 1231357, Fondequip EQM160063 (GR) Grant FONDECYT 1231685 (CO) UNAB DI-03-22/REG (FF).

Upon complete characterization, the virus is shown to belong to the Drexlerviridae family and is a member of the Webervirus genus located within the (formerly) T1-like cluster of phages. Its double-stranded (dsDNA) genome is 47,844 bp long and is predicted to have 74 protein-coding sequences (CDS). After challenging a variety of K. pneumoniae strains with phage KL-2146, grown on the NDM-1 positive strain BAA-2146, polyvalence was shown for a single antibiotic-sensitive strain, K. pneumoniae 13,883, with a very low initial infection efficiency in liquid culture. However, after one or more cycles of infection in K. pneumoniae 13,883, nearly 100% infection efficiency was achieved, while infection efficiency toward its original host, K. pneumoniae BAA-2146, was decreased. This change in host specificity is reversible upon re-infection of the NDM-1 positive strain (BAA-2146) using phages grown on the NDM-1 negative strain (13883). In biofilm infectivity experiments, the polyvalent nature of KL-2146 was demonstrated with the killing of both the multidrug-resistant K. pneumoniae BAA-2146 and drug-sensitive 13,883 in a multi-strain biofilm. The ability to infect an alternate, antibiotic-sensitive strain makes KL-2146 a useful model for studying phages infecting the NDM-1+ strain, K. pneumoniae BAA-2146.

The development of genetic tools that can serve to monitor population's health non-intrusively and inform strategies for the recovery of these species is crucial. In this study, we formally evaluate whether whole mitochondrial genomes can be assembled from environmental DNA (eDNA) metagenomics scat samples. Mitogenomes of four different large vertebrates, the panda bear (Ailuropoda melanoleuca), the moon bear (Ursus thibetanus), the Java pangolin (Manis javanica), and the the North Atlantic right whale (Eubalaena glacialis) were assembled and circularized using the pipeline GetOrganelle with a coverage ranging from 12x to 480x in 14 out of 18 different eDNA samples. Partial mitochondrial genomes were retrieved from three other eDNA samples. The complete mitochondrial genomes of the studied species were AT-rich and comprised 13 protein coding genes, 22 transfer RNA genes, two ribosomal RNA genes, and a putative D-loop/control region. Synteny observed in all assembled mitogenomes was identical to that reported for specimens of the same and other closely related species. This study demonstrates that it is possible to assemble accurate whole mitochondrial chromosomes from eDNA samples (scats) using forthright bench and bioinformatics workflows. The retrieval of mitochondrial genomes from eDNA samples represents a tool to support bioprospecting, bio-monitoring, and other non-intrusive conservation strategies in species considered 'vulnerable', 'endangered', and/or 'critically endangered' by the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species.",Many thanks to Vincent P.

coincide with a strong mean sea level variation, as observed from 27 years
of absolute dynamic topography (ADT) and the use of self-organizing maps.
From January to April, a cyclonic gyre with a strong southwestward Panama
Jet Surface Current (PJSC) dominates the basin circulation, forced by the
Panama surface wind jet that also produces upwelling, reducing sea surface
temperature (SST), increasing sea surface salinity (SSS) and causing an ADT
decrease. From June to December, the Choco surface wind jet enhances SST,
precipitation and river runoff, which reduces SSS, causing an ADT rise, which in turn forces a weak circulation in the bight, vanishing the PJSC. Interannual
variability in the region is strongly affected by El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO); however this
climatic variability does not modify the seasonal circulation patterns in
the Panama Bight. In contrast, the positive (negative) ENSO phase increases
(decreases) SST and ADT in the Panama Bight, with a mean annual difference
of 0.9 ∘C and 9.6 cm, respectively, between the two conditions,
while its effect on SSS is small. However, as the strong seasonal SST, SSS
and ADT ranges are up to 2.2 ∘C, 2.59 g kg−1 and 28.3 cm,
the seasonal signal dominates over interannual variations in the bight.","The present research was carried out in the framework of the AEI accreditation “Maria de Maeztu Centre of Excellence” given to IMEDEA (CSIC-UIB) (CEX2021-001198).

Clarke plant to treat wounds, pain, and malaria. Aim of the study: The crude extract and solvent fractions of C. latifolia Hochst. ex C.B. Clarke leaves were examined in the present investigation to determine their ability to have an antiinflammatory effect and provide an antinociceptive effect in animal models. Materials and methods: The leaves of C. latifolia were extracted with 80% methanol, and the CL crude extract was further fractionated with chloroform, pure methanol, and distilled water. The carrageenan-induced paw edema model was used to test the extracts' ability to reduce inflammation. The hotplate model and the acetic acid-induced writhing test on rodents were used to test the extracts' potential antinociceptive effect to reduce pain. Results: Inflammation was decreased by 64.59% with CL crude extract (400 mg/kg); 56.34% (400 mg/kg) of methanol fraction, 64.59% of aqueous fraction (400 mg/kg), and 38.27% of chloroform fraction in the carrageenan-induced inflammatory model. All extracts demonstrated a considerable lengthening of the nociception reaction time in the hot plate test, with a maximum antinociceptive effect of 78.98% (crude extract) and 71.65% (solvent fractions). At a dosage of 400 mg/kg, the natural C. latifolia crude extract and aqueous fraction demonstrated considerable antinociceptive effects against acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) during the writhing test (48.83% and 45.37than%, respectively).

One device that converts thermal energy into electrical power is a thermoelectric generator (TEG). TEGs are available as modules of various sizes and voltage levels. This paper is about the design of a battery charging system powered by a TEG panel. The TEG panel is implemented using 150 TEG modules interconnected in series and parallel. Its power is transferred to a battery using two stages of DC/DC converters. The 1 st stage is a Lou converter that is used for maximum power point tracking (MPPT) by a referenced perturb and observe (referenced P&O) algorithm. The 2 nd stage is a bidirectional converter based on buck-boost modes of operation. The system is used to charge a 9 V 1.2 Ah battery. The proposed MPPT algorithm’s performance is compared with a traditional P&O algorithm. The TEG panel provided 27.5 W at a Δ T of 30 0 C. The designed system is simulated in MATLAB SIMULINK.,,,Journal of Electrical Engineering,,,,2023-10-01,2023,2023-10-21,2023-10-01,74,5,357-364,All OA; Gold,Article,"Mohammed, Mustafa F.; Qasim, Mohammed A.","Mohammed, Mustafa F.

This bibliometric analysis of 196 articles in 37 journals, mostly written in Spanish, identified the main publications on communication that contributed to understanding migration. Results of this literature review show that those working in the media attribute the failures of their craft to the lack of training and ethical manuals, indicating that the quality of media products on migration tends to be poor, and that the literature on audiences documents the effects of the media and the perception of migration audiences. These findings suggest an academic bias on Latin American migration phenomena from intersectional perspectives, a lack of ethnographic approaches to media creation processes, that research on products is repetitive, and that although studies on European audiences are plentiful, those on migrant audiences are scarce.

The methodology is applied to four colonial shipwrecks located in Cartagena de Indias Bay (Colombia), two of them in the Inner Bay and two in the Bocachica sector. Five criteria are used and scored from 1 (indicating a low risk for the wreck) to 5 (high risk). The sum of the scores obtained at each criterion ranges from 5 to 25, and when the value obtained is higher than 15, management action is required. Five criteria were analyzed; (i) The historical criterion is based on the antiquity of the wreck. The ones investigated in this paper are associated with the Battle of Cartagena de Indias (A.D. 1741), having been submerged for ~280 years (all wrecks obtained a score of 3); (ii) The geographical criterion concerns the depth at which the wreck is located, which determines its accessibility. In Cartagena Bay, wrecks are situated at a water depth between 15.6 and 29.7 m (all wrecks were scored 4); (iii) The shipwreck condition criterion indicates the level of preservation, including organic and inorganic material, distinguishing among wooden hulls, ballast stones, and cannons. Obtained scores were 4 and 3 for the wrecks, respectively, located in the Inner Bay and in the Bocachica sector. (iv) The oceanographic criterion, linked to chemical and biological conditions of the water column, influences wreck conservation. All wrecks investigated scored 5. (v) The socioeconomic criterion indicates the multiple maritime and cultural activities presently taking place that might affect the wreck. In Cartagena Bay, all wrecks were scored 4. According to the total score obtained (20—Inner Bay and 19—Bocachica sector), guidelines for shipwreck conservation of cultural heritage in Cartagena Bay are proposed.","The authors especially thank the former ex-director of DIMAR, Vice Admiral José Joaquín Amézquita García, and the former ex-director of the Center for Oceanographic and Hydrographic Research, CN German Escobar.

Thus, the literature has highlighted both the benefits derived from the Third University Mission, the difficulties inherent in the process and the existence of various barriers that can hinder its consolidation in the academic environment. Within the framework of these studies, it has been possible to identify three types of barriers to adopting the third mission: process, researcher, and ally or partner. It is worth mentioning that most of the research developed to date has focused on the study of the impact of the barriers on the development of the Third Mission but not on the analysis of the factors that can influence or attenuate the perception of these barriers. This is surprising if one considers that identifying these factors is relevant in designing strategies to promote the University’s Third Mission. Therefore, this article aims to identify the factors that influence or attenuate the researcher’s perception of different types of barriers to developing Third Mission activities. The study was based on data from a survey applied to a sample of academics categorized in the National System of Science, Technology and Innovation of Colombia and linked to 6 higher education institutions in the Colombian Caribbean region. Binary logistic regression models were established to analyze the data obtained. The results obtained suggest that, in addition to the researcher's previous experience in the external sector, their perception of the existence of processes or support services provided by the university for the promotion of relationships with actors in the socioeconomic environment is important to mitigate the barriers perceived during the development of Third Mission activities, especially when these activities are located in the support for the management and execution of technology transfer activities. In particular, it was found that as the academic's perception of the policies and procedures, support activities, and the university's technology transfer capacity improves, the barriers of both the researcher and those associated with the process are dissipated. This implies that universities should advance in the institutionalization of the third mission and in strengthening the functions of promotion, advice and support, as well as promotion structures and thus be able to mitigate the perceived barriers to the development of the University’s Third Mission.","The development of this research was carried out within the framework of a project financed by the Ministerio de Ciencia, Tecnología e Innovación (MINCIENCIAS) of Colombia through a Doctoral Scholarship.",No sources of funding for the research were obtained.,Journal of Innovation and Entrepreneurship,,,,2023-06-01,2023,2023-06-01,,12,1,36,All OA; Gold,Article,"Naranjo-Africano, Gloria; Vega-Jurado, Jaider; Manjarres-Henríquez, Liney","Naranjo-Africano, Gloria (Facultad de Ingenierías, Universidad Simón Bolívar, Cra 54#64-223, 0800, Barranquilla, Colombia); Vega-Jurado, Jaider (Escuela de Negocios-Universidad del Norte, K5 vía PtoColombia, 0800, Puerto Colombia, Colombia); Manjarres-Henríquez, Liney (Departamento de Ciencias Empresariales, Universidad de la Costa, Cl58#55, 0800, Barranquilla, Colombia)","Naranjo-Africano, Gloria (Universidad Simón Bolívar); Vega-Jurado, Jaider (Universidad del Norte); Manjarres-Henríquez, Liney (University of the Coast)","Naranjo-Africano, Gloria (Universidad Simón Bolívar); Vega-Jurado, Jaider (Universidad del Norte); Manjarres-Henríquez, Liney (University of the Coast)",1,1,,,https://innovation-entrepreneurship.springeropen.com/counter/pdf/10.1186/s13731-023-00300-4,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1158550899,39 Education; 3903 Education Systems,4 Quality Education

Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) and satellite radar signals provide observations beyond ground deformation, including how earthquake and tsunami processes affect variations in the ionosphere. Here, we study the Hunga Tonga Hunga Ha’apai (HTHH) volcanic eruption 2022 and its associated tsunami propagation with the analysis GNSS derived Total Electron Content (TEC), Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) Sentinel-1 data, complemented with tide gauge observations. We utilize GNSS sites data within a ~ 5000 km radius from the volcanic eruption for estimating the ionospheric perturbation as Vertical TEC. We give evidence on the detection of acoustic gravity, internal gravity, and atmospheric Lamb waves signatures in the TEC perturbation. In particular, the internal gravity waves that concentrated in the southwest of Tonga, directly correlates with the observed tsunami propagation direction as accounted by the tide gauge measurements. However, the acoustic gravity wave signature in the TEC is dominant in the north direction suggesting a surface deformation, which could be verified using Sentinel-1A SAR amplitude data. The analysis presented herein shows that within 5 h of the volcanic eruption, the central part of the HTHH island landscape disappeared with the biggest explosion. The unprecedented detail resolved by integrating satellite data yields previously unknown details of the deformation of the 2022 HTHH volcano eruption.","Mahesh N.

Electrocardiogram (ECG) analysis is critical in detecting heart diseases, as it captures the heart's electrical activities. For continuous monitoring, wearable electrocardiographic devices must ensure user comfort over extended periods, typically 24 to 48 h. These devices demand specialized algorithms with low computational complexity to accommodate memory and power consumption constraints. One of the most crucial aspects of ECG signals is accurately detecting heartbeat intervals, specifically the R peaks. In this study, we introduce a novel algorithm designed for wearable devices, offering two primary attributes: robustness against noise and low computational complexity. Our algorithm entails fitting a least-squares parabola to the ECG signal and adaptively shaping it as it sweeps through the signal. Notably, our proposed algorithm eliminates the need for band-pass filters, which can inadvertently smooth the R peaks, making them more challenging to identify. We compared the algorithm's performance using two extensive databases: the meta-database QT database and the BIH-MIT database. Importantly, our method does not necessitate the precise localization of the ECG signal's isoelectric line, contributing to its low computational complexity. In the analysis of the QT database, our algorithm demonstrated a substantial advantage over the classical Pan-Tompkins algorithm and maintained competitiveness with state-of-the-art approaches. In the case of the BIH-MIT database, the performance results were more conservative; they continued to underscore the real-world utility of our algorithm in clinical contexts.",,This research received no external funding.,Sensors,,,"Humans; Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted; Electrocardiography; Algorithms; Heart Diseases; Wearable Electronic Devices",2023-10-28,2023,2023-10-28,,23,21,8796,All OA; Gold,Article,"Félix, Ramón A.; Ochoa-Brust, Alberto; Mata-López, Walter; Martínez-Peláez, Rafael; Mena, Luis J.; Valdez-Velázquez, Laura L.","Félix, Ramón A.

1062,pub.1165213380,10.1109/access.2023.3327643,,,End-to-End Performance Evaluation of SLP Waveforms,"In this paper, we investigate the demodulation and decoding of the symbol-level precoded (SLP) signal using the conventional logarithmic likelihood ratio (LLR) and low-density parity check (LDPC) decoding algorithms operating in real-time on the software-defined radio (SDR) receiver. Its conventional forward error correction (FEC) is designed assuming symmetric additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN). While SLP generates asymmetric constellation point clouds it is unclear if it can achieve similar FEC gains in an end-to-end coded setup. The receiver is implemented based on the DVB-S2X standard. It estimates multi-beam interference-limited channel coefficients by using the orthogonal pilots embedded into the DVB-S2X frames to facilitate precoding at the transmitter. After the received frames are fully synchronized the payload symbols are decoded in two stages: soft decision using the LLR and hard decision using the LDPC decoders. We benchmark the bit error rate (BER) and frame error rate (FER) of the complete decoding chain while using the zero-forcing (ZF) and the selected SLP channel-interference canceling techniques. The conducted in-lab experiments show that the SLP can improve BER and FER performance in the conventional receiving and decoding design for symmetric constellations while achieving its original optimization goals.","For the purpose of open access and in fulfillment of the obligations arising from the grant agreement, the author has applied a creative commons attribution 4.0 international (CC BY 4.0) license to any author accepted manuscript version arising from this submission.",This work was supported in part by the Luxembourg National Research Fund (FNR) under Grant IPBG19/14016225/INSTRUCT.,IEEE Access,,,,2023-01-01,2023,2023-10-25,2023-01-01,11,,127402-127410,All OA; Gold,Article,"Krivochiza, Jevgenij; Duncan, Juan Carlos Merlano; Querol, Jorge; Chatzinotas, Symeon","Krivochiza, Jevgenij (SNT Research Center, SIGCOM Research Group, University of Luxembourg, 1855, Luxembourg City, Luxembourg); Duncan, Juan Carlos Merlano (SNT Research Center, SIGCOM Research Group, University of Luxembourg, 1855, Luxembourg City, Luxembourg); Querol, Jorge (SNT Research Center, SIGCOM Research Group, University of Luxembourg, 1855, Luxembourg City, Luxembourg); Chatzinotas, Symeon (SNT Research Center, SIGCOM Research Group, University of Luxembourg, 1855, Luxembourg City, Luxembourg)","Krivochiza, Jevgenij (University of Luxembourg)","Krivochiza, Jevgenij (University of Luxembourg); Duncan, Juan Carlos Merlano (University of Luxembourg); Querol, Jorge (University of Luxembourg); Chatzinotas, Symeon (University of Luxembourg)",1,1,,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/ielx7/6287639/10005208/10295494.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1165213380,40 Engineering; 4006 Communications Engineering; 46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4613 Theory Of Computation,

As with most applications, Web applications can acquire software flaws (known as bugs), whose symptoms are seen during the development stage and, even worse, in production. The use of debuggers is beneficial for detecting bugs. Unfortunately, most JavaScript debuggers (1) only support the ""step into/through"" feature in an execution program to detect a bug, and (2) do not allow developers to go back-in-time at the application execution to take actions to detect the bug accurately. For example, the second limitation does not allow developers to modify the value of a variable to fix a bug while the application is running or test if the same bug is triggered with other values of that variable. Using concepts such as continuations and static analysis, this article presents a usable debugger for JavaScript, named DeloreanJS, which enables developers to go back-in-time in different execution points and resume the execution of a Web application to improve the understanding of a bug, or even experiment with hypothetical scenarios around the bug. Using an online and available version, we illustrate the benefits of DeloreanJS through five examples of bugs in JavaScript. Although DeloreanJS is developed for JavaScript, a dynamic prototype-based object model with side effects (mutable variables), we discuss our proposal with the state-of-art/practice of debuggers in terms of features. For example, modern browsers like Mozilla Firefox include a debugger in their distribution that only support for the breakpoint feature. However DeloreanJS uses a graphical user interface that considers back-in-time features. The aim of this study is to evaluate and compare the usability of DeloreanJS and Mozilla Firefox's debugger using the system usability scale approach. We requested 30 undergraduate students from two computer science programs to solve five tasks. Among the findings, we highlight two results. First, we found that 100% (15) of participants recommended DeloreanJS, and only 53% (eight) recommended Firefox's debugger to complete the tasks. Second, whereas the average score for DeloreanJS is 71.6 (""Good""), the average score for Firefox's debugger is 55.8 (""Acceptable"").",,The authors received no funding for this work.,PeerJ Computer Science,,Muhammad Aleem,,2023-02-24,2023,2023-02-24,,9,,e1238,All OA; Gold,Article,"Leger, Paul; Ruiz, Felipe; Fukuda, Hiroaki; Cardozo, Nicolás","Leger, Paul (Escuela de Ingeniería, Universidad Católica del Norte, Coquimbo, Elqui, Chile); Ruiz, Felipe (Escuela de Ingeniería, Universidad Católica del Norte, Coquimbo, Elqui, Chile); Fukuda, Hiroaki (Shibaura Institute of Technology, Tokyo, Japan); Cardozo, Nicolás (Universidad de Los Andes, Bógota, Colombia)","Leger, Paul (Catholic University of the North)","Leger, Paul (Catholic University of the North); Ruiz, Felipe (Catholic University of the North); Fukuda, Hiroaki (Shibaura Institute of Technology); Cardozo, Nicolás (Universidad de Los Andes)",1,1,,,https://doi.org/10.7717/peerj-cs.1238,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1155738906,46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4612 Software Engineering,

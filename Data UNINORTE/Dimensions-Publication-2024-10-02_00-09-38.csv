Then, education must evolve at the same pace as technological advances, developing new educational strategies. This proposal implements a teaching–learning model that encourage the students’ ability to concentrate, considering the lack of interest in traditional learning. Hence, this tool allows greater student participation, in which they acquire knowledge in an interesting and innovative way. Gamification is the basis of this tool, designed to have fun and at the same time to promote factors such as concentration, attention and motor skills. This tool is represented graphically as a video game of races, questions and ability. Its impact has a pedagogical approach so that teachers can identify in their students the different capacities of concentration and analysis that they possess and at the same time the students learn in a more didactic and interesting way based on gamification.","We would like to express our sincere thanks to psychologist María del Carmen Fontalvo, whose valuable guidance and experience were fundamental to the development of the rubric studies in this project. Her expert advice in the research design and analysis significantly enriched our approaches and results.

Then, a high level of understanding about the behavior of the renewable energy sources, the technologies, and their interaction is needed. Particularly, parabolic trough collector (PTC) solar plants can positively affect power systems due to their dispatchability. Since PTC harvests direct normal irradiance (DNI), complex dynamic models are required to understand how PTC behaves. This work uses a 1-D dynamic model that captures the dynamic behavior of PTC plants and is solved numerically via a three-point backward finite-difference. Through two case studies, this research highlights the dynamic behavior and performance of the PTC rows and total solar fields. The row response to varying DNI is showcased in the first case study. The model predicts heat transfer fluid (HTF) temperature profiles in 0.7 s, paving the way for effective control strategies to prevent overheating. The second case study extends the analysis to disturbances caused by clouds and shadows, reaffirming the model’s robustness. With a computation time of 2.7 s for temperature profiles over a day, the model offers both accuracy and computational efficiency for real-time applications.","Richard Rangel acknowledges the financial support from the Colombian Ministry of Sciences, Technology, and Innovation through the National Doctoral Program 785-2018 and Universidad del Norte through the scholarship contract N° UN-OJ-2018-41048.

Health tourists are individuals who leave their local communities and travel to another country for non-emergency medical care. Common procedures performed abroad include dental work, arthroplasty, bariatric, cosmetic and cardiac surgery, reproductive care and organ transplant. At present, complete and accurate data on the volume of health tourism, destination, services, and procedures are unavailable. Similarly, little information is available regarding the risks facing health tourists, such as the infectious diseases associated with surgery or the problems inherent in travelling to other regions. Most reports suggest that procedures carried out abroad are associated with higher rates of infections, but there is no system-wide database currently tracking procedures and outcomes. Transplant tourists are more likely to develop cytomegalovirus, hepatitis B virus, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and wound infections, and cosmetic tourists more frequently have wound infections caused by Mycobacterium abscessus. Nosocomial infections caused by resistant pathogens have also been reported in health tourism patients. Importantly, the delay in the identification of patients with resistant pathogens may potentially result in an outbreak of disease. More research into the health and safety risks in health tourism is urgently needed, and all medical centres should have a predefined approach to the management of patients who have seek medical care abroad.",,,,Emerging and Re-emerging Infections in Travellers,"Hakan Leblebicioglu, Nick Beeching, Eskild Petersen",,2024-05-23,2024,2024-05-23,2024,,,69-78,Closed,Chapter,"Viasus, Diego; Carratalà, Jordi","Viasus, Diego (Faculty of Medicine, Division of Health Sciences, Universidad del Norte and Hospital Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); Carratalà, Jordi (Infectious Disease Department, Hospital Universitari de Bellvitge and Institut d’Investigació Biomèdica de Bellvitge (IDIBELL), Barcelona, Spain; Faculty of Medicine, Clinical Sciences Department, University of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain; Centro de Investigación Biomédica en Red de Enfermedades Infecciosas (CIBERINFEC), Instituto de Salud Carlos III, Madrid, Spain)","Carratalà, Jordi (Institut d'Investigació Biomédica de Bellvitge; University of Barcelona; Instituto de Salud Carlos III)","Viasus, Diego (Universidad del Norte); Carratalà, Jordi (Institut d'Investigació Biomédica de Bellvitge; University of Barcelona; Instituto de Salud Carlos III)",0,0,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1171931350,"32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3202 Clinical Sciences; 35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3504 Commercial Services; 3506 Marketing; 3508 Tourism",3 Good Health and Well Being

In this case, we consider Antebellum to be a relevant examination of Trump-era US cultural warfare. The chapter begins by offering a categorization of the film with various subcategories within the genre of horror (e.g., folk horror, Blacks in horror, and Black horror). The chapter then explores how Antebellum is related to the Black Lives Matter movement. Moreover, Antebellum can be seen as a response to the infamous events that took place during the “Unite the Right” rally in the summer of 2017 in Charlottesville, Virginia. The chapter then delves into masculine crimes committed by Antebellum’s neo-Confederate male characters, aiming to fill the existing void in scholarly works on Black horror and the portrayal of Blacks within the horror genre. The article is divided into two sections: one examines the conflict between the characters Dr. Henley and Senator Denton, and the other considers the significance of Captain Jasper’s violent acts perpetrated against the character Amara. Making use of these scenes, we explore how Senator Denton and Captain Jasper employ concepts of neo-Confederate masculinity in Antebellum.",,,,Culture Wars and Horror Movies,"Noelia Gregorio-Fernández, Carmen M.

Latin America is characterized by being a region with enormous diversity, both from biological and cultural aspects, characterizing it as a territory with an invaluable biocultural heritage, and at the same time, an enormous inequality in different areas. These two conditions, biocultural diversity and inequality, have been historically intertwined, and indigenous, peasant, black, etc. communities have struggled to preserve their culture despite the oppression and marginalization that they have suffered for centuries. In this context, educators in Latin America have built theoretical and practical frameworks to recognize and understand the implications of cultural diversity in different disciplines such as the natural sciences. These proposals have been framed in the fields of multicultural studies, interculturality, epistemologies of the South, and social studies of science. The approaches presented here denote tensions and challenges to incorporate theoretical-methodological frameworks from disciplines (e.g., cultural anthropology, ethnobiology, sociology of science, philosophy of science, among others) that interpret different knowledge systems in a non-hierarchical or dualistic sense and with an emancipatory intention, where recognizing cultural diversity as part of giving voice to these sectors is an action that questions and strains the established power relations.

This study addresses the critical impact of class imbalance on the predictive accuracy of machine learning models applied to lung cancer diagnosis. We evaluated several popular classification algorithms, including K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forests, and Deep Learning models, across original and various enhanced datasets. Our methodology involved preprocessing the data to handle missing values and applying several techniques to balance the classes effectively. These techniques included manual oversampling, undersampling, and synthetic oversampling methods. The manual oversampling allowed us to duplicate instances of the minority classes, while undersampling reduced the instances of the majority class. Synthetic oversampling, using a method like the Adaptive Synthetic Sampling (ADASYN), generated new synthetic instances for the minority classes
. This combined approach allowed us to enhance the representation of minority classes and improve the generalizability of our models.The performance of each model was assessed using accuracy metrics and Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves across both dataset conditions. Results indicated that SVM, Random Forest, and Deep Learning models, when trained on balanced data, demonstrated significant improvements in accuracy and ROC-AUC scores compared to training on the original imbalanced dataset. Specifically, the Random Forest and Deep Learning models showed a notable increase in performance, highlighting the effectiveness of ensemble and deep learning methods in dealing with class imbalances. This study confirms that addressing class imbalance through a combination of manual and synthetic oversampling techniques can substantially improve the accuracy of predictive models in lung cancer diagnosis. These findings advocate for the integration of these techniques in preprocessing steps for clinical data analysis, potentially leading to more reliable and equitable healthcare outcomes.",,,Lecture Notes in Computer Science,Advances in Swarm Intelligence,"Ying Tan, Yuhui Shi",,2024-08-21,2024,2024-08-21,2024,14789,,219-230,Closed,Chapter,"Paola Patricia, Ariza-Colpas; Marlon Alberto, Piñeres-Melo; Er-nesto, Barceló-Martínez; Sharith Alejandra, Blanco-Anillo; Camilo, Barceló-Castellanos; Fabian, Roman-","Paola Patricia, Ariza-Colpas (Computer Science and Electronics Department, Universidad de La Costa CUC, Barranquilla, Colombia; Computer Science and Electronics Department, Universidad de La Costa CUC, Barranquilla, Colombia); Marlon Alberto, Piñeres-Melo (Department of System Engineering, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); Er-nesto, Barceló-Martínez (Instituto Colombiano de Neuropedagogía ICN, Barranquilla, Colombia); Sharith Alejandra, Blanco-Anillo (Computer Science and Electronics Department, Universidad de La Costa CUC, Barranquilla, Colombia); Camilo, Barceló-Castellanos (Instituto Colombiano de Neuropedagogía ICN, Barranquilla, Colombia); Fabian, Roman- (Instituto Colombiano de Neuropedagogía ICN, Barranquilla, Colombia)","Paola Patricia, Ariza-Colpas (University of the Coast)","Paola Patricia, Ariza-Colpas (University of the Coast); Marlon Alberto, Piñeres-Melo (Universidad del Norte); Er-nesto, Barceló-Martínez (Instituto Colombiano de Neuropedagogía ICN, Barranquilla, Colombia); Sharith Alejandra, Blanco-Anillo (University of the Coast); Camilo, Barceló-Castellanos (Instituto Colombiano de Neuropedagogía ICN, Barranquilla, Colombia); Fabian, Roman- (Instituto Colombiano de Neuropedagogía ICN, Barranquilla, Colombia)",0,0,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1174904917,46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4611 Machine Learning,

The selection of alternative materials for more efficient and durable solutions is therefore imperative through research initiatives and field projects. In response to these requirements, this paper reports the main results derived from an experimental study on asphalt mastics produced with a combined use of styrene-butadiene-styrene polymer modified bitumen and hydrated lime as a partial replacement of limestone filler. The set of five materials considered were subjected to laboratory tests, to characterize the stiffening mechanism and the performance response in terms of fatigue, thermal cracking and permanent deformation. From the results, some benefits and limitations on the use of hydrated lime as a partial replacement of limestone filler were observed, indicating its potential use at optimum filler dosage for pavement locations with warm-to-hot weather as a consequence of the filler stiffening mechanism and its consequences on the elastic response to counteract permanent deformation. Fatigue cracking results suggested detrimental effects on the predicted fatigue lives for very high hydrated lime concentrations, further suggesting the need of an optimum HL below 10% by total mastic volume. Furthermore, the low-temperature results measured through delta Tc values validate substantial improvements in the thermal cracking resistance with the incorporation of HL as a partial replacement of LF.",,,Lecture Notes in Civil Engineering,Proceedings of the 10th International Conference on Maintenance and Rehabilitation of Pavements,"Paulo Pereira, Jorge Pais",,2024-07-21,2024,2024-07-21,2024,522,,31-41,Closed,Chapter,"Carvajal-Muñoz, Juan S.; Airey, Gordon; Vergara, Isabela; Sanjuan, Anyely; Pérez, María; Contreras, María; Hernández, Rubén; Cepeda, Juan; Rodríguez, William; Gómez, Fabio; Rodriguez, Santiago","Carvajal-Muñoz, Juan S.

These activities are crucial for economic growth and development. However, when port activities are scaled up, they become hazardous to the environment and public health due to significant emissions. This exacerbates existing climate change and air quality issues. Despite the economic benefits, it is essential to consider the environmental impacts and strive to mitigate or reduce them to prevent harmful effects. To address this problem, machine learning tools and techniques can be employed to predict emissions and identify the predictors that influence them. The primary goal of this study is to forecast hydrocarbon (HC) emissions resulting from activities like cruising, maneuvering, and hoteling using machine learning models. By implementing these models, we can uncover emission patterns and develop strategies to reduce their impact. Among the models tested, the Random Forest model demonstrated the best performance, followed by Decision Trees.

The concept of immersography is proposed as a way to bridge the gap between colliding epistemologies, and between theory and practice, in the field of immersive narrative experiences. This term emphasizes the narrative connotation of immersion in relation to all-encompassing virtual or in-real-life environments that share three main components: spatial experience of the narrative universe, full-body interaction with the storyworld and its elements, and the capability to generate multiple narrative journeys through interactive narrative structures.",,,Palgrave Studies in Screenwriting,Screenwriting for Virtual Reality,"Kath Dooley, Alex Munt",,2024-04-25,2024,2024-04-25,2024,,,101-125,Closed,Chapter,"Reyes, María Cecilia","Reyes, María Cecilia (Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia)","Reyes, María Cecilia (Universidad del Norte)","Reyes, María Cecilia (Universidad del Norte)",0,0,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1171054952,36 Creative Arts and Writing; 3605 Screen and Digital Media,

The motivation for this work was to understand how the presence of an intermittent visual stimulus manifests itself in brain activity. The main objective was to quantitatively differentiate between stimulation and resting states by analysing the energy detected during stimulation pulses. An experimental protocol was employed in which subjects were exposed to a flashing light at 15 Hz for 7 s, followed by an interval of 4 s without stimulation, repeating this cycle for 10 min. By analysing the power spectrum of the EEG recordings using the spectrogram method, the average energy detected during the stimulation and rest periods was calculated. The results indicated that the energy detected during stimulation periods was significantly higher compared to rest periods. This suggests that SSVEPs represent a reliable response for distinguishing between stimulation and resting states in EEG recordings. These findings support the utility of SSVEP as biomarkers of brain activity during intermittent visual stimulation. In turn, a detailed characterisation of brain activity during periods of stimulation and rest has been achieved by analysing these potentials. These results contribute to the knowledge about the brain response to intermittent visual stimuli and may have multiple applications in the field of neuroscience and clinical research.","The authors thank the National Council of Scientific and Technical Research (CONICET, Argentina), the Superior Institute of Biological Research (INSIBIO) and the National University of Tucumán (UNT, Argentina), institutions that partially supported this work through the RESOL-2021-145-APN-DIR#CONICET grant.

The compound action potential waveform, which reflects the electrical activity and signaling properties of the nerves, plays a crucial role in this characterization. However, analyzing and understanding the complex electrophysiological behavior of nerves solely through experiments can be challenging. To overcome this limitation, empirical models have been developed, including physical and analytical models based on differential equations. In this study, we present an improved empirical model of electro-physiological activity in a bundle of myelinated nerve fibers. The model addresses several limitations and incorporates key factors such as non-aligned nodes, occupied space by fibers, arbitrary cross-sectional shapes of the nerve, non-linear conductivity, and non-punctual electrodes. The model has been validated through simulations of the toad sciatic nerve and comparisons with experimental data from the rat infraorbital nerve. The results demonstrate the accurate fit of the model to the recorded CAP waveforms. We have also released an open-source implementation of the model using Python, providing easy accessibility and versatility for the scientific community. The implementation is robust, efficient, and based on trusted libraries, allowing for further advancements and improvements by the community. The model offers a computationally efficient and accessible approach to studying nerve activity, facilitating a better understanding of the electrophysiological behavior of myelinated nerve fibers.",,,IFMBE Proceedings,Advances in Bioengineering and Clinical Engineering,"Fernando Emilio Ballina, Ricardo Armentano, Rubén Carlos Acevedo, Gustavo Javier Meschino",,2024-06-08,2024,2024-06-08,2024,114,,432-443,Closed,Chapter,"Lucianna, Facundo A.; Serra, Rosa M.; Goy, Carla B.; Fresia, Cecilia Saavedra; Real, Silvina; Padilla, Gerardo L.; Albarracín, Ana L.; Farfán, Fernando D.","Lucianna, Facundo A.

Among these pollutants are pharmaceutical drug residues that can bioaccumulate and biomagnify in the trophic chain. Hence, treatments for this type of residue are necessary before their disposal in the environment. Each year around 84,000 tons of this waste are generated, with a tendency to increase. However, conventional wastewater treatments (WWTs) are ineffective in removing these compounds, so new technologies are needed to remove the xenobiotics in question.

Colombia introduced new legislation, created new government agencies focused on anti-corruption, and modernized its public procurement system. Colombia also developed a technologically advanced e-procurement and open contracting data system, giving the government and the public access to a wide range of timely procurement data. As a result, Colombia’s public procurement market has experienced an increase in competition, cost savings, and efficiency. Yet, despite these advances, corruption still exists at all levels of the government: central, regional, and municipal. The next step for Colombia will be for purchasing officials at all levels of the government, contractors, and the public to embrace and put into practice Colombia’s anti-corruption measures more fully.",,,,Routledge Handbook of Public Procurement Corruption,,,2024-03-27,2024,2024-03-27,,,,282-296,Closed,Chapter,"Christoff, Ana Victoria","Christoff, Ana Victoria ()",,"Christoff, Ana Victoria ()",0,0,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1170225449,44 Human Society; 4407 Policy and Administration; 4408 Political Science,"16 Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions"

The study utilized bibliographical research, data compilation, and mapping through the MyMaps platform. Among the 61 pavilions studied, the results revealed that most were developed between 2013 and 2019, as a result of workshops and annual programs that used wood and bamboo as the main construction materials. From this sample, only a portion adopted biomimetic principles as inspiration in their design and construction process, evidencing the effectiveness of biomimicry as a sustainable and innovative approach for experimental pavilion construction. The wide range of findings highlights the versatility of the pavilionar typology and its use in the academic environment as a learning construction site.

Simultaneously, migration from rural areas, and processes of industrialization and urbanization transformed Colombian cities and quotidian life. Among these changes was the resignification of urban public spaces as “owned” by the state, which entailed the control of citizens’ behaviors. This chapter examines how the interaction between people and new technologies fostered a reconfiguration of the sonic sphere, established changing forms of aurality, and informed the experiences of space transforming sounding and listening into significant parts of modernizing processes. Analyzing the first anti-noise campaigns implemented in various Colombian cities in the late 1920s, this chapter reveals how the concept of sound hygiene served as a vehicle to advance notions of ethnicity and race informed by eugenic discourses that intertwined and created symbolic instruments of social classification and control. It also illuminates some of the strategies that local communities developed to resist them.

These practices ensured their prominence and influence in the dynamic relationship between the church and society in the eighteenth century. Under the spiritual direction of the Order of Preachers, tertiary elites became actors and referents of the religious imagination, encouraged by the hope of achieving eternal salvation through a devout life and a firm commitment to the lay apostolate. Within this context, and in a scenario favorable to philanthropy, this chapter aims to investigate the apostolic trajectory of the merchant Manuel Rodríguez de la Vega, who valued the common good and sustained religious practices as a means to achieve Christian perfection, and to honor his apostolate as a worthy son of Saint Dominic. Rodríguez de la Vega followed a singular path of personal discipline and spiritual strength with the aid of the sacraments, Marian devotion, and penitential exercises. When Rodríguez de la Vega died in 1799, he was widely recognized as an exemplary vecino (neighbor) of the Cabildo of Buenos Aires.2",,,,The Dominicans in the Americas and the Philippines (c. 1500–c. 1820),,,2024-06-28,2024,2024-06-28,2024-06-28,,,240-258,Closed,Chapter,"Jijena, Lucrecia","Jijena, Lucrecia ()",,"Jijena, Lucrecia ()",0,0,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1173370986,50 Philosophy and Religious Studies; 5005 Theology,

It offers a systematic reconstruction of seven contrasting positions in diverse disciplines with respect to the riddle of organismal purposiveness and agency: (i) the neo-Aristotelian position; (ii) the Drieschian answer; (iii) the heuristic approach; (iv) the holistic alternative to purposiveness; (v) purposiveness eliminativism; (vi) organismal purposiveness and agency as explananda for equilibria-related research; and (vii) organismal agency as noetic principle. Some views solely focused on ontological dimensions, underlining or disallowing organismal purposiveness; others prioritized integrating teleological concepts into the epistemology of biological science; and a subset navigated both ontological and epistemic domains. This taxonomy reveals that the conventional tripartite historiographic classification of mechanism, organicism, and vitalism does not adequately encompass the breadth of viewpoints that practicing scientists had on organismal purposiveness and agency in the early twentieth century.","I thank attendees of the “Life-Philosophies: Exploring Heterodox Naturalism” Seminar at Ghent University (December 2021) and “The Riddle of Organismal Agency” workshop at Ruhr University Bochum (March 2022) for their helpful comments and observations on this work.

As protagonists of transborder mobility circuits in the Atacama Desert, these women are intersectionally impacted by different forms of social vulnerability. With a feminist anthropological perspective, the book investigates how the boundaries of gender are constructed in the (multi)situated experience of these transborder women. By building a bridge between classical anthropological studies on kinship and contemporary debates on transnational and transborder mobility, the book invites us to rethink structuralist theoretical assertions on the elementary character of family alliances. The women’s life histories and the ethnographic data analyzed show that the limits of gender are configured as a triad between gender violence, kinship restrictions, and female mobility for the study’s protagonists. This contributes to denaturalizing both the androcentrism of the classic arguments on kinship and the emphasis on the experiences of circulation of contemporary theories. Consequently, this book also contributes to the field of border studies by overcoming the insistent invisibility of the role of women in border regions through a model of analysis that privileges female discourses, experiences, affections, and practices. The book’s focus on the reproductive tasks performed by the women allows a rethinking of the relationship between gender violence and female care as a key element to the survival of Iindigenous groups in border areas. This chapter complements the theoretical debates revisiting the anthropological studies on kinship among Aymara groups in the territories of the Andean Tri-border. Several worldviews that will appear in the ethnographic chapters of the volume are described and explained. First, the logics of Aymara symbolic complementarity are addressed. Their relationships to the patterns of kinship, mobility, and territorial occupation in different orographic platforms of the Atacama Desert are also discussed. Then, Aymara marriage (chachawarmi) and its connections with patterns of gender conflict are addressed, thus explaining the persistence of hierarchical forms of masculine domination. By exploring these debates, the chapter retrieves the current political debate of Indigenous women leaders in Bolivia, which makes visible the inequities reproduced when idyllic visions of gender equality in Aymara communities become mainstream political ideas.",,,,The elementary structuring of patriarchy,Menara Guizardi,,2024-06-14,2024,2024-06-14,2024-12-31,,,59-78,Closed,Chapter,"Guizardi, Menara; Gonzálvez, Herminia; Nazal, Esteban; Magalhães, Lina","Guizardi, Menara (); Gonzálvez, Herminia (); Nazal, Esteban (); Magalhães, Lina ()",,"Guizardi, Menara (); Gonzálvez, Herminia (); Nazal, Esteban (); Magalhães, Lina ()",0,0,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1172132378,"44 Human Society; 4405 Gender Studies; 4410 Sociology; 47 Language, Communication and Culture",5 Gender Equality

Despite the numerous eco-friendly materials available in the global construction market, the transition of the construction industry to a sustainable state is still slow-paced. One of the major hindrances identified is the continuous use of construction materials regarded as eco-friendly but discovered to lack all or some of their declared sustainable attributes. Hence, the need to address greenwashing, a term that describes the deceptive and misleading claim of the eco-friendly characteristics of a product/material. This study is aimed at evaluating and visualising the global trend and structure of greenwashing research. The datasets are research literature outputs from the years 2000 to 2020. A quantitative method was utilised to analyse the extracted datasets. The results presented the trends, citations, co-citations, co-authors, document sources, most cited, co-occurring keywords, and geospatial analyses. Visual analytics of the publication outputs enable a flexible, repeatable, timely and valuable approach to identifying critical evidence and tracking the evolution of novel trends. It is recommended that green products/materials allowed to be circulated in the global green market should be evaluated, rated, and labelled using reputable eco-labels.

The literature on the use and impact of research in policymaking has pointed to several ways that knowledge can flow between the academic world to policy (and vice-versa), even though gaps in understanding this relationship exist for this in certain areas, as is the case with Entrepreneurship Ecosystem policies. In this sense, this study aims to identify and analyze how research and scientific knowledge have been used by policy actors in policy documents and policymaking processes related to entrepreneurial ecosystems (EEs) in the European Union. The study focuses on the role of the Joint Research Centre (JRC), a cluster of 10 scientific areas that form the EU Science Hub. We used an altimetry tool (Overton) to identify the use of research in policy documents. The results indicate the prevalence of a political approach underpinned by strategic use of knowledge and expertise as well as strong expert concentration and convergence effects. We discuss these results in terms of their implications for EEs policy and research and identify avenues for future research. The main goal of this chapter was to explore the dynamics of entrepreneurial ecosystems (EEs) in the context of tourism by examining the effectiveness of leadership exercised by regional governance bodies (RGBs). The study focused on the entrepreneurial ecosystem in tourism (EET) of Ouro Preto, Minas Gerais, Brazil, which is a prominent tourism destination with significant cultural heritage. By analyzing the alignment between local agents’ actions and the expected functions of a destination management organization (DMO), the present study aimed to characterize the EET and evaluate the adequacy of RGB leadership in integrating and strategically managing the ecosystem. The findings suggest that while there is alignment between local actions and DMO functions, dysfunctions stemming from a lack of legitimacy, engagement, and political obstacles hinder the maturity and effectiveness of leadership in the EET. In addition to the leadership drivers indicated by the literature, this study proposes adopting formal management mechanisms, legitimation, and the capacity to stimulate innovation as crucial factors influencing the strategic performance of leadership within EETs. By furthering the knowledge on leadership dynamics in EETs, this study contributes to the broader literature on EEs and provides insights for academics and policymakers. This study’s findings have implications not only for Ouro Preto, but also for other destinations with similar characteristics. Overall, this study contributed to furthering the knowledge on leadership within EETs, filling the gap in empirical research, and offering practical insights for the strategic support and development of tourism entrepreneurship within EEs. This chapter is concerned with the study of entrepreneurial ecosystems (EEs) in Central and Eastern European (CEE) contexts. It summarizes the key findings of over 15 years of study of EEs in such places and draws together insights gained from empirical work, which helps us to push forward the theorizing of EEs by incorporating the experiences of regional and national contexts usually overlooked in the mainstream literature. This chapter contextualizes EEs in CEEs as peripheral when considered on the international scale, and thus broadens the discussion to more general insights about peripheral EEs, which have thus far been largely overlooked in research, suggesting that insights from these contexts can fill in some blind spots around migrant and informal or necessity entrepreneurship in particular. Rice is the staple food of the populations of two islands in the Indian Ocean: Reunion Island and Madagascar. To guarantee their food autonomy, these islands have carried out agricultural innovations around rice farming: PAPRiz in Madagascar and Riz Reunion in Reunion Island. These innovations are similar in the dimensions covered (process, product, and organizational innovations) but differ in their scope. The study explores how an agricultural innovation is diffused to stakeholders and how they are involved in. With documentary analysis and interviews, the comparison of the ecosystems of these two agricultural innovations shows some differences in structuring: the Reunion ecosystem is in the creation stage, whereas the ecosystem of Madagascar is in the maturity stage. The evolution of these ecosystems shows the importance of the structuration of the ecosystem. Public institutions can play this role to converge the interests of stakeholders. These stakeholders must be enrolled in the ecosystem via actions by a legitimation of the knowledge. Social enterprises must be understood based on the local and national contexts they are embedded in, which influence how the organizations are formed and designed. How the development of social enterprises differs in developed and developing countries is less understood. In this chapter we explore external drivers and the differences in the ecosystems surrounding social enterprises in Norway and South Africa (SA), two countries with radically different institutional preconditions. Norway represents a governance model where most of the production of welfare lay within the public sector. However, the recent need for restructuring of the welfare state has led to structural changes which better facilitate the development of a social entrepreneurship ecosystem. SA, on the other hand, has a large institutional void caused by a small public welfare system where SA social entrepreneurs are active. The study was designed as a multiple case study of social enterprises and collaborating actors in their ecosystems. The data consists of 23 interviews in addition to statistics from the two contexts. Main findings are that social entrepreneurship in Norway has developed as a supplement to the public services in small niches strongly regulated by policies, while the SA social entrepreneurs are more numerous and often act as independent service providers in a more diverse ecosystem. Despite the availability of economic resources in Norway, social enterprises report few available sources stimulating social entrepreneurship and the presence of various obstacles. Meanwhile, a developed system for philanthropy, e.g., microfinance, fair trade, and religious communities, contribute to a more diverse ecosystem in SA. The Entrepreneurship Development in Higher Education (EDHE) programme was established at the end of 2016 in response to various challenges in the South African context. These include high rates of graduate and youth unemployment, the desire to increase third-stream income at universities, and the national drive for the creation of SMEs and the concomitant job creation presented by these. The aim of this chapter is to give an overview of the entrepreneurial ecosystem (EE) in South Africa and to determine how the EDHE programme has contributed to this. In this chapter a review of literature and empirical data gathered in other studies, indexes, and reports will be studied to paint a picture of the EE in South Africa. It will then study the outcomes of the EDHE programme in detail to learn successes and failures, and specifically investigate the link to entrepreneurial universities. Finally, this chapter will determine what lessons may be learnt that are of value to other emerging economies, and aspiring entrepreneurial universities, and how entrepreneurship development impacts on EE the greater context. Our findings relate to the book’s main discussion by providing details about the drivers that impact the EE in South Africa. Innovation ecosystems are characterized by innovative activities that depend on collaboration between different actors, including universities. We seek to understand the more proactive dynamics of a university in promoting practices capable of generating positive externalities for the formation and development of innovation ecosystems. For this reason, the objective of this work is to enhance the understanding of how innovation ecosystems are formed and developed based on the orchestration of an entrepreneurial university. For that, qualitative interpretative research was carried out, through a unique case study at a university in Brazil. Data were collected through interviews and document analysis. A process approach was used to analyze the data, seeking to understand the phenomenon in its “temporal dimension.” Our findings relate to the book’s main discussion by exploring the dual role of the university in the process and the importance of collaborative practices. This work aims to understand how knowledge-based dynamic capabilities (KDBCs) can improve the development of innovation ecosystems (IEs) throughout their life cycle, for which a single case study of a university ecosystem (UNISINOS) was discussed. Data was collected through semi-structured interviews and document analysis, and information was analyzed through content analysis with categories defined a priori. Among the main findings, the following stand out: (1) throughout the life cycle of an EI, different KDBCs are mobilized to promote its development; (2) we were able to identify the existence of microfoundations related to different KDBCs of knowledge acquisition, generation, and combination; and (3) we provide an ecosystem perspective of KDBCs in a developing country.",,,,,"Elisa Thomas, Kadígia Faccin, Bruno A.

This chapter uses the classification of biotechnology areas (white, red, green, gray) to analyze the microfluidics and hydrogel combination (MHC) contribution to each of them. It presents the enormous potential of the MHC for the development of numerous applications in biotechnology. The most explored biotech area in the state of the art is the red one (tissue engineering, regenerative medicine, cell culture, or simply medical applications), where most reports can be grouped into three general applications: cell encapsulation, microfiber fabrication, and cell culture. The examples described in this chapter illustrate that the use of hydrogels in microfluidics can have diverse applications with great advantages in cost, time, and sensitivity.",,,,Smart Systems in Biotechnology,,,2024-03-27,2024,2024-03-27,2024-03-27,,,91-114,Closed,Chapter,"Madrid, Rossana E.; Goy, Carla B.; Gianni, Katia","Madrid, Rossana E.

Esto, para dar recomendaciones para el programa de educación sexual de la institución. Como metodología se opta por los lineamientos del enfoque cualitativo, específicamente en el diseño de la investigación biográfica cuya técnica principal es la historia de vida. Los resultados muestran que los principales factores que caracterizan la maternidad temprana en esa institución educativa son la falta de educación sexual integral —en la escuela y la familia— basada en derechos sexuales y reproductivos (dsr), las barreras de acceso a la salud sexual y reproductiva, la violencia intrafamiliar y su precariedad económica, así como la baja escolaridad de los padres. Revelan, también, que el enojo y la dualidad emocional, la presión social y la frustración en el proyecto de vida son las principales percepciones que las adolescentes del Colgalán tienen acerca de la maternidad. En conclusión, se demuestra que el embarazo en las jóvenes del entorno estudiado trae consecuencias psicosociales a causa del sentimiento de frustración y angustia que les produce el hecho de constituir una familia no planeada, consecuencias físicas debido a partos realizados por cesáreas, y consecuencias económicas en cuanto se repite el ciclo de pobreza.",,,,Ruralidad y educación rural en Colombia.

In this chapter, we seek to address the use of space and mobility of hunter-gatherer populations that occupied a sector of the arid and semi-arid center of Argentina, known as the Travesía Puntana (Puntana Traverse). This name is probably motivated by the difficulties faced by the Hispanic-Creole populations to generate routes and enclaves in its interior, mainly due to the scarcity of surface water. However, such a European notion is contested by the archaeological evidence. The sites are located in dunes with little or no vegetation, which functioned as ecorefuges thanks to the presence of high-quality water in the nearby groundwater. It was recently proposed that the Travesía Puntana was part of an internodal space where human activities were infrequent, ephemeral, or non-existent in relation to neighboring regions. To investigate the role of this internode we carried out the technological study of 66 sets of surface lithic artifacts and the geochemical analysis of obsidian artifacts. These two lines of research are adequate to answer questions about social interaction and circulation of information or objects. The results show the input of rocks and tools with different vectors and distances from non-local sources. We believe that in these landscapes, the dunes favored dynamics of “population convergence,” as places of potential shared use.","We would like to thank the inhabitants of Southern Córdoba and San Luis for receiving us in their places and accompanying us in the field work, the members of the native communities for their interest in our work, and the governments of San Luis and Mendoza for the researchResearches permits.

Nanolubricant additives have made significant strides in both scientific research and industrial applications with the advancement of science and technology. In comparison to organic molecules typically utilized as lubricant additives, nanoparticles provide a number of significant advantages, including their nanometer size, which enables them to access the contact area readily. This review focuses on how tribological performance in oil lubrication is affected by metal‐containing nanoparticles. The review also includes a thorough discussion of the additives’ dispersion stabilities in lubricants. Analyses are done on how the addition of nanoparticles affects the various performance characteristics. The review also outlines the lubrication mechanisms of nanolubricant additives, such as tribofilm production, microbearing effect, self‐repair performance, and synergistic impact. Analysis is done on the effects of nanoparticle size, shape, surface functionalization, and concentration on wear and friction. Consideration is given to the challenges and potential of developing metal‐containing nanoparticles as lubricant additives. Fundamental information on metal, metal oxides, metal sulfides, and rare earth nanoparticle‐based nanolubricants is generalized.

The assimilation of culture with capitalism has produced a mass culture that socialises people with the culture of capitalism, effectively domesticating and controlling the masses by establishing an intimate relationship between labor and working conditions. Intimate capitalism is a new form of capitalism where workers invest their labor and work overtime due to an affective connection to the cultural product they are working on or an intimacy with the cultural working conditions. It critically examines the narratives surrounding the creative economy, as well as digital innovations within cultural industries, to highlight how they are reinforcing and perpetuating exploitative working conditions. The erosion of workers’ rights under intimate capitalism is examined to show how cultural industries seek to dominate the lives of those working within them, leading to an increased commodification of culture and institutionalisation of creative assets in the name of economic growth and development. This book offers a critical framework for understanding intimate capitalism and outlines its impact on workers, particularly those within developing economies. It will be relevant to students and researchers interested in cultural economics, the political economy, and labour economics.

Sin em­bargo, no se trata de una situación donde se pueda ofrecer una rápida respuesta educativa y social, pues partimos de la premisa de que mu­chos de los hechos, aparentemente delictivos, donde se ve involucrado un menor de catorce años, hay que asumirlos partiendo de la base de que son «niños síntoma de una situación multi problemática». Para abordar esta realidad, se presenta este libro organizado en tres partes. En la primera se muestra una investigación llevada a cabo en Castilla y León sobre la situación educativa y social de los menores inimputables; en la segunda, presentamos una herramienta que per­mite la valoración, por parte de los distintos organismos competentes en materia de atención a la infancia, de los factores de riesgo; y, en la tercera parte, presentamos un programa de intervención basado en la prevención indicada llamado «Más por Menor».

A mixed integer linear program was formulated for designing recycling networks of lithium-ion batteries, comparing the performance of pyrometallurgical and hydrometallurgical recycling processes. The conceptual recycling network proposed consists of three nodes: collection centers, recycling processes, and consumption points. According to the model, the recycling of batteries constitutes 57% of the total cost of the network. In addition, the proposed model only considers the recycling of the cathode material. Therefore, it is crucial to develop recycling networks to process all the battery components efficiently. The proposed model is a valuable tool for designing the supply chain network for recycling Li-ion batteries.",,,Computer Aided Chemical Engineering,34th European Symposium on Computer Aided Process Engineering / 15th International Symposium on Process Systems Engineering,,,2024,2024,,2024,53,J.

One of the wastes with the largest amount is beets or beets, which, due to their decomposition, spoil quickly compared to other vegetables. For this reason, this research has as its main objective the generation of bioelectricity through microbial fuel cells (MFCs) with a single chamber using beet waste as fuel on a laboratory scale. Thus, 100 mL of beet waste extract was also used in each MFCs (they were carried out in triplicate). It was possible to generate peak electrical current and voltage of 5.64 ± 0.75 mA and 1.03 ± 0.25 V, whose substrate had an electrical conductivity of 175.71 ± 6.87 mS/cm with an optimum operating pH of 4.86 ± 0.34. While the internal resistance was calculated using Ohm’s Law, yielding a value of 48,253 ± 4749 Ω, also showing a maximum power density of 96,741 ± 4874 mw/m2 at a current density of 5614 mA/m2.

An enormous aftershock (Mw 8.2) was felt two hours after the Indian Ocean earthquake along the triple intersection of the Indian, Australian, and Sunda plates in the northwest. Over the past 20 years, there have been numerous earthquakes in the Sumatran subduction zone, including the 2004 earthquake (Mw 9.2) of Sumatra-Andaman, the 2005 earthquake (Mw 8.6) of Nias-Simeulue, the 2007 earthquake (Mw 8.4) of Bengkulu, the 2010 earthquake (Mw 7.8) of Mentawai tsunami, and a large number of other minor to moderate-sized events. It often takes a few seconds to a few minutes for the stress brought on by an earthquake to dissipate. This massive discharge disrupts the lithosphere and asthenosphere, which causes more earthquakes to occur nearby. A comprehensive comprehension of stress variations along a fault and its neighboring faults is essential for effectively predicting and mitigating seismic risks. Drawing inspiration from the earthquake finite fault model pioneered by Guangfu Shao, Xiangyu Li, and Chen Ji from UCSB, we have formulated Coulomb stress models tailored to the Sumatran subduction zone and the Sumatran fault. It was discovered that the primary shock’s related coulomb stress change exceeded the stress-triggering threshold. The aftershock struck a place where there was a lot of stress from the mainshock. Therefore, the Coulomb failure stress change brought on by the mainshock is likely what caused the Sumatra aftershock to occur.",,,,Recent Developments in Earthquake Seismology,"Rohtash Kumar, Raghav Singh, Shyam Kanhaiya, Satya Prakash Maurya",,2024-03-01,2024,2024-03-01,2024,,,99-108,Closed,Chapter,"Thakur, Pankhudi; Kumar, Rohtash; Das, Ranjit; Rai, Amritansh; Singh, Raghav; Singh, Ankit; Maurya, S.

The single backscattering model developed by Aki and Chouet (J Geophys Res 80:3322–3342, 1975) is used to investigate the dependence of Coda-Q on lapse time frames. The waveforms of 49 local earthquakes recorded by a one-station local seismological network are used for the analysis. The frequency-dependent Coda-Q relations estimated for the region are: Qc = (65.75) f0.6302 (10 sec lapse time), Qc = (92.48) f0.6868 (20 sec lapse time), Qc = (18.17) f1.3337 (30 sec lapse time), Qc = (30.95) f1.2303 (40 sec lapse time), Qc = (88.22) f0.9117, and Qc = (125.19) f0.9342. Given that greater areas would be sampled by longer lapse time windows, the rise in Qc values with lapse time demonstrates the depth dependency of Qc. The increase in value of Q0 (QC at 1 Hz) with time depicts that the heterogeneities decrease with depth. The observed quality factor is highly variable with the lapse time and frequency. The more significant value of n shows that the area is seismically active. The observed Qc relation is found equivalent to other similar seismically active regions.","The authors are grateful to Prof. H. R. Wason for providing the data.

Our main objective is to analyze and compare different approaches, such as Linear Regression models, Support Vector Regression, and Regression Trees, to determine which one offers the best gold price prediction accuracy. Through an exhaustive bibliographical review and the analysis of historical data, we seek to identify patterns and trends that allow us to improve the predictive capacity of the model. In the development process, we have used a rigorous and transparent workflow, from the definition of the problem to the evaluation of the models by dividing the data into training sets, cross-validation, and testing. Our methodology includes collecting data from trusted sources and preparing the data through proper cleaning, exploration, and transformation. The results obtained so far show that the linear regression model reaches an R2 metric greater than 0.89 but with an RMSE of 31.38 and an MAE of 17.84.

This paper aims to present a novel Onion framework for Selecting Data Envelopment Analysis (Selecting DEA) model to select multiple quality service criteria, compare, and evaluate the perception of airport concessionaires’ users about Brazilian airports through layers of analysis. This Onion framework consists of running the DEA again, in loop, where each loop is considered an onion layer, and each loop only with the criteria not selected for any of the Decision-Making Units (DMUs) in the previous loop, and to repeat it until all criteria is selected for at least one DMU and there are no more criteria for another layer. The first step was the compilation of the answers of 31 criteria, collected monthly from the Brazilian National Civil Aviation Agency (ANAC) for the main airports, deemed as Decision-Making Units (DMUs) in this study, from 2015 to 2017 for the empirical application (there are more measures than DMUs). The results showed 14 layers of the Selecting DEA, the last layer had most of the important quality service criteria. It can support decision-makers to select criteria to evaluate DMUs and support management best practices.",,,Lecture Notes in Operations Research,Advances in the Theory and Applications of Performance Measurement and Management,"Ali Emrouznejad, Emmanuel Thanassoulis, Mehdi Toloo",,2024-09-03,2024,2024-09-03,2024,,,85-94,Closed,Chapter,"Nocera Alves Junior, Paulo; Costa Melo, Isotilia; Kimura Kodama, Tatiana; Suarez Campoli, Jessica; Seido Nagano, Marcelo","Nocera Alves Junior, Paulo (Universidad Católica del Norte (UCN), Escuela de Ingeniería de Coquimbo (EIC), Coquimbo, Chile); Costa Melo, Isotilia (ICN Business School, CEREFIGE—Université de Lorraine, Paris, France); Kimura Kodama, Tatiana (São Carlos School of Engineering (EESC), University of São Paulo (USP), São Carlos, Brazil); Suarez Campoli, Jessica (São Carlos School of Engineering (EESC), University of São Paulo (USP), São Carlos, Brazil); Seido Nagano, Marcelo (São Carlos School of Engineering (EESC), University of São Paulo (USP), São Carlos, Brazil)","Nocera Alves Junior, Paulo (Catholic University of the North)","Nocera Alves Junior, Paulo (Catholic University of the North); Costa Melo, Isotilia (ICN Business School, CEREFIGE—Université de Lorraine, Paris, France); Kimura Kodama, Tatiana (Universidade de São Paulo); Suarez Campoli, Jessica (Universidade de São Paulo); Seido Nagano, Marcelo (Universidade de São Paulo)",0,0,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1175354313,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4605 Data Management and Data Science",

It was necessary to convert various earthquake magnitude classes into a single unsaturated magnitude scale. One magnitude is transformed into a preferred magnitude using regression relationships. It is necessary to apply General Orthogonal Regression (GOR) since earthquake magnitudes are inaccurate. For the purpose of estimating the slope of a regression analysis, the use of GOR needs and the proper application of needs are crucial. Regression relationships for magnitude conversion that are peculiar to the Northeast Indian region and have been published in several research studies using the SR, ISR, and GOR methods are covered in this chapter. Regression relationships for the conversion of body and surface wave magnitudes are also presented for Northern Chile and Southern Peru. To cover the complete magnitude range, Das et al(2023) additionally included several GOR relations that were based on global data.

Among the most affected countries are those located in Latin America, one of the most vulnerable regions due to the lack of adequate hospital infrastructure, the shortcomings or deficiencies of health care systems, or populations with a high prevalence of chronic diseases. Social media platforms, such as Twitter, have become valuable sources of real-time information and public sentiment during disease outbreaks. This study presents an analysis of sentiment expressed in tweets related to Monkeypox in Latin America, aiming to understand public perceptions and emotional responses. We collected a dataset of tweets containing keywords associated with Monkeypox, originating from Latin American countries, over a specific time frame (from May 31, 2022, to October 31, 2022). Natural language processing techniques were employed to preprocess and analyze the textual content. Sentiment analysis tools were applied to classify tweets into positive or negative sentiments. Our findings reveal valuable insights into the sentiment dynamics surrounding Monkeypox in Latin America. We observed fluctuations in sentiment over time, closely aligned with the progression of the disease and related events.","The authors thank to Research4tech, an Artificial Intelligence (AI) community of Latin American Researcher with the aim of promoting AI, build science communities to catapult and enforce development of Latin American countries supported on science and technology, integrating academic community, technology groups/communities, government and society.

For determining the spatial-time changes in a-value (seismic activity), b-value (recurrence graph slope), and z-value, the contemporary expanded software package ZMAP with numerous sophisticated seismological functions for earthquake catalog analysis is employed (parameter of the relative seismic quiescence). For the various statistical interpretations, catalog data from the United States Geological Survey (USGS) occurred in spatial windows 0° N – 20° N and 118°E – 130oN are used. The overall conclusion is that unusually low b-values and high z-values, which define zones of comparatively seismic quiescence, may be a signal of the approaching release of more severe stress in areas near zones of relatively high a-values. Thus, the suggested joint interpretation of the spatial-time fluctuations of these three statistical characteristics of seismicity may be seen as a form of the predictor of the more powerful recent seismic occurrences in the region. Furthermore, the occurrence probability of a seven magnitude event is near about one with a return period of 2 years.",The catalog of earthquake events from 1940 to 2022 used in this study is obtained from USGS using the Zmap 7.0 tool in MATLAB version R2019a.

Moreover, for the multi-label food recognition problem, there are few datasets available, which is mandatory for food analysis considering the great variability of dishes that can be made by combining different foods, which do not have a particular name and therefore cannot be treated as a single-label recognition problem. In this paper, we introduce a new challenging multi-label food dataset, SAI-ChileanDiet, focused on the Chilean diet. The dataset includes foods of popular dishes from Chilean cuisine and others included in the Chilean diets. SAI-ChileanDiet considers different sources of data for training and test sets. The training set comprises images from the web and the test set comprises self-acquired images. This feature of the dataset allows us to assess the representativeness of public images in real-world Chilean foods and encourages the generation of advanced methods capable of dealing with the distribution shift of these sets. We evaluate on the proposed SAI-ChileanDiet dataset the performance of several state-of-the-art deep networks and AI platforms for multi-label food recognition.

This research focuses on manufacturing a mold for a prototype orthosis aimed at developing a low-cost manufacturing methodology. Many materials can be used in an orthopedic device. This study considers a composite material of 80 g/cm2 abaca nonwoven fiber, epoxy resin, and polyester. The experimental planning is executed with a 22-factorial design with 12 experimental runs, and parameters such as the effect of resin type and nonwoven fabric are evaluated. The response variables are tensile strength (TS) and flexural strength (FS), and the samples are prepared according to the procedure described in ISO 1421:1998 (tensile strength). The TS is evaluated using the Titan 5 James Heal Dynamometer. At the same time, the FS is assessed according to the procedure in ASTM D7264 using the three-point bending test technique on the AUTOGRAPH machine. The statistical analysis is performed using Statgraphics Centurion software. It is demonstrated that there is a significant difference in tensile and flexural strength when changing the resin type and nonwoven fabric levels. This research concludes that it is feasible to manufacture orthoses with natural abaca fibers and thermosetting plastic resins such as polyester and epoxy.",,,Lecture Notes in Networks and Systems,Emerging Research in Intelligent Systems,"Gonzalo Fernando Olmedo Cifuentes, Diego Gustavo Arcos Avilés, Hernán Vinicio Lara Padilla",,2024-05-03,2024,2024-05-03,2024,903,,135-148,Closed,Chapter,"Mora-Muñoz, Elsa Sulay; Vaca-Sierra, Tulia Nohemi; Posso-Pasquel, José Rafael; Rivera-Yépez, Juan","Mora-Muñoz, Elsa Sulay (Universidad Técnica del Norte, Av. 17 de Julio, Ibarra, Ecuador); Vaca-Sierra, Tulia Nohemi (Universidad Técnica del Norte, Av. 17 de Julio, Ibarra, Ecuador); Posso-Pasquel, José Rafael (Universidad Técnica del Norte, Av. 17 de Julio, Ibarra, Ecuador); Rivera-Yépez, Juan (Universidad Técnica del Norte, Av. 17 de Julio, Ibarra, Ecuador)","Mora-Muñoz, Elsa Sulay (Universidad Técnica del Norte)","Mora-Muñoz, Elsa Sulay (Universidad Técnica del Norte); Vaca-Sierra, Tulia Nohemi (Universidad Técnica del Norte); Posso-Pasquel, José Rafael (Universidad Técnica del Norte); Rivera-Yépez, Juan (Universidad Técnica del Norte)",0,0,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1171314354,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3203 Dentistry; 40 Engineering; 4016 Materials Engineering,

The world population is growing; consequently, food consumption is expected to increase, and Brazil is one of the important countries in global food production with the potential to supply food to meet this higher food demand in the world. Considering this context, the aim of this chapter is to propose a double-frontier data envelopment analysis (DEA) model to benchmark Brazilian regions for the sustainable expansion of food production. Thus, for this purpose, a slack-based measure (SBM) DEA model combined with the composite index double-frontier method is developed for efficiency analysis of the Brazilian regions, deemed decision-making units (DMUs), based on satellite data from the Brazilian Annual Land Use and Land Cover Mapping Project (MAPBIOMAS) and the Greenhouse Gas Emission and Removal Estimating System (SEEG). The data are split into negative factors (NFs), undesirable outputs (UOs), or inputs (e.g., irrigation and CO2 equivalent emissions related to the agricultural sector), and positive factors (PFs) or outputs (e.g., food productivity or pasture area). This chapter uses averaged data from 2017 to 2021 for 14 of the 26 (plus the Federal District) Brazilian states. As for the results, Santa Catarina is in the first position of the ranking (first recommendation for expansion of agricultural production). In terms of regions, the northeast has two states in the efficient frontier and none in the inverted frontier, while the southeast has none in the efficient frontier and two in the inverted frontier. The other regions have states in both frontiers. These results would help provide policymakers with strategies for future investment to expand food production. For future research, it is suggested to apply the proposed model using data from other countries and develop stochastic DEA models, besides investigating the efficiency of future scenarios.",,,"Transformations in Banking, Finance and Regulation","Handbook on Data Envelopment Analysis in Business, Finance, and Sustainability",,,2024-08-15,2024,2024-08-15,2024-08,16,,511-530,Closed,Chapter,"Alves Junior, Paulo Nocera; Vicentin, Damaris Chieregato","Alves Junior, Paulo Nocera (Universidad Católica del Norte (UCN), Escuela de Ingeniería de Coquimbo (EIC), Coquimbo, Chile); Vicentin, Damaris Chieregato (School of Applied Science, State University of Campinas (Unicamp), Limeira, Brazil)",,"Alves Junior, Paulo Nocera (Catholic University of the North); Vicentin, Damaris Chieregato (State University of Campinas)",0,0,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1174804851,37 Earth Sciences; 3704 Geoinformatics; 38 Economics,15 Life on Land; 2 Zero Hunger

The starting point is an award-winning social responsibility project operation by a French company. Ethnography in Senegal, the destination country, evidenced that accountability had been incomplete and partial. While the published ethnographic account seemed accurate at the time, faces and landscapes were later encountered in the field that continued to haunt them. Methodologically, the authors suggest that ethnographic accountability may have less to do with reflexivity than with the (always difficult) ability to listen to the Other. Accountability is never complete-able: one must always be ready to encounter other voices and faces that challenge and deconstruct what one thought was the 'right' or 'richest possible' account.",,,,Accountability Research,,,2024-05-21,2024,2024-05-21,2024-05-21,,,255-268,Closed,Chapter,"Moriceau, Jean-Luc; Guérillot, Géraldine; Paes, Isabela","Moriceau, Jean-Luc (); Guérillot, Géraldine (); Paes, Isabela ()",,"Moriceau, Jean-Luc (); Guérillot, Géraldine (); Paes, Isabela ()",0,0,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1171893136,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3507 Strategy, Management and Organisational Behaviour",

Using the African feminist approach (that addresses the conditions and needs of African women), the research locates a comprehensive understanding and the generational acceptance of Queen Modjadji as the Balobedu people’s ‘Rain Queen’ and leader. The study offers a critique and rhetorical agency of the gender roles and identities of women and how they are expressed under kinship in Balobedu. Furthermore, the study employs empirical research in unpacking the ‘Rain Queen’, Modjadji, as a matrilineal figure. This chapter attempts to add to the pool of knowledge by informing and educating society towards the emancipation of African women. The research will also broaden the discussion on recent developments and the conflict that arose from the kinship regarding the successor to ‘Rain Queen’ to be replaced by the ‘Rain King’ according to the Modjadji Royal Council. The promotion of overlapping gender roles and patriarchal norms in the campaigns has generated conflict and resentment within the Balobedu people. The study concludes that the current contestation regarding the succession of the ‘Rain Queen’ by the ‘Rain King’ is a testament that in a patriarchal society, leadership is a domain beyond the reach of women.",,,,African Women Legends and the Spirituality of Resistance,,,2024-01-18,2024,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,,,59-74,Closed,Chapter,"Moagi, A.

253,pub.1168557222,10.4324/9781003011644-26,,,English-medium instruction in higher education in South Africa,"South Africa is a unique country with a rich multilingual history, marked by the vigorous spread and adoption of English in the country’s education system, particularly in the post-primary school sectors (Wildsmith-Cromarty & Balfour, 2019). It is distinguished from other Southern African countries, including former Anglophone colonies as Botswana, Eswatini (Swaziland), Lesotho, Namibia, Zambia, and Zimbabwe, as well as Lusophone Angola and Mozambique. These other Southern African nations have had their own experiences with English-medium education, as noted by previous research on this topic (Kamwangamalu, 2013). In this chapter, however, we will not be discussing EMI in all these societies, but will instead focus on South Africa, which undoubtedly has the most well-developed system of EMI higher education in the region. The use of African languages and English in South Africa’s higher education institutions has garnered a fair amount of attention in recent years, as language policies and practices continue to evolve according to the socio-demographic changes occurring in the country since the first democratic elections were held in 1994 (Van der Walt & Hibbert, 2014). Not only this, the deep and ongoing history of multilingualism and the prominence of English in the education system holds the potential for a unique expression of EMI in the South African higher education context. The purpose of this chapter is to provide a state-of-the-art report on the status and description of English as a medium of instruction (EMI), with a focus on South African higher education. The chapter begins with a brief overview of EMI-related concepts and terms in the South African context, followed by a discussion of the sociolinguistic dynamics of society, and related language policies. We then provide a case study of EMI and its implementation at a leading university in the country, that is North-West University. The chapter will conclude with a discussion of the challenges, opportunities, and future prospects of EMI in South African higher education.","The School of Accounting in the Faculty of Economics and Management Sciences, as well as the Language Directorate at the NWU are thanked for reporting the information about the reception of the multilingual concept videos by students in the NWUs 2020 Language Directorate report (NWU, 2020) that is available in the public domain (see details in the list of references).",,,The Routledge Handbook of English-Medium Instruction in Higher Education,,,2024-02-02,2024,2024-02-02,2024-02-02,,,311-323,Closed,Chapter,"Rooy, Susan Coetzee-Van; Botha, Werner","Rooy, Susan Coetzee-Van (); Botha, Werner ()",,"Rooy, Susan Coetzee-Van (); Botha, Werner ()",0,0,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1168557222,"39 Education; 3902 Education Policy, Sociology and Philosophy; 47 Language, Communication and Culture; 4704 Linguistics",4 Quality Education

Men and women in 15 countries (NTOTAL = 4701) completed self-report measures assessing self-esteem and the four humor styles of affiliative, aggressive, self-defeating, and self-enhancing. Each of the country samples had self-esteem averages at or above the midpoint of the scale, but did vary. The samples from Colombia and Serbia had the highest self-esteem values and Russia had the lowest. For all of the country samples, with the exception of Russia, the multiple regression results demonstrated that a greater level of the self-enhancing humor style positively predicted higher self-esteem scores. As the self-enhancing humor style involves improving one’s mood with humor, the results suggest that for the majority of the participants, self-enhancing humor styles also help to increase self-esteem. The results are discussed both within countries and across the samples. In particular, the unique finding that not a self-enhancing humor style but an aggressive humor style predicts self-esteem in the Russian sample is discussed. The chapter ends with a discussion of how humor styles correlate with mental health indicators and how the understanding of humor style profiles are related to well-being across countries adds to the global understanding of individual differences.",,,,The Palgrave Handbook of Humour Research,"Elisabeth Vanderheiden, Claude-Hélène Mayer",,2024-06-01,2024,2024-06-01,2024,,,103-127,Closed,Chapter,"Schermer, Julie Aitken; Papazova, Eva Boyanova; Kwiatkowska, Maria Magdalena; Rogoza, Radosław; Park, Joonha; Kowalski, Christopher Marcin; Branković, Marija; Doroszuk, Marta; Khanh Ha, Truong Thi; Iliško, Dzintra; Malik, Sadia; Lins, Samuel; Navarro-Carrillo, Ginés; Oviedo-Trespalacios, Oscar; Torres-Marín, Jorge; Włodarczyk, Anna; de Aquino, Sibele Dias; Volkodav, Tatiana; Krammer, Georg","Schermer, Julie Aitken (Department of Management and Organizational Studies, Faculty of Social Science, The University of Western Ontario, London, ON, Canada); Papazova, Eva Boyanova (Department of Psychology, IPHS-BAS, Sofia, Bulgaria); Kwiatkowska, Maria Magdalena (Faculty of Christian Philosophy, Cardinal Stefan Wyszyński University, Warsaw, Poland); Rogoza, Radosław (Cardinal Stefan Wyszyński University, Warsaw, Poland); Park, Joonha (NUCB Business School, Nagoya, Japan); Kowalski, Christopher Marcin (Department of Psychology, University of Western Ontario, London, ON, Canada); Branković, Marija (Faculty of Media and Communications, Singidunum University, Belgrade, Serbia); Doroszuk, Marta (Faculty of Philosophy, Institute of Psychology at Jagiellonian University, Cracow, Poland); Khanh Ha, Truong Thi (VNU University of Social Sciences and Humanities, Vietnam National University, Hanoi, Vietnam); Iliško, Dzintra (Daugavpils University, Institute of Humanities and Societal Sciences, Daugavpils, Latvia); Malik, Sadia (Department of Psychology, University of Sargodha, Sargodha, Pakistan); Lins, Samuel (University of Porto, Porto, Portugal); Navarro-Carrillo, Ginés (Department of Psychology, University of Jaén, Jaén, Spain); Oviedo-Trespalacios, Oscar (Centre for Accident Research and Road Safety-Queensland (CARRS-Q), Kelvin Grove, QLD, Australia); Torres-Marín, Jorge (Department of Experimental Psychology, University of Granada, Granada, Spain); Włodarczyk, Anna (School of Psychology, Universidad Católica del Norte, Antofagasta, Chile); de Aquino, Sibele Dias (Pontifical Catholic University of Rio de Janeiro (PUC-Rio), Rio de Janeiro, Brazil); Volkodav, Tatiana (Department of Pedagogy and Psychology, Kuban State University in Krasnodar, Krasnodar, Russia); Krammer, Georg (University College for Teacher Education Styria, Graz, Austria)","Schermer, Julie Aitken (Western University)","Schermer, Julie Aitken (Western University); Papazova, Eva Boyanova (Department of Psychology, IPHS-BAS, Sofia, Bulgaria); Kwiatkowska, Maria Magdalena (Cardinal Stefan Wyszyński University in Warsaw); Rogoza, Radosław (Cardinal Stefan Wyszyński University in Warsaw); Park, Joonha (NUCB Business School, Nagoya, Japan); Kowalski, Christopher Marcin (Western University); Branković, Marija (Singidunum University); Doroszuk, Marta (Jagiellonian University); Khanh Ha, Truong Thi (Vietnam National University, Hanoi); Iliško, Dzintra (Daugavpils University); Malik, Sadia (University of Sargodha); Lins, Samuel (University of Porto); Navarro-Carrillo, Ginés (University of Jaén); Oviedo-Trespalacios, Oscar (Centre for Accident Research and Road Safety-Queensland (CARRS-Q), Kelvin Grove, QLD, Australia); Torres-Marín, Jorge (University of Granada); Włodarczyk, Anna (Catholic University of the North); de Aquino, Sibele Dias (Pontifical Catholic University of Rio de Janeiro); Volkodav, Tatiana (Kuban State University); Krammer, Georg (University College for Teacher Education Styria, Graz, Austria)",0,0,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1172312365,52 Psychology; 5205 Social and Personality Psychology,3 Good Health and Well Being

The proposed model explicitly takes into account the spatio-temporal structure of traffic flow, systematically considering the interdependencies between vehicle passages through conflict points of crossing and merging as well as on exit roads. The statistical dependencies used in the model for the time interval between successive vehicles on the route and the difference in their speeds are determined. Methods for obtaining such dependencies from monitoring data are considered. The proposed approach can be used to analyze the current passage of flows and to select a method for structural- parametric control of an intersection.

Its regulatory regimes for public procurement and for anti-corruption are nonetheless distinct. Despite knowledge of significant corruption in the final decades of apartheid, anti-corruption was treated as a secondary rather than a primary objective in the initial phase of post-apartheid reform and the design of public procurement. Rules against corruption in public procurement have largely taken the form of criminal offences in the anti-corruption regime and the form of administrative rules internal to government within the public procurement system, neither form of which has been effective. The lack of attention to the overlap of these two regimes has created the potential for continued growth of corruption in public procurement. As a reaction to the COVID-19 pandemic as well as belatedly to the grand corruption termed ‘state capture,’ the South African government recently introduced several measures and strengthened institutions to address corruption linked to public procurement; these currently are more investigative and ad-hoc rather than systemic and preventive. Finally, operating typically under the surface, the dynamics of both the public procurement of IT products and services and IT utilized within public procurement in South Africa often make significant contributions to both the enabling and the prevention of corruption in this system.",,,,Routledge Handbook of Public Procurement Corruption,,,2024-03-27,2024,2024-03-27,,,,457-473,Closed,Chapter,"Klaaren, Jonathan; Belvedere, Florencia; Brunette, Ryan; Gray, Nomtha","Klaaren, Jonathan (); Belvedere, Florencia (); Brunette, Ryan (); Gray, Nomtha ()",,"Klaaren, Jonathan (); Belvedere, Florencia (); Brunette, Ryan (); Gray, Nomtha ()",0,0,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1170225460,44 Human Society; 4407 Policy and Administration,"16 Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions"

Then the conversational systems are characterized based on the level of inclusion of artificial intelligence techniques. Finally, the integration of conversational systems with different computational intelligence techniques is reviewed. The analysis identifies that there are many opportunities and lines open to research. In particular, the need to strengthen the application of neutrosophic theory and sets for the evaluation of conversations is identified.

The book explores a wide range of theoretical and methodological perspectives while offering practical insights to address the intricate issues surrounding return migration and crises. The topics covered within this volume include return migration trends, the pivotal roles and contributions of return migrants, the social, psychological, and policy challenges faced by returnees, emerging issues stemming from return migration in their home countries, and the public and formal responses to return migration and the reintegration of returnees, and the roles of crises in these areas. This edited volume brings together diverse perspectives of academic researchers, practitioners, and policymakers on return migration. The book features cases of multiple non-Western countries in Asia (Philippines, China, India), Europe (Lithuania, Turkey, & Ukraine), the Middle East and North Africa (Morocco), and South America and the Caribbean (Mexico, Peru & Dominican Republic). Findings provide a unique opportunity to critically explore current thinking on return migration and investigate the relationship between migration and crisis from varying policy and operational viewpoints. This book, hence, attends to practitioners to develop creative solutions to both global and local policies and practices of return migration management in emerging market countries, which will support and accommodate both their returnees and residents amid challenging times.

It is a problem that has traditionally been treated by formal methodologies. But current trends in project development have a greater focus on agile methodologies. This situation causes greater variability in project plans. In the particular case of BIM methodologies, the approach is aimed at achieving the simulation of the production process through virtual construction. In this context, in this work, a critical analysis of different approaches that deal with the construction of project schedules is carried out. In particular, the problem is analyzed from a hybrid perspective. The approach proposed by project management standards and the approach to scheduling problems raised by computer science are analyzed. As a result of the analysis, a group of lines open to research are proposed that combine traditional tendencies with metaheuristics.",,,Studies in Computational Intelligence,Computational Intelligence in Engineering and Project Management,"Pedro Yobanis Piñero Pérez, Janusz Kacprzyk, Rafael Bello Pérez, Iliana Pérez Pupo",,2024-02-20,2024,2024-02-20,2024,1134,,57-88,Closed,Chapter,"Piñero Pérez, Pedro Yobanis; Pupo, Iliana Pérez; Mahdi, Gaafar Sadeq Saeed; Quintana, Julio Madera; Acuña, Luis Alvarado","Piñero Pérez, Pedro Yobanis (Artificial Intelligence for a Sustainable Development Group, IADES, Havana, Cuba); Pupo, Iliana Pérez (Artificial Intelligence for a Sustainable Development Group, IADES, Havana, Cuba); Mahdi, Gaafar Sadeq Saeed (Artificial Intelligence for a Sustainable Development Group, IADES, Havana, Cuba); Quintana, Julio Madera (Vicerrectoría de Informatización, Universidad de Camagüey, Camagüey, Cuba); Acuña, Luis Alvarado (Departamento de Ingeniería de La Construcción, Universidad Católica del Norte, Antofagasta, Chile)","Piñero Pérez, Pedro Yobanis (Artificial Intelligence for a Sustainable Development Group, IADES, Havana, Cuba)","Piñero Pérez, Pedro Yobanis (Artificial Intelligence for a Sustainable Development Group, IADES, Havana, Cuba); Pupo, Iliana Pérez (Artificial Intelligence for a Sustainable Development Group, IADES, Havana, Cuba); Mahdi, Gaafar Sadeq Saeed (Artificial Intelligence for a Sustainable Development Group, IADES, Havana, Cuba); Quintana, Julio Madera (University of Camagüey); Acuña, Luis Alvarado (Catholic University of the North)",0,0,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1168985431,40 Engineering; 4005 Civil Engineering,

However, although there is a broad application with different demands for starches, starch sources and, consequently, their properties, are limited by nature. Accordingly, this chapter discusses novel processing technologies to enhance starch functionality, achieving new properties and applications, and improving performance. We selected as the promising emerging technologies: ozone, ultrasound, high pressure processing, high homogenization processing, pulsed electric field, and cold plasma. Each technology has specific mechanisms of interaction with starch, resulting in different levels of structural modification (at granular and molecular levels) and functionalities. For each one, we present a brief description of the technology and its principles, a discussion about the main results when used for starch modification, some possible applications, limitations, and future perspectives. Although some techniques are more explored and ready for industrial implementation (e.g., ozonation), others still require more studies (e.g., pulsed electric field), including both their potential and scale-up. We also suggested further studies focusing on specific applications for the modified starches.",,,,Starch in Food,,,2024,2024,,2024,,,213-233,Closed,Chapter,"Bitencourt, Bruna Sousa; Guedes, Jaqueline Souza; Maniglia, Bianca Chieregato; Castanha, Nanci; Rojas, Meliza Lindsay; Augusto, Pedro E.D.","Bitencourt, Bruna Sousa (Department of Agri-food Industry, Food and Nutrition (LAN), Luiz de Queiroz College of Agriculture (ESALQ), University of São Paulo (USP), Piracicaba, SP, Brazil); Guedes, Jaqueline Souza (Department of Agri-food Industry, Food and Nutrition (LAN), Luiz de Queiroz College of Agriculture (ESALQ), University of São Paulo (USP), Piracicaba, SP, Brazil); Maniglia, Bianca Chieregato (São Carlos Institute of Chemistry (IQSC), University of São Paulo (USP), São Carlos, SP, Brazil); Castanha, Nanci (Department of Agri-food Industry, Food and Nutrition (LAN), Luiz de Queiroz College of Agriculture (ESALQ), University of São Paulo (USP), Piracicaba, SP, Brazil); Rojas, Meliza Lindsay (Dirección de Investigación, Innovación y Responsabilidad Social, Universidad Privada del Norte (UPN), Trujillo, Peru); Augusto, Pedro E.D.

The resulting schedule must have the properties of being executed with the least possible time and cost and with a balanced quality of the solution. In this research, a set of new distribution estimation algorithms is presented to solve this problem. Furthermore, the behavior of different evolutionary algorithms in the construction of schedules is compared. The experimental results show the viability of evolutionary algorithms for the agile construction of chronograms and their potential use in BIM environments. In the experimentation, a set of 150 instances collected in 15 databases from the PSPLib library were used. The sensitivity of the behavior of the algorithms is evaluated in the following scenarios: variation in the number of execution modes, in the number of tasks, in the number of renewable resources, and in the number of non-renewable resources, demonstrating the feasibility of the solutions.",,,Studies in Computational Intelligence,Computational Intelligence in Engineering and Project Management,"Pedro Yobanis Piñero Pérez, Janusz Kacprzyk, Rafael Bello Pérez, Iliana Pérez Pupo",,2024-02-20,2024,2024-02-20,2024,1134,,131-187,Closed,Chapter,"Piñero Pérez, Pedro Yobanis; Pupo, Iliana Pérez; Mahdi, Sadeq Saeed; Quintana, Julio Madera; Acuña, Luis Alvarado","Piñero Pérez, Pedro Yobanis (Artificial Intelligence for a Sustainable Development Group, IADES, Havana, Cuba); Pupo, Iliana Pérez (Artificial Intelligence for a Sustainable Development Group, IADES, Havana, Cuba); Mahdi, Sadeq Saeed (Artificial Intelligence for a Sustainable Development Group, IADES, Havana, Cuba); Quintana, Julio Madera (Vicerrectoría de Informatización, Universidad de Camagüey, Camagüey, Cuba); Acuña, Luis Alvarado (Departamento de Ingeniería de La Construcción, Universidad Católica del Norte, Antofagasta, Chile)","Piñero Pérez, Pedro Yobanis (Artificial Intelligence for a Sustainable Development Group, IADES, Havana, Cuba)","Piñero Pérez, Pedro Yobanis (Artificial Intelligence for a Sustainable Development Group, IADES, Havana, Cuba); Pupo, Iliana Pérez (Artificial Intelligence for a Sustainable Development Group, IADES, Havana, Cuba); Mahdi, Sadeq Saeed (Artificial Intelligence for a Sustainable Development Group, IADES, Havana, Cuba); Quintana, Julio Madera (University of Camagüey); Acuña, Luis Alvarado (Catholic University of the North)",0,0,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1168994275,40 Engineering; 4005 Civil Engineering,13 Climate Action; 7 Affordable and Clean Energy

Marshalling insights from diverse sciences including physiology, comparative psychology, developmental biology, and evolutionary biology, the book provides an up-to-date survey of approaches to non-human organisms as agents, capable of performing activities serving their own goals such as surviving or reproducing, and whose doings in the world are thus to be explained teleologically. From an Integrated History and Philosophy of Science perspective, the book contributes to a better conceptual and theoretical understanding of organismal agency, advancing some suggestions on how to study it empirically and how to frame it in relation to wider scientific and philosophical traditions. It also provides new historical entry points for examining the deployment, trajectories, and challenges of agential views of organisms in the history of biology and philosophy. This book will be of interest to philosophers of biology; historians of science; biologists interested in analysing the active roles of organisms in development, ecological interactions, and evolution; philosophers and practitioners of the cognitive sciences; and philosophers and historians of philosophy working on purposiveness and teleology.",,,,,,,2024-06-21,2024,2024-06-21,,,,,Closed,Edited Book,,,,,0,0,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1173131246,"43 History, Heritage and Archaeology; 4303 Historical Studies; 50 Philosophy and Religious Studies; 5002 History and Philosophy Of Specific Fields",4 Quality Education

Bodies on the Front Lines situates recent performances and protests within legacies of homegrown gender and sexual rights activism from the South. Performances—enacted in public spaces and intimate venues, across national borders, and through circulating hashtags and digital media—play crucial roles in the elaboration, auto-theorization, translation, and reception of feminist, queer, and trans activism. Movements such as Argentina's NiUnaMenos (Not One Less) have brought masses of protesters and “artivists” on the streets of major cities in Latin America and beyond to denounce gender violence and demand gender, sexual, and reproductive rights.   The volume’s contributors draw from rich legacies of theater, performance, and activism in the region, as well as decolonial and intersectional theorizing, to demonstrate the ways that performance practices enable activists to sustain their movements. The chapters engage diverse perspectives from Argentina, Brazil, Bolivia, Chile, Colombia, Cuba, the Dominican Republic, transnational Central America, Peru, Puerto Rico, and Mexico.   Rather than taking an approach that simplifies complexities among states, Bodies on the Front Lines takes seriously the geopolitical stakes of examining Latin America and the Caribbean as a heterogeneous site of nations and networks. In chapters covering this wide geographical area, leading scholars in the fields of theater and performance studies showcase the aesthetic, social, and political work of performance in generating and fortifying gender and sexual activism in the Americas.",,,,,"Brenda Werth, Katherine Zien",,2024,2024,,,,,,Closed,Monograph,"Werth, Brenda; Zien, Katherine","Werth, Brenda (); Zien, Katherine ()",,"Werth, Brenda (); Zien, Katherine ()",1,1,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1161685359,44 Human Society; 4405 Gender Studies,"16 Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions; 5 Gender Equality"

During the COVID-19 pandemic, the global race for health and ancillary goods amid global supply chain disruptions demonstrated that, when tested, all countries are incredibly vulnerable to fraud and corruption in public procurement, irrespective of their level of development. Yet despite the widespread nature of the problem, there remains a lack of in-depth, analytical, and cross-country investigations into public procurement corruption. This book addresses this gap by providing a comprehensive, multidisciplinary, geographically balanced treatise on corruption in public procurement. It combines country-specific studies to allow readers to easily compare differing perspectives and approaches and overarching thematic chapters to reflect on new and cutting-edge issues in procurement and their implications for procurement corruption. Key sectors such as healthcare and infrastructure are considered, as well as the role of new technologies, in both combatting and enabling procurement corruption. This Handbook provides academics, practitioners, and graduate researchers of public administration, law, and anti-corruption with all of the tools they need to understand the nuances of public procurement corruption around the world.",,,,,,,2024-03-27,2024,2024-03-27,,,,,Closed,Edited Book,,,,,0,0,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1170225436,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3507 Strategy, Management and Organisational Behaviour","16 Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions"

With wide-reaching regional coverage and expert analysis from Asia, North and South America, Europe, the Middle East, and North Africa, this handbook reveals cross-country, and cross-regional, analysis and insights and presents in-depth explanations and consequences of autocratization. Arranged in five thematic parts, chapters explore the basic aspects of conceptualization, theorization, and measurement of autocratization; the role of various political and non-political actors as perpetrators, supporters, bystanders, or defenders of democracy against autocratization processes; and the consequences across various policy fields. Showcasing cutting-edge research developments, the handbook illustrates the deeply complex nature of the field, examining important topics in need of renewed consideration at a time of growing concerns for democracy and the global spread of authoritarian challenges to democracy. The Routledge Handbook of Autocratization will be a key reference for those interested in, and studying authoritarianism, democratization, human rights, governance, democracy and more broadly comparative politics, and regional/area studies.",,,,,,,2024-05-03,2024,2024-05-03,,,,,Closed,Edited Book,,,,,1,1,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1171358334,44 Human Society; 4407 Policy and Administration; 4408 Political Science,"16 Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions"

Bringing together some of the best minds about corruption, ethics, and governance from a multidisciplinary perspective, the book pushes critical thinking to interrogate interventions that could stamp out and stop the rot of corruption in society. The book investigates the behaviours of officials and politicians engaging in acts of corruption and considers how state institutions have been captured and corrupted by these people. Considering South Africa’s historical and regional context, the book also considers the role of watchdogs, auditors, and public opinion. In suggesting mechanisms for combating and preventing corruption, the book ultimately advocates for long-lasting preventive interventions instead of current short-lived and costly approaches to combating corruption. Combining original case studies, empirical work, and some comparisons in Zimbabwe and Botswana with South Africa, this book will be of interest to students, researchers, and policymakers working on corruption, ethics, and governance from the context of public administration and law.",,,,,,,2024-03-25,2024,2024-03-25,,,,,Closed,Edited Book,,,,,0,0,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1170147937,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3507 Strategy, Management and Organisational Behaviour; 44 Human Society; 4407 Policy and Administration; 4408 Political Science; 50 Philosophy and Religious Studies; 5001 Applied Ethics","16 Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions"

The key assumption underlying the book is that accountability is inherently an identity-creating process where the study of account-making has to be done participatively, with radical openness to the one(s) being researched, as well as to their context. That openness we call ‘ethnography’. The values or assumptions inherent to the practices of account- and identity-making, in a specific context, are what (auto-)ethnographies seek to describe and identify. These values and assumptions warrant critical, ethical reflection, and this is what the researchers presented here have tried to provide. The chapters in this book all are mini-studies of relatedness. The scale of examination is intimate; the reflections provided by the researchers are mainly methodological. This book is of interest to accounting and organization theory students and scholars who believe that accountability can fruitfully be studied through (auto-)ethnography.

This book argues that the materiality of our times, and particularly its ruins and rubbish, reveals something profound and disturbing about modern societies. It examines the political, ethical, aesthetic, and epistemological foundations of contemporary archaeology and characterizes the excess of the contemporary period through its material traces. This book remains the first attempt at describing the contemporary era from an archaeological point of view. Global in scope, the book brings together case studies from every continent and considers sources from peripheral and rarely considered traditions, meanwhile engaging in interdisciplinary dialogue with philosophy, anthropology, history, and geography. This new edition includes the latest developments in the field, both methodological and theoretical, and adds new and exciting case studies to engage students. It also covers some of the most pressing issues of the present, as they are being addressed by archaeologists, such as pandemics, the antiracist movement, the global rise of reactionary populism, the ecological crisis, and climate change. An Archaeology of the Contemporary Era is essential reading for students and practitioners of the contemporary past, historical archaeology, and archaeological theory.

Contributors also examine the impact of activism on policy advocacy and legislation, as well as groups who the Black Lives Matter movement focus on such as women and immigrants. The first part of the book focuses on making Black Lives Matter in academic studies, governmental data, and politics. The next section focuses on the impact of Black activism on policy and legislation in Brazil, Colombia, and Peru. Black activists have been fighting for Black lives throughout Latin America and their struggles have not been in vain, although less policy change has occurred in Peru. The last section finds that social media has allowed for more independent forms of Black activism in Brazil and Cuba.

13,pub.1168557205,10.4324/9781003011644,,,The Routledge Handbook of English-Medium Instruction in Higher Education,"This Handbook discusses the theoretical and disciplinary background to the study of English-medium instruction (EMI) in higher education worldwide. It highlights issues relating to EMI pedagogy, varying motivations for EMI education, and the delivery of EMI in diverse contexts across the world. The spread of English as a teaching medium and the lingua franca of the academic world has been the subject of various debates in recent years on the perceived hegemony of the English language and the ‘domain loss’ of non-English languages in academic communication. Encompassing a wide range of contributions to the field of EMI, the chapters of this Handbook are arranged in four distinct parts: Part I provides an overview of English-medium instruction in higher education worldwide; Part II focusses on EMI in Europe; Part III on EMI in the Middle East, North Africa, and Sub-Saharan Africa; and Part IV on EMI in the Asian region. The overall scope and level of expertise of this Handbook provides an unrivalled overview of this field of education. It serves as an essential reference for many courses dealing with applied linguistics, English language education, multilingualism, sociolinguistics, and related subjects at many levels of education, including Master’s and PhD-level studies. This Handbook serves as a valuable edition for university libraries across the world and an essential read for many faculty, undergraduate and postgraduate students, educators, and policymakers.",,,,,,,2024-02-02,2024,2024-02-02,,,,,Closed,Edited Book,,,,,5,5,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1168557205,"47 Language, Communication and Culture; 4703 Language Studies; 4704 Linguistics",4 Quality Education

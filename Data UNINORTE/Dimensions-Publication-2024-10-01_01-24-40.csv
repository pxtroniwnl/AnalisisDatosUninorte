The existence of these challenges requires the implementation of research platforms and the development of technologies that allow their study. This paper presents a laboratory for the research and teaching of power quality disturbance in active distribution networks, which is addressed as an educational tool for power quality concepts. This work presents a series of experiments that allow electrical and electronics engineering students actual testing of the concepts reviewed in theoretical classes. The experiments are summarized in the study of the power quality classical disturbances, such as voltage regulation and harmonic distortion in distribution networks by three operating scenarios. The results obtained show that the integration of distributed generators for voltage support presented an improved of voltage profile by 4 %, but also there was an increase of voltage and current harmonic distortion by 20% and 60% respectively. Otherwise, the implementation of natural filters presented a reduction in voltage and current harmonic distortion by 15% and 45% respectively. The above shown that these experiments allow teaching to the engineering students, conclusions that are well known in the technical literature of the power quality.",,,,2019 IEEE Workshop on Power Electronics and Power Quality Applications (PEPQA),,,2019-05-31,2019,,2019-05-31,00,,1-6,Closed,Proceeding,"Orozco-Henao, C.; Marín-Quintero, J.; Castillo-Sierra, Rafael; Velez, Juan C.; Oliveros, Ingrid; Pardo, Mauricio","Orozco-Henao, C.

In high magnitude events the total recovery time is measured in months or years. These long recoveries are performed in multiple stages and different recovery rates. Traditional resilience metrics have been designed to study strictly increasing recovery functions, which is not a valid assumption for the multi-stage recovery case. This paper defines a model to measure resilience for a multi-stage recovery scenario, where the recovery process is performed in two or more stages with possibly different recovery rates. A linear approximation metric is proposed to improve resilience level estimation accuracy. The new metric is tested on a case study of the Dique Canal breach in Colombia occurred in 2010. The adapted resilience metric is combined with an optimization model to maximize the average performance on multi-stage scenarios, enabling decision makers to decide the best strategy per stage for a predefined budget. A comparative analysis confirms that the proposed model offers a better resilience estimation than previous linear average performance metrics.",The authors thank the referees for their helpful comments that significantly contributed to improving the quality of the paper.

Port community systems (PCS), as platforms for connecting the stakeholders of a port community (PC), build a basis for improving information exchange. These systems support automation and visibility along global supply chains, thereby helping to enhance the overall PC performance in both local and foreign trade activities. However, successful real-world PCS adoption often involves multiple collaborating parties interacting with at least two different types of PC stakeholders. This study assesses the payoff of the alliances between three types of stakeholders to ensure the adoption of a PCS. In order to accomplish the former, it also identifies the different possible collaborations at the inception of a PCS. We use different simulated scenarios to obtain the expected payoff of each stakeholder, in terms of lead time savings achieved, and based on the Shapley value method allocate profits to each coalition. Also, we present a sensitivity analysis to test each coalition with different variation of the market while adopting a PCS. The main result is that profits gained from the adoption of a PCS funded by the port community grand coalition are higher than those from pairs or individual members. Also, the profits gained from the coalition of two cooperative members are higher than any individual effort. Therefore, the stakeholders’ individual incentive to join a PCS coalition should be relatively high coming from a steady coalition.",,,Lecture Notes in Computer Science,Computational Logistics,"Carlos Paternina-Arboleda, Stefan Voß",,2019-09-20,2019,2019-09-20,2019,11756,,136-153,Closed,Chapter,"Moros-Daza, Adriana; Amaya-Mier, René; Garcia-Llinas, Guisselle; Voß, Stefan","Moros-Daza, Adriana (Institute of Information Systems (IWI), University of Hamburg, Hamburg, Germany; Department of Industrial Engineering, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); Amaya-Mier, René (Department of Industrial Engineering, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); Garcia-Llinas, Guisselle (Department of Industrial Engineering, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); Voß, Stefan (Institute of Information Systems (IWI), University of Hamburg, Hamburg, Germany)","Moros-Daza, Adriana (Universität Hamburg; Universidad del Norte)","Moros-Daza, Adriana (Universität Hamburg; Universidad del Norte); Amaya-Mier, René (Universidad del Norte); Garcia-Llinas, Guisselle (Universidad del Norte); Voß, Stefan (Universität Hamburg)",7,1,,2.45,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1121118219,46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4609 Information Systems,

Among the non-conventional sources, the energy produced by the ocean has drawn the attention of many researchers due to their enormous potential, generating studies around this issue. Currently, there exist various types of mechanisms to absorb the energy of the ocean, the wave energy converter, the tidal energy converters, and others. In this paper, we study a wave energy converter through the utilization of Simulink/MATLAB software. The proposed device is a slider-crank mechanism connected to a spherical buoy. To ensure the continuous generation of energy from the device, under different conditions of the wave, a flywheel is implemented.

The proposed system interconnects different energy sources (i.e. grid, solar, wind and batteries) in a DC-based core eliminating the necessity of synchronization schemes. If the grid fails, the system acts as an uninterruptible power system proving energy from the other sources without any transfer time. A diode-based OR-gate circuitry is able to self-commutate given the I vs V curve of the solar panel allowing source combination to be transparent to the user. The diode efficiency is estimated and measured reporting close to 94%, which justifies the proposed DC core approach. The system is complemented with converters that, for the case of commercially available devices, produce a measured total efficiency up to 82%. Such performance metric is possible considering a battery system with embedded configuration mechanism that bypasses the batteries when not required. For this work, the battery pack is selected small, so that the system can be kept affordable in terms of price and maintenance. As the backup system is limited, the platform is equipped with a load shedding strategy to provide uninterruptible energy only to predefined essential loads. During normal operation, the proposed system offers economic benefits for users since reduces the power energy required from the grid.","The authors thank Universidad del Norte for the support given through the Energy Strategic Area program and for the availability of the Renewable Energies Laboratory, UniGRID, supported by the autonomous patrimony national of funding for science, technology and innovation FRANCISCO JOSE DE CALDAS.",,,2019 IEEE Texas Power and Energy Conference (TPEC),,,2019-02-08,2019,,2019-02-08,00,,1-6,Closed,Proceeding,"Navarro, Loraine; Santiago, Miguel; Pardo, Mauricio","Navarro, Loraine (Electrical and Electronics Eng.

The device employs the heat gradient developed between a metal plate that concentrates the solar radiation and a dissipative material. First, TEG modeling is presented to favor the estimation of the available power; next, a design of experiments is carried out to determine the maximum solar radiation during a day. Then, a performance analysis demonstrates conversion efficiencies higher that 20%, which surpasses the efficiency of any commercially available solar panel; while keeping the same superficial area of only 16cm2. Thus, given such performance metric, a complete power unit is devised complementing the TEG operation with a 3.7V 550mAh Li-Po battery. The complete unit is able to provide enough energy to power up an Arduino–like based sensing unit and charge an on-board battery guaranteeing in that way a continuous operation. The total energy available from the prototype allows maintaining a battery discharge percentage of 50% when powering up a maximum load of 133.61mW during selected ranges.","The authors thank Universidad del Norte for the support given through National Fund for Financing Science, Technology and Innovation – Francisco José de Caldas Fund–.",,,2019 IEEE Sensors Applications Symposium (SAS),,,2019-03-13,2019,,2019-03-13,00,,1-6,Closed,Proceeding,"Charris, Daniela; Gómez, Diego; Pardo, Mauricio","Charris, Daniela (Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); Gómez, Diego (Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); Pardo, Mauricio (Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia)","Charris, Daniela (Universidad del Norte)","Charris, Daniela (Universidad del Norte); Gómez, Diego (Universidad del Norte); Pardo, Mauricio (Universidad del Norte)",5,2,,0.78,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1113946271,"34 Chemical Sciences; 40 Engineering; 4009 Electronics, Sensors and Digital Hardware; 4016 Materials Engineering",7 Affordable and Clean Energy

For the modeling of the wind turbine, the Betz equations were used, with which it is possible to determine the efficiency of the wind turbine to convert the kinetic energy into electrical energy using the power coefficient. For the P&O controller, wind speed and angular velocity were used as inputs.

Students create maps using coordinates, lengths, areas, volumes, angles and slopes. The course is the foundation of other courses such as Road Design and Hydrology. Therefore, students in Surveying and Geoinformation require meaningful learning for applying their knowledge during their careers. However, the course has a fail rate higher than 30%. Course professors analyzed the situation and found that a high percentage of students lack basic concepts in geometry and trigonometry. Since professors could not use the class time for basic subjects, they followed the idea of automated reviews and developed an intervention for students to use virtual tutors to refresh (or acquire) the knowledge required to be successful at the course. Results show that students using virtual tutors were able to use their basic knowledge on more complex problems, improving significantly compared to previous courses that did not use the tools.",This work was funded by the Center for Excellence in Teaching (CEDU) at Universidad del Norte.

During the period when the process is under statistical control, the mean values are contained in their objective value; after the occurrence of an assignable cause, a shift is produced. To detect the occurrence of the assignable cause, we propose a model of control charts with variable parameters to monitor the process and issue warning signals. The technical and economic success of implementing this tool depends on the adequate selection of parameters for the chart such as sample size, sample interval and the coefficient of the control limits. A cost-based model based on the Taguchi loss function was used to select the parameters and multi-objective optimization techniques on the response surfaces to find the optimal levels to minimize the cost and maximize the statistical potential of the chart. The fitting of the multiple regression models was necessary to assess the statistical and economic performance. Subsequently, we constructed a desirability function to simultaneously integrate the statistical and economic design. We identified and quantified the most significant design parameters and the effect of repetition. Finally, we reviewed the impact of the auto-correlation coefficient on the optimal selection of parameters. The results demonstrated that when considering an economic and statistical objective, the sample size is a significant variable in the monitoring of the process.",,,,"2019 6th International Conference on Control, Decision and Information Technologies (CoDIT)",,,2019-04-23,2019,,2019-04-23,00,,379-384,Closed,Proceeding,"Oviedo-Trespalacios, Oscar; Peñabaena-Niebles, Rita","Oviedo-Trespalacios, Oscar (Industrial Engineering, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia; Ph.D© Industrial Engineering, Queensland University of Technology, Brisbane, Australia; Department of Industrial Engineering, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); Peñabaena-Niebles, Rita (Industrial Engineering, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia; Department of Industrial Engineering, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia; Ph.

Harmonic distortions are usually eliminated using filters, however, their allocation in the system requires attention. An inadequate allocation of filters might harm Power Quality (PQ) and can increase harmonic distortion at other buses by harmonic flow changes. We consider that filters are single-phase. The methodology is based on modeling and simulation on Alternative Transient Program (ATP/EMTP) and Matrix Laboratory (MATLAB) where the indices of harmonic distortions are verified. Different scenarios are generated through the Non-Dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGAII), then using an automatic simulator, all them run on ATP while MATLAB evaluates each one through multi-objective function. The problem is composed by two objectives, they are conflicting, one aims to decrease the harmonic distortion and the other to reduce the filters cost.

                  Utilization of waste heat from an energy conversion process is a key step in improving the overall energy system conversion efficiency and reducing the cost of energy. Since a supercritical CO2 Brayton power cycle is being considered as an important cycle for the conversion of solar energy to power, we propose to utilize the heat rejected from this cycle to feed a bottoming thermodynamic cycle. Goswami cycle can utilize the low temperature waste heat to produce both power and cooling in the same loop. Moreover, refrigeration and space cooling are usually more expensive than heating in most applications. This paper describes the modeling and simulation results of the combined Brayton and Goswami cycles. The mass flow ratio of the two cycles is determined by the heat exchanger effectiveness method, constraining the minimum allowed temperature difference. The operating parameters that yield the best performance in terms of overall cycle efficiency, net work, and cooling outputs were found through the optimization of a numerical model developed in MATLAB.

From the early 1990s, business decisions and processes started to be driven increasingly by data and data analysis. Further investment in data management was the approach taken to tackle the increasing volume, velocity, and variety of data, such as complex data repositories, data warehouses, and complex information systems. Data needed to be shared between multiple systems, which gave origin to the master data management. The first attempts of Data Management and Data Governance were failed, owing that, they were conducted by Information Technology division; today, Data Governance is still an under-researched area.In Colombia, very few organizations have started to implement Data Governance programs. There are IT Governance initiatives, within which there may be some particular linings for Data Quality or Metadata Management, as well as for Information Security. In the year 2014, the Ministerio de Tecnologías de la Información (MinTIC, a national government organization) designed a guide for Data Governance, which must be followed by every public institution, as part of the national policies such as Gobierno Digital Colombia.

The loss of reproductive efficiency of animals and cattle rustling have become one of the main concerns of farmers. The decrease in reproductive efficiency is mainly due to the low percentage in heat detection. Reproductive efficiency is commonly measured by the interval between births, which affects the daily milk production of the cow during its productive life and the income associated with the sale of milk from its production, conditioning the profitability of the farmers. The zeal for its part consists of the theft of bovine cattle that usually is used for its commercialization, bringing considerable losses. According to figures from the Observatory of Human Rights and International Humanitarian Law of the Fundacion Colombia Ganadera, Fundagán, only during 2014 there were 164 cases of cattle rustling, resulting in the loss of 3,798 cattle throughout the country, which represents a loss for the producers of 15 billion of Colombian money. This project proposes the development of a technological platform that combines hardware, software and communications systems of the latest technology and with open standards to provide an economic and reliable solution to the Colombian and Latin American livestock industry. In Colombia, there is a history of products and prototypes that have been developed to alleviate this problem, no platforms of similar benefits have been found that are accessible to farmers in the country. In this article, the different stages developed to obtain a validated prototype with the beneficiary entity and their respective results are socialized.","To the company extreme technologies for the development of the information platform and to the company Fegacesar, for allowing the piloting of this solution.",,Lecture Notes in Computer Science,Computer Information Systems and Industrial Management,"Khalid Saeed, Rituparna Chaki, Valentina Janev",,2019-08-11,2019,2019-08-11,2019,11703,,232-239,Closed,Chapter,"Ariza-Colpas, Paola; Morales-Ortega, Roberto; Piñeres-Melo, Marlon Alberto; Melendez-Pertuz, Farid; Serrano-Torné, Guillermo; Hernandez-Sanchez, Guillermo; Martínez-Osorio, Hugo","Ariza-Colpas, Paola (Universidad de la Costa, CUC, Barranquilla, Colombia); Morales-Ortega, Roberto (Universidad de la Costa, CUC, Barranquilla, Colombia); Piñeres-Melo, Marlon Alberto (Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); Melendez-Pertuz, Farid (Universidad de la Costa, CUC, Barranquilla, Colombia); Serrano-Torné, Guillermo (Extreme Technologies, Barranquilla, Colombia); Hernandez-Sanchez, Guillermo (Extreme Technologies, Barranquilla, Colombia); Martínez-Osorio, Hugo (Extreme Technologies, Barranquilla, Colombia)","Ariza-Colpas, Paola (University of the Coast)","Ariza-Colpas, Paola (University of the Coast); Morales-Ortega, Roberto (University of the Coast); Piñeres-Melo, Marlon Alberto (Universidad del Norte); Melendez-Pertuz, Farid (University of the Coast); Serrano-Torné, Guillermo (Extreme Technologies, Barranquilla, Colombia); Hernandez-Sanchez, Guillermo (Extreme Technologies, Barranquilla, Colombia); Martínez-Osorio, Hugo (Extreme Technologies, Barranquilla, Colombia)",7,0,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1120970709,46 Information and Computing Sciences,8 Decent Work and Economic Growth

Many pieces of research in the field of psychology, neuropsychology and cognitive neurosciences, have detailed the way in which the extraction of such information is carried out, even proposing models of the functioning of visual attention. From these models, computer scientists have proposed computational variants, which imitate human visual attention. This field of research is known as saliency detection on images. In this paper, a new and simple approach for detecting visual saliencies based on Dictionary Learning and Sparse Coding is presented. Our method first subdivides the image into full overlapped patches and runs a dictionary learning over them for obtaining its sparse representation. Then, by analyzing the sparse coding matrix, we compute how many image patches a dictionary atom affects in order to classify them as frequent or rare. Then, we calculate the saliency map of the image according to the composition of the image patches, i.e. an image patch is considered salient if it is mainly composed of rare atoms, an atom is rare whether it affects a few patches.

In Colombia, the agricultural sector contributes approximately 11.83% of the national GDP at current prices, according to the Bank of the Republic. Likewise, the livestock industry participates with 3.6%, in comparison with other sectors of the agricultural economy, the production of Colombian cattle doubles and triples to other sectors, such as poultry, coffee and floriculture. In addition, it contributes to the generation of employment in more than 25% of the total jobs generated in the agricultural sector and approximately 7% of the total employment of the Colombian economy (http://www.banrep.gov.co/is/pib). Within agricultural production, livestock occupy 38 million hectares, being 9 times larger than the area dedicated to agriculture. However, agriculture contributes 63% of the value of agricultural production, while livestock, mainly extensive, contributes 26% (FEDEGAN, Strategic Livestock Plan 2019).

1614,pub.1123247560,10.1201/9780429264702-57,,,Environmental and mechanical benefits of cold recycled bituminous mixes with crumb rubber,"Cold mix recycling technologies based on asphalt emulsion have been acknowledged for allowing to reduce the environmental burdens associated with road pavement maintenance and rehabilitation. In fact, mixing and placement are conducted at lower temperatures leading to energy savings, a reduction of asphalt aging, fume and odor releasing, and a general decrease of airborne emissions. However, there are still several concerns related to the high variability of reclaimed asphalt pavement (RAP), the lack of standard mix-design procedures and the fair/low mechanical performance often achieved especially due to poor moisture resistance. On other side, the addition of crumb rubber into hot mix asphalts is considered an environmentally-friendly and cost-effective practice in several countries. Producing bituminous cold mixes containing crumb rubber to develop a “greener” paving material with a performance level comparable to that of conventional materials, represents a great challenge to materials engineering. This paper presents the results of a laboratory investigation concerning the mix-design characteristics of cold 100%-recycled asphalt emulsion mixes, using crumb rubber to improve cold recycling engineered properties. Mechanical and volumetric properties were assessed through fatigue tests, dynamic modulus and indirect tensile strength on dry and water-conditioned specimens. Finally, a life cycle assessment of alternative maintenance and rehabilitation treatments was conducted to quantify both engineered and environmental advantages in relation to the conventional materials. The growing societal concern about the environmental effects of constructing, operating and maintaining the highway infrastructure network has led pavement community in general, to investigate strategies to include waste materials into asphalt mixes. The incorporation of recycled materials, such as reclaimed asphalt pavement and crumb rubber, in hot-asphalt mixes is considered both an environmental-friendly an economic-effective procedure. The chapter presents the results of a laboratory investigation concerning the effect of crumb rubber on the mechanical properties of cold recycled emulsion mixes (CREM). A laboratory investigation was undertaken in order to evaluate the influence and possible benefits of producing CREM with crumb rubber as substitute of fine aggregates. The inclusion of crumb rubber in asphalt mixes to enhance their performance has received a considerable attention throughout the evolution of paving technologies. The addition of rubber to CREM represents the inclusion of a material with higher volume with respect to the fine granular fraction, while its density is markedly lower.",,,,Pavement and Asset Management,Maurizio Crispino,,2019-02-21,2019,2019-02-21,2019-02-21,,,477-484,Closed,Chapter,"Castro, A.; Martínez, G.; Fuentes, L.; Bonicelli, A.; Preciado, J.; Santos, J.","Castro, A.

Specifically, this paper explores the use of in-code comments as an approach to support students’ learning process and development of abstraction skills in an introductory programming course at the undergraduate level. Computer programming is a difficult skill to learn by novices due to the complexity of multiple elements interacting with each other to produce a specific outcome. Providing worked-examples paired with an engaging pedagogical practice has demonstrated to be an effective strategy for novices to start learning complex topics such as computer programming. One of the strategies that can support the introduction of worked examples is the use of self-explanation activities. In the context of programming, using in-code comments as a way for students to self-explain programming code can support the integration of worked-examples to scaffold their learning process. In this study, students wrote comments to explain how worked examples that were provided completed a specific task. Their comments were scored using an assessment rubric to provide detailed feedback about regarding the quality of their comments and their understanding of the code beyond the line by line execution. The goal of this study is to explore whether students with prior exposure to computer programming generate better self-explanations, and the effect that the quality of the written explanations and students’ prior programming experiences have on student overall performance in the introductory programming course. The implications of this study will contribute to a better understanding of effective practices to incorporate worked examples and self-explanation activities in the form of in-code comments for introductory programming courses.",This work was supported in part by the U.S. National Science foundation under the award No. EEC # 1449238.

For the bottom-up strategy, the forecast for each series is developed individually and then these are combined to produce a cumulative forecast of the aggregated series. For the top-down strategy, the series or components values are first combined and then a single forecast is determined for the aggregated series. Based on our implementation, state space models showed a higher forecast performance when a top-down strategy is applied. ARIMA models had a higher forecast performance for the bottom-up strategy. For state space models the top-down strategy reduced the overall error significantly. ARIMA models showed to be more accurate when forecasts are first determined individually.

The efficiency of the urban and inter-urban freight transport sector is crucial for Colombia’s economic competitiveness, and the government continually engages in projects to improve freight transport activities. Recently, as part of a program towards the reduction of greenhouse gases (GHGs) and the improvement of efficiency from the transportation sector, the Ministry of Transport pilot tested advanced information services using a freight brokerage system. This work discusses the results of this pilot program. Specifically, the work discusses the data collection methodology, provides details about the program, and describes the findings. The study had three stages. First, a socio-economic analysis of at least 500 vehicles/drivers, based on information from both vehicles and drivers. Second, the implementation of an ESD tool (Engine System Diagnostic Tool) device on the vehicle computer to measure some control variables of importance. Last, the data analysis of potential reduction on empty trips. The results show that the program can reduce the number of empty and non-revenue generating trips of the over-the-road freight transport (45% of trips in Colombia are empty) and improve the system. Specifically, the program reduced a third of these trips and generated new revenue trips to the participating carrier companies. However, the system reduced empty trips by 20%, and increased the number of trips per month, therefore, yielding more return on investment to drivers/vehicles and to the carrier.",,,Lecture Notes in Computer Science,Computational Logistics,"Carlos Paternina-Arboleda, Stefan Voß",,2019-09-20,2019,2019-09-20,2019,11756,,22-38,Closed,Chapter,"Moros-Daza, Adriana; Cassandro-De La Hoz, Daniela; Jaller-Martelo, Miguel; Paternina-Arboleda, Carlos D.","Moros-Daza, Adriana (Institute of Information Systems (IWI), University of Hamburg, Hamburg, Germany; Department of Industrial Engineering, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); Cassandro-De La Hoz, Daniela (Department of Industrial Engineering, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); Jaller-Martelo, Miguel (Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, University of California, Davis, USA); Paternina-Arboleda, Carlos D.

This extension offers novel features compared to the intergranular strain theory by Herle and Niemunis [4], including the incorporation of an elastic strain amplitude, to separate the elastic and plastic response, and the ability to reduce the plastic accumulation rate upon a larger number of cycles ($$N>10$$). In the present work, a modification to the ISA-hypoplastic model is described in order to enable the simulation of cyclic mobility effects exhibited by granular materials. The modification is based on a new state variable, able to detect paths at which the cyclic mobility effect is activated. With this information, some factors of the ISA-hypoplastic model are modified to deliver the proper response on paths showing cyclic mobility effects.

The situation of Colombia is particularly interesting: this country has been strong in its democratic ideals, despite the threats originated by a long internal conflict between the State with guerrilla groups, drug trafficking, corruption in public and private institutions, among other issues, which have created a wide range of social problems, poverty, and inequality. In that sense, Colombia urgently needs more spaces for its civil society to participate and let their voice be heard for the recently agreed Peace Accord to be long-lasting. While most of the time LTE exemplify an open and constructive forum where readers contribute and participate in political and social life, this section remains unheard, in opposition to violent protests and other actions of social mobilization that are more spectacular but often carry anger and polarization. In Colombia, letters reflect collective values and within the same country, one can identify different emotional approaches to the same reality.

Urinary catheterization has been performed for more than three thousand years to drain urine. Over the years, its shape and materials have been changing to enhance the facility of usage and to reduce the possibility of infection. The perspective of the user experience has been taken little account in the procedure and the design of the device. This study is focused on the use of vesical catheters by children in Guadalajara, Jalisco at ages of 6 to 10 years old. The aim is to improve the user’s experience during a vesical catheterization. This experience does not only include the insertion procedure, but the whole medical procedure. It is hoped that the proposed service and product will enhance the experience during the vesical catheterization. The results could help to be used as reference to improve the experience of diverse invasive or uncomfortable circumstances such as medical procedures.",,,Advances in Intelligent Systems and Computing,Human Systems Engineering and Design II,"Tareq Ahram, Waldemar Karwowski, Stefan Pickl, Redha Taiar",,2019-08-14,2019,2019-08-14,2020,1026,,767-772,Closed,Chapter,"SantaCruz-González, Natalia; Uribe-Fernández, Mariana; Duran-Aguilar, Gabriela","SantaCruz-González, Natalia (Facultad de Ingeniería, Universidad Panamericana, Álvaro del Portillo #49, 45010, Zapopan, Jalisco, Mexico); Uribe-Fernández, Mariana (Facultad de Ingeniería, Universidad Panamericana, Álvaro del Portillo #49, 45010, Zapopan, Jalisco, Mexico); Duran-Aguilar, Gabriela (Facultad de Ingeniería, Universidad Panamericana, Álvaro del Portillo #49, 45010, Zapopan, Jalisco, Mexico)","SantaCruz-González, Natalia (Panamerican University)","SantaCruz-González, Natalia (Panamerican University); Uribe-Fernández, Mariana (Panamerican University); Duran-Aguilar, Gabriela (Panamerican University)",0,0,,0.0,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1120304667,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 33 Built Environment and Design; 3303 Design,

                  Scroll expanders are generally used for low temperature power generation applications due to their inherently small built-in volume ratio. The working fluid and operating conditions play an important role in the expander performance as well as its physical size and volume ratio. Hence, a comparative study of scroll expander performance was carried out between two different working fluids, R433C and supercritical (s-CO2). The s-CO2 Brayton cycle achieved a maximum cycle efficiency of 13.6% at an expander supply pressure of 11 MPa. Two separate scroll geometries were modeled for supercritical Organic Rankine Cycle (SORC) using R433C and s-CO2 Brayton cycle for the operating conditions that provided the maximum cycle performance. The s-CO2 scroll geometry achieved a maximum expander efficiency of 80% with a volume ratio of 2.5 and a diameter of 19 cm. The high inlet temperatures required a much higher volume ratio of 6.2 and scroll diameter of 30 cm for the R433C based SORC leading to greater leakages and lower expander efficiency of 62%. The comparative study shows that s-CO2 is better suited for scroll expander than R433C at such high expander supply temperatures.",,,,"Volume 1: Compressors, Fans, and Pumps; Turbines; Heat Transfer; Structures and Dynamics",,,2019-12-05,2019,2020-01-24,2019-12-05,,,,Closed,Proceeding,"Narasimhan, Arun Kumar; Perez, Diego Guillen; Goswami, D.

The simulation is during four cardiac cycles, taking ten time samples per cycle. The employed method uses five stages. In the first stage, CT scan images are obtained for a male, 72 years old patient. During the second stage, image signal processing techniques, like filtering, enhancement and segmentation, are used to extract the Region of Interest (ROI) from each CT image. A 3D model of the aorta is built during the third stage, and then used to get a 2D model for simulation and analysis. In the fourth stage mesh parameters, as well as initial and boundary conditions for the simulation, are setup using Comsol Multiphysics, and then the simulation is ran, obtaining blood-flow's velocity and pressure distributions. The last stage uses a two-factor fixed effects model to record the data of interest and generate evaluation plots and metrics using the R programming language.

Multiple categories and denominations pertaining to scientific processes and knowledge have emerged in cyberspace, and one of the leading topics in this field is Ehealth, as an interdisciplinary dialogue between the health sciences and the field of social communication. However, a review of relevant academic journals and specialized platforms shows there has been little research into this subject in Latin America and the Caribbean. The present study was aimed at discussing past and current E-health practices in Ecuador. The research was qualitative and based on the method of content analysis, supported by a literature review of relevant documentary and virtual sources. The results highlight several web platforms pertaining to health institutions, bodies, hospitals, associations or charitable foundations, the contents of which prioritize the promotion and prevention of public health, and provide tools which encourage and streamline the health processes used both by medical professionals and the general public. The study concluded by setting out the key areas of E-health in which Ecuador lags behind, beginning with the need to design more up-to-date strategies and programs adapted to the social and cultural realities of the country. The referenced sources consulted were 19 specialized platforms, organizations, bodies and health centers in Ecuador, in addition to 6 digital sites carrying academic articles related to the object of study.","Universidad Técnica de Ambato, Dirección de Investigacin y Desarrollo (DIDE).

We believe this to be the first time that this has been attempted. Our work is the continuation of the trend to develop cold boot attacks for different schemes as revealed by the literature. But it is also the continuation of the evaluation of post-quantum cryptographic schemes against this class of attack. Particularly, we review the BLISS implementation provided by the strongSwan project. This implementation particularly stores its private key in memory in an interesting way therefore requiring novel approaches to key recovery. We present various approaches to key recovery. We first analyse the key recovery problem in this particular case via key enumeration algorithms, and so propose different techniques for key recovery. We then turn our attention to exploit further the algebraic relation among the components of the private key, and we thus establish a connection between the key recovery problem in this particular case and an instance of Learning with Errors Problem (LWE). We then explore various key recovery techniques to tackle this instance of LWE. In particular, we show a key recovery strategy combining lattice techniques and key enumeration. Finally, we report results from experimenting with one of the key recovery algorithms for a range of parameters, showing it is able to tolerate a noise level of α=0.001$$ \alpha = 0.001$$ and β=0.09$$\beta = 0.09$$ for a parameter set when performing a 240$$2^{40}$$ enumeration.",,,Lecture Notes in Computer Science,Progress in Cryptology – LATINCRYPT 2019,"Peter Schwabe, Nicolas Thériault",,2019-09-09,2019,2019-09-09,2019,11774,,40-61,Closed,Chapter,"Villanueva-Polanco, Ricardo","Villanueva-Polanco, Ricardo (Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia)","Villanueva-Polanco, Ricardo (Universidad del Norte)","Villanueva-Polanco, Ricardo (Universidad del Norte)",15,5,,4.02,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1120935911,46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4604 Cybersecurity and Privacy,

This group of people needs day-to-day care due to their age and, in addition, they often have health problems. Technology can be used to mitigate these problem. However, it must be beared in mind that most of this population is currently unable to get the most out of electronic devices. To help elders benefit from these devices systems adapted to their needs and preferences are needed. In particular, systems that use the elders contextual information to integrate several aspects of eldercare and adapt them to each elder would provide significant benefits. In this paper, we propose to use smartphones as the device who centralizes contextual information of the elders, focusing on emotion recognition. These emotions will be used to recognize to what extent an elderly person needs care at certain times of the day and to adapt surrounding IoT systems to their needs and moods.","This work was supported by 4IE project (0045-4IE-4-P) funded by the Interreg V-A España-Portugal (POCTEP) 2014–2020 program, by the Spanish Ministry of Economy, Industry and Competitiveness (TIN2014-53986-REDT and TIN2015-69957-R (MINECO/FEDER)), by the Department of Economy and Infrastructure of the Government of Extremadura (GR15098), and by the European Regional Development Fund.",,Communications in Computer and Information Science,Gerontechnology,"José García-Alonso, César Fonseca",,2019-04-14,2019,2019-04-14,2019,1016,,15-25,Closed,Chapter,"Bonilla, Sheila; Moguel, Enrique; Garcia-Alonso, Jose","Bonilla, Sheila (University of Extremadura, Cáceres, Spain); Moguel, Enrique (University of Extremadura, Cáceres, Spain); Garcia-Alonso, Jose (University of Extremadura, Cáceres, Spain)","Bonilla, Sheila (University of Extremadura)","Bonilla, Sheila (University of Extremadura); Moguel, Enrique (University of Extremadura); Garcia-Alonso, Jose (University of Extremadura)",4,0,,1.14,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1113461241,46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4608 Human-Centred Computing,

The findings from the eastern and western sectors display metric differences that might be indicative for the presence of two species or morphotypes. The horse remains are most abundant in stratigraphic layer PB-8. The metric analysis assigns most of the camelid remnants to cf. Hemiauhenia paradoxa, whereas the remaining, less diagnostic, material is classified merely on the family level. The camelid remnants have been recovered from stratigraphic layers PB-7 and PB-8.

On the one hand, both ethnic groups are the result of displacement triggered by the Conquista and the transatlantic slave trade, and on the other hand both kept strong ties to non-Spanish European powers such as the English, the Dutch, and the French which gave them access to alternative markets. During the so-called independence period of the early nineteenth century, the territories of the Miskito and the Wayuu remained largely autonomous because of British protection. It was not until the mid of the nineteenth century that the young Latin American nation states succeeded in invading the area in their struggle for territorial integrity but failed because the British protected them against all these attempts. The situation changed when the USA came into dispute with the UK over steamship routes, coal storages, and the establishment of interoceanic connections, although both Nicaragua and Honduras and Colombia and Venezuela finally succeeded in incorporating the still unconquered areas into their state territory at the beginning of the twentieth century and even though the two now transnational ethnic groups were able to maintain autonomous structures. Since the 1960s civil and drug wars as well as guerrilla activity in Central America and in Colombia and Venezuela increased, which again led to mass murder and displacement of Wayuu and Miskito which persist in the case of Wayuu to this day.",,,,The Palgrave Handbook of Ethnicity,Steven Ratuva,,2019-01-31,2019,2019-01-31,2019,,,1-17,Closed,Chapter,"Cwik, Christian","Cwik, Christian (Department of History, The University of the West Indies, St Augustine, Trinidad and Tobago)","Cwik, Christian (University of the West Indies)","Cwik, Christian (University of the West Indies)",0,0,,0.0,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1114068442,"43 History, Heritage and Archaeology; 4303 Historical Studies; 47 Language, Communication and Culture","16 Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions"

Our work leaves aside any analytical category that takes on the examination of state institutions through binary relations (i.e. formal/informal; rational/irrational, etc.) or depicts them just as sites of reproduction of social inequalities. Instead, our analysis focuses on a more concrete aspect of bureaucracy: the material aspects of bureaucratic knowledge-making instantiated in files, legal forms, procedures, protocols, and official and unofficial routines. Drawing on anthropological theory and ethnographic research, we study the technical and material dimensions of law by engaging with concrete aspects of the bureaucratic practices encountered in different milieus: the field of judicial practice in Argentina and disputes over land tenure in Colombia. Through this analysis, we aim to illustrate how an ethnographic lens on the technical dimensions of law may reveal the constitution of the law through the creation, circulation, and mediation of its material forms, which, in turn are able to mobilize different modes of sociality. Ultimately, this chapter seeks to challenge some of the common tropes present in socio-legal scholarship, as well as to spot new dynamics and power relations that have been often forgotten or overlooked when theorizing about the state and the role of law in Latin America In this chapter, the authors begin by situating bureaucracy as a subject matter that unfolds within the context of historical tensions and phenomena that make state practices in Latin America worthy of scholarly attention. They seek to place their approach to everyday legal and bureaucratic knowledge-making within a larger anthropological research agenda on the state that, according to Trouillot, should “look for state processes and effects in sites less obvious than those of institutionalized politics and established bureaucracies”. The authors examine the long-run discussion between law on the books and law in action by bringing the question of law’s materiality center-stage. The political history of Latin American countries has influenced the development of their institutions. For example, during the twentieth century political regimes often alternated between dictatorships and democratic governments. The critical focus on procedural practices of state-making sometimes fails to comprehend that such routine practices are much more than modes of controlling or exercising power.",,,,Routledge Handbook of Law and Society in Latin America,"Rachel Sieder, Karina Ansolabehere, Tatiana Alfonso",,2019-05-20,2019,2019-05-20,2019-05-20,,,95-110,Closed,Chapter,"Barrera, Leticia; Latorre, Sergio","Barrera, Leticia (); Latorre, Sergio ()",,"Barrera, Leticia (); Latorre, Sergio ()",1,0,,1.2,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1115038338,48 Law and Legal Studies; 4804 Law In Context,"16 Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions"

The social and cultural context of this region sets conditions for a natural existence of experiences related to C4D approaches. A reason for this might be the oral tradition of most Latin American cultures which has been based on their indigenous origins and forms of communication until now. Another factor that makes communication practices be linked to efforts to promote social change is the structural setting in several countries and the persistence of poverty conditions and unequal distribution of opportunities among the diverse social sectors. Despite the course of at least three moments of the presence of C4D in Latin America identified as development communication, development support communication, and alternative communication for democratic development, this approach is permanently modified by the presence of new social and collective actors, different resources, and means that allow this practice, as well as new social demands of the community. These experiences are, however, recovering the regional tradition of understanding the process of communication as an ethical, aesthetical, and political practice based on dialogue and participation to reach conditions for survival and social change. Contemporary Latin America presents new visions which have an impact on C4D paradigms of Communication for Living Well and the analysis of the decolonial approach in the field of communication.",,,,Handbook of Communication for Development and Social Change,Jan Servaes,,2019-03-23,2019,2019-03-23,2019,,,1-25,Closed,Chapter,"Aguirre Alvis, José Luis","Aguirre Alvis, José Luis (Department of Social Communication, Universidad Católica Boliviana “San Pablo”, La Paz, Bolivia)","Aguirre Alvis, José Luis (Universidad Católica Bolivia San Pablo)","Aguirre Alvis, José Luis (Universidad Católica Bolivia San Pablo)",3,0,,1.86,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1124696121,44 Human Society; 4404 Development Studies,

486,pub.1124397301,10.4324/9780429429156,,,Contemporary Issues in Branding,"iThis book provides students and academics with a comprehensive analysis of the theory and practice of branding. The challenge to explore new and effective ways of harnessing the power of communication to engage with company stakeholders in interactive, immediate and innovative ways is ever-present in the digital era. Digital marketing and social media create opportunities for managers to communicate their brand’s identity to their consumers and stakeholders. Yet, limited empirical research exists to elucidate these issues, and less still that assists our understanding of branding issues at an international level. Recognising the complexity and plurality at the heart of the branding discipline, this text explores the relationship between brands, identity and stakeholders. Working through building, designing and maintaining a brand, the authors consider such aspects as strategic planning and campaign management, research and measurement, media relations, employee communication, leadership and change communication, and crisis branding. Critically, differing methods and approaches applied to branding and communication research design are assessed, including both qualitative and quantitative methods. Proposing a mixture of theory and practice with international case studies, this book is an invaluable companion for advanced undergraduate and postgraduate students, academics of marketing and strategic brand management, as well as managers and decision makers globally.",,,,,"Pantea Foroudi, Maria Palazzo",,2019-12-06,2019,2019-12-06,,,,,Closed,Edited Book,,,,,1,0,,0.32,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1124397301,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3503 Business Systems In Context; 3506 Marketing; 3507 Strategy, Management and Organisational Behaviour; 47 Language, Communication and Culture",

Breeding,"Quinoa is native to the Andean Region, with recognized nutritional value and the ability to thrive in marginal agricultural environments. It is a very important alternative crop to face the negative environmental changes that are reducing yield and quality, and causing food insecurity during recent decades. This species has been cultivated in the Andean Region for thousands of years in very marginal environments from sea level in Chile to more than 4000 m elevation in the Peruvian and Bolivian Altiplano. High genetic diversity of quinoa ecotypes made it possible to yield quality grains in soil pH values of 4.5–9.5> in diverse annual rainfall 200–2000 mm, and at very low temperatures in flowering and grain-filling periods, with diseases, insect epidemics and other negative management practices. The recognition of quinoa values since the 1980s has increased significantly the demand and interest from other countries to grow this plant in marginal lands. Cultivation has increased notably in the Andean Region, in North America, Europe, Asia and Africa, with very good agricultural and industrial results. Current wide distribution and planting in large-scale farms have shown limitations because growth conditions are different from those typical in the origin center. High susceptibility to biotic factors (diseases, pests and weeds), low heat tolerance, damage by long photoperiods, lack of appropriate culture technologies for different farming systems, and limitations in food elaboration and industrial uses, are major limitations. These can be overcome with new improved varieties using the highly diverse germplasm and appropriate breeding methodology; and employing appropriate agronomic practices for sustainable production to ensure food security in marginal lands and environments.",,,,Advances in Plant Breeding Strategies: Cereals,"Jameel M.

419,pub.1112538397,10.5772/intechopen.77680,,,Traumatic Brain Injury,"Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a significant public health problem. There are several advanced techniques available for the investigation of disease neurobiology, diagnosis, and treatment. This book covers many topics in the active TBI research field such as cumulative mild head injury review, brain changes, and risk factors, as well as post-concussion syndrome (PCS) definition, classification, and association with brain dysfunction. Brain changes, including blood flow, intracranial pressure, and neuroinflammation, the neurobiological basis of neuroprotective activation, as well as correlation with PCS, including sleep, are illustrated further. Furthermore, multiple biomarkers, including S-100?, UCH-L1, and GFAP for blood-brain barrier breakdown and neuronal injury, are reviewed thoroughly. Lastly, well-evaluated neuroprotective agents, hypothermia as a neuroprotective effect in TBI, and effects investigation, as well as sedation in TBI as a neurocritical and therapeutic strategy with different assessments, are reported. This book introduces readers to a number of perspectives, including TBI disease pathophysiology and post-concussion syndrome classification, associated brain changes, imaging diagnosis, and several useful biomarkers with high sensitivities, as well as multiple therapeutic strategies. Various advanced technical developments, upfront neuroimaging, and clinical data are presented together with comprehensive, up-to-date, and interesting examples. Detailed reviews and accurate illustrations together with objective and informative discussions of several challenging problems such as PCS and neuroprotective treatments are the advantages of this book. Finally, this book will hopefully convey the clinical aspects of TBI and help guide diagnosis and therapeutic research in this field.",,,,,Yongxia Zhou,,2019-09-11,2019,,,,,,Closed,Edited Book,,,,,2,1,,0.54,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1112538397,52 Psychology; 5203 Clinical and Health Psychology,

The program was hailed by President John F. Kennedy and by volunteers themselves as an exceptional initiative to end global poverty. In practice, it was another front for fighting the Cold War and promoting American interests in the Global South. This book examines how this ideological project played out on the ground as volunteers encountered a range of local actors and agencies engaged in anti-poverty efforts of their own. As they negotiated the complexities of community intervention, these volunteers faced conflicts and frustrations, struggled to adapt, and gradually transformed the Peace Corps of the 1960s into a truly global, decentralized institution. Drawing on letters, diaries, reports, and newsletters created by volunteers themselves, Fernando Purcell shows how their experiences offer an invaluable perspective on local manifestations of the global Cold War.",,,,,,,2019,2019,,2019,,,,Closed,Monograph,"Purcell, Fernando","Purcell, Fernando (Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile, Santiago, Chile)",,"Purcell, Fernando (Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile)",4,2,,2.39,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1120506213,36 Creative Arts and Writing; 44 Human Society; 4408 Political Science,1 No Poverty

Institutional websites are available for a large amount of data hindering the access of scholars to information relevant to their academic journey. As the university is also a space of opportunities, it is necessary that the student is aware of all the possibilities that can support his professional and human growth, such as, monitoring, projects of scientific initiation, cultural activities, among others. So, considering the massive use of smartphones by students, this paper proposes a mobile application that provides the information of interest to academics in a more simplified way, using the resources of gamification. In order to investigate the most interesting contents of the students of the State University of the North of Paraná (UENP), a questionnaire containing questions related to university contents was applied a 220 students. The investigation allowed to verify that the students have a high level of difficulty to access the contents of their interest, pointing out as main reason the organization and the great amount of information available. The most interesting contents of the students were their scores, class schedule and the availability of the teachers. For the application, only the most interesting subjects pointed out by the students. All these subjects usually have a long way to their access, due to the structuring of the university website and the large amount of information already mentioned.",Our acknowledgment for the “Fundação Araucária de Apoio ao Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico do Estado do Paraná” for the support given for the research.,,Lecture Notes in Computer Science,Social Computing and Social Media.

The regional structure is characterized by the interplay between large basement-involved reverse and thrust faults, commonly reactivated, that affect Mesozoic synrift deposits and Cenozoic synorogenic deposits. This structural pattern varies along the Coastal and Frontal Cordilleras. The tectonic evolution of this region can be summarized by three generalized episodes: (i) stretching and crustal extension during Triassic-Jurassic and Early Cretaceous periods, which created half-graben structures that accommodated more than 6km of volcanic and sedimentary basin fill, (ii) Late Cretaceous contraction and tectonic inversion of the previous Mesozoic half-graben structures that formed doubly verging asymmetric anticlines, along which synrift Jurassic and Lower Cretaceous deposits were uplifted, (iii) Paleocene to Miocene shortening and basement-involved deformation dominated by the creation and successive exhumation of several kilometers of Permo-Triassic prerift and granitic blocks along reverse faults and thrusts that accommodated nearly 50km of crustal shortening.","This work was supported by Fondecyt project n° 3140557 “Crustal structure and deformation timing along the Chilean flat-slab subduction segment (27°–29°S), Central Andes.” We have benefited from large discussions on Andean tectonic evolution with Drs.

Many methods such as MCDM, Heuristics and Intelligent approaches are available to solve the FLD problems. However in reality, finding the feasible facility layout selection is subject to management as well as performances oriented selections. Here in India, speed post mail processing service industry is facing tremendous challenges like tumbling demands due to low production concern, gloomy trend in technology advancement, and fierce private couriers’ competition. Hence, the highly competitive operational performance is of much concern and attention is focused towards the direction of facility location science. This paper aims to examine the challenges of sustainable operational performance oriented layout selection by Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) and proposes a genetic algorithm (GA) related to intelligent based approach, for finding the optimal total facility layout cost for a hypothetical South Indian speed post service office layout. In this paper, we used multiple-criteria facility layout selection problem using mathematical model generated with Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA).",,,Advances in Intelligent Systems and Computing,Intelligent Systems Design and Applications,"Ajith Abraham, Aswani Kumar Cherukuri, Patricia Melin, Niketa Gandhi",,2019-04-14,2019,2019-04-14,2020,941,,1035-1044,Closed,Chapter,"Vadivel, S.

This area of research attempts to determine the feelings, opinions, emotions, among other things, of people on something or someone. In particular, this article discusses the task of determining the polarity of reviews using an ordinal classification technique called Barycentric Coordinates for Ordinal Classification (BCOC). The aim of this analysis is to explore the viability of the application of BCOC on the field of sentiment analysis. This method is based on the hypothesis that the ordinal classes can be represented geometrically inside a convex polygon on the real plane by using barycentric coordinates. A set of experiments were conducted to evaluate the capability and performance of the proposed approach relative to a baseline, using accuracy as the general measure of performance. In general, the method is competitive with the baseline.

Many scallop species are reared since they are considered a great source of low-cost/high quality protein product. Like any farmed aquatic species, scallops are constantly exposed to changing environmental conditions and many microorganisms present in the surrounding aquatic environment. Despite this, scallops generally remain healthy as a result of their efficient defense mechanisms which are orchestrated by the innate immune response. Like all invertebrates, scallop defense focuses on mechanisms of innate immunity, mediated by cellular (immunocompetent cells, the hemocytes, and mucosal surfaces) and humoral (plasmatic molecules) components to defend themselves against pathogens. Scallop immune response is divided into three main stages: (i) recognition of the non-self by pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) and pattern recognition proteins (PRPs), (ii) activation of signaling pathways and the phagocytic process by hemocytes, and (iii) the production of antimicrobial effectors and antioxidant enzymes.

For a food recognition system to be useful in real applications, it is necessary to recognize a huge number of different foods. We argue that for very large scale classification, a traditional flat classifier is not enough to acquire an acceptable result. To address this, we propose a method that performs prediction with local classifiers, based on a class hierarchy, or with flat classifier. We decide which approach to use, depending on the analysis of both the Epistemic Uncertainty obtained for the image in the children classifiers and the prediction of the parent classifier. When our criterion is met, the final prediction is obtained with the respective local classifier; otherwise, with the flat classifier. From the results, we can see that the proposed method improves the classification performance compared to the use of a single flat classifier.","This work was partially funded by TIN2015-66951-C2-1-R, 2017 SGR 1742, Nestore, Validithi, 20141510 (La MaratoTV3) and CERCA Programme/Generalitat de Catalunya.

When data is not enough, CNN models tend to be overfitted. To deal with this, often, traditional techniques of data augmentation are applied, such as: affine transformations, adjusting the color balance, among others. However, we argue that some techniques of data augmentation may be more appropriate for some of the classes. In order to select the techniques that work best for particular class, we propose to explore the epistemic uncertainty for the samples within each class. From our experiments, we can observe that when the data augmentation is applied class-conditionally, we improve the results in terms of accuracy and also reduce the overall epistemic uncertainty. To summarize, in this paper we propose a class-conditional data augmentation procedure that allows us to obtain better results and improve robustness of the classification in the face of model uncertainty.","This work was partially funded by TIN2015-66951-C2-1-R, 2017 SGR 1742, Nestore, Validithi, 20141510 (La MaratoTV3) and CERCA Programme/Generalitat de Catalunya.

All the components of the Pg activator system are expressed in the CNS and their co-localization with Hsp27, Hsp70 or the 78-kDa glucose-regulated protein (GRP78) makes them essential players in processes such as synaptic transmission, synapse plasticity, neuroinflammation and nervous system repair. The Hsp participate in the neuroprotection of the CNS and their connections with both Pg activator systems play a regulatory role in these processes. The conversion of Pg to the active protease plasmin by both Pg activators are part of mechanisms used by neurons, microglia and astrocyte cells to stimulate cell growth and synaptic plasticity. In the CNS, the activity of plasmin is tightly regulated via mechanisms operating under the coordinated expression of HSP and components of the Pg activator system during normal conditions or in response to tissue injury. This chapter reviews the roles of Hsp27, Hsp70 and GRP78 in these mechanisms.","This work was supported by a grant from Fondo Nacional de Desarrollo Científico y Tecnológico de Chile, FONDECYT No 1130451.",,Heat Shock Proteins,Heat Shock Proteins in Neuroscience,"Alexzander A.

This disruptive tool differs from other biometric techniques, as faces can be recognized remotely. Thus, these applications can be incorporated in different institutions with the purpose of restricting access to unauthorized people, avoiding damages and losses to the property. The objective of this study is to identify people in controlled and uncontrolled environments within a university building that has suffered insecurity problems on several occasions. For this reason, it is used a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture that was implemented on a GPU. The procedure consists of 3 phases: (i) training; (ii) learning and; (iii) classification. The CNN training stage was performed using the VGGFace2 dataset. The learning and generalization of deeply discriminatory facial embeddings of 512 bytes per face by joint supervision of softmax loss and center loss signals. The classification used a support vector machine (SVM) in several experiments with different amounts of classes. The efficiency of this approach was tested in real time on a sample of 128 students by means of quantitative metrics derived by confusion matrix.

Classifiers like artificial neural networks, support vector machines, decision trees, and nearest neighbors are commonly employed to discriminate fruit samples represented in different color spaces (e.g., RGB, HSV, and L*a*b*). Although these feature spaces are equivalent up to a transformation, some of them facilitate classification. In a previous work, authors showed that combining the three-color spaces through principal component analysis enhances classification performance at expenses of increased computational complexity. In this paper, two combination and two selection approaches are explored to find the best characteristics among the combination of the different color spaces (9 features in total). Experimental results reveal that selection and combination of color channels allow classifiers to reach similar levels of accuracy, but combination methods require increased computational complexity.","Authors acknowledge the continuous support provided by the authorities of the Centro Universitario de los Valles of the Universidad de Guadalajara, as well as the Universidad Privada del Norte.",,Advances in Intelligent Systems and Computing,Trends and Applications in Software Engineering,"Jezreel Mejia, Mirna Muñoz, Álvaro Rocha, Jose A.

Its purpose was to accommodate the workers of this large water project during the canal construction phase. It underwent further development to provide for the services and needs of the construction workers. However, subsequent to the completion of the project in 1989, when the Department of Water Affairs abandoned it, it became a ghost town. The town was put up for sale by tender and was bought by the Afrikanervryheidstigting (AVSTIG) (the Afrikaner Freedom Foundation) in 1991, and was envisaged as the first homeland for the Afrikaans-speaking white population. A mixed-methods methodology was used to obtain information about the development and the current developmental potential of the town. At this stage, it was clear that the Apartheid ideology was reaching its demise in South Africa. The town went through three economic phases. The first was as an economic phase during construction in the early 1960s, when large water projects were initiated by the South African government. Subsequently, during the early 1990s, it served as a political-economic base; and finally, in 1994, when the farm adjacent to the town was bought and subdivided into smallholdings, it entered an agricultural economic phase. This development brought about steady growth in the town’s population from 1997 to 2011, with the 2011 census showing a growth of approximately 49%, with a significant increase in the age group younger than 20 years. Twenty-four (24) years after Apartheid, on account of the authority wielded by the village council to act as gatekeeper, Orania still has a whites-only population.",,,Key Challenges in Geography,Smart Geography,"Stoyan Nedkov, Georgi Zhelezov, Nadezhda Ilieva, Mariyana Nikolova, Boian Koulov, Kliment Naydenov, Steliyan Dimitrov",,2019-10-06,2019,2019-10-06,2020,,,217-230,Closed,Chapter,"Kotze, Nico; Schoeman, Ruan; Carow, Sanet; Schmitz, Peter","Kotze, Nico (Department of Geography, University of South Africa (Unisa), Private Bag X90, 1710, Johannesburg, Florida, South Africa); Schoeman, Ruan (Department of Geography, University of South Africa (Unisa), Private Bag X90, 1710, Johannesburg, Florida, South Africa); Carow, Sanet (Department of Geography, University of South Africa (Unisa), Private Bag X90, 1710, Johannesburg, Florida, South Africa); Schmitz, Peter (Department of Geography, University of South Africa (Unisa), Private Bag X90, 1710, Johannesburg, Florida, South Africa)","Kotze, Nico (University of South Africa)","Kotze, Nico (University of South Africa); Schoeman, Ruan (University of South Africa); Carow, Sanet (University of South Africa); Schmitz, Peter (University of South Africa)",3,0,,1.86,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1121521878,33 Built Environment and Design; 44 Human Society; 4404 Development Studies,

A particular attention is paid to the current research surrounding the ‘commodification of heritage’ exemplified by the fashion house Burberry, which demonstrates Britishness as an intangible element of cultural heritage. In-depth findings illustrated cover V&A Archives, Burberry’s celebrity endorsement and the royal appointment system. To compare the findings from this top profitable company, the centuries old footwear brands of the Northampton area in the English Midlands that have preserved the making of gentleman’s shoes, are also exemplified. It has been noted that some manufacturers have been taken over by international houses such as Hermès and Prada to essentially safeguard the craftsmanship that is “Made in Britain”. Both exemplars will be related to the UK Government funded initiatives and by Walpole, British Fashion Council, Made in Britain Initiative, London Craft Fair, as well as other benevolent bodies, namely Leathersellers and Cordwainers Guilds. Live fashion events and halo projects sponsored by industry are also the focal point for certain aspects of the intangible cultural heritage industry. Policy and reports, such as The State of Fashion [1], will inform the debate.

The question is whether more data are actually better? The role of data and information in the decision-making process was evaluated, with the aim of characterising the decision process in terms of the influence of data and information in that process. When data are analysed, information is generated which upon interpretation increases the level of knowledge and understanding that is used to base management decisions on. To determine the effect of data and information on the decision-making process, data from a field site were evaluated. The depth-to-groundwater level was used as the required variable on which information was required. The evaluation was done for all 715 data points collected for the Middelburg Site aquifers. The analysis showed that the decision-making process has a logarithmic nature which means that less and less information becomes available with more data. The value of data was assessed in a data-worth or data-cost evaluation. The information gained and cost can be determined when sufficient and when optimal data have been gathered.

En este libro se ofrece un análisis actualizado de estos programas y su relación con la inclusión laboral, y se abordan los debates en curso sobre sus posibles incentivos y desincentivos a la oferta laboral, formalización y trabajo infantil entre la población destinataria. Considerando que la pobreza es un problema estructural de sociedades muy desiguales, se argumenta que la tesis de que las personas se encuentran en condiciones de pobreza por falta de esfuerzo propio es la expresión de un alto grado de prejuicio contra las personas en esa situación, quienes en su gran mayoría trabajan o buscan activamente un trabajo, pero presentan altos déficits de trabajo decente.

The Society of Jesus puts itself at the disposal of the Inquisition, acclaiming the participation of the Jesuits in detecting heterodoxy and, therefore, playing a direct role in the offensive based on re-Catholicisation and missionary work between the individuals prosecuted by the Holy Office in this episode. The Society, between coercion and persuasion, acted as the union border between the Catholic Reformation and the Counter-Reformation. The descriptions of the martyrdom suffered in defence of the faith had a great impact in the Iberian hagiographic literature at the beginning of the Early Modern Age. From the beginning of the Christian era, a religious argument surrounding the figure of the martyr was being constructed in the West, combining elements of the classical tradition and the new religious theology. Since the sixteenth century, the religious Protestant rupture, the wars against the Ottomans and the overseas expansion of the Iberian powers, all prompted new accounts of martyrs located on the frontiers of the Catholic World. The missionaries of the religious orders were its main protagonists. Through the narration of their lives and deaths, the Catholic Church tried to build models of moral behaviour that would serve as an example to the spirituality of the faithful Catholic. The aim of this article is to analyse how ecclesiastical treatise writers progressively slid into positions of intolerance with regard to the visions or the mystical expressions reported by nuns and beatas, from Teresa of Jesus and to the mid-seventeenth century. Nevertheless there were Catalan theologians of the Baroque period that, instead of denouncing the Teresian Legacy to the Inquisition, wanted to recover the essence of her message, appealing to her balance and emotional self-control. In this article, the author questions the supposed unity of the Spanish Catholic thought and the identification of the Spanish Catholicism with intolerance. It exposes the different ways of understanding tolerance in the Early Modern Spain: the freedom of conscience, the aptitude to adapt the inquisitorial judgments, the relaxed attitude of the old Christians towards the new Christians, the doubt and the uncertainty, the moral probabilism and the political dissimulation. According to the author, all these elements are different expressions of tolerance and challenge the topical vision of the fanatical Spain. The Inquisition was not an institution which was simply imposed by those in power on an immobile and passive society. In the search for support among different urban and rural groups and communities, the Holy Office surrounded itself with diverse symbolic, allegorical and interpretative constructions. The Inquisition reinvented some of these allegories in order to build up an image of itself that would make it credible and respected. In a clothes-conscious society like Ancien Regime in Europe, the sambenito, the ignominious penitential habit, not only marked the wearers, but also subjected them to public and collective memory and opinion. The sambenito becomes, in the Foucaultian sense, a key aspect in the analysis of conflicting relations with the ruling order, and the different forms of resistance put up by individuals and their communities The memory of infamy and shame was one of the real reasons for the Inquisition being feared, and one of the most useful signs of this violence was the sambenito. The chapter argues that the convents of the religious orders (Franciscans, Dominicans and Augustinians) played an important role as spaces of circulation of medical knowledge and practices during the first century of the colonization of Mesoamerican territory. Confronting the enormous problems related to the health of the population, originated by the so-called 'encounter' between the Amerindians and Europeans, a new medical culture was brought by indigenous and colonizers. Circulation of medical knowledge and healing practices took place, very prominently, in the space of convento, a building complex that the orders disseminated throughout the territory controlled by the colonizers. This text focuses on the Atlantic and the two-way cultural relationship between America and Europe. It analyses studies that have considered written culture, the transmission of texts, and the networks through which books circulated across the Atlantic. The analysis goes beyond formal institutional and legal interpretations and provides information on social and cultural contacts and on the range of means of cultural intermediation. Cultural studies allow the analysis of the norms and their transgression, a habitual circumstance in Atlantic relations. Through the study of a small book dedicated to defending the figure of Hernán Cortés in 1806, written by the Jesuit Ramón Diosdado Caballero (1740–1829), the cultural debates that took place in the 18th century Atlantic world are explored. The writing of a new vision of the conquest, the defence of the Spanish role in America against the stereotypes of the anti-Hispanic black legend, or the apology of an intolerant Christian religion are treated by Diosdado, who also establishes a positive balance on Spanish cultural heritage. His defence of the values of Christianity, of the royal power and of the Ancien Régime political principles allow to situate the author in the origins of a original Spanish reactionary thought, of endogenous character and developed apart from the influences of European conservatism.",,,,The Complexity of Hispanic Religious Life in the 16th–18th Centuries,Doris Moreno,,2019-10-24,2019,,2019-10-24,,,1-12,Closed,Chapter,"Moreno, Doris; García Cárcel, Ricardo","Moreno, Doris (); García Cárcel, Ricardo ()",,"Moreno, Doris (); García Cárcel, Ricardo ()",0,0,,0.0,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1122315995,"43 History, Heritage and Archaeology; 4303 Historical Studies; 47 Language, Communication and Culture; 4705 Literary Studies; 50 Philosophy and Religious Studies; 5004 Religious Studies; 5005 Theology","16 Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions"

Cities of this region are expanding very fast and this impressive urban growth has a significant impact on the environment, on energy consumption, and on public health. This chapter explores the urban heat island (UHI) effect on the climate of Guayaquil, Lima, Antofagasta, and Valparaíso. These four cities are important urban centers on the Pacific coast of South America. The UHI effect is simulated by using the Urban Weather Generator tool (UWG), a coupled atmospheric–building simulation model that uses urban form parameters to transform rural weather files into urban weather files. Urban form parameters considered in the analysis are the built-up ratio, the facade ratio and the green area ratio, obtained for 24 one-hectare random samples and running a principal component analysis and a k-mean cluster to group them. Simulation results show the presence of a UHI effect that varies between 2 and 5 °C during the night and a more dispersed situation during the day. Valparaíso and Guayaquil seem to have higher UHI than Lima and Antofagasta, probably because of the difference in the temperature ranges (higher maximum temperatures). Some hypotheses regarding the influence of the Pacific Ocean, such as urban form, heat generation in the street, building energy use, impervious materials on the resulting UHI effect are formulated and discussed, along with an estimation of the impact on the built environment looking at energy consumption, comfort felt by users, and vulnerability to heat waves.",,,,Urban Climates in Latin America,"Cristián Henríquez, Hugo Romero",,2019-02-24,2019,2019-02-24,2019,,,33-62,Closed,Chapter,"Palme, Massimo; Inostroza, Luis; Villacreses, Geovanna; Carrasco, Claudio; Lobato, Andrea","Palme, Massimo (Universidad Católica del Norte, Escuela de Arquitectura, Antofagasta, Chile; Instituto de Investigación Geológico y Energético, Quito, Ecuador); Inostroza, Luis (Ruhr University Bochum, Institute of Geography, Bochum, Germany; Universidad Autónoma de Chile, Santiago, Chile); Villacreses, Geovanna (Instituto de Investigación Geológico y Energético, Quito, Ecuador); Carrasco, Claudio (Facultad de Ingeniería, Universidad de Valparaíso, Valparaíso, Chile); Lobato, Andrea (Instituto de Investigación Geológico y Energético, Quito, Ecuador)","Palme, Massimo (Catholic University of the North; Instituto de Investigación Geológico y Energético)","Palme, Massimo (Catholic University of the North; Instituto de Investigación Geológico y Energético); Inostroza, Luis (Ruhr University Bochum; Universidad Autónoma de Chile); Villacreses, Geovanna (Instituto de Investigación Geológico y Energético); Carrasco, Claudio (University of Valparaíso); Lobato, Andrea (Instituto de Investigación Geológico y Energético)",7,0,,3.52,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1112367941,33 Built Environment and Design; 3301 Architecture; 37 Earth Sciences,11 Sustainable Cities and Communities

We focus on one aspect of inequality, wage dispersion, investigating the factors that shape the ratio of wages at the 90th percentile to wages at the 10th percentile, and the ratio of wages at the median to wages at the 10th percentile. We analyze data for 21 advanced democracies for varying numbers of years between the 1960s and 2013, depending on data availability for both the dependent and the independent variables. We integrate a focus on structural changes in the economy with a focus on labor market institutions, partisan politics, and education policies. We argue that the same factors shape wage dispersion between both the top and the bottom and the middle and bottom, but some of those factors have a stronger effect on the distance between the bottom and the median income earner. Specifically, higher levels of capital market openness, Third World imports, and immigration are all associated with higher wage dispersion in the 90:10 and the 50:10 ratio, but these effects are much stronger for the 50:10 ratio. Among the countervailing factors, union density, wage coordination, employment legislation that regulates temporary work, and investment in human capital restrain the overall distance and the distance between the bottom and the middle of the income distribution. The effect of regulation of temporary employment, however, is stronger at the bottom.",,,,The European Social Model under Pressure,"Romana Careja, Patrick Emmenegger, Nathalie Giger",,2019-07-12,2019,2019-07-12,2020,,,231-252,Closed,Chapter,"Huber, Evelyne; Stephens, John D.; Alper, Kaitlin","Huber, Evelyne (University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, USA); Stephens, John D.

To achieve this, we briefly describe the imposition of Chile's 1981 Water Code. This description provides the historical context for understanding its main characteristics. This makes it both unique and controversial. In continuation, we revise the main arguments for and against the model.

Evidence from dredge samples suggests MCEs in the southeast Pacific once extended along the Salas y Gómez Ridge as far east as ~85° W, but MCEs in Chile were virtually unexplored prior to 2010. Despite providing critical structural habitat for numerous flora and fauna, including commercially important fishes, basic information about their geographic distribution and community structure are lacking. Here, we review the state of knowledge on these communities and present preliminary results from the most recent surveys at Rapa Nui. Surveys at mesophotic depths (30–280 m) have revealed ecosystems dominated by crustose coralline algae with occasional patches of rhodoliths, undiscovered biodiversity, the first reports of wide-ranging Pacific species, and reports of potential new species in multiple taxa including fishes and echinoderms. Preliminary observations suggest fish communities change with depth and time of day, some habitats support commercially important and juvenile fishes, and MCEs and fisheries at Rapa Nui are in decline due to local, artisanal fishing practices. The recent designation of no-take marine parks in Chile may help to conserve these habitats, but additional information is required to support management decisions and future conservation efforts at Rapa Nui, Salas y Gómez, and seamounts within the Chilean Exclusive Economic Zone.","This work was financed by the Chilean Millennium Initiative ESMOI, Oceana Chile, the postdoctoral Fondecyt N° 3160195 grant to JA, Fondecyt N° 1181153 to JS, and the Chilean National Oceanographic Committee grant C22 16-09.",,Coral Reefs of the World,Mesophotic Coral Ecosystems,"Yossi Loya, Kimberly A.

While their relatives Megaloptera and Raphidioptera have biting mouthparts also in their larval stage, the larvae of Neuroptera are characterized by conspicuous sucking jaws that are used to imbibe fluids, mostly the haemolymph of prey. They comprise a mandibular and a maxillary part and can be curved or straight, long or short. In the pupal stages, a transformation from the larval sucking to adult biting and chewing mouthparts takes place. The development during metamorphosis indicates that the larval maxillary stylet contains the Anlagen of different parts of the adult maxilla and that the larval mandibular stylet is a lateral outgrowth of the mandible. The mouthparts of extant adult Neuroptera are of the biting and chewing functional type, whereas from the Mesozoic era forms with siphonate mouthparts are also known. Various food sources are used in larvae and in particular in adult Neuroptera. Morphological adaptations of the mouthparts of adult Neuroptera to the feeding on honeydew, pollen and arthropods are described in several examples. New hypotheses on the diet of adult Nevrorthidae and Dilaridae are presented.","We sincerely thank Brian Metscher (University of Vienna) for providing microCT scans which have proved to be helpful ever since.

236,pub.1117907417,10.4324/9781315206646-3,,,Towards a Disability-inclusive Higher Education Policy through the Capabilities Approach,"Evidence from international literature shows that despite interventions and policies, students with disabilities face persistent challenges in higher education. The capabilities approach can take us forward in addressing these challenges in two ways. Nussbaum’s version of the capabilities approach, in particular, provides us with an analytical framework to explore valued opportunities and freedoms from a social justice perspective. Secondly, in line with Sen’s argument, the approach can serve as the informational base for disability policies. In this study, the capabilities approach is operationalized within education by applying Walker’s list of eight valued freedoms and opportunities to students with disabilities. Data are drawn from a qualitative study examining the processes through which students with disabilities at two South African universities make their educational choices and negotiate different structures on their way to, and in higher education. These students identified key valued freedoms and opportunities that are needed to access and succeed in higher education. Four of the eight valued freedoms and opportunities on Walker’s list emerged strongly in this study. Seven other valued freedoms and opportunities which fall outside of Walker’s list were also identified. These 11 key valued freedoms and opportunities, we argue, are needed for the formulation of socially just disability-inclusive policies. International studies on disability and higher education have shown that students with disabilities face significant challenges in higher education beyond those experienced by students without disabilities. This chapter utilizes the capabilities approach as a frame of analysis to introduce a language of well-being and agency, while taking account of the relationship between individual opportunities and social arrangements which shape students’ ability to convert their means to achieve into freedoms and actual achievements. It focuses upon earlier studies that have analysed the lives of people with disabilities using the capabilities approach, although these have not been located in higher education. The chapter explores major issues discussed in studies on disability in higher education, both internationally and nationally. Participants showed remarkable resilience in their education experiences, despite overwhelming challenges generated by conversion factors. The presence of an accessible higher education environment allows ease of access to offices, classrooms and residences.","We acknowledge the valuable comments and suggestions from Sophie Mitra, anonymous peer reviewers and the funding support to the CRHED by the UFS and the National Research Fund for this study.",,,"Health, Disability and the Capability Approach","Sophie Mitra, Jennifer Prah Ruger",,2019-04-17,2019,2019-04-17,2019-04-17,,,29-45,Closed,Chapter,"Mutanga, Oliver; Walker, Melanie","Mutanga, Oliver (); Walker, Melanie ()",,"Mutanga, Oliver (); Walker, Melanie ()",1,1,,0.47,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1117907417,"39 Education; 3902 Education Policy, Sociology and Philosophy; 3903 Education Systems; 3904 Specialist Studies In Education",4 Quality Education

Here, we report the results of the inspection of the large, deeply incised Cap de Creus, La Fonera and Blanes submarine canyons in order to assess the presence of cold-water corals at depths between 600 and 1500 m. Two complementary methodologies were applied: remotely operated vehicle dives for in situ observation, and Agassiz trawls to get biological samples. Remotely operated vehicle videos pictured aggregations of specimens of the solitary D. dianthus at 1409 m depth in La Fonera Canyon, which seemed to be alive. This is the first in situ observation of this species at such depths in the northwestern Mediterranean Sea. Agassiz trawl samples provided living M. oculata and L. pertusa in Blanes Canyon at 1200 and 900 m depth, respectively. They also yielded living D. dianthus in Cap de Creus Canyon at 900 m and in Blanes Canyon at 900 and 1200 m depth. Jointly with other recently published results, our findings demonstrate that submarine canyons in the northwestern Mediterranean Sea host significant cold-water coral populations, locally extending to water depths below 1000 m.","The work presented here was developed within the DOS MARES (ref.

Its narrative and practice both reflect and contribute to the region’s profound inequalities. However, citizenship is usually studied on the margins of society. Despite substantial public interest in recent mass mobilizations, the middle and upper classes are rarely approached as political agents or citizens. As the region’s middle classes continue to grow and new elites develop, their importance can only increase. This interdisciplinary volume addresses this gap, showcasing recent ethnographic research on middle- and upper-class citizenship in contemporary Latin America. It explores how the region’s middle and upper classes constitute themselves as citizens through politics and culture, and questions how these processes interact with the construction of difference and commonality, division and unity. Subsequently, this collection highlights how elite citizenships are constructed in dialogue with other identities, how these co-constructions reproduce or challenge inequality, and whether they have the potential to bring about change. Citizenship in the Latin American Upper and Middle Classes will appeal to scholars, advanced undergraduate and postgraduate students interested in fields such as Latin American Studies, Citizenship Studies, Political Science and Cultural Studies; and to a general readership interested in Latin American politics and society.",,,,,"Fiorella Montero-Diaz, Franka Winter",,2019-05-02,2019,2019-05-02,,,,,Closed,Monograph,,,,,10,6,,5.97,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1114066282,44 Human Society; 4408 Political Science,10 Reduced Inequalities; 4 Quality Education

These forested wetlands perform valuable ecosystem services, and both are endangered by threats of sea level rise and land use. Understanding the mechanisms that control the distribution of tidal forests has been greatly enhanced by innovation in measurement and modeling of tidal forcing brought about by satellite observation of sea level. Oceanographic hydrodynamic models can now be merged with riverine hydraulic models to address forcing functions in the upper estuary and tidal river. There are new opportunities to study these unique forested ecosystems in a context of (a) the physical driving mechanisms that control their distribution and (b) the anthropogenic and natural disturbances that impact these ecosystems. Remote sensing and geographic information system technology and hydrodynamic, hydraulic, and hydrologic modeling can and must be combined to understand the functioning of these dynamic systems and their interactions with the environment. This chapter summarizes the tidal process and ecosystem characteristics of tidal forested wetlands, with examples from eastern China and the Southeastern United States. The first example demonstrates the need for hydrodynamic modeling to correctly interpret a time series of satellite images in order to evaluate the impact of human management on tidal wetlands. The second examines both empirical data on tidal dynamics and geospatial modeling to examine effects of sea level rise on freshwater forested wetlands. A short review of two widely used large-scale hydrologic models is also provided for describing the flow transport in intertidal rivers, a transition between tidal estuaries and freshwater nontidal wetlands.","We thank anonymous reviewers for their thoughtful comments and suggestions, which improved the manuscript.

In organizational theory, dynamic capability is defined as an organization’s ability to react and adapt adequately and rapidly to external change. In today’s global economy, pursuing sustainable strategies and practices is critical to organizational success.Complying with externally and internally imposed sustainability targets might initially appear as a restriction for organizations; however, they can be transformed into a new set of opportunities. This means that the classic ways in which management absorbs the experiences associated with evolving conditions, organizational frameworks and markets must be reconsidered in light of the preservation of the technological, environmental and social ecosystems. Featuring research and case studies from sectors such as NGOs, SMEs, education and agriculture, this book offers students, academics, practitioners and policymakers a multi-faceted understanding of how and why knowledge, innovation and sustainability are intricately linked—and offers insight into best practices that balance organizational and societal needs.",,,"Innovation, Technology, and Knowledge Management",,"Marta Peris-Ortiz, João J.

In the north, the coast is characterized by continuous, regular, and wave-exposed shores, while to south of 40°S it is highly fragmented, with extensive fjords and small archipelagos with many wave-protected zones. The Humboldt Current System (HCS) determines oceanographic and ecological processes in the northern part, with persistent upwelling fronts and episodic “El Niño” events. In the southern part the southward-flowing Magellan Current is important. Coastal upwelling along the HCS sustains a diverse pelagic and benthic food web structure. Rocky coastal habitats are dominated by large kelp forests and filter-feeding species like reef-forming mussels and tunicates. The main coastal habitats along the coast of Chile are rocky shores, sandy beaches, coastal wetlands, and dunes. The main populated zones are concentrated between 33°S to 35°S in central Chile, with economically important trading ports. Sewage discharges from large cities have the potential to increase nutrients levels in nearshore habitats causing localized eutrophication. Mining activities in northern Chile contaminate coastal waters, while in the south intensive aquaculture affects the fjord ecosystem. Also, subsistence harvesting (of kelps, molluscs, fish) is dramatically reducing the abundance of top consumers or habitat-forming species. The diverse and productive coastal marine ecosystems are used by different socioeconomic activities and exposed to interventions which are potentially harmful. Ecosystem services should be managed, and necessary interventions carefully planned. Achieving sustainable use of natural marine resources and coastal ecosystem integrity is challenging, and a basic understanding of ecosystem responses to direct human impacts and global climate change require better monitoring strategies. The establishment of a marine reserve “Humboldt Current System” would be a major step toward this goal.","MAA was financed by FONDECYT grant #1160223, and PAI-CONICYT#79150002 during the writing of the chapter.

141,pub.1121736094,10.1163/9789004423435,,,The Global Phenomenon of Family-Owned or Managed Universities,,,"Many FOMHEIs have deep financial reserves due to individual family members who have acquired wealth from other business ventures. Others with longer histories have built wealth over time. However, many, if not a majority of FOMHEIs (especially newer ones) are not as well off as the public may believe. These institutions, like many around the world, find securing and generating revenue to be an enormous challenge. One reason is the disproportionate concentration of national research funding to a small group of elite universities. According to Kim (2008), top-tier institutions receive 46 percent of total disbursements. As a result, the remaining share of research monies become the focus of intense competition among the hundreds of lower-tier universities, including many FOMHEIs. Another challenge lies in satisfying strict research funding criteria. Some government research funding is disbursed only when institutions can match funds or demonstrate linkages with local businesses. While fulfilling such criteria may be easy for wealthier universities in major cities where businesses abound, rural FOMHEIs find this difficult. Many rural FOMHEIs not only have fewer resources (making it difficult to match grants), but also operate in less developed communities devoid of businesses. They thus struggle to receive funding that requires partnerships with local businesses. Demographic changes and the shrinking youth population pose an even greater risk to the financial footing of all institutions in the private sector. Private institutions depend on tuition revenue as their primary source of operating income. This overdependence is extremely risky in a context where low fertility rates and brain drain translate into rapidly declining student enrollment and large budgetary gaps. The imperatives are very clear—find ways to maintain enrollment or identify alternative funding strategies to offset shortages in tuition revenue. Unfortunately, for many FOMHEIs, pursuing either option offers little promise. The former is not easily addressed due to the shape of national demand in Korea and domestic migration patterns. The latter is equally challenging due to excessive government controls and URP penalty schemes that limit an institution’s ability to recoup costs. While financial cost-recovery strategies such as raising tuition and transferring more financial responsibility to students and their families have been on the uptake in various parts of the world, the Korean government has taken a different approach. The government not only penalizes institutions for increasing tuition levels above socially determined limits, but also demands greater institutional student aid in line with URP goals. This has forced many underfunded FOMHEIs, or those anticipating funding challenges in the future, to rely on cost-cutting solutions to offset tuition losses and outlays for student aid. Cost-cutting solutions may range from academic retrenchment like discontinuing programs and courses to hiring more contingent (part-time) faculty. These solutions are temporary at best and may have an adverse effect on academic quality. Part-time faculty may not bring the same level of commitment to their work and research as their full-time peers. A final funding challenge is unique to the financial structure of ownership. Historically, the financial structure was centralized, and the parent foundation and affiliated institutions shared a single accounting system. Such a structure allowed for the movement of funds among the different organizations controlled by the same family. This approach was useful for filling budgetary gaps at one institution by borrowing funds from another. Financial crises have been avoided with the ability to move funds around quickly and easily. Further, the centralized accounting system allowed for using surplus institutional funds as seed money to develop additional funding streams. For example, families would use university resources to establish business ventures that pumped profits into institutional accounts. Such a strategy, understood as a form of social entrepreneurship (Mair & Noboa, 2006), is allowed under Korea’s Private School Act and may be vital to support financially floundering institutions that could use the extra financial boost in times of financial reversal. These financial strategies, however, can no longer be applied. The Korean government now mandates a decentralized accounting structure with controls in place to prevent the sharing of funds between institutions. While the “every tub stands on its own bottom” (Barr & McClellan, 2018) approach is well-meaning and perhaps necessary to keep owner families accountable and minimize “tunneling” activities, the new system seems to have created additional funding challenges for FOMHEIs. Most FOMHEIs around the world have been established by individuals or groups of individuals using a combination of personal and external resources. External resources include bank loans, capital investments, and donations. Donations are both financial as well as in-kind, such as land grants from local and federal governments. Toledo University Center in Brazil, for example, was founded with the personal funds of the founder, land donations, and bank loans. Based on the cases, it is typical for founders to commit significant personal resources to the establishment of their institutions. FOMHEIs are often bankrolled by wealthy families or individuals. Often, founding an institution of higher education is not their first venture. These families and individuals already operate successful businesses outside of higher education that have generated significant wealth. This wealth is used toward establishing institutions of higher education. Such is the story of Al Ghurair University in Dubai, founded by the Al Ghurair family, one of the wealthiest families in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). They built their wealth through various business ventures and investments including running one of the largest banks in the UAE. Whether FOMHEIs result from mergers between smaller FOMHEIs, private investment from wealthy families, or by borrowing money from banks, all FOMHEIs rely heavily on tuition revenue to sustain operations. This funding structure mirrors that of the broader category of the private higher education sector. Tuition revenue at most private institutions is significant relative to other revenue sources such as research grants, donations (virtually non-existent in most countries outside of the US and UK), and direct government assistance. In most of the case studies, the government does not provide direct assistance at all. The exceptions are Korea, Brazil, and Colombia where public resources—though insubstantial in the case of Korea and irregularly disbursed in the case of Colombia—flow to the private sector. Some FOMHEIs supplement tuition revenue with other forms of income. Publicly-listed FOMHEIs generate additional cash flow by attracting investors seeking some stake in company equity (e.g., China Education Group). Others benefit financially or from in-kind charitable donations from their wealthy founders. Still some FOMHEIs complement main revenue streams with income generated through social entrepreneurship. In this arrangement, families draw funds from other non-education businesses they establish to support the academic mission of their institution. And finally, some institutions are part of a family-owned educational conglomerate that may include primary and secondary schools. Such arrangements may be found in Japan, the Philippines, India, Brazil, Armenia, and other countries in Asia and Latin America. The lower-level schools may generate additional revenue through fees that may be allocated to the postsecondary institution and vice versa. Revenue is shared among different organizations within the family conglomerate.",,,"Philip G. Altbach, Edward Choi, Mathew R.

Donald Trump’s presidency has transformed trans-Pacific economic and political relations, contrasting sharply with President Obama’s ‘pivot to Asia’ strategy. Unilateralism and bilateralism have returned to the center stage, at the cost of regionalism, interregionalism, and multilateralism. Understanding these new dynamics requires closer examination of the underlying domestic political economies. Examining ten country case studies of multi-actor agency at the national level, expert contributors argue that trans-Pacific relations should not only be explained in terms of the behavior of the major powers, but that medium powers, and even small countries, can exert influence and occupy strategic nodes and contribute to shaping a new international relations network.

132,pub.1115244414,10.4324/9780429447440,,,Public Probity and Corruption in Chile,"In most Latin American countries, key officials and political figures have been involved in big corruption scandals in the last decade, leading to a rigorous academic debate on the possible socio-economic, political and cultural factors responsible for corrupt practices across the region. This book takes a different approach by focusing on Chile, which shows the lowest levels of corruption in the region. Instead of analysing notoriously bad cases in Mexico, Argentina, Brazil and Venezuela, this book explores the factors which have led to a relatively high degree of public probity among power holders in Chile. Public Probity and Corruption in Chile presents a long-term historical analysis, demonstrating that public probity in Chile has its roots in the colonial period, and that public and state responses have historically shown a low level of tolerance for public cases of corruption. In particular, the author highlights the role played by relative poverty and lack of resources, geographical remoteness, the impact of the Arauco War against the Mapuche people, the militarisation of both government and public administration, the extreme oligarchic nature of the Chilean aristocracy, the early consolidation of state institutions and the rule of law, high levels of political stability and the role played by patriotism. Studying an example of better practice in detail in this way provides valuable insights into the factors and actors which can help to prevent or to revert the phenomenon of public corruption in the region more generally. As such, this book will be of interest to researchers of corruption and public probity both in Chile and further afield.",,,,,,,2019-05-22,2019,2019-05-22,,,,,Closed,Monograph,"Silva, Patricio","Silva, Patricio ()",,"Silva, Patricio ()",1,1,,0.6,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1115244414,44 Human Society; 4408 Political Science,"16 Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions"

It discusses the motives and methods of activists, and how they document and criticise wrongdoing by governments. It documents the dialectical process by which repression stimulates and shapes the forces of resistance against it. Drawing on over 350 interviews with activists, this book discusses their motives; the tactics they use to withstand and challenge repression; and the legal and other norms they draw upon to challenge the state, including various forms of law and religious teaching. It analyses the relation between political activism and charitable work, and the often ambivalent views of civil society organisations towards violence. It highlights struggles over land as one of the key areas of state and corporate crime and civil resistance. The interviews illustrate and enrich the theoretical premise that civil society plays a vital part in defining, documenting and denouncing state crime.

Contributors to the Handbook look to the most recent research and thinking to shed light on topics every parent, professional, and policymaker wonders about. Parenting is a perennially “hot” topic. After all, everyone who has ever lived has been parented, and the vast majority of people become parents themselves. No wonder bookstores house shelves of “how-to” parenting books, and magazine racks in pharmacies and airports overflow with periodicals that feature parenting advice. However, almost none of these is evidence-based. The Handbook of Parenting is. Period. Each chapter has been written to be read and absorbed in a single sitting, and includes historical considerations of the topic, a discussion of central issues and theory, a review of classical and modern research, and forecasts of future directions of theory and research. Together, the five volumes in the Handbook cover Children and Parenting, the Biology and Ecology of Parenting, Being and Becoming a Parent, Social Conditions and Applied Parenting, and the Practice of Parenting. Volume 3, Being and Becoming a Parent, considers a large cast of characters responsible for parenting, each with her or his own customs and agenda, and examines what the psychological characteristics and social interests of those individuals reveal about what parenting is. Chapters in Part I, on The Parent, show just how rich and multifaceted is the constellation of children’s caregivers. Considered first are family systems and then successively mothers and fathers, coparenting and gatekeeping between parents, adolescent parenting, grandparenting, and single parenthood, divorced and remarried parenting, lesbian and gay parents and, finally, sibling caregivers and nonparental caregiving. Parenting also draws on transient and enduring physical, personality, and intellectual characteristics of the individual. The chapters in Part II, on Becoming and Being a Parent, consider the intergenerational transmission of parenting, parenting and contemporary reproductive technologies, the transition to parenthood, and stages of parental development, and then chapters turn to parents’ well-being, emotions, self-efficacy, cognitions, and attributions as well as socialization, personality in parenting, and psychoanalytic theory. These features of parents serve many functions: they generate and shape parental practices, mediate the effectiveness of parenting, and help to organize parenting.",,,,,Marc H.

The authors provide an overview and classification of these rocks and elucidate the geochemical differences between barren and mineralized potassic igneous complexes. High-K rocks are genetically associated with a number of epithermal gold and porphyry copper-gold deposits. In recent years, there has also been growing recognition of an association of such rocks with iron-oxide copper-gold (IOCG) deposits, intrusion-related gold deposits (IRGDs) and Carlin-type gold deposits. This fifth updated and expanded edition incorporates new data and references from world-class copper and gold deposits worldwide. It also includes the latest publications on the petrogenesis of high-K magmatism and related mineral deposits. Numerous new representative ore photographs of the mineral deposits described are also included in the new edition. As such, the book offers a valuable guide not only for academic petrologists working on alkaline rocks, but also for exploration geologists prospecting for epithermal gold and/or porphyry copper-gold deposits in modern and ancient terrains.",,,Mineral Resource Reviews,,,,2019,2019,,2019,,,,Closed,Monograph,"Müller, Daniel; Groves, David I.","Müller, Daniel (NDP Exploration Team—Target Generation, QPX Chile, Las Condes, Santiago, Chile); Groves, David I.

This book offers an up-to-date analysis of these programmes and the way they relate to labour inclusion, and analyses ongoing debates regarding the possible incentives and disincentives they create in terms of the labour supply, formalization and child labour among the target population. Considering that poverty is a structural problem of highly unequal societies, the thesis that poverty is due to a lack of effort on the part of the poor is argued to be an expression of the strong prejudice against those living in poverty, the great majority of whom work or are actively seeking employment, but are hampered by the large decent work deficits existing in the region. From an integrated and rights-based perspective, public policies should simultaneously address the twofold challenge of social and labour inclusion in order to achieve basic thresholds of well-being by ensuring income, universal access to good-quality social services and opportunities for decent work.",,,ECLAC Books,,,,2019-06-20,2019,,2019-06-20,,,,Closed,Monograph,"Abramo, Laís; Cecchini, Simone; Morales, Beatriz","Abramo, Laís (); Cecchini, Simone (); Morales, Beatriz ()",,"Abramo, Laís (); Cecchini, Simone (); Morales, Beatriz ()",14,3,,8.7,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1119802895,44 Human Society; 4404 Development Studies,1 No Poverty; 10 Reduced Inequalities; 8 Decent Work and Economic Growth

It brings together specialists in the Spanish and Portuguese imperial spheres, their geographic and cultural borderlands in both South and North America, and their maritime networks across the Caribbean, Atlantic and Pacific oceans. Its objectives emphasize (1) scholarship published in Latin America as well as new research published in diverse academic communities; (2) transdisciplinary research in fields such as ecology, archaeology, art history, geography, musicology, and anthropology that inform the current field of borderlands scholarship; (3) accessible language and imagery to make this work appeal widely to students, teachers, and scholars. “Borderlands” as a concept and a field of academic inquiry has opened new dimensions of interdisciplinary and critical thought in the last quarter-century at the same time that ethnohistorical approaches to imperialism and colonialism have produced critical analyses of European imperial spheres in the Americas and other world regions. This Handbook offers new research on environmental change, powerful indigenous federations in both North and South America, gendered histories in the mixed and volatile social fabrics of borderlands, indigenous enslavement and the complex degrees of difference between freedom and bondage, Afro-descendant populations in the Spanish and Portuguese borderlands, interethnic relations, and cultural productions in the arts and sciences.",,,,,"Danna A.

The basic concept of this book is to examine the use of innovative methods augmenting traditional plant breeding towards the improvement and development of new crop varieties, under the increasingly limiting environmental and cultivation factors, to achieve sustainable agricultural production and enhanced food security. In addition to developing improved crops for innovative industrial products such as pharmaceuticals and food additives, biofuels, oils and textiles. Three volumes of this book series were published in 2015, 2016 and 2018, respectively: Volume 1. Breeding, Biotechnology and Molecular Tools; Volume 2. Agronomic, Abiotic and Biotic Stress Traits and Volume 3. Fruits. In 2019, the following four volumes are concurrently being published: Volume 4. Nut and Beverage Crops, Volume 5. Cereals, Volume 6. Industrial and Food Crops and Volume 7. Legumes. This Volume 5, subtitled Cereals, focuses on advances in breeding strategies using both traditional and modern approaches for the improvement of individual crops. It addresses important staple food crops including barley, fonio, finger millet, foxtail millet, pearl millet, proso millet, quinoa, rice, rye, tef, triticale and spelt wheat. Chapters are written by 60 internationally reputable scientists from 14 countries and subjected to a review process to assure quality presentation and scientific accuracy.

Global South perspectives are encapsulated in struggles for basic, economic, political, and social transformation in an inequitable world, and are not confined to the geographical South. Taking a critical perspective on southern theories, demonstrating why it is important to view the world from southern perspectives, and why such positions must be open to critical investigation, this book: charts the impacts of these theories on approaches to multilingualism, language learning, language in education, literacy and diversity, language rights, and language policy; provides broad historical and geographical understandings of the movement towards a southern perspective and draws on Indigenous and southern ways of thinking that challenge mainstream viewpoints; seeks to develop alternative understandings of applied linguistics, expand the intellectual repertoires of the discipline, and challenge the complicities between applied linguistics, colonialism, and capitalism. charts the impacts of these theories on approaches to multilingualism, language learning, language in education, literacy and diversity, language rights, and language policy; provides broad historical and geographical understandings of the movement towards a southern perspective and draws on Indigenous and southern ways of thinking that challenge mainstream viewpoints; seeks to develop alternative understandings of applied linguistics, expand the intellectual repertoires of the discipline, and challenge the complicities between applied linguistics, colonialism, and capitalism.

Organized thematically, this book builds from the ground up, shedding light on the full, diverse range of institutions—including small liberal arts schools, junior and community colleges, black and white women’s colleges, black colleges, and state colleges—that have been instrumental in creating the higher education system we know today. A People’s History of American Higher Education focuses on those participants who may not have been members of elite groups, yet who helped push elite institutions and the country as a whole. This pathbreaking textbook addresses key issues that have often been condemned to exceptions and footnotes—if not ignored completely—in historical considerations of U.S. higher education; particularly race, ethnicity, gender, and class. Hutcheson introduces readers to both social and intellectual history, providing invaluable perspectives and methodologies for graduate students and faculty members alike. A People’s History of American Higher Education surveys the varied characteristics of the diverse populations constituting or striving for the middle class through educational attainment, providing a narrative that unites often divergent historical fields.

It provides essential insights into a number of contextual changes that organizations are facing internationally, and is structured around three complementary themes. In the first part, recent economic and financial crises are analysed and presented as revealing transitions for the business world. In the second part, the impact of these transitions is assessed at the level of various key economic players in today’s societies (states, business networks, companies, associations, etc.).

Its colonial origins and its unaffordability for most Africans make it a bad fit for the continent, yet it was also central to the creation of most postcolonial African national literary canons. These bipolar traditions remain unresolved in recent debates about Afropolitanism and the novel in Africa today. This book extends this debate, arguing that Africa’s ‘de-realization’ in global representation and the global economy is reflected in the African novel becoming dominated by Afropolitan, rather than African, aesthetics, styles, and forms. Drawing on close readings of a variety of major African novels of the 2000s, the volume traces the tensions between the novel’s complicity with and resistance to such de-realization. The book argues that current trends and experiments in African non-realist genres, such as science fiction, magical and animist realism, Afro-futurism, and speculative environmentalism, are the result of a preoccupation with such de-realization. The volume is a significant exploration into literary form and its social, philosophical, political, and economic underpinnings.

The role of wetlands in either cooling or warming the climate is analyzed as the net balance between carbon sequestration and emissions of methane and nitrous oxide. Wetlands start off having a net warming effect on the climate but in time switch to net cooling. Further, they remove 40% of the N and P from run-off and groundwater flow in agricultural areas, but wetlands need to amount to 10% of the total catchment area to make a difference. Reflecting on the recent large investment in wetland ecological studies in China and neighboring countries, the book addresses invasive species in coastal wetlands as well as the protection and wise use of tidal flats around the Yellow Sea. It also presents promising regional case studies on wetland restoration.

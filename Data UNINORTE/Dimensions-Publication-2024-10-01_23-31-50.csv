The comparison is done using network parameters and during the development of computer programming tasks and the solution of first-order algebraic equations. For that purpose, electroencephalographic recordings (EEG) were made with a volunteer group of 16 students of systems engineering of Universidad del Norte in Colombia, while they were performing computer programming tasks and solving first-order algebraic equations with three levels of difficulty. Then, based on the Synchronization Likelihood method, graph models of functional cortical networks were developed, whose parameters of Small-Worldness (SWN), global(Eg) and local (El) efficiency were compared between both types of tasks. From this study, it can be highlighted, first, the novelty of studying cortical function during the solution of algebraic equations and during programming tasks; second, significant differences between both types of tasks observed only in the delta and theta bands. Likewise, the differences between simpler mathematical tasks with the other levels in both types of tasks; third, the Brodmann areas 21 and 42, associated with auditory sensory processing, can be considered as differentiating elements of programming tasks; as well as Brodmann area 8, during equation solving.",I am very grateful to the coordination of the Chemistry and Biology Department at Universidad del Norte for their permanent support in this research.,The author(s) received no specific funding for this work.,PLOS ONE,,Fabio Rapallo,Humans; Cerebral Cortex; Electroencephalography; Algorithms; Mathematics; Colombia,2023-06-27,2023,2023-06-27,,18,6,e0274713,All OA; Gold,Article,"Hernández, Oscar; Zurek, Eduardo; Barbosa, John; Villasana, Minaya","Hernández, Oscar (Departamento de Química y Biología, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Atlántico, Colombia); Zurek, Eduardo (Departamento de Ingeniería de sistemas, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Atlántico, Colombia); Barbosa, John (Departamento de Ingeniería de sistemas, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Atlántico, Colombia); Villasana, Minaya (Departamento de Cómputo Científico y Estadística, Universidad Simón Bolivar, Caracas, Venezuela)","Hernández, Oscar (Universidad del Norte)","Hernández, Oscar (Universidad del Norte); Zurek, Eduardo (Universidad del Norte); Barbosa, John (Universidad del Norte); Villasana, Minaya (Simón Bolívar University)",0,0,,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0274713&type=printable,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1160154648,46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4611 Machine Learning,

This is within the framework of the multi-country project coordinated by UNFPA and WHO aimed at generating evidence on the role of facilitators in the delivery of CSE in non-school contexts. The research was carried out in four municipalities in northern Colombia, in rural and marginal urban contexts with conditions of vulnerability for the adolescent population, including a strong presence of migrant populations from Venezuela. A total of 150 male and female adolescents ages 10-17 participated in the formative research. Workshops such as patchwork quilt, body mapping and talking maps were used as methods to gather information. The groups were divided by sex and age (10-13 years old and 14-17 years old). Knowledge, attitudes and social norms regarding adolescent pregnancy, sexually transmitted infections, including human immunodeficiency virus, and gender-based violence, were identified in adolescents (schooled and not schooled, but with minimal or no access to CSE). All of the above enabled us to establish a set of recommendations for the strengthening of the CSE strategy Tírala plena.","Special thanks to the team of Universidad del Norte that was part of the research, including Greys Jiménez, Moisés Carrillo and Gabriela Monsalvo.

The effect of GB misorientation on the mechanical properties, fracture resistance, and crack propagation are evaluated under monotonic and cyclic load conditions. The J-integral and the crack tip opening displacement (CTOD) are assessed to establish the effect of the GB misorientation angle on the fracture resistance. The simulations reveal that the misorientation angle plays a significant role in the mechanical response of Al bicrystals.

This article presents the first report of a cohort of Venezuelan migrant women entering Colombia through Cúcuta and its metropolitan area. The study aimed to describe the health status and access to healthcare services among Venezuelan migrant women in Colombia with irregular migration status, and to analyze changes in those conditions at a one-month follow-up.
METHODS: We carried out a longitudinal cohort study of Venezuelan migrant women, 18 to 45 years, who entered Colombia with an irregular migration status. Study participants were recruited in Cúcuta and its metropolitan area. At baseline, we administered a structured questionnaire including sociodemographic characteristics, migration history, health history, access to health services, sexual and reproductive health, practice of early detection of cervical cancer and breast cancer, food insecurity, and depressive symptoms. The women were again contacted by phone one month later, between March and July 2021, and a second questionnaire was applied.
RESULTS: A total of 2,298 women were included in the baseline measurement and 56.4% could be contacted again at the one-month follow-up. At the baseline, 23.0% of the participants reported a self-perceived health problem or condition in the past month and 29.5% in the past 6 months, and 14.5% evaluated their health as fair or poor. A significant increase was found in the percentage of women who reported a self-perceived health problem during the past month (from 23.1% to 31.4%; p<0.01); as well as in the share who reported moderate, severe, or extreme difficulty working or performing daily chores (from 5.5% to 11.0%; p = 0.03) and who rated their health as fair (from 13.0% to 31.2%; p<0.01). Meanwhile, the percentage of women with depressive symptoms decreased from 80.5% to 71.2% (p<0.01).
CONCLUSION: This report presents initial information on the health status of Venezuelan migrant women in Colombia, and is a starting point for further longer longitudinal follow-ups to assess changes over time in health conditions.","We thank the health authorities of Cúcuta and Villa del Rosario, the local migrant organizations, and all the women who participated in this study.","This study was possible thanks to the generous support of the people of the United States through the Community Stabilization Activities (CSA) of the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) which funded this survey (https://www.usaid.gov/colombia).

While some products become outdated due to natural causes such as wear and tear or technological advancements, others are strategically designed with a predetermined shelf life to encourage rapid product turnover. Obsolescence is an essential issue in product design because of its impact on product life, efficiency, and sustainability. Although there are approaches to map and measure possible product obsolescence scenarios, it remains a challenge to quantify and diagnose a product's or component's obsolescence potential based on its design attributes. Therefore, this article aims to analyze the existing literature on obsolescence from a product design perspective. It covers its application in methodological design strategies, metrics for measuring obsolescence from early design stages, and identifying understudied research topics, challenges, and trends. On August 15, 2023, a total of 221 articles published between 1983 and 2023 on SCOPUS, Web of Science, and Google Scholar were selected and analyzed using a content-based research approach encompassing three main aspects: objectives and methodologies, strategies and design phases, and metrics for obsolescence analysis. As main findings, this literature review identified several methodological design approaches aimed at resisting and postponing obsolescence, mainly divided into designing long-life products and extending product life. Nevertheless, this study found no formal identification of product design attributes related to the different types of obsolescence, and obsolescence forecasting metrics have focused on defining whether the scenario happens but do not consider what type of obsolescence the product may exhibit. Consequently, it can be challenging to determine the most effective design strategy to reduce obsolescence. This study has limitations, including the potential for researcher bias to affect the systematization of the information.",Declaration of competing interest The authors declare the following financial interests/personal relationships which may be considered as potential competing interests:Lesly Sierra-Fontalvo financial support was provided by Universidad del Norte.,"This research work was supported by Vicerrectoría de Investigación, Creación e Innovación, Universidad del Norte under contract UN-OJ-2022-57,010.",Heliyon,,,,2023-11-04,2023,2023-11-04,2023-11,9,11,e21856,All OA; Gold,Article,"Sierra-Fontalvo, Lesly; Gonzalez-Quiroga, Arturo; Mesa, Jaime A.","Sierra-Fontalvo, Lesly (GIMYP Research Unit, Department of Mechanical Engineering, Universidad del Norte, Km 5 Vía Puerto Colombia, Barranquilla, 080001, Colombia); Gonzalez-Quiroga, Arturo (UREMA Research Unit, Department of Mechanical Engineering, Universidad del Norte, Km 5 Vía Puerto Colombia, Barranquilla, 080001, Colombia); Mesa, Jaime A.

However, micro-learning has become popular in e-Learning environments as a course design technique due to short attention spans, demand for small chunks of information, and time constraints. Hence, it has been selected for creating reading mobile applications provided to the nature of its learning approach. In order to describe the multiple iterations of design, development, and evaluation of this general framework, a methodology named Design-Based Research (DBR) is implemented. First, the article presents the abstract framework components and a cloud-based software architecture that allows a modular approach to creating such applications. The pathway developed through adapting the iPAC framework, which involves personalization, authenticity, and collaboration, is part of the methodology used to design the app under pedagogical and technological considerations. The process demanded the following phases: analysis and exploration, design and construction, evaluation and reflection, redesign and reconstruction, and final critical reflections. Four applied instruments also validate the framework implementation: The iPAC Rubric, an aphorisms checklist, a pre and post-test, a focus group, and a usability test taken by 28 students in a private university in Colombia. Findings indicated that Design-Based Research (DBR) methodology emerged as an appropriate tool to encounter the needs behind reading applications design due to its sequence of operations yields results successively closer to adequate usability standards and smooth implementation. They also reveal the positive impact of new types of texts on students' motivation and awareness toward other reading strategies and micro-learning. This impact indeed proved the proposed framework's effectiveness for designing micro-learning applications.",,"This work was supported by the Ministry of Sciences of Colombia (MinCiencias).

Eligible participants had lived in the intervention or control areas for at least 2 years and were not planning to move within the next 2 years. Physical activity was assessed among participants in the intervention and control areas before and after the inauguration of TransMiCable in Ciudad Bolívar with the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (long form) and with wearable accelerometers. Complete cases (those with baseline and follow-up data) were included in analyses. Respondents were classed as being physically active if they met 2020 WHO guidelines (≥150 min per week of moderate activity, ≥75 min per week of vigorous activity, or equivalent combinations); and accelerometery data were classified with the Freedson cut-points for adults. Data were also gathered in zonal parks (area ≥10 000 m2) and neighbourhood parks (area <10 000 m2) in the intervention and control areas by direct observation with the System for Observing Play and Recreation in Communities, to assess levels of physical activity before and after the TransMiCable intervention. Multilevel regression models were used to assess changes in physical activity associated with the TransMiCable intervention.
FINDINGS: Physical activity questionnaires were completed by 2052 adult participants (1289 [62·8%] women and 763 [37·2%] men; mean age 43·5 years [SD 17·7]) before the inauguration of TransMiCable. After the inauguration, the follow-up (final) questionnaire sample comprised 825 adults in the intervention group and 854 in the control group, including 357 adults in the intervention group and 334 in the control group with valid accelerometery data. 334 (40·5%) of 825 participants in the intervention group reported levels of physical activity that met the 2020 WHO guidelines during walking for transport before the intervention, and 426 (51·6%) afterwards (change 11·1 percentage points [95% CI 6·4 to 15·9]). A similar change was observed in the control group (change 8·0 percentage points [3·4 to 12·5]; adjusted odds ratio [OR] for the time-by-group interaction, intervention vs control group: 1·1 [95% CI 0·8 to 1·5], p=0·38). Time spent doing moderate-to-vigorous physical activity, measured with accelerometers, did not change in the intervention group after the inauguration of TransMiCable (change -0·8 min per day [-4·6 to 3·0]) and did not change compared with the control group (adjusted β for the time-by-group interaction: 1·4 min per day [95% CI -2·0 to 4·9], p=0·41). Moderate-to-vigorous physical activity was 52·1 min per day (SD 24·7) before and 59·4 min per day (35·2) after the inauguration of TransMiCable in new regular users who reported using TransMiCable during mandatory trips for work or education (n=32; change 7·3 min per day [-22·5 to 7·9]). After the intervention, an increase in the proportion of male individuals engaging in moderate or vigorous physical activity was observed in a renovated zonal park (adjusted OR for the time-by-group interaction, intervention vs control park: 2·7 [1·1 to 6·8], p=0·033). Female users of a renovated neighbourhood park were less likely to become engaged in moderate or vigorous physical activity than female users of the control area neighbourhood park (adjusted OR for the time-by-group interaction: 0·4 [0·1 to 0·6], p=0·019).
INTERPRETATION: It is encouraging that walking for transport remained high in the TransMiCable intervention area when the use of private motorised transport had increased elsewhere in Bogotá. In low-income urban areas, where transport-related walking is a necessity, transport interventions should be focused on efforts to maintain participation in active travel while improving conditions under which it occurs.

The main advantage of the Drift-Flux Model is the reduced number of differential equations, which results in a lower computational time. However, the accuracy of the model depends on a suitable constitutive equation for the velocity of the dispersed phase, commonly, the gas phase. The gas velocity constitutive equation includes two important parameters, namely, the distribution coefficient and the void-fraction-weighted drift velocity. A drift-flux-model code was developed, by using the Finite Volume Method (FVM) with staggered grid system, to evaluate the effect of highly viscous liquid and pipe geometry (pipe diameter and pipe inclination) in the prediction of liquid hold-up and pressure drop gradient. The gas phase compressibility was also included in the model. The results show that the energy consumption to pump the fluids through the lift system has been overestimated when highly viscous liquids are produced. For the case of a vertical upward flow, the overestimation can be up to 10 % of energy consumption. We strongly recommend incorporating the effects of pipe inclination and liquid viscosity into the estimation of the Distribution Coefficient of the dispersed phase, encompassing both C0 and gas drift velocity.",Declaration of competing interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.,"The authors gratefully acknowledge Universidad del Norte, Colombia (Contract Identification: CCBUNDDA/12/2016) for the financial support.

Physical-chemical characterization of the catalysts showed a significant change in morphological and optical properties of the TiO2 thin films after surface modification. We applied the kinetic and isothermal models to the methylene blue (MB) adsorption process on both catalysts. The pseudo-second order model was the best fitting model for the kinetic results; qe (mg/g) was 11.9 for TiO2 thin films and 14.6 for TiO2-AlPOM thin films, and k2 (g mg-1 min-1) was 16.3 × 10-2 for TiO2 thin films and 28.2 × 10-2 for TiO2-AlPOM thin films. Furthermore, the Freundlich model was suitable to describe the isothermal behavior of TiO2, KF (5.42 mg/g), and 1/n (0.312). The kinetics of photocatalytic degradation was fitted using the Langmuir-Hinshelwood model; kap was 7 × 10-4 min-1 for TiO2 and 13 × 10-4 min-1 for TiO2-AlPOM. The comparative study showed that TiO2 thin films reach a 19.6% MB degradation under UV irradiation and 9.1% MB adsorption, while the TiO2-AlPOM thin films reach a 32.6% MB degradation and 12.2% MB adsorption on their surface. The surface modification improves the morphological, optical, and photocatalytic properties of the thin films. Finally, the DFT study supports all the previously shown results.","W.V. and C.D.-U. thank Universidad del Atlántico, Ministry of Economy, Development and Tourism-Chile, grant Nuclei on Catalytic Processes towards Sustainable Chemistry (CSC) ANID-NCN2021_090.

In addition, a search for new energy-saving opportunities was performed. The results showed that interactions between the temperature of the air inlet, the humidity of the air inlet, and the fan speed level are significant in the mini-split energy performance under Caribbean climate conditions. Hence, working on an oriented energy savings control strategy is necessary. Therefore, this study recommends developing a fan speed control scheme, generating energy savings of around 10% in the air conditioning unit.","Declaration of Competing Interest The authors declare no conflict of interest.

We observed a surprising reduction in the optical band gap from 2.20 to 1.18 eV with increasing calcination temperature from 400 to 500 °C. Raman and X-Ray diffraction measurements indicated slight changes in the lattice parameters induced by the growth process. However, density functional theory calculations of the Rietveld-refined and pristine structures revealed that the observed optical gap reduction could not be explained by structural changes alone. By introducing oxygen vacancies to the refined structures, we could reproduce the reduction of the band gap. Our calculations also showed that the inclusion of oxygen vacancies at the vanadyl position creates a spin-polarized interband state that reduces the electronic band gap and promotes a magnetic response due to unpaired electrons. This prediction was confirmed by our magnetometry measurements, which exhibited a ferromagnetic-like behavior. Our findings suggest that oxygen vacancies play a crucial role in band gap reduction and the promotion of a ferromagnetic-like response in an otherwise paramagnetic material. This provides a promising route to engineer novel devices.","We gratefully acknowledge the support of the Physics Department and the Faculty of Science at Universidad de los Andes, Bogotá, Colombia.

Although refractory ascites are not a common complication, they can have a significant impact on patients' prognosis and quality of life.

We sought to validate a Latin-American Spanish version of the Body Esteem Scale for Adolescents and Adults (BESAA; Mendelson et al. 2001).MethodsThe BESAA was translated, culturally adapted, and validated in a sample of adults in Colombia (N = 525, 65% women, Mage 24.4, SD = 9.28). We assessed factor structure (using confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and exploratory structural equation model (ESEM)), internal reliability (using Cronbach’s alpha and omega), validity (using the Body Appreciation Scale BAS and Sociocultural Attitudes Towards Appearance Questionnaire SATAQ), test–retest stability in a small subsample (N = 84, using Intraclass correlations ICC) and measurement invariance across gender. To evaluate the generalizability of the scale, we assessed reliability, validity, and factor structure in a second sample from rural Nicaragua (N = 102, 73% women, Mage 22.2, SD = 4.72), and assessed measurement invariance across Nicaraguan and Colombian participants.ResultsThe scale showed good internal reliability and validity in both samples, and there was evidence of adequate test–retest stability in the Colombian sample. EFA showed a three-factor structure with subscales we labelled ‘appearance-positive’, ‘appearance-negative’ and ‘weight’, that was confirmed using CFA and ESEM in the Colombian sample. Measurement invariance was confirmed across the Colombian and Nicaraguan samples, and across gender within the Colombian sample.ConclusionThe Latin-American Spanish version of the BESAA (BESAA-LA) appears to be a psychometrically sound measure with good reliability, validity and invariance across gender and countries. These results support the use of this scale to measure body satisfaction/dissatisfaction in Latin American adult populations.","We thank Elvis Calero for his facilitation at the university of URACCAN, as well as all our participants for their time.

The catalytic tests were carried out in a MAT-type reactor under typical conditions. The zeolites were subjected to alkaline treatment with NaOH at concentrations ranging from 0.05 to 0.4 mol/L, resulting in the creation of several samples (Z-0.05, Z-0.10, Z-0.20, Z-0.30 and Z-0.40) that were then hydrothermally stabilized (Z-0.05-M, Z-0.10-M, Z-0.20-M, Z-0.30-M and Z-0.40-M) to increase mesoporosity and reduced crystallinity. The increase in mesoporosity was accompanied by an improvement in acidity. Despite Z-0.30-M having higher acidity, Z-0.00-M and Z-0.10-M exhibited the highest activity due to their high crystallinity and microporosity, yielding the highest gas yields. Gasoline was the main product, with maximum yields exceeding 30%. Z-0.20-M produced more aromatic and olefin compounds than the others, resulting in higher quality gasoline. Coke formation followed the trend: Z-0.00-M < Z-0.10-M < Z-0.20-M < Z-0.30-M. The higher intracrystalline mesoporosity in the zeolites favored the formation of a more condensed coke.","Declaration of competing interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

The present cross-sectional study assessed the association between health behaviors of first-semester students and these factors.
METHOD: N = 189 (Mage = 18.79; SD = 1.07; female = 68.8%) first-semester students in Colombia completed an online questionnaire investigating current and expected health behaviors as well as influencing factors. ANCOVAs, bivariate correlations, moderation analyses, and hierarchical regressions were used to analyze the data.
RESULTS: expected food consumption (stronger among participants who live with parents) as well as current and expected heavy drinking and binge drinking (stronger among participants who do not live with parents) were significantly correlated to the respective parental behavior. Current and expected drinking was significantly correlated to partners' drinking. Expected physical activity was correlated with peers' physical activity. Partners' attempts to encourage drinking moderated the association between participants' current and expected drinking with partners' drinking. Time spent with peers was related to heavy drinking and engaging in more physical activity.
CONCLUSION: in Colombia, parents appear to play a significant role in their offspring's health behaviors during their first semester at university, particularly regarding food consumption and alcohol use.

In Colombia, the use of illicit substances has increased up to 10.3%, while the consumption alcohol and tobacco has increased to 84% and 12%, respectively. It is well-known that identifying drug consumption patterns in the general population is essential in reducing overall drug consumption. However, existing approaches do not incorporate Machine Learning and/or Deep Data Mining methods in combination with spatial techniques. To enhance our understanding of mental health issues related to PAS and assist in the development of national policies, here we present a novel Deep Neural Network-based Clustering-oriented Embedding Algorithm that incorporates an autoencoder and spatial techniques. The primary goal of our model is to identify general and spatial patterns of drug consumption and abuse, while also extracting relevant features from the input data and identifying clusters during the learning process. As a test case, we used the largest publicly available database of legal and illegal PAS consumption comprising 49,600 Colombian households. We estimated and geographically represented the prevalence of consumption and/or abuse of both PAS and non-PAS, while achieving statistically significant goodness-of-fit values. Our results indicate that region, sex, housing type, socioeconomic status, age, and variables related to household finances contribute to explaining the patterns of consumption and/or abuse of PAS. Additionally, we identified three distinct patterns of PAS consumption and/or abuse. At the spatial level, these patterns indicate concentrations of drug consumption in specific regions of the country, which are closely related to specific geographic locations and the prevailing social and environmental contexts. These findings can provide valuable insights to facilitate decision-making and develop national policies targeting specific groups given their cultural, geographic, and social conditions.",,,PLOS ONE,,Vinícius Silva Belo,"Humans; Colombia; Neural Networks, Computer; Algorithms; Alcohol Drinking; Central Nervous System Agents; Cluster Analysis",2023-08-18,2023,2023-08-18,,18,8,e0290098,All OA; Gold,Article,"Palomino, Kevin; Berdugo, Carmen R; Vélez, Jorge I","Palomino, Kevin (Department of Industrial Engineering, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia.); Berdugo, Carmen R (Department of Industrial Engineering, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia.); Vélez, Jorge I (Department of Industrial Engineering, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia.)",,"Palomino, Kevin (Universidad del Norte); Berdugo, Carmen R (Universidad del Norte); Vélez, Jorge I (Universidad del Norte)",0,0,,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0290098&type=printable,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1163387315,46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4611 Machine Learning,3 Good Health and Well Being

(2) Methods: This is a multicenter study of nonimmunosuppressed adult patients who required hospitalization for CAP. Whole blood samples were obtained within 24 h of admission for genome-expression-profile analysis. Gene expression profiling identified both differentially expressed genes and enriched gene sets. (3) Results: A total of 198 samples from adult patients who required hospitalization for CAP were processed, of which 13 were from patients who died. Comparison of gene expression between patients who died and those who survived yielded 49 differentially expressed genes, 36 of which were upregulated and 13 downregulated. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) identified four positively enriched gene sets in survivors, mainly associated with the interferon-alpha response, apoptosis, and sex hormone pathways. Similarly, GSEA identified seven positively enriched gene sets, associated with the oxidative stress, endoplasmic reticulum stress, oxidative phosphorylation, and angiogenesis pathways, in the patients who died. Protein-protein-interaction-network analysis identified FOS, CDC42, SLC26A10, EIF4G2, CCND3, ASXL1, UBE2S, and AURKA as the main gene hubs.

One of the contexts in which the LTE is considered is the intensive care unit (ICU). This review is to describe the competencies for the execution of a nursing professional role in the LTE in the ICU.
Method: An integrative review of the literature published between the years 2010 and 2023. The search was carried out in five databases: Medline, Wiley Online Library, SciELO, ScienceDirect, and Web of Science. The Critical Appraisal Skills Programme in Spanish was used as the template for study evaluation. The methodology of the Oxford Center for Evidence-Based Medicine (CEBM) was used to assess the level of evidence and the degree of recommendation.
Result: A total of 25 articles in a wide range of studies were included. The findings suggest that the competencies for LTE in the ICU are direct patient care, family-centered care, and the role of the nurse within the team. However, more high-quality studies are needed to confirm these conclusions. Three categories were identified: (a) competencies as defender agent between the patient, his family, and the interdisciplinary team; (b) competencies for decision-making in limiting the therapeutic effort; and (c) competencies for nursing therapeutic interventions at the end of life.
Conclusion: The competencies of the nursing professionals who work in the adult ICU in the LTE are essential to the patient's quality of life, dignity of their death, and comprehensive family support for coping with grief.",Declaration of competing interest The authors declare no conflict of interest.,This research received no external funding.,International Journal of Nursing Sciences,,,,2023-12-19,2023,2023-12-19,2024-01,11,1,143-154,All OA; Gold,Article,"López-Panza, Elvia R.; Pacheco-Roys, Vanessa C.; Fernández-Ahumada, Kelly J.; Díaz-Mass, Diana C.; Expósito-Concepción, María Y.; Villarreal-Cantillo, Elizabeth; Gonzalez, Cesar I.

This study aims to compare the distribution of empathy levels, about functionality or dysfunction, and the three styles, which can be derived from family functioning in the families of Argentine medical students. Previously providing evidence of the validity of the family functioning measure. As well as provide evidence of the validity of the measure of family functioning.
METHODS: Ex post facto design: 306 Argentine medical students who had already taken the Jefferson Scale of Empathy-Spanish Edition (JSE-S) and the abbreviated Spanish Family Adaptability and Cohesion Evaluation Scale (FACES-20). A gender-weighted linear regression analysis was made, establishing an ANOVA and multiple comparisons via DMS to determine the effect of functional and dysfunctional families' balanced, intermediate and extreme functioning styles concerning empathy.
RESULTS: Students who presented dysfunction in familial cohesion and adaptability showed measures of empathy greater than those classified as functional. Differences of cohesion were statistically significant in compassionate care, perspective taking and general empathy. These components were significantly higher in students from families classified as extreme than balanced ones. Students classified within families with either extreme or dysfunctional styles showed greater levels of empathy than more adaptive and functional ones, except in the 'walking in patient's shoes' component where differences were not observed.
CONCLUSIONS: Individual resilience as an intervening variable in the presence of empathy is discussed.
IMPLICATIONS: The study of empathy, its associated variables, and the conditions of its development remains a central theme in relation to students and professionals of the health sciences. To achieve an effective professional practice, it is necessary to develop human capacities such as empathy and personal resilience.",,This research received no external funding.,Behavioral Sciences,,Luis Vivanco,,2023-04-24,2023,2023-04-24,,13,5,356,All OA; Gold,Article,"Ulloque, María J.; Villalba, Silvina; Foscarini, Gabriela; Quinteros, Susana; Calzadilla-Núñez, Aracelis; Reyes-Reyes, Alejandro; Díaz-Narváez, Víctor","Ulloque, María J.

The usual mechanism of injury is falling over the hand with the elbow extended and the hand open. The management of these fractures encompasses a range of treatment options, and their goal is to recover the anatomy and achieve a stable contact area between them. There are some controversies on the management of these injuries mainly focused on those that present some degree of displacement. A review and analysis of the current treatment at our institution and a comparison with the guidelines suggested by the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (AAOS) for the treatment of these fractures in the pediatric population were performed. Materials and methods This was an observational, analytical, retrospective study of consecutive pediatric patients with displaced supracondylar humeral fracture treated at Hospital de Trauma ""Manuel Giagni"" in Asunción, Paraguay, from January 2016 to December 2021. Demographic and clinical data were assessed, and patients were clinically and radiologically followed for at least 12 months. The management of supracondylar humeral fractures at our hospital was compared with the guidelines suggested by the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (AAOS) by analyzing whether these guidelines were applied in each case. The mechanism of injury was divided into three groups, initial X-rays were measured, extension-type fractures were categorized into three groups, and the type of treatment was divided into two groups: non-operative and operative. Furthermore, trauma-related preoperative complications and postoperative complications were reported. Outpatient follow-up was performed for at least 12 months in all cases. Results Of the 843 patients analyzed, 71.5% were male, with a mean age of 5.6 years. It was observed that 57.5% of injuries were caused by falls on the same level. The most frequent type of injury was Gartland type III, accounting for 55% of the cases, and associated injuries were found in 4% of the cases. With regard to the type of treatment, 91.8% of patients were treated with closed reduction and percutaneous pin fixation. Complications on admission were found in 12% of the cases and late complications in 12% of the cases. Most patients (82%) had excellent Mayo Elbow Performance Score. Conclusion Supracondylar fractures were more frequent in males and in schoolchildren. Garland type III fractures were the most common type of injury. The treatment of choice was predominantly closed reduction and percutaneous pin fixation. The Mayo Elbow Performance Score was excellent in most patients. Our service, a referral center of a public hospital in a developing country, complies with the guidelines recommended by the AAOS.","The authors had no conflict of interest to declare, and there was no external funding either for investigation or for study publication.",,Cureus,,"Alexander Muacevic, John R Adler",,2023-08-31,2023,2023-08-31,,15,8,e44430,All OA; Gold,Article,"Vergara, Alberto Daniel Navarro; Fretes, Alberto Navarro; Alonso, Rafael Aníbal Arréllaga; Villate, Maria Mercedes Medina","Vergara, Alberto Daniel Navarro (Orthopedics and Traumatology, Hospital de Trauma “Manuel Giagni”, Asunción, PRY; Orthopedics and Traumatology, Hospital de Especialidades Quirúrgicas Ingavi del Instituto de Previsión Social (IPS), Asunción, PRY; Orthopedics and Traumatology, Universidad del Norte, Asunción, PRY); Fretes, Alberto Navarro (Orthopedics and Traumatology, Universidad del Norte, Asunción, PRY; Pediatric Orthopedics, Hospital de Especialidades Quirúrgicas Ingavi del Instituto de Previsión Social (IPS), Asunción, PRY; Pediatrics Service, Hospital de Trauma “Manuel Giagni”, Asunción, PRY); Alonso, Rafael Aníbal Arréllaga (Orthopedics and Traumatology, Hospital de Trauma “Manuel Giagni”, Asunción, PRY); Villate, Maria Mercedes Medina (Orthopedics and Traumatology, Hospital de Especialidades Quirúrgicas Ingavi del Instituto de Previsión Social (IPS), Asunción, PRY)","Vergara, Alberto Daniel Navarro (Orthopedics and Traumatology, Hospital de Trauma “Manuel Giagni”, Asunción, PRY; Orthopedics and Traumatology, Hospital de Especialidades Quirúrgicas Ingavi del Instituto de Previsión Social (IPS), Asunción, PRY; Universidad del Norte)","Vergara, Alberto Daniel Navarro (Orthopedics and Traumatology, Hospital de Trauma “Manuel Giagni”, Asunción, PRY; Orthopedics and Traumatology, Hospital de Especialidades Quirúrgicas Ingavi del Instituto de Previsión Social (IPS), Asunción, PRY; Universidad del Norte); Fretes, Alberto Navarro (Universidad del Norte; Pediatric Orthopedics, Hospital de Especialidades Quirúrgicas Ingavi del Instituto de Previsión Social (IPS), Asunción, PRY; Pediatrics Service, Hospital de Trauma “Manuel Giagni”, Asunción, PRY); Alonso, Rafael Aníbal Arréllaga (Orthopedics and Traumatology, Hospital de Trauma “Manuel Giagni”, Asunción, PRY); Villate, Maria Mercedes Medina (Orthopedics and Traumatology, Hospital de Especialidades Quirúrgicas Ingavi del Instituto de Previsión Social (IPS), Asunción, PRY)",0,0,,,https://assets.cureus.com/uploads/original_article/pdf/176638/20230831-2252-1qm87bg.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1163749047,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3202 Clinical Sciences,

Alternative routes can be provided by recent discoveries of a time-reversal symmetry breaking anomalous Hall effect (AHE) in noncollinear magnets and altermagnets, but hitherto reported bulk materials are not polar. Here, the authors report the observation of a spontaneous AHE in doped AgCrSe2 , a layered polar semiconductor with an antiferromagnetic coupling between Cr spins in adjacent layers. The anomalous Hall resistivity 3  μ Ω  c m $\mu \Omega \, \textnormal {cm}$  is comparable to the largest observed in compensated magnetic systems to date, and is rapidly switched off when the angle of an applied magnetic field is rotated to ≈80° from the crystalline c-axis. The ionic gating experiments show that the anomalous Hall conductivity magnitude can be enhanced by modulating the p-type carrier density. They also present theoretical results that suggest the AHE is driven by Berry curvature due to noncollinear antiferromagnetic correlations among Cr spins, which are consistent with the previously suggested magnetic ordering in AgCrSe2 . The results open the possibility to study the interplay of magnetic and ferroelectric-like responses in this fascinating class of materials.","Acknowledgements The authors thank B. Doucot, P.D.C.

ISCH is frequently underdiagnosed, and the information available in case reports is limited. To provide an overview of the clinical manifestations and diagnosis of this condition, this study aims to conduct a review of reported cases of ISCH.
Methods: A literature review was carried out using seven databases. The search was conducted using the keywords ""Idiopathic spinal cord herniation"" OR ""Idiopathic Ventral Spinal Cord Herniation"" AND ""Case report"" OR ""case series.""
Results: A total of 92 relevant papers reporting 224 cases, besides the index case, were determined. Of the cases, 58.5% were females and the mean age was 50.7 (SD 13.2) years. Symptoms, diagnoses, and outcomes were similar between genders. The most common clinical signs included motor symptoms (82.6%), instability (61.3%), hypoesthesia (59.2%), and disturbance of thermal sensitivity (47.3%). Brown-Séquard syndrome was observed in 27.2% of the cases, and surgical treatment was employed in 89.7% of the cases.
Conclusions: ISCH is a pathology that is principally treated with surgical approach. This study provides valuable insights into the clinical manifestations and diagnosis of ISCH, which can aid in the early recognition and treatment of this rare condition.",,,Spine Surgery and Related Research,,,,2023-09-04,2023,2023-09-04,2024-05-27,8,3,225-234,All OA; Gold,Article,"Rairan, Luis Garcia; Henriquez, Alberto; Diaz, Gustavo; Mejía, Juan Armando; Gomez, Diego; Ramon, Juan Fernando; Hakim, Enrique Jimenez","Rairan, Luis Garcia (Department of Neurosurgery, Universidad Nacional de Colombia, Bogotà, Colombia); Henriquez, Alberto (Faculty of Medicine, Universidad del Norte, Bogotá, Colombia); Diaz, Gustavo (Faculty of Medicine, Universidad El Bosque, Bogotá, Colombia); Mejía, Juan Armando (Department of Neurosurgery, Fundación Santa Fe, Bogotá, Colombia); Gomez, Diego (Department of Neurosurgery, Fundación Santa Fe, Bogotá, Colombia); Ramon, Juan Fernando (Department of Neurosurgery, Fundación Santa Fe, Bogotá, Colombia); Hakim, Enrique Jimenez (Department of Neurosurgery, Fundación Santa Fe, Bogotá, Colombia)",,"Rairan, Luis Garcia (National University of Colombia); Henriquez, Alberto (Universidad del Norte); Diaz, Gustavo (El Bosque University); Mejía, Juan Armando (Fundación Santa Fe de Bogotá); Gomez, Diego (Fundación Santa Fe de Bogotá); Ramon, Juan Fernando (Fundación Santa Fe de Bogotá); Hakim, Enrique Jimenez (Fundación Santa Fe de Bogotá)",0,0,,,https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/ssrr/advpub/0/advpub_2023-0102/_pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1163807088,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3202 Clinical Sciences,

The database was compiled through a global collaboration between a network of researchers, meteorological services and environmental organisations from 65 countries. GloREDa is the first open access database of rainfall erosivity (R-factor) based on hourly and sub-hourly rainfall records at a global scale. This database is now stored and accessible for download in the long-term European Soil Data Centre (ESDAC) repository of the European Commission's Joint Research Centre. This will ensure the further development of the database with insertions of new records, maintenance of the data and provision of a helpdesk. In addition to the annual erosivity data, this release also includes the mean monthly erosivity data for 94% of the GloREDa stations. Based on these mean monthly R-factor values, we predict the global monthly erosivity datasets at 1 km resolution using the ensemble machine learning approach (ML) as implemented in the mlr package for R. The produced monthly raster data (GeoTIFF format) may be useful for soil erosion prediction modelling, sediment distribution analysis, climate change predictions, flood, and natural disaster assessments and can be valuable inputs for Land and Earth Systems modelling.","Declaration of Competing Interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

This study aimed to develop and validate a tool for identifying PIMs in older adults within the primary care setting. The tool is composed of a list of criteria and was created based on consensus among experts from three Spanish-speaking countries, including two from Latin America.MethodsA literature review was conducted to identify existing tools, and prescription patterns were evaluated in a cohort of 36,111 older adults. An electronic Delphi method, consisting of two rounds, was used to reach a formal expert consensus. The panel included 18 experts from Spain, Colombia, and Argentina. The content validity index, validity of each content item, and Kappa Fleiss statistical measure were used to establish reliability.ResultsRound one did not yield a consensus, but a definitive consensus was reached in round two. The resulting tool consisted of a list of 5 general recommendations per disease, along with 33 criteria related to potential problems, recommendations, and alternative therapeutic options. The overall content validity of the tool was 0.87, with a Kappa value of 0.69 (95% CI 0.64—0.73; Substantial).ConclusionsThe developed criteria provide a novel list that allows for a comprehensive approach to pharmacotherapy in older adults, intending to reduce inappropriate medication use, ineffective treatments, prophylactic therapies, and treatments with an unfavorable risk–benefit ratio for the given condition. Further studies are necessary to evaluate the impact of these criteria on health outcomes.","We would like to thank Paulo Cesar Sepulveda and Andres Beltran for supporting the translation.

The objective of this literature review was to analyze the theoretical and empirical studies that address telemedicine management in the last 10 years based on the scientific literature obtained from the Scopus, Scielo, Ebsco, ProQuest, Dialnet, and Redalyc databases, from which 50 articles were selected. The inclusion criteria were the last 10 years, scientific articles, language, variables, and open access. The non-inclusion criteria were repeated articles, not addressing the variable, and not open access. The results show a tendency to manage telemedicine through various approaches and scenarios. These can be grouped into humanistic, socioeconomic, ethical, contingency in the Armed Forces-NASA, and application in the field of medicine with teaching to the entire chain of users, as well as controls and monitoring of patients. In this sense, it is concluded that telemedicine management worldwide faces challenges that must be overcome to reduce still-existing barriers and achieve better access to health systems worldwide.",The support of the Universidad Privada del Norte is gratefully acknowledged.,This research received no external funding.,Behavioral Sciences,,,,2023-03-14,2023,2023-03-14,,13,3,255,All OA; Gold,Article,"Aguirre-Sosa, Joaquín; Vargas-Merino, Jorge Alberto","Aguirre-Sosa, Joaquín (Faculty of Business, School of Management, Universidad Privada del Norte, San Juan de Lurigancho, Lima 15434, Peru;, n00220615@upn.pe); Vargas-Merino, Jorge Alberto (Faculty of Business, Department of Research, Innovation and Social Responsibility, Universidad Privada del Norte, San Juan de Lurigancho, Lima 15434, Peru)","Vargas-Merino, Jorge Alberto (Private University of the North)","Aguirre-Sosa, Joaquín (Private University of the North); Vargas-Merino, Jorge Alberto (Private University of the North)",3,3,,,https://www.mdpi.com/2076-328X/13/3/255/pdf?version=1678797165,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1156238086,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3202 Clinical Sciences; 52 Psychology; 5202 Biological Psychology; 5203 Clinical and Health Psychology,"16 Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions; 3 Good Health and Well Being"

Although residential environments provide natural experimental conditions to observe these relationships, the complexity of measuring sensory perceptions and their subsequent interpretation constitutes a challenge. This study aims to identify the influence of socio-demographics and residential location characteristics on three latent variables: noise-Sensitivity, sound-Pleasantness, and visual-Liveability in a Latin American city. The methodology is replicable and relies on a digital survey that displays environments in 360-format video and uses sound immersion techniques; it was applied to a sample of household heads in Quito, Ecuador. Based on an efficient experimental design, we selected different residential environments according to acoustic-visual attributes and the proximity to residential, commercial, and recreational land uses. Structural Equation Models (SEM) were estimated using mediating variables. Our results reveal the influence of noise-Sensitivity on sound-Pleasantness and, indirectly, on visual-Liveability. Further analysis shows that the impact of sound and visual perception changes with different socio-demographics and residential location characteristics.","This research was accomplished thanks to collaboration of the Universidad Técnica del Norte and the co-funding project SOA.MCA.19.05- provided the Universidad de Las Américas in Ecuador and the Civil Engineering programme at Universidad del Norte in Barranquilla, Colombia.

There is a great need for better-developed scales that comply with Rasch model requirements.
Methods: Prospective study including patients with DED. A series of focus groups were performed to determine the best items to be included. A Rasch modeling methodology was used to validate the Medellín Dry Eye Inventory (ME·Dry). After iterative analysis and scale modification, a final version of the scale was attained which complied with the Rasch analysis expectations. Correlation between the different subscales of the ME·Dry and the Ocular Surface Disease Index (OSDI) was evaluated through Spearman correlation.
Results: A total of 166 patients with DED were included. Rasch modeling demonstrated an excellent behavior for the ME·Dry, including four subscales: Symptoms, Triggers, Activity Limitation, and Emotional Compromise. Infit and Outfit parameters were all between 0.50 and 1.50, with excellent category utilization. Person and item separation and reliability were excellent for all subscales. There was a need for a category collapsing for the Emotional Compromise subscale. There was a strong correlation between the different subscales of the ME·Dry except for the Emotional Compromise subscale, which seems to be independent.
Conclusion: The ME·Dry is a reliable scale, complying with the Rasch model expectations, that allows for a reliable measurement of quality of life compromise in patients with DED. Emotional compromise secondary to DED does not seem to correlate with disease severity as assessed by the other quality-of-life subscales.",The authors are in debt to the patients who were capital in the process of developing the items for the scale.

Hemoperfusion (HPF) can remove inflammatory cytokines and can reduce the negative effects of cytokine storm in COVID-19. We compared the mortality rate, inflammatory response, and acute kidney injury (AKI) prevalence among patients suffering from respiratory insufficiency secondary to COVID-19 treated with and without HPF with HA330 cartridge.
Methods: Mortality rate, serum creatinine, and ferritin values were compared between patients suffering from respiratory insufficiency secondary to COVID-19 who received conventional treatment and another group of patients who additionally received four sessions of HPF with HA330.
Results: Of 116 patients suffering from acute respiratory insufficiency secondary to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), one group (n: 84) received support treatment and the other group (n: 32) additionally received HPF with HA330 cartridge. Both groups had no renal disease and similar age and comorbidities at admission, except for obesity and mechanical ventilation requirement, which were significantly higher in the HPF group. Mortality rate (61% vs. 31%, P: 0.008), serum creatinine (1.4 vs. 0.5 mg/dl, P < 0.001), and post-HPF serum ferritin (2868 vs. 1675, P < 0.001) were significantly lower in the HPF group.
Conclusion: Mortality rate, serum ferritin, and AKI were significantly reduced in critical COVID-19 patients who received HPF with HA330 cartridge than in those who did not receive it.

This creates an urgent need to know the families of inhibitors and their concentration levels. This article uses ethylene green to synthesize an ethylene-propylene copolymer. It describes the impact of trace impurities of furan in ethylene green and how this furan influences the loss of properties such as thermal and mechanical properties of the random copolymer. For the development of the investigation, 12 runs were carried out, each in triplicate. The results show an evident influence of furan on the productivity of the Ziegler-Natta catalyst (ZN); productivity losses of 10, 20, and 41% were obtained for the copolymers synthesized with ethylene rich in 6, 12, and 25 ppm of furan, respectively. PP0 (without furan) did not present losses. Likewise, as the concentration of furan increased, it was observed that the melt flow index (MFI), thermal (TGA), and mechanical properties (tensile, bending, and impact) decreased significantly. Therefore, it can be affirmed that furan should be a substance to be controlled in the purification processes of green ethylene.",We acknowledge Dalila Fernandez Viloria.,This research received no external funding.,Polymers,,Cristina Cazan,,2023-05-11,2023,2023-05-11,,15,10,2264,All OA; Gold,Article,"Hernández-Fernández, Joaquín; Puello-Polo, Esneyder; Márquez, Edgar","Hernández-Fernández, Joaquín (Chemistry Program, Department of Natural and Exact Sciences, San Pablo Campus, University of Cartagena, Cartagena 130015, Colombia.; Chemical Engineering Program, School of Engineering, Universidad Tecnológica de Bolivar, Parque Industrial y Tecnológico Carlos Vélez Pombo Km 1 Vía Turbaco, Cartagena 130001, Colombia.; Department of Natural and Exact Science, Universidad de la Costa, Barranquilla 080002, Colombia.); Puello-Polo, Esneyder (Group de Investigación en Oxi/Hidrotratamiento Catalítico Y Nuevos Materiales, Programa de Química-Ciencias Básicas, Universidad del Atlántico, Puerto Colombia 081001, Colombia.); Márquez, Edgar (Grupo de Investigaciones en Química Y Biología, Departamento de Química Y Biología, Facultad de Ciencias Básicas, Universidad del Norte, Carrera 51B, Km 5, Vía Puerto Colombia, Barranquilla 081007, Colombia.)","Hernández-Fernández, Joaquín (University of Cartagena; Universidad Tecnológica de Bolívar; University of the Coast); Márquez, Edgar (Universidad del Norte)","Hernández-Fernández, Joaquín (University of Cartagena; Universidad Tecnológica de Bolívar; University of the Coast); Puello-Polo, Esneyder (University of Atlántico); Márquez, Edgar (Universidad del Norte)",4,4,,,https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4360/15/10/2264/pdf?version=1683779604,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1157965416,34 Chemical Sciences; 3403 Macromolecular and Materials Chemistry,

A better understanding of the vaccine immune response may help to define vaccination strategies against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
Objective: To investigate the long-term immunological response to CoronaVac vaccine and determinants of breakthrough COVID-19 infection.
Methods: A long-term, prospective cohort study involving vaccinated adult and elderly subjects was conducted to investigate the presence of anti-RBD-specific immunoglobulin (Ig)G, anti-nucleocapsid IgG and anti-spike trimeric protein IgG. Antibody level dynamics and risk factors associated with breakthrough COVID-19 infection were investigated.
Results: In total, 3902 participants were included in this study. Vaccination with two doses of CoronaVac and a booster dose increased the levels of anti-RBD-specific IgG, anti-nucleocapsid IgG and anti-spike trimeric IgG significantly. In adults, anti-nucleocapsid IgG and anti-spike trimeric IgG levels decreased significantly 7 months after the second dose. In adults and the elderly, the levels of anti-spike trimeric IgG and anti-RBD IgG decreased significantly 4 and 6 months after the booster dose, respectively. Previous exposure to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) and anti-spike trimeric IgG titres was independently associated with a lower probability of post-vaccination infection.
Conclusions: A significant increase in antibody levels was found after two doses of CoronaVac and a booster dose. Antibody titres declined significantly 7 months post-vaccination in participants who did not receive a booster dose. Higher levels of antibodies and previous SARS-CoV-2 infection were associated with protection against breakthrough COVID-19.","Conflict of interest statement MCB, GJV, NNF, PMMG, GRM, BALF and RTC received research support from Instituto Butantan during the conduct of this study.

This proposal was validated by running several simulations using a dataset for a multi-class classification problem, different MLP neural network architectures, and different numbers of participating clients. The results are shown for several metrics in the local and federated settings, and a comparative analysis is carried out. Additionally, the privacy guarantees of the proposal are formally analyzed under a set of defined assumptions, and the added value of the proposed protocol is identified compared with previous works in the same area of knowledge.",,This research received no external funding and the APC was funded by Universidad de Norte.,Sensors,,"Stefano Giordano, Periklis Chatzimisios, Mike Oluwatayo Ojo",,2023-02-09,2023,2023-02-09,,23,4,1966,All OA; Gold,Article,"Angulo, Eduardo; Márquez, José; Villanueva-Polanco, Ricardo","Angulo, Eduardo (Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla 081007, Colombia.); Márquez, José (Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla 081007, Colombia.); Villanueva-Polanco, Ricardo (Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla 081007, Colombia.)","Villanueva-Polanco, Ricardo (Universidad del Norte)","Angulo, Eduardo (Universidad del Norte); Márquez, José (Universidad del Norte); Villanueva-Polanco, Ricardo (Universidad del Norte)",4,4,,,https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/23/4/1966/pdf?version=1676957891,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1155322626,46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4604 Cybersecurity and Privacy; 4611 Machine Learning,

Given the rarity of this finding and because PCE could be a manifestation of Von Hippel-Lindau disease (VHL), although the patient had no family or personal history of VHL, the VHL gene was tested, and a known pathogenetic variant (c.464-1G>A; p.)? was found. Screening for other Von Hippel-Lindau disease-associated neoplasms revealed bilateral retinal capillary hemangioblastomas, clear cell renal cell carcinoma, and multiple pancreatic cysts. In this case, an accurate diagnostic workup for male infertility allowed the detection of a rare life-threatening syndrome, already presenting with several silent neoplasms.

Juan de Acosta, Atlántico, a city located on the Caribbean coast of Colombia, is home to the world's second-largest HD pedigree. Here, we include 291 descendants of this pedigree with at least one family member with HD. Blood samples were collected, and genomic DNA was extracted. We quantified the HTT CAG expansion using an amplicon sequencing protocol. The genetic heterogeneity was measured as the ratio of the mosaicism allele's read peak and the slippage ratio of the allele's read peak from our sequence data. The statistical and bioinformatic analyses were performed with a significance threshold of p < 0.05. We found that the average HTT CAG repeat length in all participants was 21.91 (SD = 8.92). Of the 291 participants, 33 (11.3%, 18 females) had a positive molecular diagnosis for HD. Most affected individuals were adults, and the most common primary and secondary alleles were 17/7 (CAG/CCG) and 17/10 (CAG/CCG), respectively. The mosaicism increased with age in the participants with HD, while the slippage analyses revealed differences by the HD allele type only for the secondary allele. The slippage tended to increase with the HTT CAG repeat length in the participants with HD, but the increase was not statistically significant. This study analyzed the genetic and molecular features of 291 participants, including 33 with HD. We found that the mosaicism increased with age in the participants with HD, particularly for the secondary allele. The most common haplotype was 17/7_17/10. The slippage for the secondary allele varied by the HD allele type, but there was no significant difference in the slippage by sex. Our findings offer valuable insights into HD and could have implications for future research and clinical management.","We express our highest appreciation to all individuals who voluntarily participated in this study.

Through the analysis of the global and local reactivity of the reagents, it was determined that the furan acts as an electron donor. In contrast, the titanium of the ZN catalyst acts as an electron acceptor. It is postulated that this difference in reactivity could lead to forming a furan-titanium complex, which blocks the catalyst's active sites and reduces its efficiency for propylene polymerization. Theoretical results showed a high adsorption affinity of furan to the active site of the Ti catalyst, indicating that furan tends to bind strongly to the catalyst, thus blocking the active sites and decreasing the availability for propylene polymerization. The experimental data revealed that the presence of furan significantly reduced the productivity of the ZN catalyst by 10, 20, and 41% for concentrations of 6, 12.23, and 25.03 ppm furan, respectively. In addition, a proportional relationship was observed between the furan concentration and the MFI melt index of the polymer, where the higher the furan concentration, the higher the MFI. Likewise, the presence of furan negatively affected the mechanical properties of polypropylene, especially the impact Izod value, with percentage decreases of 9, 18, and 22% for concentrations of 6, 12.23, and 25.03 ppm furan, respectively.",,This research received no external funding.,International Journal of Molecular Sciences,,Haiyang Gao,,2023-09-21,2023,2023-09-21,,24,18,14368,All OA; Gold,Article,"Hernández-Fernández, Joaquín; Puello-Polo, Esneyder; Marquez, Edgar","Hernández-Fernández, Joaquín (Chemistry Program, Department of Natural and Exact Sciences, San Pablo Campus, University of Cartagena, Cartagena 130015, Colombia; Chemical Engineering Program, School of Engineering, Universidad Tecnológica de Bolivar, Parque Industrial y Tecnológico Carlos Vélez Pombo, Cartagena 130001, Colombia; Department of Natural and Exact Science, Universidad de la Costa, Barranquilla 080002, Colombia); Puello-Polo, Esneyder (Group de Investigación en Oxi/Hidrotratamiento Catalítico Y Nuevos Materiales, Programa de Química-Ciencias Básicas, Universidad del Atlántico, Puerto Colombia 081001, Colombia;, esneyderpuello@mail.uniatlantico.edu.co); Marquez, Edgar (Grupo de Investigaciones en Química Y Biología, Departamento de Química Y Biología, Facultad de Ciencias Básicas, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla 081007, Colombia)","Hernández-Fernández, Joaquín (University of Cartagena; Universidad Tecnológica de Bolívar; University of the Coast); Marquez, Edgar (Universidad del Norte)","Hernández-Fernández, Joaquín (University of Cartagena; Universidad Tecnológica de Bolívar; University of the Coast); Puello-Polo, Esneyder (University of Atlántico); Marquez, Edgar (Universidad del Norte)",1,1,,,https://www.mdpi.com/1422-0067/24/18/14368/pdf?version=1695276711,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1164318726,34 Chemical Sciences; 3403 Macromolecular and Materials Chemistry,

Consequently, this often leads to caregivers who are the patient's relatives, which adversely impacts the workforce along with severely diminishing the quality of life for all involved. It is, therefore, highly desirable to develop a fast, effective and reliable sensor to enable early-stage detection in an attempt to reverse disease progression. This research validates the detection of amyloid-beta 42 (Aβ42) using a Silicon Carbide (SiC) electrode, a fact that is unprecedented in the literature. Aβ42 is considered a reliable biomarker for AD detection, as reported in previous studies. To validate the detection with a SiC-based electrochemical sensor, a gold (Au) electrode-based electrochemical sensor was used as a control. The same cleaning, functionalization and Aβ1-28 antibody immobilization steps were used on both electrodes. Sensor validation was carried out by means of Cyclic Voltammetry (CV) and Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) aiming to detect an 0.5 µg·mL-1 Aβ42 concentration in 0.1 M buffer solution as a proof of concept. A repeatable peak directly related to the presence of Aβ42 was observed, indicating that a fast SiC-based electrochemical sensor was constructed and may prove to be a useful approach for the early detection of AD.","Bianca I.

According to the SIMCE test carried out in 2015, 45% of 8th year students in Chile were overweight. Moreover, international studies have shown that being overweight is associated with the development of chronic illnesses, negatively affecting cognitive mechanisms and processes. Nevertheless, there is little to no evidence that analyzes the relationship between physical fitness and executive functions in students, at a national level. The aim was to analyze the relationship between cardiorespiratory, musculoskeletal, and motor fitness, and performance in an executive functions test, in students from a public school in the south of Chile. A qualitative, descriptive -correlational, non-experimental, and cross-sectional approach was used. In total, 100 students between 9 and 12 and 11 months of age from a public school in the south of Chile completed the physical fitness assessments through the ALPHA fitness test, and 81 students completed the executive function assessments through the ENFEN test. It was evidenced that students who achieved a longer duration of time and a later stage in the Course Navette test, more centimeters in the standing broad jump (SBJ) test, and a shorter duration in the 4 × 10 shuttle run obtained a better score in the gray trail test. Additionally, students who presented a stronger dominant handgrip scored higher in the colored trail tests. We conclude that students who show a higher level of physical fitness also present a better development of executive functions such as working memory and inhibitory control. In addition, these results suggest physical condition is a factor to consider for better cognitive and school performance.","The authors would like to thank and acknowledge the support of all the educational communities involved in this study: school administrators, teachers, students, parents, and legal guardians.",This research received no external funding.,Behavioral Sciences,,,,2023-02-20,2023,2023-02-20,,13,2,191,All OA; Gold,Article,"Alonso-Cabrera, Jesús; Salazar, Franco; Benavides-Ulloa, Jorge; Parra-Rizo, María Antonia; Zapata-Lamana, Rafael; Diaz-Vargas, Caterin; Vásquez-Gómez, Jaime; Cigarroa, Igor","Alonso-Cabrera, Jesús (Departamento de Matemáticas y Estadística, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla 081008, Colombia); Salazar, Franco (Escuela de Kinesiología, Facultad de Salud, Universidad Santo Tomás, Los Ángeles 4440000, Chile); Benavides-Ulloa, Jorge (Escuela de Kinesiología, Facultad de Salud, Universidad Santo Tomás, Los Ángeles 4440000, Chile); Parra-Rizo, María Antonia (Faculty of Health Sciences, Valencian International University (VIU), 46002 Valencia, Spain; Department of Health Psychology, Faculty of Social and Health Sciences, Campus of Elche, Miguel Hernandez University (UMH), 03202 Elche, Spain); Zapata-Lamana, Rafael (Escuela de Educación, Universidad de Concepción, Los Ángeles 4440000, Chile); Diaz-Vargas, Caterin (Escuela de Educación, Universidad de Concepción, Los Ángeles 4440000, Chile); Vásquez-Gómez, Jaime (Centro de Investigación de Estudios Avanzados del Maule (CIEAM), Universidad Católica del Maule, Talca 3460000, Chile; Laboratorio de Rendimiento Humano, Grupo de Estudios en Educación, Actividad Física y Salud (GEEAFyS), Universidad Católica del Maule, Talca 3460000, Chile); Cigarroa, Igor (Escuela de Kinesiología, Facultad de Salud, Universidad Santo Tomás, Los Ángeles 4440000, Chile)","Cigarroa, Igor (Universidad Santo Tomás)","Alonso-Cabrera, Jesús (Universidad del Norte); Salazar, Franco (Universidad Santo Tomás); Benavides-Ulloa, Jorge (Universidad Santo Tomás); Parra-Rizo, María Antonia (Valencian International University; Miguel Hernandez University); Zapata-Lamana, Rafael (University of Concepción); Diaz-Vargas, Caterin (University of Concepción); Vásquez-Gómez, Jaime (Catholic University of the Maule; Catholic University of the Maule); Cigarroa, Igor (Universidad Santo Tomás)",3,3,,,https://www.mdpi.com/2076-328X/13/2/191/pdf?version=1676961087,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1155620923,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3202 Clinical Sciences; 52 Psychology; 5202 Biological Psychology; 5203 Clinical and Health Psychology,

Inclusion of migrants in COVID-19 vaccination is not only ethically necessary from a right-to-health perspective but also technically indispensable for disease control. This study aimed to characterize the inclusion of international migrants, refugees, and asylum seekers in COVID-19 vaccination policies in Latin American countries that have the greatest recent increase in the reception of migrants. We conducted a content analysis of public policy documents issued between March 11, 2020, and June 30, 2022 by the Ministries of Health of seven countries: Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, Mexico and Peru. Documents were located through Ministries of Health web pages, references in scientific literature, and the Pan American Health Organization's Information Platform on Health and Migration in the Americas. A content analysis was performed of the documents that were located, along six dimensions: migrants' right to vaccination, temporality of vaccination, administrative discretion, policies to facilitate access, language or cultural considerations, and normative, ethical or technical justifications provided. Eighty-six public policy documents were reviewed. Their contents showed that none of the countries explicitly excluded migrants from vaccination, nor did they explicitly define restrictions on this population. One barrier that was detected was to require identity documents in order to be vaccinated or to receive a vaccination certificate, which could be difficult for migrants to obtain. Few countries defined actions to facilitate or promote the vaccination of migrants. The documents that mentioned justifications for vaccinating migrants presented reasons that were mainly based on the recognition of the right to health, the principle of non-discrimination and equity. The countries studied generally had inclusive policies but were limited in terms of dealing with potential barriers to access. The lack of mechanisms to guarantee the right to health is a limitation that countries in the region should address.","Declaration of Competing Interest The authors declare the following financial interests/personal relationships which may be considered as potential competing interests: Julián A.

Understanding how best to fill existing gaps and account for biases is necessary to improve our current information most effectively. Two current main approaches for obtaining and improving data include (1) curation of biological collections, and (2) fieldwork. However, the comparative effectiveness of these approaches in improving biodiversity data remains little explored. We used the Flora de Bogotá project to study the magnitude of change in species richness, spatial coverage, and sample coverage of plant records based on curation versus fieldwork. The process of curation resulted in a decrease in species richness (synonym and error removal), but it significantly increased the number of records per species. Fieldwork contributed to a slight increase in species richness, via accumulation of new records. Additionally, curation led to increases in spatial coverage, species observed by locality, the number of plant records by species, and localities by species compared to fieldwork. Overall, curation was more efficient in producing new information compared to fieldwork, mainly because of the large number of records available in herbaria. We recommend intensive curatorial work as the first step in increasing biodiversity data quality and quantity, to identify bias and gaps at the regional scale that can then be targeted with fieldwork. The stepwise strategy would enable fieldwork to be planned more cost-effectively given the limited resources for biodiversity exploration and characterization.","Declaration of competing interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

This study examines the influence of social media on coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and non-COVID-19 vaccination in Asia during the peri-pandemic period. Through a comprehensive analysis of available literature, we aim to elucidate the role of SMPs in shaping vaccination attitudes and behaviors. The findings highlight the detrimental impact of social media on vaccination efforts and provide insights into addressing vaccine hesitancy during this critical period. A narrative review was conducted by searching the PubMed, Scopus, and Google Scholar databases from inception to May 26, 2022. Only English-language articles involving human participants from Asian countries were included in this review. Out of the 228 articles identified through the database search, 14 articles were included in the final analysis. The prevalence of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy or negative attitudes towards COVID-19 vaccines in Asian countries was found to be high, ranging from 20% to 55% across countries. Notably, reliance on SMPs for vaccine-related information was associated with a higher likelihood of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy. This trend coincided with the proliferation of misinformation and conspiracy theories that portrayed COVID-19 vaccines as harmful during the pandemic. Similar patterns were observed for other types of vaccines, including polio, measles mumps and rubella, and diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis vaccines. The use of SMPs was also found to be associated with increased fear among caregivers in Asian countries, as well as a 3-4 times higher likelihood of delayed immunization. SMPs negatively impact vaccine intent in Asia due to misinformation and anti-vaccination campaigns during the pandemic. However, they can be a powerful tool for healthcare providers and policymakers to promote informed decision-making. Efforts should focus on leveraging SMPs to disseminate reliable information and combat hesitancy, fostering a well-informed and vaccinated population in Asia.",,,Journal of Korean Medical Science,,,Humans; Social Media; COVID-19 Vaccines; COVID-19; Vaccination; Immunization; Vaccines,2023,2023,2023,,38,40,e326,All OA; Gold,Article,"Rodrigues, Flinta; Ziade, Nelly; Jatuworapruk, Kanon; Caballero-Uribe, Carlo V; Khursheed, Tayyeba; Gupta, Latika","Rodrigues, Flinta (Seth Gordhandas Sunderdas Medical College and King Edward Memorial Hospital, Mumbai, Maharashtra,); Ziade, Nelly (Rheumatology Department, Saint-Joseph University, Beirut,; Rheumatology Department, Hotel-Dieu de France Hospital, Beirut,); Jatuworapruk, Kanon (Department of Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Thammasat University, Pathumthani,); Caballero-Uribe, Carlo V (Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla,); Khursheed, Tayyeba (Department of Rheumatology, Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences, Islamabad,); Gupta, Latika (Department of Rheumatology, Royal Wolverhampton Hospitals NHS Trust, Wolverhampton,; City Hospital, Sandwell and West Birmingham Hospitals NHS Trust, Birmingham,; Division of Musculoskeletal and Dermatological Sciences, Centre for Musculoskeletal Research, School of Biological Sciences, The University of Manchester, Manchester,)","Gupta, Latika (The Royal Wolverhampton NHS Trust; Birmingham City Hospital; University of Manchester)","Rodrigues, Flinta (King Edward Memorial Hospital and Seth G.S.

About 40% of the patients with PPGL have a hereditary predisposition. Here we present a case-series of 19 unrelated Colombian patients with a clinical diagnosis of PPGL tumors that underwent germline genetic testing as part of the Hereditary Cancer Program developed at the Instituto Nacional de Cancerología, Colombia (INC-C), the largest reference cancer center in the country. Ten of 19 patients (52.63%) were identified as carriers of a pathogenic/likely pathogenic (P/LP) germline variant in a known susceptibility gene. The majority of the P/LP variants were in the SDHB gene (9/10): one corresponded to a nonsense variant c.268C>T (p.Arg90*) and eight cases were found to be carriers of a recurrent CNV consisting of a large deletion of one copy of exon 1, explaining 42% (8/19) of all the affected cases. Only one additional case was found to be a carrier of a missense mutation in the VHL gene: c.355T>C (p.Phe119Leu).

Early diagnosis, comorbidity prevention, and control are cornerstones for a quality life and for improving life expectancy. In Colombian Caribbean, where there is a genetically admixed population, CF is an orphan disease affecting children and adults, and it remains a challenging issue to be addressed carefully. This work describes the genetic, clinical, and paraclinical profiles of CF patients from Cartagena de Indias, Colombia.
Methods: Thirty-six patients were included in the study. The subjects were identified and evaluated through the Regional Program for CF patients. CFTR gene mutations, anthropometric parameters, microbiological infections, and pulmonary function were analyzed. Data on demographic parameters, pharmacological treatments, and comorbidities were reported. Frequency and percentages were established for the categorical variables and mean or median for the quantitative variables. In addition, comparisons were made by sex.
Results: The average age of the patients was 11.9 ± 5.3 years and the median age at diagnosis was 14 months. 55.5% were women and 44.5% were men. The mean values for weight, height, and body mass index were 35 ± 17.6 kg, 139.9 ± 28 cm, and 16.5 ± 2.9 kg/m2, respectively. The clinical manifestations that occurred more frequently were steatorrhea (65.4%) and recurrent pneumonia (46.2%). Chronic airway infection with Pseudomonas aeruginosa was identified in 71.4% of the cases and the p.F508del mutation was found in 47.2% of the subjects.
Conclusion: The current profile of CF patients from the Colombian Caribbean showed some concerning features, such as nutritional status; however, progress in early diagnosis and clinical follow-up could contribute to improve the general conditions of patients. It is necessary to continue efforts to increase the life expectancy and quality of life of the patients.","Declaration of competing interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

The thermal degradation of the recovered additive was found to be between 340 and 420 °C, with a melting temperature of 246 °C, adopting the same behavior as the pure additive. In FTIR, the characteristic absorption peak of Millad NX 8000 was observed at 1073 cm-1, which indicates the purity of the extracted compound.

In the search for new potential drug candidates that can be used as treatments or adjuvants in the control of infections by these pathogenic yeasts, the objective of this research was to evaluate the action of isoespintanol (ISO) against the formation of fungal biofilms, the mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm), and its effect on the integrity of the cell wall. We report the ability of ISO to inhibit the formation of biofilms by up to 89.35%, in all cases higher than the values expressed by amphotericin B (AFB). Flow cytometric experiments using rhodamine 123 (Rh123) showed the ability of ISO to cause mitochondrial dysfunction in these cells. Likewise, experiments using calcofluor white (CFW) and analyzed by flow cytometry showed the ability of ISO to affect the integrity of the cell wall by stimulating chitin synthesis; these changes in the integrity of the wall were also observed through transmission electron microscopy (TEM). These mechanisms are involved in the antifungal action of this monoterpene.","To Homero San Juan, Specialized Diagnostic Center, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla.

This study characterized the competencies of professionals in the Colombian Caribbean, the circumstances that favor and hinder the development of appropriate care, as well as the preferences, expectations and attitudes toward an educational intervention supported by ICTs.
METHODS: We used a qualitative, phenomenological approach, combining documentary review and data obtained through observation, an online survey and two focus groups involving 55 healthcare professionals (physicians, nurses and psychologists) of varying experience. For the analysis and integration of results, the Capacity, Opportunity, Motivation and Behavior model and the Theoretical Domains Framework were used as references. The Consolidated Criteria for Reporting Qualitative Research (COREQ) checklist guided the reporting of this study.
RESULTS: Competency deficits were found regardless of the profession and experience, which are related to inadequacies in undergraduate and post-graduate training. Structural problems in Colombian society and healthcare service organization were also discovered, which were considered unmodifiable barriers and have been aggravated by the social, economic and health effects of the pandemic. The main modifiable barriers found were as follows: pain underestimation and under-treatment of older adults, as well as stereotypes regarding old age and pain, lack of knowledge of the psychosocial determinants of pain and of techniques for its assessment and treatment, overestimation of pharmacological treatment and failure to update pharmacological and non-pharmacological techniques.
CONCLUSIONS: Recommendations for the design of the educational intervention were established as follows: favoring non-synchronous resources, facilitating synchronous activities of short duration, facilitating permanent access to information and resources and generating incentives for continuing education, such as certification, institutional recognition and encouraging popular recognition.",,The work was supported by the International Association for the Study of Pain [2020 Initiative to Improve Pain Education Grant]; Universidad Cooperativa de Colombia [INV2932],Medical Education Online,,,Aged; Humans; Colombia; Health Personnel; Musculoskeletal Pain; Pandemics; Students; Qualitative Research; Competency-Based Education,2023-02-06,2023,2023-02-06,2023-12-31,28,1,2172755,All OA; Gold,Article,"Martín-Carbonell, Marta; Colorado, Yuli Suárez; Camacho-Rodríguez, Doriam; Expósito-Concepción, Maria Yaquelin; Touchie-Meza, Salín; Daza, Doris Sequeira; Julio, Luz Karinne González","Martín-Carbonell, Marta (Psychology Department, Universidad Cooperativa de Colombia, Santa Marta, Colombia); Colorado, Yuli Suárez (Psychology Department, Universidad Cooperativa de Colombia, Santa Marta, Colombia); Camacho-Rodríguez, Doriam (Nursing Department, Universidad Cooperativa de Colombia, Santa Marta, Colombia); Expósito-Concepción, Maria Yaquelin (Nursing Departament, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); Touchie-Meza, Salín (Medicine Department, Universidad Cooperativa de Colombia, Santa Marta, Colombia); Daza, Doris Sequeira (Nursing Department, Health School, Universidad Central de Chile, Valparaiso, Chile); Julio, Luz Karinne González (Nursing Department, Universidad Cooperativa de Colombia, Santa Marta, Colombia)","Martín-Carbonell, Marta (Cooperative University of Colombia)","Martín-Carbonell, Marta (Cooperative University of Colombia); Colorado, Yuli Suárez (Cooperative University of Colombia); Camacho-Rodríguez, Doriam (Cooperative University of Colombia); Expósito-Concepción, Maria Yaquelin (Universidad del Norte); Touchie-Meza, Salín (Cooperative University of Colombia); Daza, Doris Sequeira (Universidad Central de Chile); Julio, Luz Karinne González (Cooperative University of Colombia)",1,1,,,https://doi.org/10.1080/10872981.2023.2172755,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1155153453,42 Health Sciences; 4203 Health Services and Systems,3 Good Health and Well Being; 4 Quality Education

The present study investigates the impact of aromaticity on racemization using advanced theoretical techniques based on density functional theory. Calculations were performed at the ωb97xd/6-311++g(d,p) level of theory. A compelling explanation for the observed aromatic stabilization via resonance is put forward, involving a carbanion intermediate. The analysis, employing Hammett's parameters, convincingly supports the presence of a negative charge within the transition state of aromatic compounds. Moreover, the combined utilization of natural bond orbital (NBO) analysis and intrinsic reaction coordinate (IRC) calculations confirms the pronounced stabilization of electron distribution within the carbanion intermediate. To enhance our understanding of the racemization process, a thorough examination of the evolution of NBO charges and Wiberg bond indices (WBIs) at all points along the IRC profile is performed. This approach offers valuable insights into the synchronicity parameters governing the racemization reactions.",The authors have used the high-performance computing (HPC) system available in USFQ for the theoretical calculations presented in this work.,This study was supported by the Universidad San Francisco de Quito by the Collaboration grants 2022–2023.,International Journal of Molecular Sciences,,,"Amino Acids, Aromatic; Hydrogen Bonding",2023-07-25,2023,2023-07-25,,24,15,11877,All OA; Gold,Article,"Andino, Mateo S.; Mora, José R.; Paz, José L.; Márquez, Edgar A.; Perez-Castillo, Yunierkis; Agüero-Chapin, Guillermin","Andino, Mateo S.

For instance, graphene-like materials have been employed as asphalt binder modifying agents in pavement engineering. In the literature, it has been reported that (in comparison to an unmodified binder) the Graphene Modified Asphalt Binders (GMABs) exhibit an enhanced performance grade, a lower thermal susceptibility, a higher fatigue life, and a decreased accumulation of permanent deformations. Nonetheless, although GMABs stand out significantly from traditional alternatives, there is still no consensus on their behavior regarding chemical, rheological, microstructural, morphological, thermogravimetric, and surface topography properties. Therefore, this research conducted a literature review on the properties and advanced characterization techniques of GMABs. Thus, the laboratory protocols covered by this manuscript are atomic force microscopy, differential scanning calorimetry, dynamic shear rheometer, elemental analysis, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, thermogravimetric analysis, X-ray diffraction, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Consequently, the main contribution of this investigation to the state-of-the-art is the identification of the prominent trends and gaps in the current state of knowledge.",,This research received no external funding.,Nanomaterials,,,,2023-03-06,2023,2023-03-06,,13,5,955,All OA; Gold,Article,"Polo-Mendoza, Rodrigo; Navarro-Donado, Tatiana; Ortega-Martinez, Daniela; Turbay, Emilio; Martinez-Arguelles, Gilberto; Peñabaena-Niebles, Rita","Polo-Mendoza, Rodrigo (Faculty of Science, Charles University, 128 00 Prague, Czech Republic); Navarro-Donado, Tatiana (Department of Civil & Environmental Engineering, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla 081001, Colombia); Ortega-Martinez, Daniela (Department of Civil & Environmental Engineering, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla 081001, Colombia; School of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Technische Universität Dresden, 01069 Dresden, Germany); Turbay, Emilio (Department of Civil & Environmental Engineering, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla 081001, Colombia); Martinez-Arguelles, Gilberto (Department of Civil & Environmental Engineering, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla 081001, Colombia); Peñabaena-Niebles, Rita (Department of Industrial Engineering, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla 081001, Colombia)","Martinez-Arguelles, Gilberto (Universidad del Norte)","Polo-Mendoza, Rodrigo (Charles University); Navarro-Donado, Tatiana (Universidad del Norte); Ortega-Martinez, Daniela (Universidad del Norte; TU Dresden); Turbay, Emilio (Universidad del Norte); Martinez-Arguelles, Gilberto (Universidad del Norte); Peñabaena-Niebles, Rita (Universidad del Norte)",32,32,,,https://www.mdpi.com/2079-4991/13/5/955/pdf?version=1678114216,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1156032144,40 Engineering; 4016 Materials Engineering; 4018 Nanotechnology,

We herein aimed to assess delayed adverse events (DAEs) occurring >7 days after COVID-19 vaccination in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) versus other rheumatic autoimmune diseases (rAIDs), non-rheumatic AIDs (nrAIDs), and healthy controls (HCs).
METHODS: Self-reported data were captured within the COVID-19 Vaccination in Autoimmune Diseases (COVAD)-2 online survey, which comprised >150 centres and responses from 106 countries, between February and June 2022. Logistic regression analysis adjusting for important confounders (age, sex, ethnicity) was used to compare groups.
RESULTS: Of 7203 eligible individuals, 882 (12.2%) patients had SLE, 3161 (43.9%) patients had rAIDs, 426 (5.9%) patients had nrAIDs, and 2734 (38.0%) were HCs. SLE patients had a median age of 39 years (IQR: 31-50); 93.7% were women. SLE patients reported, more frequently, major DAEs (OR: 1.6; 95% CI: 1.2-2.0; p = 0.001) and hospitalisation (OR: 2.2; 95% CI: 1.4-3.4; p < 0.001) compared to HCs, severe rashes (OR: 2.4; 95% CI: 1.3-4.2; p = 0.004) compared to people with rAIDS, and hospitalisation (OR: 2.3; 95% CI: 1.1-4.9; p = 0.029) as well as several minor DAEs compared to people with nrAIDs. Differences were observed between vaccines in terms of frequency of major DAEs and hospitalisations, with the latter seen more frequently in patients receiving the Moderna vaccine. People with SLE with no autoimmune multimorbidity less frequently reported overall minor DAEs compared to SLE patients with comorbid nrAIDs (OR: 0.5; 95% CI: 0.3-1.0; p = 0.036).
CONCLUSION: Hospitalisations post-vaccination were more frequent in SLE patients than in HCs. Monitoring of SLE patients following COVID-19 vaccination can help in identifying DAEs early, informing patients about expected DAEs, and supporting patients, especially those with autoimmune multimorbidity.","The authors are grateful to all respondents for completing the questionnaire.

The treatment of invasive Candida infections is based on the use of fluconazole, but the emergence of resistant isolates has been an increasing concern which has led to the study of alternative drugs with antifungal activity. Sphingolipids have been considered a promising target due to their roles in fungal growth and virulence. Inhibitors of the sphingolipid biosynthetic pathway have been described to display antifungal properties, such as myriocin and aureobasidin A, which are active against resistant Candida isolates. In the present study, aureobasidin A did not display antibiofilm activity nor synergism with amphotericin B, but its combination with fluconazole was effective against Candida biofilms and protected the host in an in vivo infection model. Alterations in treated cells revealed increased oxidative stress, reduced mitochondrial membrane potential and chitin content, as well as altered morphology, enhanced DNA leakage and a greater susceptibility to sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS). In addition, it seems to inhibit the efflux pump CaCdr2p. All these data contribute to elucidating the role of aureobasidin A on fungal cells, especially evidencing its promising use in clinical resistant isolates of Candida species.","The authors thank the Centro Nacional de Biologia Estrutural e Bioimagem (CENABIO, UFRJ, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil) for the facilities and support in the use of SEM equipment.","This study was financed in part by the Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior—Brasil (CAPES)—Finance Code 001; Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e TecnolÓgico (CNPq) Universal-Processo # 408981/2018-0 and Fundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do estado do Rio de Janeiro-CNE (Faperj) Processo # E-26/202974/2017.

Case definitions for the three arboviral infections overlap.
METHODS: A cross-sectional analysis was carried out. A bivariate analysis was made using confirmed CHIKV infection as the outcome. Variables with significant statistical association were included in an agreement consensus. Agreed variables were analyzed in a multiple regression model. The area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was calculated to determine a cut-off value and performance.
RESULTS: 295 patients with confirmed CHIKV infection were included. A screening tool was created using symmetric arthritis (4 points), fatigue (3 points), rash (2 points), and ankle joint pain (1 point). The ROC curve identified a cut-off value, and a score ≥ 5.5 was considered positive for identifying CHIKV patients with a sensibility of 64.4% and a specificity of 87.4%, positive predictive value of 85.5%, negative predictive value of 67.7%, area under the curve of 0.72, and an accuracy of 75%.
CONCLUSION: We developed a screening tool for CHIKV diagnosis using only clinical symptoms as well as proposed an algorithm to aid the primary care physician.",None.,"This work was supported by the Colombian Rheumatology Association (ACTA 169 10 July 2015), Universidad de La Sabana (MED-197-2015), and COLCIENCIAS doctoral scholarship (757-2016).",Tropical Medicine and Infectious Disease,,,,2023-04-03,2023,2023-04-03,,8,4,213,All OA; Gold,Article,"Rueda, Juan C.; Peláez-Ballestas, Ingris; Angarita, Jose-Ignacio; Santos, Ana M.; Pinzon, Carlos; Saldarriaga, Eugenia-Lucia; Rueda, Jorge M.; Forero, Elias; Saaibi, Diego L.; Pavía, Paula X.; Mantilla, Marta Juliana; Rodríguez-Salas, Gustavo; Santacruz, Juan Camilo; Rueda, Igor; Cardiel, Mario H.; Londono, John","Rueda, Juan C.

OD is a common problem in children with congenital Zika virus syndrome (CZS). In this case series, we describe the clinical and acoustic alterations of swallowing in children exposed to the Zika virus during pregnancy in a cohort from Amazonas, Brazil. From July 2019 to January 2020, 22 children were evaluated, 6 with microcephaly and 16 without microcephaly. The mean age among the participants was 35 months (±4.6 months). All children with microcephaly had alterations in oral motricity, mainly in the lips and cheeks. Other alterations were in vocal quality, hard palate, and soft palate. Half of the children with microcephaly showed changes in cervical auscultation during breast milk swallowing. In children without microcephaly, the most frequently observed alteration was in lip motricity, but alterations in auscultation during the swallowing of breast milk were not observed. Regarding swallowing food of a liquid and pasty consistency, the most frequent alterations were incomplete verbal closure, increased oral transit time, inadequacy in capturing the spoon, anterior labial leakage, and increased oral transit time. Although these events are more frequent in microcephalic children, they can also be seen in non-microcephalic children, which points to the need for an indistinct evaluation of children exposed in utero to ZIKV.","We would like to thank the families who agreed to follow us on this path of acceptance, care, and construction of knowledge. We thank the Zika Project’s multidisciplinary team for working with us in monitoring the children.","This work was funded by Fundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado do Amazonas (FAPEAM): Universal Amazonas (#002/2018); the Ministry of Health of Brazil: Programa de Pesquisa para o SUS—PPSUS (#062.01018/2018)—and Departamento de Ciência e Tecnologia—(#51/2019); and Leônidas and Maria Deane Institute (ILMD/Fiocruz Amazônia), in partnership with the Nacional Council for Scientific and Technological Development—CNPq (#400911/2018-3n).

This bacillus can invade the peripheral nerves asymmetrically, including the ulnar, median, and radial nerves, causing mononeuritis multiplex. We present the case of a 41-year-old man with a history of Hansen's disease with sensory and motor symptoms. Electrodiagnostic studies and ultrasound showed asymmetric lesions of the median, ulnar, and radial nerves. Because this is the main complication of this pathology, electrodiagnosis is clearly valuable for its diagnosis, demonstrating axonal and myelin involvement, as well as signs of denervation and reinnervation. Ultrasound is valuable in the detection, diagnosis, and assessment of the extent of mononeuritis multiplex due to Hansen's disease. It aids in identifying significant inflammatory deterioration, as indicated by increased blood flow in the nerves and enlargement of the nerves. This technique allows for the exploration of nerves such as the ulnar nerve and branches of the brachial plexus. In a complementary way, ultrasound provides information on the severity of the disease. Early diagnosis of this entity is essential because it can generate aesthetic and functional permanent affectation.",,,Cureus,,"Alexander Muacevic, John R Adler",,2023-08-26,2023,2023-08-26,,15,8,e44175,All OA; Gold,Article,"Malpica, Wilmer Santiago Herrera; Hernández, Paula Vanessa Muñetones; Becerra, Nathalia Maria Perez; Rodriguez, Jorge Nicolas Muñoz; Ruiz, Jorge Arturo Diaz","Malpica, Wilmer Santiago Herrera (Rehabilitation Medicine, Universidad Nacional De Colombia, Bogotá, COL); Hernández, Paula Vanessa Muñetones (General Medicine, Universidad Nacional De Colombia, Bogotá, COL); Becerra, Nathalia Maria Perez (Rehabilitation Medicine, Universidad Nacional De Colombia, Bogotá, COL); Rodriguez, Jorge Nicolas Muñoz (Rehabilitation Medicine, Universidad Nacional De Colombia, Bogotá, COL); Ruiz, Jorge Arturo Diaz (Rehabilitation Medicine, Universidad Nacional De Colombia, Bogotá, COL)","Malpica, Wilmer Santiago Herrera (National University of Colombia)","Malpica, Wilmer Santiago Herrera (National University of Colombia); Hernández, Paula Vanessa Muñetones (National University of Colombia); Becerra, Nathalia Maria Perez (National University of Colombia); Rodriguez, Jorge Nicolas Muñoz (National University of Colombia); Ruiz, Jorge Arturo Diaz (National University of Colombia)",0,0,,,https://assets.cureus.com/uploads/case_report/pdf/166696/20230826-22854-a8p3mu.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1163598347,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3202 Clinical Sciences,3 Good Health and Well Being

Design: Federated pharmacoepidemiological evaluation in LEGEND-T2DM.
Setting: 10 US and seven non-US electronic health record and administrative claims databases in the Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics network in eight countries from 2011 to the end of 2021.
Participants: 4.8 million patients (≥18 years) across US and non-US based databases with type 2 diabetes mellitus who had received metformin monotherapy and had initiated second line treatments.
Exposure: The exposure used to evaluate each database was calendar year trends, with the years in the study that were specific to each cohort.
Main outcomes measures: The outcome was the incidence of second line antihyperglycaemic drug use (ie, glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists, sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors, dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors, and sulfonylureas) among individuals who were already receiving treatment with metformin. The relative drug class level uptake across cardiovascular risk groups was also evaluated.
Results: 4.6 million patients were identified in US databases, 61 382 from Spain, 32 442 from Germany, 25 173 from the UK, 13 270 from France, 5580 from Scotland, 4614 from Hong Kong, and 2322 from Australia. During 2011-21, the combined proportional initiation of the cardioprotective antihyperglycaemic drugs (glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists and sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors) increased across all data sources, with the combined initiation of these drugs as second line drugs in 2021 ranging from 35.2% to 68.2% in the US databases, 15.4% in France, 34.7% in Spain, 50.1% in Germany, and 54.8% in Scotland. From 2016 to 2021, in some US and non-US databases, uptake of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists and sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors increased more significantly among populations with no cardiovascular disease compared with patients with established cardiovascular disease. No data source provided evidence of a greater increase in the uptake of these two drug classes in populations with cardiovascular disease compared with no cardiovascular disease.
Conclusions: Despite the increase in overall uptake of cardioprotective antihyperglycaemic drugs as second line treatments for type 2 diabetes mellitus, their uptake was lower in patients with cardiovascular disease than in people with no cardiovascular disease over the past decade. A strategy is needed to ensure that medication use is concordant with guideline recommendations to improve outcomes of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.",,,BMJ Medicine,,,,2023-10-06,2023,2023-10-06,2023-10,2,1,e000651,All OA;

These types of studies, which have attracted growing attention in recent years, enhance the scope and rigor of the evaluation. While various frameworks that summarize the justifications for carrying out these types of studies and provide implementation guidance have been published in the last few years in the health sciences, we do not know whether such frameworks have been properly implemented in the social and educational sciences. This review examined the methodological features and reporting practices of mixed methods intervention studies aimed at increasing young people's interest in STEM.
Methods: A systematic search was carried out in APA PsycNET, ERIC, ProQuest, Scopus, and Web of Science, and a hand search in 20 journals. We included peer-reviewed English-language articles that reported intervention studies with a quantitative component measuring outcomes specific to increasing secondary school students' interest in STEM fields, a qualitative component conducted before, during, or after the quantitative component, and evidence of integration of both components. Qualitative content analysis and ideal-type analysis were used to synthesize the findings.
Results: We found 34 studies; the majority published in the last ten years. Several patterns of mixed methods application were described in these studies, illustrating the unique insights that can be gained by employing this methodology. The reporting quality of the included studies was generally adequate, especially regarding the justification for using a mixed methods intervention design and the integration of the quantitative and qualitative components. Nonetheless, a few reporting issues were observed, such as a lack of detail in the presentation of the mixed methods design, an inadequate description of the qualitative sampling and analysis techniques, and the absence of joint displays for representing integration.
Discussion: Authors must pay attention to these issues to ensure that the insights obtained by the use of mixed methods research are effectively communicated.",The authors would like to acknowledge the help of Dick Edelstein in editing the final manuscript.,"This study belonged to a research project led by MS and funded by the Spanish Ministry of Economy, Industry and Competitiveness (MINECO), Spanish State Research Agency (AEI), and European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) grant number (FEM2017-84589-R).",Frontiers in Psychology,,,,2023-01-05,2023,2023-01-05,,13,,956300,All OA; Gold,Article,"Fàbregues, Sergi; Sáinz, Milagros; Romano, María José; Escalante-Barrios, Elsa Lucia; Younas, Ahtisham; López-Pérez, Beatriz-Soledad","Fàbregues, Sergi (Department of Psychology and Education, Universitat Oberta de Catalunya, Barcelona, Spain); Sáinz, Milagros (Internet Interdisciplinary Institute, Universitat Oberta de Catalunya, Barcelona, Spain); Romano, María José (Internet Interdisciplinary Institute, Universitat Oberta de Catalunya, Barcelona, Spain); Escalante-Barrios, Elsa Lucia (Department of Education, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); Younas, Ahtisham (Faculty of Nursing, Memorial University of Newfoundland, St. John’s, IL, Canada); López-Pérez, Beatriz-Soledad (Internet Interdisciplinary Institute, Universitat Oberta de Catalunya, Barcelona, Spain)","Fàbregues, Sergi (Open University of Catalonia); Sáinz, Milagros (Open University of Catalonia)","Fàbregues, Sergi (Open University of Catalonia); Sáinz, Milagros (Open University of Catalonia); Romano, María José (Open University of Catalonia); Escalante-Barrios, Elsa Lucia (Universidad del Norte); Younas, Ahtisham (Memorial University of Newfoundland); López-Pérez, Beatriz-Soledad (Open University of Catalonia)",6,6,,,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.956300/pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1154252387,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 52 Psychology,

For the determination and analysis of Irgafos P-168, DSC, HPLC-MS, and FTIR methodologies were used. Solid phase extraction (SPE) proved to be the best technique for extracting Irgafos from wastewater. HPLC-MS and SPE determined the repeatability, reproducibility, and linearity of the method and the SPE of the standards and samples. The relative standard deviations, errors, and correlation coefficients for the repeatability and reproducibility of the calibration curves were less than 4.4% and 4.2% and greater than 0.99955, respectively. The analysis of variance (ANOVA), using the Fisher method with confidence in 95% of the data, did not reveal significant differences between the mentioned parameters. The removal of the antioxidant from the wastewater by SPE showed recovery percentages higher than 91.03%, and the chemical characterization of this antioxidant by FTIR spectroscopy, DSC, TGA, and MS showed it to be structurally the same as the Irgafos P-168 molecule. The recovered Irgafos was added to the polypropylene matrix, significantly improving its oxidation times. An OIT analysis, performed using DSC, showed that the recovered Irgafos-blended polypropylene (PP) demonstrated oxidative degradation at 8 min. With the addition of the Irgafos, the oxidation time was 13 min. This increases the polypropylene's useful life and minimizes the environmental impact of the wastewater.",,This research received no external funding.,Molecules,,Mohamad Nasir Mohamad Ibrahim,,2023-04-02,2023,2023-04-02,,28,7,3163,All OA; Gold,Article,"Hernández-Fernández, Joaquín; Cano, Heidis; Reyes, Ana Fonseca","Hernández-Fernández, Joaquín (Chemistry Program, Department of Natural and Exact Sciences, San Pablo Campus, University of Cartagena, Cartagena 130015, Colombia.; Chemical Engineering Program, School of Engineering, Universidad Tecnológica de Bolivar, Parque Industrial y Tecnológico Carlos Vélez Pombo, Km 1 Vía Turbaco, Turbaco 130001, Colombia.; Department of Natural and Exact Science, Universidad de la Costa, Barranquilla 30300, Colombia.); Cano, Heidis (Department of Civil and Environmental, Universidad de la Costa, Barranquilla 080002, Colombia.); Reyes, Ana Fonseca (Department of Mechanical Engineering, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla 081007, Colombia.)","Hernández-Fernández, Joaquín (University of Cartagena; Universidad Tecnológica de Bolívar; University of the Coast); Reyes, Ana Fonseca (Universidad del Norte)","Hernández-Fernández, Joaquín (University of Cartagena; Universidad Tecnológica de Bolívar; University of the Coast); Cano, Heidis (University of the Coast); Reyes, Ana Fonseca (Universidad del Norte)",4,4,,,https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/28/7/3163/pdf?version=1680427127,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1156943796,34 Chemical Sciences; 3404 Medicinal and Biomolecular Chemistry; 3405 Organic Chemistry,

The influence of the abnormal function of mentalis muscle on the shape and posture of the mandible was evaluated using a finite element approach.
METHODS: Finite element analysis was used to create a three-dimensional representation of a human mandible that represents a dry normal mandible with teeth (33-36 gm/cm2). Pressures were applied directly to the labial surface of the mandible's lower anterior dento-alveolar structure reflecting the normal lips muscle function. While on abnormal swallowing pattern, lip muscle force (300 gm\cm2) had been assumed.
RESULTS: Shape and postural abnormality of the mandible with malocclusion particularly at the anterior dentoalveolar and basal bone region in sagittal direction as well as inward pressure on the mandibular posterior region.
CONCLUSION: Abnormal perioral muscle function throughout growth and development may result in a shape and postural abnormality of the mandible and a companying malocclusion.","The authors would like to express their gratitude to the University of Mosul, College of Dentistry, and College of Engineering for their ongoing support.

This approach pivoted on the incorporation of byproducts, with a spotlight on ground glass powder (GP) as a pivotal supplementary cementitious material (SCM). Our goal was twofold: engineering cost-efficient concrete while maintaining environmental integrity. The derived RPC showcased robust mechanical strength and impressive workability. Rigorous evaluations, containing attributes like compressive strength, resistance to chloride ion penetration, ultrasonic pulse speed, and drying shrinkage, highlighted its merits. Notably, the optimized RPC, despite an insignificant decrease in compressive strength at 90 days compared to its traditional counterpart, maintained steady strength augmentation over time. The refinement process culminated in a notable 29% reduction in ordinary Portland cement (OPC) usage and a significant 64% decrease in silica fume (SF), with the optimized mix composition being 590 for cement, 100 for SF, 335 for GP, and 257 kg/m3 for calcium carbonate. Additionally, the optimized RPC stood out due to the enhanced rheological behavior, influenced by the lubricative properties of calcium carbonate and the water conservation features of the glass powder. The reactive properties of SF, combined with GP, brought distinct performance variations, most evident at 28 days. Yet, both mixtures exhibited superior resistance to chloride, deeming them ideal for rigorous settings like coastal regions. Significantly, the RPC iteration, enriched with selective mineral admixtures, displayed a reduced tendency for drying-induced shrinkage, mitigating potential crack emergence.","The authors extend their appreciation to Researcher Supporting Project number (RSPD2023R692), King Saud University, Riyadh, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.

Normally, such cases would be left undecided, while on the other hand, timely taxonomic decisions are required. We argue that morphological, chorological, and ecological data can be informative to illuminate patterns of speciation. Their use can provide a first step in testing taxon concepts at species level. We focused on five cases of nested singletons in trees of the genus Casearia. We employed PCA and cluster analysis to assess phenotypic differentiation. Using geocoordinates, we calculated niche space differentiation based on 19 bioclim variables, by means of PCA and niche equivalency and similarity tests and generated dot maps. We found that the singletons were morphologically distinctive in two of the five cases (Casearia selloana and C. manausensis), relatively distinctive in two other cases (C. zizyphoides and C. mariquitensis), and partially overlapping in the last case (C. grandiflora). For two cases (C. mariquitensis and C. selloana), ecological niche space was broadly overlapping, in two cases it was found broadly nested (C. grandiflora and C. zizyphoides), and in one case narrowly nested (C. manausensis), but in no case niche differentiation was observed. Niche overlap, similarity and equivalency showed corresponding patterns. Given these data, one would interpret C. selloana and C. manausensis as presumably well-distinguished taxa, their narrow distribution ranges suggesting recently emerging lineages. The other three cases are not clearcut. Morphological data would suggest particularly C. grandiflora conspecific with C. arborea, but differences in the distribution are intriguing. Our approach would reject the notion of potential synonymy based on nested phylogenetic placement for at least two of the five cases. The other case also shows no complete lack of differentiation which would support synonymy.","ACKNOWLEDGMENTS We are thankful to Mac H.

The objective of this study was to estimate the effectiveness of vaccines in preventing hospitalization and death from COVID-19 in Colombia under real-life conditions among people aged 18 years and older, according to sex, age, confirmed history of COVID-19 and vaccination series, including the effects of boosters. This investigation was an observational, retrospective, population-based study based on the Colombian cohort ""Esperanza"". A total of 14,213,409 individuals aged 18 years and older were analyzed, who were matched in a 1:1 ratio of vaccinated to unvaccinated. The study groups consisted of unvaccinated individuals, those with a complete series (CS) and individuals with a CS plus booster. The vaccinated individuals received either homologous or heterologous vaccinations with Ad26.COV2-S, BNT162b2, ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, CoronaVac and mRNA-1273 vaccines. Follow-up was conducted between February 2021 and June 2022. Cox proportional hazards models were used, adjusted for potential confounders, to estimate the effectiveness of different vaccination series. For adults aged 18 years and older, the overall effectiveness of the vaccines in preventing hospitalization was 82.7% (95% CI 82.1-83.2) for CS and 80.2% (95%CI 78.7-81.6) for CS + booster. The effectiveness in preventing death was 86.0% (95%CI 85.5-86.5) for CS and 83.1% (95%CI 81.5-84.5) for CS + booster. Effectiveness decreased with age. While all efficacies were high, CoronaVac offered significantly lower protection, although this improved with a booster. Continued mass vaccination is pivotal, especially in low- and middle-income countries. The study highlights both the real-world effectiveness of these vaccines and the challenges in understanding waning immunity and the influence of different VoC(Variants of Concern) on results.",,"This study did not have any formal grant or specific funding.

When the work environment negatively influences individuals, it may trigger emotional disturbances, behavioral problems, chronic stress conditions, and illnesses such as burnout syndrome (BS). Recently, studies on BS have increased and placed a special focus on health care professionals. The prevalence of BS among health professionals is associated with their chronic exposure to human hardship and long working hours without proper rest. These factors have contributed to greater stress and high physical and emotional exhaustion levels.
OBJECTIVE: This study aims to identify and map studies using the Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI) scale to identify burnout syndrome in health professionals working in public health services.
METHODS: This scoping review was developed based on the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) Reviewers Manual and reported according to the PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Extension for Scoping Reviews). A total of 6 databases were searched to identify relevant studies: Embase, LILACS, MEDLINE or PubMed, PsycInfo, Scopus, and Web of Science. Gray literature was consulted on ProQuest Dissertations and Theses Global, Google Scholar, Brazilian Digital Library of Theses and Dissertations, and Open Access Theses and Dissertations. Additionally, the reference lists were searched to retrieve studies not previously selected. The steps followed in this study were proposed by Arskey and O'Malley and Levac, Colquhoun, and O'Brien: identification of research questions, identification of potential studies, study selection, data extraction and imputation, data analyses and interpretation, and consultation with stakeholders. The detailed methodology was published in a protocol.
RESULTS: A total of 55 articles were identified after screening for eligibility criteria, published between 1999 and 2021 in 32 countries. Most reports were published in Brazil, Spain, and China. A total of 22 versions of the MBI were identified, presenting different items, scores, and cutoff points. The included studies had recommendations and implications for clinical practice. The consultation with stakeholders allowed knowledge translation for those interested in BS.
CONCLUSIONS: Studies mostly included physicians (34/55, 61.8%) and nurses (24/55, 43.6%), and the original version of MBI was predominantly used. Divergences in BS classification were highlighted, which may be related to MBI cross-cultural adaptations and applications in other countries. This study contributes to the advancement of research regarding burnout syndrome as an occupational illness since it has harmful consequences for workers, health care services, and the quality of care provided to the population.","The authors would like to thank Wánderson Cássio Oliveira Araújo for their support in developing the search strategy and Probatus Academic Services for providing scientific language translation, revision, and editing.",,JMIR Mental Health,,"John Torous, Gunther Eysenbach",,2023-07-21,2023,2023-07-21,,10,,e44195,All OA; Gold,Article,"Soares, Juliana Pontes; Lopes, Rayssa Horácio; de Souza Mendonça, Paula Beatriz; Silva, Cícera Renata Diniz Vieira; Rodrigues, Cláudia Cristiane Filgueira Martins; de Castro, Janete Lima","Soares, Juliana Pontes (Postgraduate Program in Collective Health, Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte, Natal, Brazil); Lopes, Rayssa Horácio (Postgraduate Program in Collective Health, Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte, Natal, Brazil); de Souza Mendonça, Paula Beatriz (Postgraduate Program in Collective Health, Federal University of Espírito Santo, Vitória, Brazil); Silva, Cícera Renata Diniz Vieira (Technical School of Health of Cajazeiras, Federal University of Campina Grande, Cajazeiras, Brazil); Rodrigues, Cláudia Cristiane Filgueira Martins (School of Health, Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte, Natal, Brazil); de Castro, Janete Lima (Postgraduate Program in Collective Health, Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte, Natal, Brazil)","Soares, Juliana Pontes (Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte)","Soares, Juliana Pontes (Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte); Lopes, Rayssa Horácio (Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte); de Souza Mendonça, Paula Beatriz (Universidade Federal do Espírito Santo); Silva, Cícera Renata Diniz Vieira (Federal University of Campina Grande); Rodrigues, Cláudia Cristiane Filgueira Martins (Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte); de Castro, Janete Lima (Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte)",14,14,,,https://mental.jmir.org/2023/1/e44195/PDF,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1154125645,42 Health Sciences; 4203 Health Services and Systems,3 Good Health and Well Being

The available data suggest an increasing use of CAM over time and a higher prevalence in low- and middle-income countries. However, no reliable data are available from Latin America. Accordingly, we examined the prevalence of CAM use among cancer patients from six Colombian regions.MethodsWe conducted a survey on cancer patients attending comprehensive cancer centres in six capital cities from different regions. The survey was designed based on a literature review and information gathered through focus groups on CAM terminology in Colombia. Independent random samples of patients from two comprehensive cancer centres in every city were obtained. Patients 18 years and older with a histopathological diagnosis of cancer undergoing active treatment were eligible. The prevalence of CAM use is reported as a percentage with the corresponding confidence interval. CAM types are reported by region. The sociodemographic and clinical characteristics of CAM users and non-users were compared using Chi square and t tests.ResultsIn total, 3117 patients were recruited. The average age 59.6 years old, and 62.8% were female. The prevalence of CAM use was 51.7%, and compared to non-users, CAM users were younger, more frequently women, affiliated with the health insurance plan for low-income populations and non-Catholic. We found no differences regarding the clinical stage or treatment modality, but CAM users reported more treatment-related side effects. The most frequent types of CAM were herbal products, specific foods and vitamins, and individually, soursop was the most frequently used product. Relevant variability between regions was observed regarding the prevalence and type of CAM used (range: 36.6% to 66.7%). The most frequent reason for using CAM was symptom management (30.5%), followed by curative purposes (19.5%).ConclusionsThe prevalence of CAM use among cancer patients in Colombia is high in general, and variations between regions might be related to differences in cultural backgrounds and access to comprehensive cancer care. The most frequently used CAM products and practices have little scientific support, suggesting the need to enhance integrative oncology research in the country.","We thank the following institutions which made posible the field work and recruitment of patients: Hospital Universitario San Ignacio, Clínica Universitaria Colombia, Hospital Internacional de Colombia, Organización Clínica Bonadona Prevenir, Clínica de la Misericordia, Oncólogos Asociados del Cauca, Oncólogos Asociados de Imbanaco, Hospital San Vicente Fundación Medellín, Clínica de Oncología Astorga, Unidad Oncológica Surcolombiana, Universidad Surcolombiana.","We had the support of the following Colombian institutions: Pontificia Universidad Javeriana; the Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation; the Ministry of Education; the Ministry of Industry, Commerce and Tourism; and the ICETEX.

Some AESIs are not only associated with the vaccines, but with COVID-19. Our aim was to characterise the incidence rates of AESIs following SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients and compare these to historical rates in the general population.
Methods: A multi-national cohort study with data from primary care, electronic health records, and insurance claims mapped to a common data model. This study's evidence was collected between Jan 1, 2017 and the conclusion of each database (which ranged from Jul 2020 to May 2022). The 16 pre-specified prevalent AESIs were: acute myocardial infarction, anaphylaxis, appendicitis, Bell's palsy, deep vein thrombosis, disseminated intravascular coagulation, encephalomyelitis, Guillain- Barré syndrome, haemorrhagic stroke, non-haemorrhagic stroke, immune thrombocytopenia, myocarditis/pericarditis, narcolepsy, pulmonary embolism, transverse myelitis, and thrombosis with thrombocytopenia. Age-sex standardised incidence rate ratios (SIR) were estimated to compare post-COVID-19 to pre-pandemic rates in each of the databases.
Findings: Substantial heterogeneity by age was seen for AESI rates, with some clearly increasing with age but others following the opposite trend. Similarly, differences were also observed across databases for same health outcome and age-sex strata. All studied AESIs appeared consistently more common in the post-COVID-19 compared to the historical cohorts, with related meta-analytic SIRs ranging from 1.32 (1.05 to 1.66) for narcolepsy to 11.70 (10.10 to 13.70) for pulmonary embolism.
Interpretation: Our findings suggest all AESIs are more common after COVID-19 than in the general population. Thromboembolic events were particularly common, and over 10-fold more so. More research is needed to contextualise post-COVID-19 complications in the longer term.

METHODS: Multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled trial in 658 adults with prediabetes treated for 1 year with metformin, linagliptin, their combination or placebo. Endpoints are small fiber peripheral neuropathy (SFPN) risk estimated by foot electrochemical skin conductance (FESC < 70 μSiemens) and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR).
RESULTS: Compared to the placebo, the proportion of SFPN was reduced by 25.1% (95% CI:16.3-33.9) with metformin alone, by 17.3% (95% CI 7.4-27.2) with linagliptin alone, and by 19.5% (95% CI 10.1-29.0) with the combination linagliptin/metformin (p < 0.0001 for all comparisons). eGFR remained +3.3 mL/min (95% CI: 0.38-6.22) higher with the combination linagliptin/metformin than with the placebo (p = 0.03). Fasting plasma glucose (FPG) decreased more with metformin monotherapy -0.3 mmol/L (95%CI: -0.48; 0.12, p = 0.0009) and with the combination metformin/linagliptin -0.2 mmol/L (95% CI: -0.37; -0.03) than with the placebo (p = 0.0219). Body weight (BW) decreased by -2.0 kg (95% CI: -5.65; -1.65, p = 0.0006) with metformin monotherapy, and by -1.9 kg (95% CI: -3.02; -0.97) with the combination metformin/linagliptin as compared to the placebo (p = 0.0002).
CONCLUSIONS: in people with prediabetes, a 1 year treatment with metformin and linagliptin, combined or in monotherapy, was associated with a lower risk of SFPN, and with a lower decrease in eGFR, than treatment with placebo.","Members of the e-PREDICE Consortium: Steering Committee: Jaakko Tuomilehto, Rafael Gabriel, Jaana Lindström, Jesús Egido, Andrea Natali, José Carlos Pastor, Michael Brainin, Marcus Lind, Luis Silva, Peter Schwartz, Aleksandra Gilis-Januszewska.

The degree of pathogenesis of clinical isolates varies greatly. This study was aimed to molecular identification of E. histolytica in children using the nested polymerase chain reaction (nPCR), and then, a genotyping of positive E. histolytica isolates using the quantitative PCR (qPCR) assay through targeting serine-rich E. histolytica protein (SREHP) gene. For this purpose, a total of 50 bloody diarrheic stool samples were collected from the children attended to the Al-Zahraa' Teaching Hospital and Alkut Hospital for Gynecology, Obstetric and Pediatrics (Alkut, Wasit, Iraq) were subjected to the present study from September to December 2021. Firstly, the extracted DNAs that amplified using specific primers through targeting 18S rRNA gene and tested using nPCR assay were revealed an overall 48% (24/50) positive samples for E. histolytica. For genotyping, our results were detected an existence of four different genotypes (I, II, III and IV) with a significant prevalence of Genotype-II (54.17%) when compared to Genotype-I (20.83%), Genotype-III (12.5%) and Genotype- IV (12.5%). In addition, results of melting temperature of targeted genotypes were 84ºC, 83 - 83.5ºC, 82.5ºC and 81ºC for Genotype-I, II, III and IV, respectively. In conclusion, molecular amplification of 18S rRNA gene was revealed the large prevalence of E. histolytica among bloody diarrheic children of study areas; while, amplification of SREHP gene was reflected the widespread phenotypic variation of the Genotype-II suggesting the high ability of this genotype to spread infection in children. In different endemic areas as Iraq, the utilization of high-resolution genotyping methods showed the extremely polymorphic genetic structure of this parasite.",,,Archives of Razi Institute,,,"Animals; Female; Pregnancy; Entamoeba histolytica; Genotype; DNA Primers; Hospitals; Iraq; RNA, Ribosomal, 18S",2023-02-28,2023,2023-02-28,,78,1,337-343,All OA; Gold,Article,"Kadhim, D Kareem; Hraija, B Abdulsalam; Aqeele, G","Kadhim, D Kareem (Department of Anatomy and Biology, College of Medicine, University of Wasit, Wasit, Iraq); Hraija, B Abdulsalam (Department of Microbiology, College of Medicine, University of Wasit, Wasit, Iraq); Aqeele, G (Department of Microbiology, College of Medicine, University of Wasit, Wasit, Iraq)",,"Kadhim, D Kareem (University of Wasit); Hraija, B Abdulsalam (University of Wasit); Aqeele, G (University of Wasit)",0,0,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.22092/ari.2022.358947.2336,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1159795676,31 Biological Sciences; 3107 Microbiology,

The Born-Oppenheimer electronic energy curve for this molecular model consists of two-intercrossing harmonic oscillator potentials with minima displaced in energy and nuclear coordinate. The results obtained show how these optical responses are sensitive to explicit considerations of both intramolecular coupling and the presence of the solvent through their stochastic interaction. Our study shows that the permanent dipoles of the system and the transition dipoles induced by electromagnetic field effects represent critical quantities for the analysis. The solvent action in our model is treated through the natural Bohr frequency shift to a time-dependent function, with explicit manifestations in its comparison as if the upper state were broadened. Significant variations in the nonlinear optical properties for cases of perturbative and saturative treatments, relaxation times, and optical propagation, mainly due to changes in the probe and pump intensities, are studied. Our studies relating the intramolecular effects with those generated by the presence of the solvent and its stochastic interaction with the solute of study, have allowed not only to analyze the influence of these in the profile of the optical responses, but they could also provide some insights into the analysis and characterization of molecular systems through nonlinear optical properties.",The work was carried out using the computational resources provided by the Universidad Nacional Mayor de San Marcos through its Vice Rectorate of Research and Postgraduate Studies.

Therefore, different authors have developed mathematical models for its calculation. The target of this review was to analyze the work carried out on mathematical models of body composition variables from different anthropometric measurements, answering the following questions: what is the corporal variable that the model predicts?, what are the input variables for model development?, how is the patients typification in each model?, what data analysis method has been used?, and how has been the model evaluated? The search was limited to journals found in repositories in the areas of Medicine, Nursing, Biochemistry, Biology, Health, Pharmacology, Immunology, Engineering, and Mathematics. Four hundred and twenty-four articles were found, which were reduced to 30 by applying the systematic literature review process. The analyzed studies are oriented to the prediction of variables related to body fat mass. The evaluation results found for fat-free mass, fat mass and metabolic rate differ according to the comparison technique and the body segments analyzed. The evaluation is mainly based on the intraclass correlation, the Pearson correlation and the coefficient of determination (r2), and they present a good correlation for the population under study.",,,Nutrición Hospitalaria,,,Humans; Body Composition; Anthropometry,2023,2023,,2023,40,5,1068-1079,All OA; Gold,Article,"Eraso-Checa, Francisco; Rosero, Ricardo; González, Carlos; Cortés, David; Hernández, Eder; Polanco, Juan Pablo; Díaz-Tribaldos, Carolina","Eraso-Checa, Francisco (Programa de Ingeniería Electrónica.

Patients and Methods: Descriptive, cross-sectional, retrospective, and quantitative approach study, the information was analyzed by statistical analysis by multiple correspondence using Orange Data Mining software; the analysis consisted of visual programming to perform interactive data exploration, to identify and differentiate associations or oppositions between different categories in space.
Results: The most frequently reported adverse events were allergic reactions, with 28.5%. Female sex and adult age are the groups most prone to present these events; antibiotics were the pharmacological group that produced the most adverse events with 18.3%; the main errors that produce these events are related to prescription.
Conclusion: Age and sex increase the risk of adverse drug events; most of these events are the product of erroneous prescriptions. The findings presented in this article are useful for pharmacovigilance programs in health institutions.",The authors would like to extend their sincere appreciation to the University of Córdoba - Colombia (Grant No. FCS 01-22) for the financial support of this research.

Here we investigated the motives that underlie support for COVID-19 preventive behaviours in a sample of 12,758 individuals from 34 countries. We hypothesized that the associations of empathic prosocial concern and fear of disease with support towards preventive COVID-19 behaviours would be moderated by trust in the government. Results suggest that the association between fear of disease and support for COVID-19 preventive behaviours was strongest when trust in the government was weak (both at individual- and country-level). Conversely, the association with empathic prosocial concern was strongest when trust in the government was high, but this moderation was only found at individual-level scores of governmental trust. We discuss how motivations may be shaped by socio-cultural context, and outline how findings may contribute to a better understanding of collective action during global crises.","We would like to thank Valentina Romo, Jallene Jia En Chua, Melis Yetkin, Emren Burak Ömür, Miguel Landa Blanco, Christine Kraus, Raymond Langley, Youmna Haddad, Abida Sultana, Sadiya Alam Surma, Nishat Tamanna Omi, Asmaul Husna Chara, Monir Hossen, Mohima Akter, Nargees Akter, Khondoker Shahriar Islam, Md Johirul Islam, Joti Saha, Sk.Sabbir Islam Mahi, Tayeba Sultana Sonia, Md.

We studied the effects of nifurtimox administered by two different treatment regimens on the T. cruzi calcium-binding flagellar protein F29 in children diagnosed with Chagas disease measured using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) technique (ELISA F29).
METHODS AND PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: In a phase 3, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, historically controlled study (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02625974), blood samples obtained from children diagnosed with Chagas disease and treated with nifurtimox for either 60 days or 30 days were analyzed using an ELISA with an F29 recombinant protein as the antigen, as well as conventional serological tests (recombinant ELISA and indirect hemagglutination assay). In an exploratory approach, serological response to nifurtimox treatment was evaluated for 4 years post-treatment. In both treatment groups, the number of patients with negative ELISA F29 values increased over the period of observation. The incidence rate of negative seroconversion using ELISA F29 was 22.94% (95% CI: 19.65%, 26.63%) in the 60-day treatment group and 21.64% (95% CI: 17.21%, 26.86%) in the 30-day treatment group. In the subpopulation of patients who tested seropositive for F29 before nifurtimox treatment, 88 patients (67.7%) in the 60-day regimen and 39 patients (59.1%) in the 30-day regimen were F29 seronegative at 4 years post-treatment. All patients who had a positive ELISA F29 test at baseline and seroconverted to negative measured by conventional serology reached seronegativity in ELISA F29 earlier than in conventional serology.
CONCLUSIONS: The results demonstrate a serological response to treatment with nifurtimox measured by the ELISA F29 test in children diagnosed with Chagas disease. The F29-based ELISA can be considered a potential early marker of response to antitrypanosomal therapy for Chagas disease.

The sample included 151 participants (97 males, mean age of 55.7 ± 14.1 years) who completed the cross-culturally adapted version of the FPAS instrument for the Brazilian context. The psychometric properties of both versions of the FPAS instrument were evaluated by two distinct approaches:•Exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis: used to test the internal structure of the instrument•Cronbach's Alpha and McDonald's Omega: used to determine the reliability of the instrument The two versions of the FPAS-Br instrument showed consistent evidence of internal structure validity and reliability.

MATERIALS AND METHODS.: Analytical cross-sectional observational study at the Instituto Nacional de Salud del Niño San Borja in 2019. The sample consisted of children older than one month and younger than 18 years who were admitted to emergency diagnosed with community-acquired pneumonia. We used Poisson regression to assess association.
RESULTS.: We evaluated 166 patients diagnosed with pneumonia, 94 (56.6%) were male and the median age was 24 months (IQR: 11 - 48). Most patients had a mild modified PIRO score of 136 (81.9%); 31 (18.7%) patients had complicated pneumonia and 24 (14.5%) were admitted to intensive care. The higher the age, the lower the prevalence of admission to ICU (PR=0.99, 95%CI: 0.98-0.99). The severity assessed with the modified PIRO score (PR=3.40, 95%CI: 1.46-7.93) and the presence of complicated pneumonia (PR: 5.88, 95%CI: 2.46-14.06) were associated with admission to intensive care.
CONCLUSIONS.: The prevalence of admission to intensive care in children with community-acquired pneumonia was 14.5%.

Methods: Qualitative study of 20 semi-structured interviews with women from Venezuela who are residents of Barranquilla and who carry out leadership activities in communities or who participate in or benefit from those activities. The interviews included opinions and experiences related to access to VIP, and to SRH in general, as well as suggestions for improving access for migrant women. The relationship between access to these services and the migration process was explored, as well as the role of social organizations.
Results: A lack of information on SRH-related rights was identified as the main access barrier to VIP. Other identified barriers were: attitude towards VIP, excessive steps involved in accessing medical care, difficulties in admission to the social security system, lack of training and care in SRH, and xenophobia in hospitals. The interviewees said they did not understand the legal framework in Colombia and did not know the channels for safe abortion care.
Conclusions: Despite the efforts of institutions and international cooperation, Venezuelan migrant women in Barranquilla are in a situation of vulnerability due to their lack of access to sexual and reproductive health, including voluntary interruption of pregnancy. Implementing strategies for comprehensive care for migrants will improve current health conditions and the effective enjoyment of SRH-related rights.",,"Este trabajo recibió financiamiento del Programa Especial de Investigación, Desarrollo y Capacitación para la Investigación en Reproducción Humana del Programa de las Naciones Unidas para el Desarrollo (PNUD, por su sigla en inglés), el Fondo de Población de las Naciones (UNFPA, por su sigla en inglés), el Fondo para la Infancia de las Naciones Unidas ((UNICEF), la Organización Mundial de la Salud (/OMS) y el Banco Mundial, y por el Programa Especial de Investigación y Capacitación en Enfermedades Tropicales de UNICEF-PNUD-Banco Mundial-OMS, ambos programas copatrocinados por la OMS.",BULL PAN AM HEALTH ORGAN,,,,2023-03-03,2023,2023-03-03,2023-03-03,47,,e49,All OA; Gold,Article,"Quintero, Luz Dary; Osorio, Habid Osorio; Bojorquez-Chapela, Ietza; Isaza, Laura; Acosta-Reyes, Jorge; Fernández-Niño, Julián Alfredo","Quintero, Luz Dary (Departamento de Salud Pública, Universidad del Norte, Puerto Colombia, Colombia, Departamento de Salud Pública.

The present study aimed to determine the influence of the anthropometric profile and physical activity level (PAL) on the postural balance of overweight and obese children. The sample included 387 schoolchildren (216 boys and 171 girls). The variables of the anthropometric profile studied were body mass, biped height, BMI, waist circumference, waist-to-hip ratio (WHR), summation of folds, body composition, and somatotype. PAL was measured using the PAQ-C questionnaire. Static and dynamic postural balance were measured through an open-eye (OE) and closed-eye (CE) posturographic test and the SEBTm, respectively. For static balance, the significant models were for mediolateral velocity (R2 = 0.42 in OA; R2 = 0.24 in OC), anteroposterior velocity (R2 = 0.21 in OA; R2 = 0.27 in OC), and mean velocity (R2 = 0.27 in OA; R2 = 0.46 in OC), where the predictors of low performance were younger age, male sex, overweight/obese nutritional status, greater thickness of skin folds, less tendency to mesomorphy, and greater fat mass. On the other hand, for dynamic postural balance, the significant models were observed in the previous direction (R2 = 0.39), posteromedial (R2 = 0.57), and posterolateral (R2 = 0.56), where the variables that predict a low performance were low PAL, overweight/obese nutritional status, and high WHR. Overweight and obese children presented a deficit in static and dynamic postural balance, enhanced by variables such as gender, age, PAL, and anthropometric characteristics related to adiposity.",,This research was financed by the internal funds of the Academic Vice-Rector for Research and Postgraduate Studies of the Universidad Santo Tomás (Chile) (project number 113200024).,Behavioral Sciences,,,,2023-01-14,2023,2023-01-14,,13,1,73,All OA; Gold,Article,"Guzmán-Muñoz, Eduardo; Mendez-Rebolledo, Guillermo; Núñez-Espinosa, Cristián; Valdés-Badilla, Pablo; Monsalves-Álvarez, Matías; Delgado-Floody, Pedro; Herrera-Valenzuela, Tomás","Guzmán-Muñoz, Eduardo (Escuela de Kinesiología, Facultad de Salud, Universidad Santo Tomás, Talca 3480094, Chile; Escuela de Kinesiología, Facultad de Ciencias de la Salud, Universidad Autónoma de Chile, Talca 3480094, Chile); Mendez-Rebolledo, Guillermo (Escuela de Kinesiología, Facultad de Salud, Universidad Santo Tomás, Talca 3480094, Chile); Núñez-Espinosa, Cristián (Escuela de Medicina, Universidad de Magallanes, Punta Arenas 6200000, Chile; Centro Asistencial Docente y de Investigación, Universidad de Magallanes, Punta Arenas 6200000, Chile); Valdés-Badilla, Pablo (Departamento de Ciencias de la Actividad Física, Facultad de Ciencias de la Educación, Universidad Católica del Maule, Talca 3480094, Chile; Carrera de Entrenador Deportivo, Escuela de Educación.

Pretraining foundation models using self-supervised learning on electronic health records (EHR) may be effective in acquiring informative global patterns that can improve the robustness of task-specific models. The objective was to evaluate the utility of EHR foundation models in improving the in-distribution (ID) and out-of-distribution (OOD) performance of clinical prediction models. Transformer- and gated recurrent unit-based foundation models were pretrained on EHR of up to 1.8 M patients (382 M coded events) collected within pre-determined year groups (e.g., 2009–2012) and were subsequently used to construct patient representations for patients admitted to inpatient units. These representations were used to train logistic regression models to predict hospital mortality, long length of stay, 30-day readmission, and ICU admission. We compared our EHR foundation models with baseline logistic regression models learned on count-based representations (count-LR) in ID and OOD year groups. Performance was measured using area-under-the-receiver-operating-characteristic curve (AUROC), area-under-the-precision-recall curve, and absolute calibration error. Both transformer and recurrent-based foundation models generally showed better ID and OOD discrimination relative to count-LR and often exhibited less decay in tasks where there is observable degradation of discrimination performance (average AUROC decay of 3% for transformer-based foundation model vs. 7% for count-LR after 5–9 years). In addition, the performance and robustness of transformer-based foundation models continued to improve as pretraining set size increased. These results suggest that pretraining EHR foundation models at scale is a useful approach for developing clinical prediction models that perform well in the presence of temporal distribution shift.",,No external funding was received for the study.,Scientific Reports,,,Humans; Electric Power Supplies; Electronic Health Records; Hospital Mortality; Hospitalization,2023-03-07,2023,2023-03-07,,13,1,3767,All OA; Gold,Article,"Guo, Lin Lawrence; Steinberg, Ethan; Fleming, Scott Lanyon; Posada, Jose; Lemmon, Joshua; Pfohl, Stephen R.; Shah, Nigam; Fries, Jason; Sung, Lillian","Guo, Lin Lawrence (Program in Child Health Evaluative Sciences, The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, ON, Canada); Steinberg, Ethan (Stanford Center for Biomedical Informatics Research, Stanford University, Palo Alto, CA, USA); Fleming, Scott Lanyon (Stanford Center for Biomedical Informatics Research, Stanford University, Palo Alto, CA, USA); Posada, Jose (Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); Lemmon, Joshua (Program in Child Health Evaluative Sciences, The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, ON, Canada); Pfohl, Stephen R.

However, part of the carbon fixed returns to the atmosphere, and this is done through soil respiration. The present study seeks to quantify the total soil efflux (a subrogate of total soil respiration) that includes both autotrophic and heterotrophic soil efflux, emitted by a Panama's mangrove swamp, as well as to investigate what drivers are important. Firstly, 3 plots were established with predominant mangroves species, such as salty mangrove tree (Avicennia bicolor Standl.) and black mangrove tree (Avicennia germinans L.). Secondly, a forest inventory was carried out in one ha, resulting in 371 trees ha-1, where the salty mangrove tree prevailed with 219 individuals in front of the black mangrove tree, with 152 trees. In addition, tree level measurements were performed such as diameter at breast height (DBH), crown diameter and distance between trees. Third, using a Licor 6400XT infrared gas analyzer system and a meteorological tower, soil CO2 fluxes and air and soil temperature were measured respectively. Results showed a total of 33.61 t of CO2 ha-1 emitted by the soil of the mangrove in 3.5 months.","Declaration of competing interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper Acknowledgment We thank to MSc.

The quantitative component consisted of an analytical ecological design, where proportions, ratios, measures of central tendency and rates ratios, rate difference, Gini and concentration indices were calculated to measure inequalities. The qualitative component had a phenomenological and interpretive approach. One hundred thirty-one women died in Choco between 2010-2018. The Maternal Mortality Ratio was 224/100.000 live births. The Gini coefficient was 0.35, indicating inequality in the distribution of the number of MM with respect to live births. The health service offers have been concentrated in the private sector in urban areas (77%). The exercise of midwifery has played an important role in maternal and perinatal care processes, especially in territories where the State has been absent. Nevertheless, it occurs in complex circumstances such as the armed conflict, lack of transportation routes, and income deficits, affecting the timelines and care quality for these vulnerable groups. MM in Chocó has been a consequence of deficiencies in the health system and weaknesses in its infrastructure (absence of a high level of maternal-perinatal care). This is in addition to the territory's geographical characteristics, which increase vulnerability and health risks for women and their newborns. In Colombia, as well as in other countries, many maternal and newborn deaths are preventable because their causes are due to social injustices.","Special thanks are due to Manuela Mosquera, Director of Asoredipar Chocó, and Yalile Ricard and Silvia Quiroz of the Technological University of Chocó for their willingness and support for the materialization of this article.","This article was co-funded by the project “Exchange and transfer of formal, traditional and community knowledge for the improvement of maternal and perinatal health with a differential and intercultural approach”, derived from Contract 714–2018 made with the Ministry of Science and Technology of Colombia.

We evaluated tofacitinib efficacy and safety in the 52-week maintenance study, OCTAVE Sustain, by baseline Mayo endoscopic subscore (MES) following 8-week induction.MethodsThe proportion of patients achieving efficacy endpoints at Week 24 or 52 of OCTAVE Sustain was evaluated by baseline MES following 8-week induction. Using logistic regression, the difference in treatment effect (tofacitinib vs. placebo) between baseline MES (0 vs. 1) for each endpoint was assessed. Adverse events were evaluated.ResultsAt Week 52 of OCTAVE Sustain, a numerically higher proportion of tofacitinib-treated patients achieved remission with OCTAVE Sustain baseline MES of 0 versus 1 (61.9% vs. 36.5% for tofacitinib 5 mg twice daily [BID] and 75.0% vs. 54.2% for tofacitinib 10 mg BID). Similar trends were observed for endoscopic remission and endoscopic improvement. Logistic regression analyses showed a larger treatment effect at Week 52 in patients with baseline MES of 0 versus 1 for clinical response (p = 0.0306) in the tofacitinib 5 mg BID group (other endpoints all p > 0.05); differences were not significant for any endpoint in the 10 mg BID group (all p > 0.05). Infection adverse events were less frequent among patients with baseline MES 0 versus 1.ConclusionsMES may be important in predicting long-term efficacy outcomes for tofacitinib maintenance treatment. Aiming for endoscopic remission during induction with tofacitinib 10 mg BID may allow successful maintenance with tofacitinib 5 mg BID. Safety was consistent with the known tofacitinib safety profile.Trial registration NCT01458574.","The authors would like to thank the patients, investigators, and study teams who were involved in the tofacitinib UC program.

The diagnosis of Diabetes Mellitus supposes an impact for the patient, since it requires a modification in the lifestyle, which demands a great capacity for adaptation and modification of habits. The aim of the study was to determine whether personality factors and health status influence resilience and coping strategies in a sample of healthy and diabetic subjects.
Methodology: The sample included a total of 401 subjects (201 patients with Diabetes and 200 without pathology). The instruments applied for data collection were: Sociodemographic data questionnaire, the Resilience Scale, the Coping Strategies Questionnaire and The ""Big Five"" factor taxonomy. The data collection period was approximately 2 years (between February 2018 and January 2020).
Results: Certain personality factors, such as Emotional Stability, Integrity, Conscientiousness and Extraversion, were positively related to Resilience. Additionally, Emotional Stability, Integrity, and Extraversion were positively associated with Rational Coping. On the other hand, emotional stability, agreeableness and extraversion were negatively related to emotional coping. In relation to health status, the absence of pathology is related to the use of rational strategies more than to the diagnosis of diabetes. Therefore, the participants in this study present different psychological patterns depending on personality and health status.
Conclusions: The present study shows that the subjects of the sample present different psychological patterns depending on Personality and health status.",,,Frontiers in Public Health,,,"Humans; Healthy Volunteers; Adaptation, Psychological; Diabetes Mellitus; Health Status; Personality",2023-03-02,2023,2023-03-02,,11,,1074613,All OA; Gold,Article,"Rivera-Picón, Cristina; Benavente-Cuesta, María Hinojal; Quevedo-Aguado, María Paz; Juárez-Vela, Raúl; Martinez-Tofe, Jesús; Sánchez-González, Juan Luis; Rodríguez-Muñoz, Pedro Manuel","Rivera-Picón, Cristina (Faculty of Health Sciences, Nursing, Pontifical University of Salamanca, Salamanca, Spain); Benavente-Cuesta, María Hinojal (Faculty of Health Sciences, Nursing, Pontifical University of Salamanca, Salamanca, Spain); Quevedo-Aguado, María Paz (Faculty of Health Sciences, Nursing, Pontifical University of Salamanca, Salamanca, Spain); Juárez-Vela, Raúl (Nursing Department, Faculty of Health Sciences, Research Group GRUPAC, University of La Rioja, Logroño, Spain); Martinez-Tofe, Jesús (Nursing Department, Faculty of Health Sciences, Research Group GRUPAC, University of La Rioja, Logroño, Spain); Sánchez-González, Juan Luis (Faculty of Nursing and Physiotherapy, University of Salamanca, Salamanca, Spain); Rodríguez-Muñoz, Pedro Manuel (Faculty of Nursing and Physiotherapy, University of Salamanca, Salamanca, Spain; Department of Nursing, Instituto Maimónides de Investigación Biomédica de Córboda, Córdona, Spain)","Martinez-Tofe, Jesús (University of La Rioja)","Rivera-Picón, Cristina (Pontifical University of Salamanca); Benavente-Cuesta, María Hinojal (Pontifical University of Salamanca); Quevedo-Aguado, María Paz (Pontifical University of Salamanca); Juárez-Vela, Raúl (University of La Rioja); Martinez-Tofe, Jesús (University of La Rioja); Sánchez-González, Juan Luis (University of Salamanca); Rodríguez-Muñoz, Pedro Manuel (University of Salamanca; Department of Nursing, Instituto Maimónides de Investigación Biomédica de Córboda, Córdona, Spain)",2,2,,,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpubh.2023.1074613/pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1155874160,42 Health Sciences; 4203 Health Services and Systems,3 Good Health and Well Being

The association between empathy and age was estimated using regression equations and statistical significance of the regression coefficients, after evaluating the type of curve using variance analysis.
RESULTS: the underlying model of three dimensions of empathy was identified. The values of the descriptive statistics observed were relatively low in empathy and its dimensions. Empathy levels were not associated with the age range. No differences in empathy were found between the types of work schedules. Variability was found in the dimensions: ""compassionate care"" and ""Walking on the patient's shoes"".
CONCLUSION: these results show that the levels of empathy observed may imply a deficient performance in empathetic care for patients. (1) The levels of empathy are low in the nursing professionals studied. (2) These levels are not associated with age and type of work performed. (3) Low levels of empathy could imply a negative alteration of humanized attention.",,,Revista Latino-Americana de Enfermagem,,,"Humans; Empathy; Cross-Sectional Studies; Hospitals, Public; Health Personnel; Nurses; Surveys and Questionnaires",2023-12,2023,2023-12,,31,,e3968,All OA; Gold,Article,"Pontón, Yolanda Dávila; Narváez, Víctor Patricio Díaz; Andrade, Bernardo Montero; Terán, Joseline Janeth López; Reyes-Reyes, Alejandro; Calzadilla-Núñez, Aracelis","Pontón, Yolanda Dávila (Universidad del Azuay, Facultad de Medicina, Cuenca, Ecuador., Universidad del Azuay, Facultad de Medicina, Cuenca, Ecuador); Narváez, Víctor Patricio Díaz (Universidad Andres Bello, Facultad de Odontología, Santiago, Región Metropolitana, Chile., Universidad Andres Bello, Facultad de Odontología, Santiago, Región Metropolitana, Chile); Andrade, Bernardo Montero (Universidad del Azuay, Facultad de Medicina, Cuenca, Ecuador., Universidad del Azuay, Facultad de Medicina, Cuenca, Ecuador); Terán, Joseline Janeth López (Universidad del Azuay, Facultad de Medicina, Cuenca, Ecuador., Universidad del Azuay, Facultad de Medicina, Cuenca, Ecuador); Reyes-Reyes, Alejandro (Universidad Santo Tomás, Facultad de Ciencias Sociales y Comunicación, Concepción, Región del Bío Bio, Chile., Universidad Santo Tomás, Facultad de Ciencias Sociales y Comunicación, Concepción, Región del Bío Bio, Chile); Calzadilla-Núñez, Aracelis (Universidad Bernardo O’Higgins, Departamento de Investigaciones, Santiago, Región Metropolitana, Chile., Universidad Bernardo O’Higgins, Departamento de Investigaciones, Santiago, Región Metropolitana, Chile)","Narváez, Víctor Patricio Díaz (Andrés Bello National University)","Pontón, Yolanda Dávila (University of Azuay); Narváez, Víctor Patricio Díaz (Andrés Bello National University); Andrade, Bernardo Montero (University of Azuay); Terán, Joseline Janeth López (University of Azuay); Reyes-Reyes, Alejandro (Universidad Santo Tomás); Calzadilla-Núñez, Aracelis (Universidad Bernardo O'Higgins)",2,2,,,https://www.scielo.br/j/rlae/a/8FkSJ6JkWg58PxTBYQn8RTw/?lang=es&format=pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1163040558,42 Health Sciences; 4203 Health Services and Systems; 4205 Nursing,

This study evaluated the capacity of the peptidoglycan obtained from the CRL1505 strain (PG-Lr1505) to modulate the immuno-coagulative response triggered by the viral pathogen-associated molecular pattern poly(I:C) in the respiratory tract. Adult BALB/c mice were nasally treated with PG-Lr1505 for two days. Treated and untreated control mice were then nasally challenged with poly(I:C). Mice received three doses of poly(I:C) with a 24 h rest period between each administration. The immuno-coagulative response was studied after the last administration of poly(I:C). The challenge with poly(I:C) significantly increased blood and respiratory pro-inflammatory mediators, decreased prothrombin activity (PT), and increased von Willebrand factor (vWF) levels in plasma. Furthermore, tissue factor (TF), tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI), and thrombomodulin (TM) expressions were increased in the lungs. PG-Lr1505-treated mice showed significant modulation of hemostatic parameters in plasma (PT in %, Control = 71.3 ± 3.8, PG-Lr1505 = 94.0 ± 4.0, p < 0.01) and lungs. Moreover, PG-Lr1505-treated mice demonstrated reduced TF in F4/80 cells from lungs, higher pro-inflammatory mediators, and increased IL-10 compared to poly(I:C) control mice (IL-10 in pg/mL, Control = 379.1 ± 12.1, PG-Lr1505 = 483.9 ± 11.3, p < 0.0001). These changes induced by PG-Lr1505 correlated with a significant reduction in lung tissue damage. Complementary in vitro studies using Raw 264.7 cells confirmed the beneficial effect of PG-Lr1505 on poly(I:C)-induced inflammation, since increased IL-10 expression, as well as reduced damage, production of inflammatory mediators, and hemostatic parameter expressions were observed. In addition, protease-activated receptor-1 (PAR1) activation in lungs and Raw 264.7 cells was observed after TLR3 stimulation, which was differentially modulated by PG-Lr1505. The peptidoglycan from L. rhamnosus CRL1505 is able to regulate inflammation, the procoagulant state, and PAR1 activation in mice and macrophages in the context of the activation of TLR3 signaling pathways, contributing to a beneficial modulation of inflammation-hemostasis crosstalk.",,"This study was supported by the grants ANPCyT-FONCyT PICT-2021-I-A-00705 to J.V. and Fundación Alberto J.

A previous study in a Southern region reported one of the highest prevalences of dementia in Latin America.
Objective: To investigate the prevalence of mild cognitive impairment associated with low education, rurality, and demographic characteristics.
Methods: A cross-sectional study recruited a community-dwelling sample of 823 adults from rural and urban areas of two Southern provinces of Colombia from 2020-2022. Participants were assessed with a neuropsychological protocol validated in Colombia. To obtain general and region-specific prevalence rates, age, sex, schooling, and socioeconomic level were considered and controlled for.
Results: Most of the participants reported low education and socioeconomic level, the participation of women was higher. It was determined that the prevalence of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) was 53.6%, with 56.6% in the province of Caquetá followed by 51.9% in the province of Huila. The amnestic MCI represented 42.6%, the amnestic multi-domain was 39%, the non-amnestic 16.55%, and the non-amnestic multi-domain 1.81%. Our participants reported comorbidities such as diabetes and hypertension. We also observed a relationship between exposure to pesticides and MCI.
Conclusions: We observed one of the highest prevalences of MCI in Latin America reported to date. Variables such as age, gender, and education proved risk factors for MCI in the explored regions. Our findings are very much in line with recent studies that highlight the influence of non-canonical risk factors of dementia in underrepresented countries from Latin America.","We thank the older adults for their participation and willingness to carry out the research, the community clubs of Huila and Caquetá.","This work was supported by The Science, Technology, and Innovation Fund- Huila of the General System of Royalties through the Ministry of Science, Technology, and Innovation of Colombia [BPIN 2020000100011] Universidad Surcolombiana and Universidad de la Amazonia, and [CONADI - Universidad Cooperativa de Colombia in agreement with Universidad Surcolombiana] under Grant [INV2384].",Journal of Alzheimer's Disease Reports,,,,2023-12-29,2023,2023-12-29,,7,1,1455-1464,All OA; Gold,Article,"Bonilla-Santos, Jasmin; González-Hernández, Alfredis; Cala-Martínez, Dorian Yisela; Gómez-Morales, Duván Fernando; Calceto-Garavito, Laura Natalia; Forero-Aldana, Arnulfo Eduardo; González-Montealegre, Rodrigo Alberto; Cumaco, Yeing Alexandra Cardona; Rojas-Bernal, Luz Angela; Zabaleta-Orozco, Mario Alberto; Parra, Mario Alfredo","Bonilla-Santos, Jasmin (Department of Psychology, Universidad Cooperativa de Colombia, Neiva, Colombia; Neurocognition and Psychophysiology Laboratory, Universidad Surcolombiana, Neiva, Colombia); González-Hernández, Alfredis (Department of Psychology, Universidad Surcolombiana, Neiva, Colombia); Cala-Martínez, Dorian Yisela (Department of Psychology, Universidad Cooperativa de Colombia, Neiva, Colombia; Neurocognition and Psychophysiology Laboratory, Universidad Surcolombiana, Neiva, Colombia); Gómez-Morales, Duván Fernando (Department of Psychology, Universidad Surcolombiana, Neiva, Colombia); Calceto-Garavito, Laura Natalia (Neurocognition and Psychophysiology Laboratory, Universidad Surcolombiana, Neiva, Colombia); Forero-Aldana, Arnulfo Eduardo (Neurocognition and Psychophysiology Laboratory, Universidad de la Amazonía, Florencia, Caquetá, Colombia); González-Montealegre, Rodrigo Alberto (Neurocognition and Psychophysiology Laboratory, Universidad Surcolombiana, Neiva, Colombia); Cumaco, Yeing Alexandra Cardona (Department of Psychology, Universidad de la Amazonía, Florencia, Caquetá, Colombia); Rojas-Bernal, Luz Angela (Instituto del cerebro, Hospital Universitario Mayor Méderi, Universidad del Rosario, Bogotá, Colombia; Clinical Neuropsychology, Universidad Surcolombiana, Neiva, Colombia); Zabaleta-Orozco, Mario Alberto (Hernando Moncaleano University Hospital, Neiva, Colombia); Parra, Mario Alfredo (Department of Psychological Sciences and Health, University of Strathclyde, Glasgow, UK)","González-Hernández, Alfredis (South Colombian University); Parra, Mario Alfredo (University of Strathclyde)","Bonilla-Santos, Jasmin (Cooperative University of Colombia; South Colombian University); González-Hernández, Alfredis (South Colombian University); Cala-Martínez, Dorian Yisela (Cooperative University of Colombia; South Colombian University); Gómez-Morales, Duván Fernando (South Colombian University); Calceto-Garavito, Laura Natalia (South Colombian University); Forero-Aldana, Arnulfo Eduardo (University of the Amazon); González-Montealegre, Rodrigo Alberto (South Colombian University); Cumaco, Yeing Alexandra Cardona (University of the Amazon); Rojas-Bernal, Luz Angela (Universidad del Rosario; South Colombian University); Zabaleta-Orozco, Mario Alberto (Hernando Moncaleano University Hospital, Neiva, Colombia); Parra, Mario Alfredo (University of Strathclyde)",0,0,,,https://content.iospress.com:443/download/journal-of-alzheimers-disease-reports/adr230041?id=journal-of-alzheimers-disease-reports%2Fadr230041,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1167519693,42 Health Sciences; 4203 Health Services and Systems,4 Quality Education

(2) Methods: Data from the third wave of the Children's Worlds Project was used, which was collected by administering self-report measures to representative samples in each country. The sample was composed of 4008 early adolescents from Brazil (22.1%, n = 886), Chile (22.8%, n = 913) and Spain (55.1%, n = 2209). The mean age of the sample was 10.17 years (SD = 0.57), and 51.7% were girls. (3) Results: In terms of subjective happiness, moderate to high means were observed, with higher scores in boys and the Spanish sample. The results showed some differences in leisure time activities among children from Brazil, Chile and Spain. Furthermore, the results highlighted the importance of relaxation time with the family to promote happiness in pre-adolescence across genders and countries. Additionally, playing outdoors and doing homework were also found to be protective factors for subjective happiness. (4) Conclusions: In Brazil, Chile and Spain the most consistent result was the positive effect of spending time relaxing with the family on subjective happiness.","The data used in this publication come from the third wave of Children’s Worlds project: An international survey of children’s lives and well-being (www.isciweb.org, accessed on 1 April 2023).

The objective of this research was to analyze the eating habits (EH), physical activity (PA), and sleep quality (SQ) of older adults in the rural parish of San José de Minas in Quito, Ecuador. Three validated questionnaires were used: the Pittsburgh PSQI for SQ, IPAQ for PA, and frequency of consumption for EH. The results revealed high consumption of refined flours and sugar (70% at least once a day), low intake of whole grains, fish, and olive oil, and considerable consumption of fruits and water. Fifty percent of respondents engage in moderate physical activity and 24% in low physical activity, while 90% of older adults have poor sleep quality. These results indicate a problem in the integral health of the population that does not allow older adults to have a good old age. Health campaigns should be developed to increase physical activity, encourage a better diet, and thus, improve the quality of sleep.","The authors would like to thank the Universidad Iberoamericana del Ecuador (UNIBE) and the Decentralized Autonomous Government (GAD) of the parish San José de Minas, for all the support in carrying out this study.

The review shows significant gaps in academic publications, particularly because health was mostly a secondary theme examined in the studies. The few studies about governmental interventions (e.g., policies and programs) suggest that these have not been effective. Regarding public engagement, no studies examined social media engagement with health and climate change, and only one examined news coverage. Finally, most articles focused primarily on individual countries, with few comparative or regional analyses of South America.

MATERIALS AND METHODS.: An analytical cross-sectional study was conducted in 33 municipal markets of the 14 departmental capitals of El Salvador. The sample consisted of 256 out of 456 possible market stalls. A sample of chicken meat was obtained from each market stall. The microbiological analysis was conducted at the National Public Health Laboratory. Frequencies, percentages, measures of central tendency and association were calculated with SPSS version 21.
RESULTS.: Escherichia coli was found in 74% of the samples, Staphylococcus aureus in 24% and Salmonella spp. in 1%. The presence of Salmonella spp. was associated with not using hand sanitizer and not using towels for drying the hands. S. aureus was associated with the use of personal accessories and improper storage. The presence of S. aureus was associated with the lack of hand washing, not using a towel to dry the hands and not wearing an apron.
CONCLUSION.: The hygienic-sanitary conditions of the handlers and the market stalls were associated with microbiological contamination of chicken meat marketed in El Salvador.","Marieta Solani Rivera Corona, Senior Specialist, Department of Food Analysis for Human Consumption, National Laboratory of Food Hygiene, for her contribution to the technical review of the manuscript.

Therefore, the aim of the present study was to evaluate the factors associated with knowledge of pharmacological management of pregnant women in dental students of a Peruvian university located in the capital and province.MethodsThis analytical, cross-sectional, prospective and observational study assessed 312 Peruvian dental students from third to fifth year of study between February and April 2022. A validated questionnaire of 10 closed questions was used to measure knowledge about pharmacological management in pregnant women. A logit model was used to assess the influence of the variables: gender, age, year of study, marital status, place of origin and area of residence. A significance of p < 0.05 was considered.ResultsThe 25.96, 55.13 and 18.91% of the dental students showed poor, fair and good knowledge about pharmacological management in pregnant women; respectively. In addition, it was observed that students under 24 years of age and those from the capital were significantly (p < 0.05) 44% less likely to have poor knowledge of pharmacological management in pregnant women compared to those aged 24 years or older (OR = 0.56; CI: 0.34–0.92) and those from the province (OR = 0.56; CI: 0.32–0.98); respectively. Finally, those in their third and fourth year of study were significantly three times more likely to have poor knowledge (OR = 3.17; CI: 1.68–5.97 and OR = 3.88; CI: 2.07–7.31; respectively) compared to fifth year dental students.ConclusionThe knowledge of dental students about pharmacological management in pregnant women was predominantly of fair level. In addition, it was observed that being under 24 years of age and being from the capital city were protective factors against poor knowledge, while being a third- and fourth-year student was a risk factor. Finally, gender, marital status and area of residence were not influential factors in the level of knowledge.","We thank the Social Responsibility team of the San Juan Bautista Private University, Academic Program of Stomatology, Lima and Ica, Peru, for their constant support in the preparation of this manuscript.",Self-financed.,BMC Medical Education,,,"Humans; Female; Pregnancy; Young Adult; Adult; Pregnant Women; Logistic Models; Students, Dental; Peru; Cross-Sectional Studies; Prospective Studies; Surveys and Questionnaires; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice",2023-02-04,2023,2023-02-04,,23,1,89,All OA; Gold,Article,"Flores-Montalvo, Elizabeth; Córdova-Limaylla, Nancy; Ladera-Castañeda, Marysela; López-Gurreonero, Carlos; Echavarría-Gálvez, Alí; Cornejo-Pinto, Alberto; Cervantes-Ganoza, Luis; Cayo-Rojas, César","Flores-Montalvo, Elizabeth (Universidad Privada San Juan Bautista, School of Stomatology, Av.

We aimed to systematically review guidelines, and reports of practice and to analyze associations between timing of CC and mother-to-neonate SARS-CoV-2 transmission during the early phases of the pandemic.
METHODS: Major databases were searched from December 1, 2019, to July 20, 2021.
INCLUSION: studies and guidelines describing CC practice in women with SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy until 2 postnatal days, giving birth to live-born neonates.
EXCLUSION: no extractable data. Two reviewers independently screened studies for eligibility and assessed study quality. Pooled prevalence rates were calculated.
RESULTS: Forty-eight studies (1476 neonates) and 40 guidelines were included. Delayed CC was recommended in 70.0% of the guidelines. Nevertheless, delayed CC was reported less often than early CC: 262/1476 (17.8%) vs 511/1476 (34.6%). Neonatal SARS-CoV-2 positivity rates were similar following delayed (1.2%) and early CC (1.3%). Most SARS-CoV-2 transmissions (93.3%) occurred in utero.
CONCLUSION: Delayed CC did not seem to increase mother-to-neonate SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Due to its benefits, it should be encouraged even in births where the mother has a SARS-CoV-2 infection.

The research was conducted by the psychology department of a reproductive health institution in Mexico City. The objective was to know the relation between marital satisfaction/dissatisfaction and gender roles, self-esteem, the types of coping strategies and the types of violence perceived from the partner. It was a nonexperimental, retrospective, cross-sectional study of two samples-one of women and one of men-classified by marital satisfaction or dissatisfaction. The nonprobability quota sampling included 208 participants: 104 women and 104 men. Comparisons, correlations and a discriminant analysis were made to identify the most significant variables. Women with marital dissatisfaction perceived blackmail, psychological violence and humiliation/devaluation from their partner; they preferably adopt a submissive gender role and use escape/avoidance as a coping strategy, and so do the men with marital dissatisfaction, who also perceived blackmail, control and psychological violence from their partner; they have low self-esteem, and they preferably adopt a submissive gender role. Isolating factors will allow for more specificity in terms of psychological care at health institutions as well as avoiding gender biases and preventing an increase of violence in couples.",We thank the National Institute of Perinatology for the facilities for this study.,This research received no external funding.,Healthcare,,"Isabel Cuadrado-Gordillo, Parra Guadalupe Martín-Mora, Walter R.

Given the molecular diversity characteristic of each cellular phenotype, the possible cytopathic, tissue and clinical effects are difficult to predict, which determines the heterogeneity of COVID-19 symptoms. The purpose of this article is to provide a comprehensive review of the cytopathic effects of SARS-CoV-2 on various cell types, focusing on the development of COVID-19, which in turn may lead, in some patients, to a persistence of symptoms after recovery from the disease, a condition known as long COVID. We describe the molecular mechanisms underlying virus-host interactions, including alterations in protein expression, intracellular signaling pathways, and immune responses. In particular, the article highlights the potential impact of these cytopathies on cellular function and clinical outcomes, such as immune dysregulation, neuropsychiatric disorders, and organ damage. The article concludes by discussing future directions for research and implications for the management and treatment of COVID-19 and long COVID.","We thank the Fundación Carolina, Universidad Simón Bolívar, Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation of Colombia and Integrated Territorial Investment (ITI), Junta de Andalucía for facilitating the resources for article publication.

Thus far, there have been several records of mycovirus infection in Colletotrichum spp., primarily by viruses of the Partitiviridae family. There have also been records of infections by mycoviruses of the Chrysoviridae family. Mycoviruses are (+)ssRNA and dsRNA genome viruses, which may or may not be enveloped. To date, no mycovirus with a DNA genome has been isolated from Colletotrichum spp. Typically, mycoviruses cause latent infections, although hypo- and hypervirulence have also been reported in Colletotrichum spp. In addition to its effects on pathogenic behavior, mycovirus infection can lead to important physiological changes, such as altered morphological characteristics, reduced vegetative growth, and suppressed conidia production. Therefore, research on mycoviruses infecting phytopathogenic fungi can help develop alternative methods to chemical control, which can cause irreversible damage to humans and the environment. From an agricultural perspective, mycoviruses can contribute to sustainable agriculture as biological control agents via changes in fungal physiology, ultimately resulting in the total loss of or reduction in the virulence of these pathogens.","This study was financed by the Coordination for the Improvement of Higher Education Personnel (CAPES), Brazil, (financing Code 001) and the Foundation of Research Support of Amazonas State (FAPEAM 002/2018 – UNIVERSAL AMAZONAS).

The study aimed to generate evidence of the validity of the mental and physical health symptomatology scale in two samples of vulnerable groups: emerging university adults, who report high levels of mental health problems, and migrants, who report high levels of physical and mental health problems. Using non-probability sampling, in the first study, evidence of construct validity of the scale was reported in 652 emerging adults and, in the second, evidence of validity was provided from associations with the depression, stress and anxiety scale (DASS-21) among 283 migrants. The results indicate that in Study 1 the two-factor model had adequate indicators of fit and adequate reliability; only the mental health factor presented evidence of convergent validity. In Study 2, the mental health factor showed positive and large associations with the DASS-21, which decreased when the physical health symptoms factor was considered. These analyses provide evidence of validity for the scale, which is an easy-to-use instrument that allows for the assessment of health from an integral perspective.",The authors would like to thank all the participants who responded to the survey.,This research was funded by Agencia Nacional de Investigación y Desarrollo (ANID) through the program Fondecyt Iniciación Grant No. 11200984 and Grant No. 11181020.

Symptoms of anaemia include fatigue and weakness, among others, affecting health and quality of life. Anaemic pregnant women have an increased risk of premature delivery, a low-birthweight infant, and postpartum depression. They are also more likely to have anaemia in the postpartum period which can lead to an ongoing condition and affect subsequent pregnancies. In 2019 nearly 37% of pregnant women globally had anaemia, and estimates suggest that 50–80% of postpartum women in low- and middle-income countries have anaemia, but currently there is no standard measurement or classification for postpartum anaemia.MethodsA rapid landscape review was conducted to identify and characterize postpartum anaemia measurement searching references within three published systematic reviews of anaemia, including studies published between 2012 and 2021. We then conducted a new search for relevant literature from February 2021 to April 2022 in EMBASE and MEDLINE using a similar search strategy as used in the published reviews.ResultsIn total, we identified 53 relevant studies. The timing of haemoglobin measurement ranged from within the immediate postpartum period to over 6 weeks. The thresholds used to diagnose anaemia in postpartum women varied considerably, with < 120, < 110, < 100 and < 80 g/L the most frequently reported. Other laboratory results frequently reported included ferritin and transferrin receptor. Clinical outcomes reported in 32 out of 53 studies included postpartum depression, quality of life, and fatigue. Haemoglobin measurements were performed in a laboratory, although it is unclear from the studies if venous samples and automatic analysers were used in all cases.ConclusionsThis review demonstrates the need for improving postpartum anaemia measurement given the variability observed in published measures. With the high prevalence of anaemia, the relatively simple treatment for non-severe cases of iron deficiency anaemia, and its importance to public health with multi-generational effects, it is crucial to develop common measures for women in the postpartum period and promote rapid uptake and reporting.","The authors thank Vaibhav Patwardhan, Research Officer, Jhpiego India country office for assistance with formatting references.","This work received support from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation as part of the Mother and Newborn Information for Tracking Outcomes and Results (MoNITOR) Advisory Group.

A literature search was conducted across four databases (Psychology and Behavioral (EBSCO), Scopus, Web of Science and PubMed). The PRISMA guidelines were followed. The PEDro scale and Cochrane risk of bias tool were used to assess the quality of and risk of bias in the studies, respectively. The protocol was registered in PROSPERO (code: CRD42022319239). The outcomes were muscle strength, cardiorespiratory fitness, postural balance and gait speed. From 610 records initially found, 10 were finally included in the systematic review, involving 354 older people with a mean age of 67.3 years. Nine of them reported significant changes in at least one variable related to physical performance in the intervention compared to the control groups. The neuromuscular training caused significant improvements in postural balance, flexibility, cardiorespiratory fitness, strength power of the upper and lower limbs and autonomy. The available evidence indicates that neuromuscular training has a positive effect on some variables of physical performance, especially in postural balance; however, the methodological quality and certainty of the evidence in the available literature are limited.

In light of this and based on a survey, this research seeks to examine how and why work-related stress impacts the life satisfaction level of university junior faculty members. The results indicate that the three subdivisions of university faculty members' work-related stress, namely, research stress, teaching stress, and administrative stress, are all negatively related to their life satisfaction level. In addition, emotional burnout has been confirmed to function as the psychological mechanism for the aforementioned main effects.

The main objective of the study is to assess the effectiveness of CRDPT in detecting HDP.
Methods: This is a systemic review and meta-analysis of published studies on the effectiveness of CRDPT in the detection of HDP. The study was conducted in line with the PRISMA-DTA guidelines. The PICOS framework was used to search for relevant articles using Medline, PubMed, Google Scholar, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library databases. The articles were screened against a set of inclusion and exclusion criteria and analysed using the Review Manager 5.4 software.
Results: A title, abstract and full article screening was conducted on 18,153 potential articles based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria. The screening yielded five articles for meta-analysis. The total number of normotensive pregnant women (n = 3,380) in the included studies was five times higher than the total number of women with pre-eclampsia (n = 535). A difference between the HDP and normotensive group was noted. This is indicated by a significantly decreased in the effectiveness of CRDPT in detecting HDP as compared to normotensive group [Risk Ratio (RR) = 6.32 (2.17, 18.43) p < 0.00001]. The included studies had a high nature of heterogeneity (I 2 = 98%, p < 0.00001) partially due to different study designs included in the analysis and different regions where studies were conducted given that none of these studies were conducted in African countries where HDP is prominent.
Conclusions: According to results generated from 5 studies in this meta-analysis, it was found that CRDPT might not be effective in the detection of hypertensive disorder of pregnancy. Moreover, more research, especially in African women where hypertensive disorders of pregnancy are prevalent, are re-quired to ascertain these findings.

In Latin American countries, Colombia is historically one of the most affected by epidemics of this flavivirus. The underreporting of signs and symptoms of probable cases of dengue, the lack of characterization of the serotypes of the infection, and the few detailed studies of postmortem necropsies of patients are among other conditions that have delayed progress in the knowledge of the pathogenesis of the disease. This study presents the results of fragment sequencing assays on paraffin-embedded tissue samples from fatal DENV cases during the 2010 epidemic in Colombia. We found that the predominant serotype was DENV-2, with the Asian/American genotype of lineages 1 and 2. This work is one of the few reports of the circulating genotypes of dengue during the 2010 epidemic in Colombia, one of the most lethal dates in the country's history.",Authors thank the INS and Minciencias for the financial support.,"The present study was funded by Instituto Nacional de Salud (INS), Grupo de Morfología Celular, and the Colombian Department of Science, Technology, and Innovation, Minciencias contract 757 project 2013.",Virology Journal,,,Humans; Dengue Virus; Dengue; Paraffin; Genotype; Phylogeny; Serogroup,2023-05-25,2023,2023-05-25,,20,1,100,All OA; Gold,Article,"Rivera, Jorge Alonso; Rengifo, Aura Caterine; Rosales-Munar, Alicia; Díaz-Herrera, Taylor H.; Ciro, José Usme; Parra, Edgar; Alvarez-Díaz, Diego A.; Laiton-Donato, Katherine; Caldas, María Leonor","Rivera, Jorge Alonso (Dirección de investigación en Salud Pública, Grupo de Morfología Celular, Instituto Nacional de Salud, Avenue 26 No. 51-20 – Zone 6 CAN, Bogotá, Colombia); Rengifo, Aura Caterine (Dirección de investigación en Salud Pública, Grupo de Morfología Celular, Instituto Nacional de Salud, Avenue 26 No. 51-20 – Zone 6 CAN, Bogotá, Colombia); Rosales-Munar, Alicia (Dirección de investigación en Salud Pública, Grupo de Morfología Celular, Instituto Nacional de Salud, Avenue 26 No. 51-20 – Zone 6 CAN, Bogotá, Colombia); Díaz-Herrera, Taylor H.

The dataset is named WyoFlex sEMG Hand Gesture and recorded the data of 28 participants between 18 and 37 years old without neuromuscular diseases or cardiovascular problems. The test protocol consisted of sEMG signals acquisition corresponding to ten wrist and grasping movements (extension, flexion, ulnar deviation, radial deviation, hook grip, power grip, spherical grip, precision grip, lateral grip, and pinch grip), considering three repetitions for each gesture. Also, the dataset contains general information such as anthropometric measures of the upper limb, gender, age, laterally of the person, and physical condition. Likewise, the implemented acquisition system consists of a portable armband with four sEMG channels distributed equidistantly for each forearm. The database could be used for the recognition of hand gestures, evaluation of the evolution of patients in rehabilitation processes, control of upper limb orthoses or prostheses, and biomechanical analysis of the forearm.","The authors thank the Instituto Politécnico Nacional for the support provided by the grants SIP20221151, SIP20221150, SIP20231089, SIP20231293, SIP20231030 and SIP20231089.

Objectives: To determine sociodemographic, labor, sanitary, and environmental conditions that influence the prevalence of food poisoning in informal workers in downtown Medellín, Colombia.
Methods: This is a cross-sectional study using a workers' survey as the primary source. A total of 686 workers aged ≥18 years who had been working for ≥ 5 years were surveyed. An assisted survey was initially applied as a pilot test for training purposes and to obtain informed consent.
Results: We identified several associations and explanatory factors of food poisoning using chi-square tests and prevalence ratios, with unadjusted and adjusted 95% confidence intervals (95%CI). A higher prevalence of food poisoning (p < 0.05) was observed in workers with lower frequency of waste collection (PR = 2.09; 95%CI = 1.04-4.19), who left cooked food (PR = 6.40; 95%CI = 2.34-17.8), beverages or chopped fruits uncovered at their workplace (PR = 3.92; 95%CI = 1.40-10.48), with inadequate waste management (PR = 4.84; 95%CI = 2.12-11.06), exposure to polluted water (PR = 3.00; 95%CI = 1.20-7.50) and acceptable water supply (PR = 5.40; 95%CI = 1.60-17.8). The factors that explained higher rates of food poisoning were not having a waste collection service (PRadjusted = 5.58; 95%CI = 3.38-13.10), inadequate waste management (PRadjusted = 6.61; 95%CI = 1.25-34.84), and having sanitary services next to worker's stall (PRadjusted = 14.44; 95%CI = 1.26-165.11).
Conclusions: The conditions that are associated with and explain the higher prevalence of food poisoning in this working population can be addressed with health promotion and disease prevention interventions.","We thank informal street vendors in downtown Medellín who participated in this research.

The few studies that focused on Northern Nigeria mostly examined individual correlates, but largely ignored the community correlates. Also, the persistence of armed insurgencies in the region calls for more research attention. This study examines the utilization and the associated individual and community factors of insecticide-treated nets in Northern Nigeria.MethodsThe study adopted a cross-sectional design. Data were extracted from the 2021 Nigeria Malaria Indicator Survey (NMIS). A weighted sample size of 6873 women was analysed. The outcome variable was the utilization of insecticide-treated nets. The explanatory variables selected at the individual/household level were maternal age, maternal education, parity, religion, sex of head of household, household wealth, and household size. The variables selected at the community level were the type of place of residence, geo-political zone of residence, the proportion of children under five who slept under a bed net, the proportion of women aged 15–49 who heard malaria media messages, and the community literacy level. Two variables, namely, the number of mosquito bed nets in the household, and the number of rooms used for sleeping were included for statistical control. Three multilevel mixed-effect regression models were fitted.ResultsThe majority of childbearing women (71.8%) utilized insecticide-treated nets. Parity and household size were the significant individual/household characteristics associated with the utilization of insecticide-treated nets. The proportion of under-five children in the community who slept under mosquito bed nets, and the geopolitical zone of residence were significant community correlates of the use of insecticide-treated nets. In addition, the number of rooms for sleeping, and the number of mosquito bed nets in the households were significantly associated with the utilization of insecticide-treated nets.ConclusionParity, household size, number of sleeping rooms, number of treated bed nets, geo-political zone of residence, and proportion of under-five children sleeping under bed nets are important associated factors of the utilization of insecticide-treated nets in Northern Nigeria. Existing malaria preventive initiatives should be strengthened to target these characteristics.",The authors express gratitude to MEASURE DHS and National Malaria Elimination Programme (Nigeria) for granting permission to access the 2021 NMIS datasets.,Not applicable.,Malaria Journal,,,Female; Humans; Pregnancy; Cross-Sectional Studies; Family Characteristics; Insecticide-Treated Bednets; Insecticides; Malaria; Mosquito Control; Nigeria; Adolescent; Young Adult; Adult; Middle Aged,2023-06-16,2023,2023-06-16,,22,1,184,All OA; Gold,Article,"Solanke, Bola Lukman; Soladoye, Daniel Alabi; Birsirka, Ibrahim Adamu; Abdurraheem, Anifat; Salau, Omowumi Romoke","Solanke, Bola Lukman (Department of Demography and Social Statistics, Obafemi Awolowo University, Ile-Ife, Nigeria); Soladoye, Daniel Alabi (Department of Demography and Social Statistics, Obafemi Awolowo University, Ile-Ife, Nigeria); Birsirka, Ibrahim Adamu (Department of Sociology, Bayero University, Kano, Nigeria); Abdurraheem, Anifat (Department of Sociology, Federal University, Dutsin-ma, Nigeria); Salau, Omowumi Romoke (Department of Clinical Nursing Services, UHD Trust, Royal Bournemouth Dorset, Bournemouth, UK)","Solanke, Bola Lukman (Obafemi Awolowo University)","Solanke, Bola Lukman (Obafemi Awolowo University); Soladoye, Daniel Alabi (Obafemi Awolowo University); Birsirka, Ibrahim Adamu (Bayero University Kano); Abdurraheem, Anifat (Federal University Dutsin-Ma); Salau, Omowumi Romoke (Department of Clinical Nursing Services, UHD Trust, Royal Bournemouth Dorset, Bournemouth, UK)",2,2,,,https://malariajournal.biomedcentral.com/counter/pdf/10.1186/s12936-023-04620-4,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1159886402,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3207 Medical Microbiology,3 Good Health and Well Being

Escherichia coli is a commensal bacterium of the gut microbiota in humans and animals; however, some strains cause infections and are resistant to antibiotics. One of the most common ways of acquiring pathogenic E. coli strains is through food. This review analyzes multidrug-resistant E. coli isolated from food, emphasizing Latin America and Mexico, and the mobile genetic elements (MGEs) responsible for spreading antibiotic resistance determinants among bacteria in different environments and hosts. We conducted a systematic search of the literature published from 2015 to 2022 in open access databases and electronic repositories. The prevalence of 11 E. coli pathotypes was described, with diarrheagenic E. coli pathotypes being the most frequently associated with foodborne illness in different Latin American countries, highlighting the presence of different antibiotic resistance genes mostly carried by IncF-type plasmids or class 1 integrons. Although the global incidence of foodborne illness is high, there have been few studies in Mexico and Latin America, which highlights the need to generate updated epidemiological data from the ""One Health"" approach, which allows monitoring of the multidrug-resistance phenomenon in E. coli from a common perspective in the interaction of human, veterinary, and environmental health.",The authors would like to thank Pepper St. Clair and Sage Chavez from the Department of Biology and Chemistry at California State University Monterey Bay for native English editing.,"This work was supported by the Consejo Nacional de Humanidades, Ciencias y Tecnologías (CONAHCYT) [Grant: CB-2017-2018/A1-S-22136].

This study aims to analyze the level of anxiety, as well as coping strategies, among the health personnel in Latin American countries and Spain. An exploratory, descriptive, quantitative, cross-sectional study was conducted with 584 participants from the healthcare population. No significant differences were observed in anxiety levels due to COVID-19 between Latin American countries and Spain. In Spain, an active and passive coping style is used, while in Latin American countries, an avoidance coping style is employed; there is a direct correlation between anxiety levels and the avoidance coping style. There exists an inverse correlation between anxiety levels and the use of an active coping style; moreover, there are no significant differences in the anxiety level of health personnel depending on whether they have cared for patients with COVID-19. Low cognitive activity, use of the avoidance method and Spanish geography were the main predictive coping styles of anxiety.

Our objective was to analyze the living conditions and the psychosocial sphere of older adult people living in extreme poverty in Requena del Tapiche in Peru. This was an observational, descriptive, cross-sectional study. Sixty participants between 60 and 100 years of age of both sexes were included who gave their informed consent. Sociodemographic variables were analyzed, and the Gijón, family Apgar, Yesavage, and Pfeiffer scales were used. The sample was composed of 55% women and 45% men, with a mean age of 79.2 years (SD 6.67). More than half live alone or with their spouse. Fifty-seven percent sleep on the floor or on wood, and about 82% do not have safe water. Family dysfunction is found in 40%, and 98% are at social risk or with an established social problem and a precarious economic situation. More than 60% suffer from depressive symptoms, which are more frequent in women. We conclude that older adults perceive deficient family support, observing a deteriorated social situation. Most of them are at risk of social exclusion and loneliness, making them more vulnerable. They show sadness, with a high rate of depression. People with more cognitive impairment live alone, and those in social exclusion suffer a higher degree of depression. More cooperative projects and health promotion interventions developed in the peripheral neighborhoods of Requena del Tapiche are needed to improve the impact on the health of older adult people in extreme poverty.",,The publication costs of this work have been financed by the Catholic University of Valencia under grant 2023-275-001.,Healthcare,,,,2023-11-23,2023,2023-11-23,,11,23,3022,All OA; Gold,Article,"Murillo-Llorente, María Teresa; Coloma, Nerea Caballero; Tomás-Aguirre, Francisco; Tejeda-Adell, Manuel; Ventura, Ignacio; Perez-Bermejo, Marcelino","Murillo-Llorente, María Teresa (SONEV Research Group, School of Medicine and Health Sciences, Catholic University of Valencia San Vicente Mártir, C/Quevedo nº 2, 46001 Valencia, Spain;, mt.murillo@ucv.es); Coloma, Nerea Caballero (School of Medicine and Health Sciences, Catholic University of Valencia San Vicente Mártir, C/Quevedo nº 2, 46001 Valencia, Spain;, nerea.caballero@mail.ucv.es, (N.C.C.);, paco.tomas@ucv.es, (F.T.-A.);, manuel.tejeda@ucv.es, (M.T.-A.);, ignacio.ventura@ucv.es, (I.V.)); Tomás-Aguirre, Francisco (School of Medicine and Health Sciences, Catholic University of Valencia San Vicente Mártir, C/Quevedo nº 2, 46001 Valencia, Spain;, nerea.caballero@mail.ucv.es, (N.C.C.);, paco.tomas@ucv.es, (F.T.-A.);, manuel.tejeda@ucv.es, (M.T.-A.);, ignacio.ventura@ucv.es, (I.V.)); Tejeda-Adell, Manuel (School of Medicine and Health Sciences, Catholic University of Valencia San Vicente Mártir, C/Quevedo nº 2, 46001 Valencia, Spain;, nerea.caballero@mail.ucv.es, (N.C.C.);, paco.tomas@ucv.es, (F.T.-A.);, manuel.tejeda@ucv.es, (M.T.-A.);, ignacio.ventura@ucv.es, (I.V.)); Ventura, Ignacio (School of Medicine and Health Sciences, Catholic University of Valencia San Vicente Mártir, C/Quevedo nº 2, 46001 Valencia, Spain;, nerea.caballero@mail.ucv.es, (N.C.C.);, paco.tomas@ucv.es, (F.T.-A.);, manuel.tejeda@ucv.es, (M.T.-A.);, ignacio.ventura@ucv.es, (I.V.)); Perez-Bermejo, Marcelino (SONEV Research Group, School of Medicine and Health Sciences, Catholic University of Valencia San Vicente Mártir, C/Quevedo nº 2, 46001 Valencia, Spain;, mt.murillo@ucv.es)","Perez-Bermejo, Marcelino (Valencia Catholic University Saint Vincent Martyr)","Murillo-Llorente, María Teresa (Valencia Catholic University Saint Vincent Martyr); Coloma, Nerea Caballero (Valencia Catholic University Saint Vincent Martyr); Tomás-Aguirre, Francisco (Valencia Catholic University Saint Vincent Martyr); Tejeda-Adell, Manuel (Valencia Catholic University Saint Vincent Martyr); Ventura, Ignacio (Valencia Catholic University Saint Vincent Martyr); Perez-Bermejo, Marcelino (Valencia Catholic University Saint Vincent Martyr)",0,0,,,https://www.mdpi.com/2227-9032/11/23/3022/pdf?version=1700718076,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1166313275,42 Health Sciences,1 No Poverty; 3 Good Health and Well Being; 8 Decent Work and Economic Growth

It is the causative agent of the primary amoebic meningoencephalitis. Focused on our interest to develop promising lead structures for the development of antiparasitic agents, this study was aimed at identifying new anti-Naegleria marine natural products from a collection of chamigrane-type sesquiterpenes with structural variety in the levels of saturation, halogenation and oxygenation isolated from Laurencia dendroidea. (+)-Elatol (1) was the most active compound against Naegleria fowleri trophozoites with IC50 values of 1.08 μM against the ATCC 30808™ strain and 1.14 μM against the ATCC 30215™ strain. Furthermore, the activity of (+)-elatol (1) against the resistant stage of N. fowleri was also assessed, showing great cysticidal properties with a very similar IC50 value (1.14 µM) to the one obtained for the trophozoite stage. Moreover, at low concentrations (+)-elatol (1) showed no toxic effect towards murine macrophages and could induce the appearance of different cellular events related to the programmed cell death, such as an increase of the plasma membrane permeability, reactive oxygen species overproduction, mitochondrial malfunction or chromatin condensation. Its enantiomer (-)-elatol (2) was shown to be 34-fold less potent with an IC50 of 36.77 μM and 38.03 μM. An analysis of the structure-activity relationship suggests that dehalogenation leads to a significant decrease of activity. The lipophilic character of these compounds is an essential property to cross the blood-brain barrier, therefore they represent interesting chemical scaffolds to develop new drugs.",,"This work was funded by Project PID2019-109476RB-C21 (BIOALGRI) (Spanish Ministry of Science, Madrid, Spain), Proyecto Intramural Especial CSIC [Ref. 202280I032]; N.N. was funded by the Agustín de Betancourt Programme (Cabildo de Tenerife, TFinnova Programme supported by MEDI and FDCAN funds).

Family support has been shown to be protective against CD, yet the relationship between these in psychotic patients remains complex and not fully understood. This study investigated the association between a subdomain of family support, namely, family involvement (estimated through a proxy measure), cognitive functioning, and sex in first-episode psychosis (FEP) patients. The sample included 308 patients enrolled in the Program for Early Phases of Psychosis (PAFIP), divided into 4 groups based on their estimated family involvement (eFI) level and sex, and compared on various variables. Women presented lower rates of eFI than men (37.1% and 48.8%). Higher eFI was associated with better cognitive functioning, particularly in verbal memory. This association was stronger in women. The findings suggest that eFI may be an important factor in FEP patients' cognitive functioning. This highlights the importance of including families in treatment plans for psychotic patients to prevent CD. Further research is needed to better understand the complex interplay between family support, sex, and cognitive functioning in psychotic patients and develop effective interventions that target these factors.","The authors wish to thank the PAFIP and PAFIP-FAMILIAS research team, and especially all the patients and their relatives who participated in the studies.","The PAFIP-FAMILIAS project received funding from the Carlos III Health Institute (FIS PI17/00221).

The Delphi process, with a ≥8 0% pre-defined participants' agreement, included three phases and a Coordinating Group. During the Preparation phase three panels of experts were selected and invited to participate: a) Regional academic/professional Dental Associations (Associations-Panel): n = 12; b) Regional Dental Schools (Dental-Schools-Panel): existing dental schools (n = 263) from the 19 Spanish-speaking regional countries; c) International academic/professional associations Peer Experts (Peer-Panel): n = 4. Based on consensus documents from Europe, Colombia, the Caribbean, USA, Chile and Spain, and updated scientific evidence, the Coordinating Group developed a baseline framework proposal of domains, main competencies (MC) and specific competencies (SC). The Consultation-Agreement and Consensus phases included three rounds of questionnaires with a step-wise sharing of the MC updated version of the consensus framework with the Dental-Schools-Panel and including SC with the Associations-Panel. Diverse communication strategies were used ( e.g ., independent google-form questionnaires and workshops). Consensus was reached after an on-site Associations-Panel workshop and secret voting, followed by an online meeting with the Peers-Panel. A total of 127 academic/professional institutions participated (Associations-Panel: 11, 91.6%; Dental-Schools-Panel: 112, 42.6%, all countries; Peers-Panel: 4, 100%).

In this perspective, the burden of disease in inhabitants of Colombian Orinoquia is quantified for the first time.
Methods: A descriptive population-based study that was based on secondary sources was carried out, which aimed at measuring the burden of the disease in the Colombian region of Orinoquia, using the simplified synthetic indicator of disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) of the global health estimation methodology. We used mortality records from the National Administrative Department of Statistics (DANE) and service provision records from the Ministry of Health and Social Protection of Colombia, both records from the year 2017, available on the Integrated Social Protection Information System.
Results: 288,740.2 DALYs occurred (95% UI 210,714.6-382,948.8), with higher reports for men (59%); group of non-communicable diseases accounted for 62.3% of DALYs (179,993.6, 95% UI, 115,030.2-268,405.0), followed by external cause injuries group which contributed 24.6% (71,000.0, 95% UI, 25,638.1-134,013.1), and group of communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional disorders which contributed 13.1% (37,746.0, 95% UI, 28,048.0-50,239.7). Interpersonal violence was the primary cause specific of DALYs with 9.8% of the burden, (28,290.0, 95% UI, 7,365.1-64,208.1).
Conclusions: Most DALYs in Orinoquia are produced by non-communicable diseases (NCD), largely caused by neoplasms and cardiovascular disease, which increased with age. However, when considered by specific cause of illness or injury, interpersonal violence is indicated as the main cause of DALYs, affecting mainly young men, possibly as an expression of social inequality, substance use, criminality, and insecurity. It is important to highlight that this region has been recognized as an area of armed conflict, drug trafficking, and poverty.","To Ángel Cruz-Roa, PhD, for his contribution in estimations through free software, on a script in Python 3.0 programming language, on the Jupyter Notebook platform with NumPy, and Pandas libraries.",The author(s) declared that no grants were involved in supporting this work.,F1000Research,,,"Colombia; Humans; Male; Female; Adult; Child, Preschool; Child; Middle Aged; Adolescent; Infant; Cost of Illness; Disability-Adjusted Life Years; Aged; Young Adult; Infant, Newborn; Aged, 80 and over; Noncommunicable Diseases",2023-11-20,2023,2023-11-20,,11,,1257,All OA; Gold,Article,"Gutiérrez-Lesmes, Oscar; Grisales-Romero, Hugo","Gutiérrez-Lesmes, Oscar (Escuela de Salud Pública, Universidad de los Llanos, Villavicencio, Meta, Colombia; Grupo Demografía y Salud, Universidad de Antioquia, Medellín, Antioquia, Colombia); Grisales-Romero, Hugo (Escuela de Salud Pública, Universidad de los Llanos, Villavicencio, Meta, Colombia)","Gutiérrez-Lesmes, Oscar (University of the Llanos; University of Antioquia)","Gutiérrez-Lesmes, Oscar (University of the Llanos; University of Antioquia); Grisales-Romero, Hugo (University of the Llanos)",0,0,,,https://f1000research.com/articles/11-1257/pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1166197575,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 42 Health Sciences; 4206 Public Health,"16 Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions; 3 Good Health and Well Being"

Quickly identifying corrosion damage to the stiffness of a steel structure is a challenge in coastal environments since corrosion progresses rapidly, and traditional methods of inspection and diagnosis are time-consuming and costly. This is an important issue; therefore, characterization of the corrosion level represents a key element in making decisions regarding maintenance or structural integrity. This work estimates the relationship between the corrosion level in steel structures and their dynamic parameters using ambient vibration records. It comprises the characterization of the dynamic behavior and corrosion state of three full-scale pedestrian bridges with similar geometry, material, and structural configuration characteristics but with significant differences in the degree of deterioration. The structures were instrumented with piezoelectric sensors connected to a portable data acquisition system; the recorded information was analyzed with optimization algorithms in Python based on the power spectral density (PSD) of the vibrations of each bridge. The parameters obtained related to the degree of corrosion determine the incidence of the level of deterioration in the structural behavior, thus involving changes in its stiffness and mass.","The authors thank the Sistema General de Regalías (SGR), the Ministerio de Ciencia, Tecnología, e Innovación (CTeI) and the Universidad del Norte, whose through the call No. 1 of the CTeI of the Biennial Plan of Convocations in the framework of the bicentennial excellence scholarship program have supported this project; also thank to those who contributed to this research.","This research was funded by the following entities in Colombia: Sistema General de Regalías (SGR), the Ministerio de Ciencia, Tecnología e Innovación (CTeI) and the Universidad del Norte, through the call No. 1: “Convocatoria del fondo de ciencia, tecnología e innovación del sistema general de regalías para la conformación de una lista de proyectos elegibles para ser viabilizados, priorizados y aprobados por el OCAD en el marco del programa de becas de excelencia doctoral del bicentenario”.",Infrastructures,,,,2023-03-13,2023,2023-03-13,,8,3,52,All OA; Gold,Article,"Barrios, Susana; Guzmán, Andrés; Ortiz, Albert","Barrios, Susana (Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla 081007, Colombia); Guzmán, Andrés (Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla 081007, Colombia); Ortiz, Albert (School of Civil and Geomatics Engineering, Universidad del Valle, Cali 760042, Colombia)","Guzmán, Andrés (Universidad del Norte)","Barrios, Susana (Universidad del Norte); Guzmán, Andrés (Universidad del Norte); Ortiz, Albert (University of Valle)",0,0,,,https://www.mdpi.com/2412-3811/8/3/52/pdf?version=1678701818,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1156169160,40 Engineering; 4005 Civil Engineering,

This is why the Quality of Work Life (QoWL) study has gained relevance in recent years. For this reason, various scales have been developed to evaluate this organizational variable constantly. However, to date, there is no evidence in the scientific literature of a Spanish version that evaluates the validity and reliability of these scales in a Peruvian context. Thus, this study aimed to translate into Spanish and adapt and analyze the validity and reliability of a scale to assess the quality of work life in Peruvian teachers based on Walton's model. For this purpose, 457 regular basic education teachers from a private educational network located in the three regions of Peru were surveyed. The analyses used the Structural Equation Model (SEM) with the AMOS 24 statistical software. Confirmatory Factor Analysis provided an excellent fit model of eight factors and 31 elements (CMIN/DF = 2.351; CFI = 0.955; SRMR = 0.062; RMSEA = 0.054; Pclose = 0.052). It also demonstrated good internal consistency (α = between 0.806 and 0.938; CR = between 0.824 and 0.939; AVE = between 0.547 and 0.794).

However, the underreporting of the disease is an unfortunate reality, with a clear trend towards a decrease in cases since 2019, when the guidelines for its confirmatory diagnosis changed with the requirement of two paired samples. The purpose of this review is to highlight the importance of leptospirosis. While the access to rapid diagnosis is available at practically all levels of care for dengue and malaria, leptospirosis-a doubly neglected disease-deserves recognition as a serious public health problem in Colombia. In this manner, it is proposed that molecular tests are a viable diagnostic alternative that can improve the targeted treatment of the patient and the timeliness of data and case reporting to SIVIGILA, and reduce the underreporting of the disease. Taking advantage of the strengthened technological infrastructure derived from the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic for molecular diagnosis in Colombia, with a network of 227 laboratories distributed throughout the national territory, with an installed capacity for PCR testing, it is proposed that molecular diagnosis can be used as an alternative for early diagnosis. This would allow case confirmation through the public health network in Colombia, and, together with the microagglutination (MAT) technique, the epidemiological surveillance of this disease in this country would be strengthened.",,"This study was supported by the Fogarty International Center and the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, of the National Institutes of Health under Award Number D43 TW010331.

Worldwide, most cases are registered in the African Meningitis Belt (AMB). The role of particular socioepidemiological features is essential for understanding disease dynamics and optimizing policy-making.
Objective: To identify socioepidemiological macro-determinants that contribute to explaining the differences in BM incidence between AMB and the rest of Africa.
Methods: Country-level ecologic study based on the cumulative incidence estimates of the Global Burden of Disease study and reports of the MenAfriNet Consortium. Data about relevant socioepidemiological features were extracted from international sources. Multivariate regression models were implemented to define variables associated with the classification of African countries within the AMB and the incidence of BM worldwide.
Results: Cumulative incidences at the AMB sub-regions were 111.93 (west), 87.23 (central), 65.10 (east), and 42.47 (north) per 100,000 population. A pattern of common origin with continuous exposition and seasonality of cases was observed. Socio-epidemiological determinants contributing to differentiating the AMB from the rest of Africa were household occupancy (OR 3.17 CI 95% 1.09-9.22, p = 0.034) and malaria incidence (OR 1.01 CI 95% 1.00-1.02, p = 0.016). BM cumulative incidence worldwide was additionally associated with temperature and gross national income per capita.
Conclusion: Socioeconomic and climate conditions are macro-determinants associated with BM cumulative incidence. Multilevel designs are required to confirm these findings.",This study was approved as the capstone project for granting the degree of specialist in epidemiology to one of the authors (GP-M) and a preliminary analysis was presented at the American Academy of Neurology Annual Meeting in 2022.

Embracing a healthy way of living is vital in lessening the impact of illnesses and extending one's lifespan. This research delves into the link between the health and eHealth literacy levels of individuals accessing primary healthcare services and investigates how this relates to adopting a health-conscious lifestyle.
METHODS: The approach involves a cross-sectional examination carried out at a healthcare facility in the Madrid region of Spain, focusing on adult patients who are in need of primary care nursing services. Health and eHealth literacy and a healthy lifestyle were measured using the Health Literacy Questionnaire (HLQ), the eHealth Literacy Questionnaire (eHLQ), and the ""PA100"" questionnaire, respectively.
RESULTS: Only some of the dimensions of the HLQ and eHLQ were significantly related to a healthy lifestyle, predominantly with a very low or low relationship. Dimension three of the HLQ and dimension five of the eHLQ acquired more importance and were positioned as positive predictors of a healthy lifestyle.
CONCLUSIONS: This study helps comprehend the relationship between health and eHealth literacy and a healthy lifestyle, which provides information that contributes to understanding the factors that might have a higher impact on lifestyles.",The authors thank the nursing team of the “C.S.

Proliferation, migration and overall behaviour of those cells is greatly determined by micromechanical queues provided by the ECM. Lung fibrosis displays an aberrant increased deposition of ECM which likely changes filament organization and stiffens the ECM, thus upregulating the profibrotic profile of pulmonary cells. We have previously used AFM to assess changes in the Young's Modulus (E) of the ECM in the lung. Here, we perform further ECM topographical, mechanical and viscoelastic analysis at the micro- and nano-scale throughout fibrosis development. Furthermore, we provide nanoscale correlations between topographical and elastic properties of the ECM fibres. Firstly, we identify a softening of the ECM after rats are instilled with media associated with recovery of mechanical homeostasis, which is hindered in bleomycin-instilled lungs. Moreover, we find opposite correlations between fibre stiffness and roughness in PBS- vs bleomycin-treated lung. Our findings suggest that changes in ECM nanoscale organization take place at different stages of fibrosis, with the potential to help identify pharmacological targets to hinder its progression.",,"This research was partially funded by Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovación (PID2020-113910RB-I00-AEI/10.13039/501100011033, SAF2017-85574-R, and PID2020-116808RB-I00 AEI-Retos) and SEPAR (900-2019).

Teachers underwent a re-planning of their teaching approaches, shifting from face-to-face teaching formats to remote ones. These challenges resulted in high levels of burnout. The identification of risk/protective factors contributing to burnout is crucial in order to inform intervention programs. Thus, we hypothesized a mediation role of teachers' mentalizing ability (processing of emotions, a component of mentalized affectivity) on the relationship between depression, anxiety, and depersonalization (burnout dimension). Two reverse models were computed. Job satisfaction, teachers' age and gender, school grade, and length of teaching experience served as covariates.
METHODS: 466 (M(sd) = 46.2 (10.4) years) online questionnaires were completed by Italian teachers of primary (n = 204) and middle (n = 242) schools. Measures of burnout, depression, anxiety, and mentalization were administered.
RESULTS: The findings corroborated our hypotheses: in all models, processing emotions served as a mediator on the relationship between depression, anxiety, and depersonalization, and on the reciprocal one. Job satisfaction positively impacted processing emotion, and negatively impacted depression and depersonalization; women teachers reported high levels of the anxious trait.
CONCLUSIONS: Overall, it can be concluded that the ability to mentalize has a beneficial impact on teachers' well-being.

This study aimed to examine the variables associated with suicide risk and determine their predictive capacity. The specific objectives were: (1) to analyze the relationship between suicide risk and model variables and (2) to design an artificial neural network (ANN) with predictive capacity for suicide risk. The sample comprised 337 youths aged 18-33 years. An ex post facto design was used. The results showed that emotional attention, followed by problem solving and perfectionism, were variables that contributed the most to the ANN's predictive capacity. The ANN achieved a hit rate of 85.7%, which is much higher than chance, and with only 14.3% of incorrect cases.

This study aimed to predict the potential mechanism of LMQXM for ADHD using network pharmacology and molecular docking, which were then validated using animal experiments. Methods: Network pharmacology and molecular docking techniques were used to predict the core targets and potential pathways of LMQXMQ for ADHD, and KEGG pathway enrichment analysis revealed the potential significance of dopamine (DA) and cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) signaling pathways. To verify the hypothesis, we conducted an animal experiment. In the animal experiment, the young spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs) were randomly divided into the model group (SHR), the methylphenidate hydrochloride group (MPH, 4.22 mg/kg), and 3 LMQXM groups (low-dose (LD) group, 5.28 ml/kg; medium-dose (MD) group, 10.56 ml/kg; and high-dose (HD) group, 21.12 ml/kg), and administered by gavage for 4 weeks; the WKY rats were set as the control group. The open field test and Morris water maze test were used to evaluate the behavioral performance of rats, high performance liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC-MS) was used to analyze DA levels in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and striatum of rats, ELISA was used to detect cAMP concentrations in the PFC and striatum, and immunohistochemistry and qPCR were used to analyze positive cell expression and mRNA expression for indicators related to DA and cAMP pathways. Results: The results showed that beta-sitosterol, stigmasterol, rhynchophylline, baicalein, and formononetin might be key components of LMQXM for ADHD and that these components bind well to the core targets, DA receptors (DRD1 and DRD2). Furthermore, LMQXM might act through the DA and cAMP signaling pathways. In the animal experiment, we found that MPH and LMQXM-MD controlled hyperactivity and improved learning and memory in SHRs, while LMQXM-HD only controlled hyperactivity in SHRs; meanwhile, MPH and LMQXM-MD upregulated DA and cAMP levels, mean optical density (MOD) of cAMP, and MOD and mRNA expression of DRD1 and PKA in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and striatum of SHRs, while LMQXM-LD and LMQXM-HD upregulated DA and cAMP levels in the striatum, MOD of cAMP in the PFC, and mRNA expression of PKA in the PFC. However, we did not find a significant regulatory effect of LMQXM on DRD2. Conclusion: To sum up, this study demonstrated that LMQXM may increase DA levels mainly by activating the cAMP/PKA signaling pathway through DRD1, thereby controlling the behavioral disorders of SHRs, which is most effective at moderate doses, and this may be a key mechanism for LMQXM in the treatment of ADHD.",The authors would like to thank all the reviewers who participated in the review and ZJ and ZX’s strong support for ADHD research.,This study was funded by the Shanghai “13th Five-Year Plan” Clinical Key Specialty TCM Pediatrics Project (shslczdzk04102) and the Shanghai Three-Year Action Plan to Further Accelerate the Development of Chinese Medicine Inheritance and Innovation (2021-2023) Project (ZY (2021-2023)-0206-01).,Frontiers in Pharmacology,,,,2023-03-17,2023,2023-03-17,,14,,1144907,All OA; Gold,Article,"Li, Xuejun; Xiao, Zhen; Pu, Wenyan; Jiang, Zhiyan; Wang, Shumin; Zhang, Yixing","Li, Xuejun (Pediatrics, Longhua Hospital Affiliated to Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Shanghai, China; Longhua Clinical Medical College, Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Shanghai, China); Xiao, Zhen (Pediatrics, Longhua Hospital Affiliated to Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Shanghai, China); Pu, Wenyan (Pediatrics, Longhua Hospital Affiliated to Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Shanghai, China; Longhua Clinical Medical College, Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Shanghai, China); Jiang, Zhiyan (Pediatrics, Longhua Hospital Affiliated to Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Shanghai, China); Wang, Shumin (Pediatrics, Longhua Hospital Affiliated to Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Shanghai, China; Longhua Clinical Medical College, Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Shanghai, China); Zhang, Yixing (Pediatrics, Longhua Hospital Affiliated to Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Shanghai, China; Longhua Clinical Medical College, Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Shanghai, China)","Xiao, Zhen (Longhua Hospital Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine); Jiang, Zhiyan (Longhua Hospital Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine)","Li, Xuejun (Longhua Hospital Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine; Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine); Xiao, Zhen (Longhua Hospital Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine); Pu, Wenyan (Longhua Hospital Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine; Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine); Jiang, Zhiyan (Longhua Hospital Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine); Wang, Shumin (Longhua Hospital Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine; Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine); Zhang, Yixing (Longhua Hospital Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine; Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine)",2,2,,,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fphar.2023.1144907/pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1156286333,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3214 Pharmacology and Pharmaceutical Sciences,

Methods: A population-based analytical cross-sectional study was conducted using pooled data from the Demographic and Family Health Surveys of Peru, 2015-2019. A total sample of 8850 adolescent girls aged 12 to 19 years who reported a history of sexual intercourse were included. To identify factors related to adolescent pregnancy, the study employed adjusted prevalence ratios (aPR) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). The aPR were obtained from a multivariable logistic regression model.
Results: The prevalence of adolescent pregnancy among sexually active adolescents in Peru was 30.9% (95%CI: 29.4-32.4%). In the multivariable analysis; being 17-19 years (aPR: 1.48; 95%CI:1.33-1.64), being married or cohabitant (aPR: 4.01; 95%CI: 3.48-4.61) and belonging to the Quechua ethnicity group (aPR: 1.16; 95%CI: 1.07-1.25), were associated with a higher prevalence. Conversely, the following factors were associated with a lower prevalence of pregnancy: being employed (aPR: 0.81; 95%CI: 0.76-0.86), being currently studying (aPR: 0.43; 95%CI: 0.38-0.49), belonging to the second (aPR: 0.91; 95%CI: 0.85-0.97), third (aPR: 0.81; 95%CI: 0.74-0.89), fourth (aPR: 0.79; 95%CI: 0.69-0.91) and fifth (aPR: 0.59; 95%CI: 0.47-0.75) wealth quintile, initiating sexual relations in middle adolescente (aPR: 0.76; 95%CI: 0.69-0.83) or late adolescence (aPR: 0.40; 95%CI: 0.35-0.46), perceiving a future pregnancy as a problem (aPR: 0.77; 95%CI: 0.72-0.83) and having knowledge of the moment in the cycle when pregnancy can occur (aPR: 0.84; 95%CI: 0.77-0.92).
Conclusions: Approximately three out of ten adolescents who initiated a sexual life had at least one pregnancy. Age, marital status, employment, education, wealth, ethnicity, age at first intercourse, knowledge of when in the cycle she may become pregnant, and perception of future pregnancy were associated with adolescent pregnancy. To decrease the prevalence of teenage pregnancy in Peru, it is imperative to enhance national policies concerning family planning and provide comprehensive sex education targeted at adolescents.",,The author(s) declared that no grants were involved in supporting this work.,F1000Research,,,Pregnancy; Female; Humans; Adolescent; Pregnancy in Adolescence; Peru; Prevalence; Cross-Sectional Studies; Health Surveys,2023-10-02,2023,2023-10-02,,11,,566,All OA; Gold,Article,"Caira-Chuquineyra, Brenda; Fernandez-Guzman, Daniel; Meza-Gómez, Adria; Luque-Mamani, Beatriz Milagros; Medina-Carpio, Shawny Luz; Mamani-García, Carlos S.; Romani-Peña, Marilia; Díaz-Vélez, Cristian","Caira-Chuquineyra, Brenda (Facultad de Medicina, Universidad Nacional de San Agustin de Arequipa, Arequipa, Arequipa, 04001, Peru); Fernandez-Guzman, Daniel (Escuela Profesional de Medicina Humana, Universidad Nacional de San Antonio Abad del Cusco, Cusco, 0800, Peru); Meza-Gómez, Adria (Facultad de Medicina, Universidad Nacional de San Agustin de Arequipa, Arequipa, Arequipa, 04001, Peru); Luque-Mamani, Beatriz Milagros (Facultad de Medicina, Universidad Nacional de San Agustin de Arequipa, Arequipa, Arequipa, 04001, Peru); Medina-Carpio, Shawny Luz (Facultad de Medicina, Universidad Nacional de San Agustin de Arequipa, Arequipa, Arequipa, 04001, Peru); Mamani-García, Carlos S.

Moreover, chronic stress can affect sleep. A unidirectional relationship has been established between burnout and sleep, and it is known that white-collar workers with burnout syndrome have sleep fragmentation and marked daytime sleepiness.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to assess the relationships between burnout and sleep quality in elementary school teachers in Mexico.
METHODS: We collected data from more than 400 teachers who completed tests. Correlation analyses controlled for anxiety and depression, and Poisson logistic regression analyses were performed to examine the relationships of burnout with sleep quality, depression, and anxiety.
RESULTS: There was a significant correlation between burnout syndrome (mainly in the dimension of emotional exhaustion) and sleep disturbances; significant correlations were also observed with other burnout, depression, and anxiety dimensions. The strength of the correlations decreased after controlling for depression and anxiety.
CONCLUSIONS: The symptoms of burnout syndrome in teachers can overlap with sleep disorders, so it is necessary to make a differential diagnosis to differentiate burnout syndrome from depression and anxiety, among others.",We sincerely acknowledge the teachers for their participation in this research.,This research received no external funding.,International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health,,"Anthony Montgomery, Igor Portoghese, Renato Pisanti, Chiara Consiglio, Amal K.

Methods: A qualitative study was conducted with an interpretive hermeneutic approach, using semi-structured interviews developed in the Metropolitan Area of Aburrá Valley, Bogotá, and the Colombian coffee-growing region.
Results: Fifty-five interviews were conducted. Of the total number of people interviewed, 60% were cisgender men, 31% were cisgender women, and 9% were transgender women. The average age of the participants was 27 years. Sixty-nine percent were irregular migrants in Colombia. Only 11% were affiliated with the health system. It was observed that condom use is inconsistent among sex workers, depending on personal and social factors.
Conclusions: The factors that influence condom use in sex workers of Venezuelan origin in Colombia are determined by various factors, both personal and social. Personal factors relate to knowledge, support networks, and risk perception, while social factors are associated with substance use, stigma and discrimination, and the places where sex work is done.

ABSTRACT Introduction: Self-regulation of learning refers to the modulation of affective, cognitive and behavioral processes throughout a learning experience to reach a desired level of achievement. Students who have a better management of their cognitive and metacognitive skills learn in a better way than those who do not, therefore, it is essential to study at what level university students are capable of learning to learn and to be managers of their learning. Objectives: To analyze the relationship between self-regulation of learning and academic performance in medical students from three universities in the year 2022. Materials and methods: This research followed a quantitative approach; the type of research was observational and descriptive. A previously validated instrument was used to identify types of self-regulation, the Self-Regulation of Learning from Texts (ARATEX-R). Results: No significant relationship was found between the academic profile of medical students and the total ARATEX-R score. When studying the relationship between the dimensions of self-regulation, a relationship was found between academic performance and motivation planning and management, which implies that those who have better planning skills and who are able to manage their motivation have better academic performance. Conclusion: The main dimensions that characterize the self-regulation of learning in medical students were: context management, cognition management and comprehension evaluation.",,,Anales de la Facultad de Ciencias Médicas (Asunción),,,,2023-04-15,2023,2023-04-15,,56,1,32-40,All OA; Gold,Article,"Coronel, Ivn Barrios; Patio, Mara Isabel; Coronel, Jazmn Barrios; Osorio, Hernando Bez; Rbalo, Telmo Ral Aveiro; Pont, Ema Maidana; Alvez, Edis Ortigoza; Arias, Jorge Villalba; Maia, Joo Mauricio Castaldelli; Ventriglio, Antonio; Torales, Julio Csar","Coronel, Ivn Barrios (); Patio, Mara Isabel (); Coronel, Jazmn Barrios (); Osorio, Hernando Bez (); Rbalo, Telmo Ral Aveiro (); Pont, Ema Maidana (); Alvez, Edis Ortigoza (); Arias, Jorge Villalba (); Maia, Joo Mauricio Castaldelli (); Ventriglio, Antonio (); Torales, Julio Csar ()",,"Coronel, Ivn Barrios (); Patio, Mara Isabel (); Coronel, Jazmn Barrios (); Osorio, Hernando Bez (); Rbalo, Telmo Ral Aveiro (); Pont, Ema Maidana (); Alvez, Edis Ortigoza (); Arias, Jorge Villalba (); Maia, Joo Mauricio Castaldelli (); Ventriglio, Antonio (); Torales, Julio Csar ()",1,1,,,http://scielo.iics.una.py/pdf/anales/v56n1/1816-8949-anales-56-01-32.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1157437530,39 Education; 3901 Curriculum and Pedagogy,

The 1990 Caracas declaration proposed a shift towards decentralised community mental health services and interventions based on the recovery approach and emphasis on social determinants of mental health in the Americas. Colombia has adopted these approaches in its legal and practical framework in recent years, but implementation has been uneven. This systematic review aims to contribute to mental health services understanding in Colombia by examining the barriers and facilitators to the implementation of mental health services in Colombia. A search was conducted to explore available peer-reviewed studies on Colombian mental health services across five databases (Medline, PubMed, Scopus, Scielo and BVS) on quantitative and qualitative research papers published in the last ten years and without language restrictions. The Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR) was used to structure the analysis and identify barriers and facilitators during the implementation of mental health services. We adapted the CFIR to attend to gender, race and age informed by the Socio-Political Economy of Global Mental Health framework, given the importance of these factors to the Colombian health landscape. Finally, narrative synthesis was used to summarise the data. 1 530 records were identified, and 12 articles met all inclusion criteria and were included in the analysis. 8 papers described substance use disorders services, 11 involved multidisciplinary healthcare professionals, and 7 were implemented at a local scale. The primary barriers to implementation were the lack of coordination, high workloads, and low funding. Facilitators included the use of protocols, and the involvement of communities, stakeholders, users, and external champions. Findings suggest the continued importance of community and recovery approaches and efforts to improve coordination between multi-sector actors involved in the mental health spaces (e.g., public, and private organisations, users and their families).",,"This paper was conducted in partial fulfilment of GA-AG MSc degree in Global Health and Development at UCL.

The medical student faces a high level of competitiveness in the course of his academic training with an increase in the workload as he progresses; this causes symptoms such as anxiety, stress, sadness, among others. If these aspects are not treated or are masked, they can turn into depression, generalized anxiety, burnout and even suicide (2).
Aim: To describe the QoL of the students of medicina at the National University of Córdoba, considering the complete training cycle divided into two groups from 1 to 3° and from 4 to 5°.
Methods: Cross-sectional study, through the Guarani System of the UNC. The WHOQoL-BREF online questionnaire, which uses the Likert scale, was applied to all students. This assesses the global QoL and satisfaction regarding the state of physical and psychological health, interpersonal relationships and environment. p was considered significant <0.05. This work was approved by the Adult CIEIS.
Results: 854 responses were obtained, 72% were female, 43% were from another province/country and 63% corresponded to the 1-3° group. Of these, 37% rated their QoL as “fairly good”, while 36% of the 4-5th grade group perceived their QoL as “normal” (p:0.0469). The most influential variables correspond to the supply of money for their needs (p:0.0005), sexual satisfaction (p:0.0056) and access to health services (p:0.0042) . Cronbach's alpha was 0.8899.
Conclusion: QoL is better perceived in the 1-3 year group and economic supply, sexual satisfaction and access to health services were the main points to take care of in this medicine students.",,Fuentes de apoyo La presente investigación no contó con fuentes de financiación.,Revista de la Facultad de Ciencias Médicas de Córdoba,,,"Adult; Male; Humans; Female; Quality of Life; Students, Medical; Cross-Sectional Studies; Argentina; Surveys and Questionnaires; Retrospective Studies",2023-09-29,2023,2023-09-29,,80,3,205-220,All OA; Gold,Article,"Romero, Santiago; Regis, Matías Agustín; Díaz, Elena María Rosa; Allende, Guillermo Einer; Pepe, Gustavo Alberto; Gobbi, Carla Andrea","Romero, Santiago (Universidad Nacional de Córdoba.

METHOD: a cross-sectional comparative study in the Pulmonary Care unit of a tertiary-level public hospital. The Maslach Burnout Inventory was used.
RESULTS: 280 surveys were distributed across three periods: before (n=80), during (n=105) and after (n=95) COVID-19 care; 172 surveys were returned. The response rates were 57.5%, 64.8% and 61.1%, respectively. The prevalence of severe burnout was 30.4%, 63.2% and 34.5% before, during and after COVID-19 care (p<0.001). Emotional exhaustion (p<0.001) and depersonalization (p=0.002) symptoms were more prevalent among nurses than among physicians. Severe burnout was more prevalent in women, nurses and night shift staff.
CONCLUSION: the high prevalence of burnout doubled in the first peak of hospital admissions and returned to pre-pandemic levels one month after COVID-19 care ended. Burnout varied by gender, shift and occupation, with nurses among the most vulnerable groups. Focus on early assessment and mitigation strategies are required to support nurses not only during crisis but permanently.","Agradecemos a los Doctores Catalina Casillas-Suárez y Francisco Navarro-Reynoso, y a todo el personal de la unidad de Neumología del Hospital General de México “Dr. Eduardo Liceaga” que atendieron a los pacientes de COVID-19.

OBJETIVE: To evaluate whether there is an association between social support, concern about COVID-19 infection and knowledge about tuberculosis, and non-adherence to antituberculosis treatment.
MATERIALS AND METHODOS: A cross-sectional study was carried out on patients under antituberculosis treatment, from January to March, 2022, in centers located in areas with a high prevalence of tuberculosis in Lima. We used the Morisky Green-Levine questionnaire to assess adherence to treatment as the dependent variable; the independent variables were evaluated using the Medical Outcomes Study Social Support Survey for perceived social support and concern about COVID-19 infection, and the Battle Test to assess patients’ knowledge about their disease. We used Poisson regression with robust variance to evaluate the association between the independent variables and the dependent one.
RESULTS: Out of 101 participants (73.3% male with an average age of 35.1 ± 16 years), 51.5% were non-adherent to antituberculosis treatment. Medium or high level of concern about getting COVID-19 was associated with a higher prevalence of non-adherence to treatment (odds ratio: 1.68; 95 % confidence interval: 1.09-2.57) (adjusted for considered confounding variables).
CONCLUSIONS: Non-adherence is a frequent condition among patients living in an area with a high prevalence of tuberculosis in Lima, especially among those with a higher concern for COVID-19 infection.","Agradecemos al personal de las instituciones en estudio por su colaboración en la realización de esta investigación.

This paradigm allows the interpretation and study of phenomena from their own complexity. In public health, qualitative research has gained ground, as it allows the study of subjective aspects of the health-disease process.
Objective: To describe and analyze qualitative research on health issues published in Colombian journals between 2011 and 2021.
Materials and methods: A descriptive study on qualitative health research published in Colombian journals between 2011 and 2021 was carried out.
Results: Eighty-one articles were included. The journal with the highest number of publications was the Revista de Salud Pública (44.4%). The year with the highest
production corresponded to 2019 and the main design was the fundamental theory (17.3%). In 79% of the articles, women were the main author and nursing was the most frequent profession of undergraduate training. The most frequent topic was HIV/AIDS (12.3%), followed by cancer (11.1%). In 24.6% of the studies, a software was used for the analysis.
Conclusions: Qualitative research in public health has had a variable dynamic in scientific production between 2011 and 2021. Despite its benefits, the adoption of computer programs for qualitative analysis is rare. Nursing stands out as the area that concentrates the largest number of qualitative studies in public health with contributions on topics such as COVID-19 and HIV/AIDS.",,Ninguna persona o entidad ha contribuido financieramente en el desarrollo de este artículo.,Biomédica,,,Humans; COVID-19; Retrospective Studies,2023-03-30,2023,2023-03-30,,43,1,69-82,All OA; Gold,Article,"Rodríguez-Gómez, Rodolfo","Rodríguez-Gómez, Rodolfo (Asesor metodológico en investigación en salud, Bogotá, D.C., Colombia, Bogotá, D.C., Colombia)","Rodríguez-Gómez, Rodolfo (Asesor metodológico en investigación en salud, Bogotá, D.C., Colombia, Bogotá, D.C., Colombia)","Rodríguez-Gómez, Rodolfo (Asesor metodológico en investigación en salud, Bogotá, D.C., Colombia, Bogotá, D.C., Colombia)",2,1,,,https://revistabiomedica.org/index.php/biomedica/article/download/6476/5194,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1157585001,42 Health Sciences; 4203 Health Services and Systems,3 Good Health and Well Being

This is in addition to the importance placed on welfare for the animals themselves. However, the content and application of laws protecting animals' welfare vary across countries. In Latin America, there are a range of common practices or activities involving certain animal species, many of which are legal, that can impair an animal's quality of life. These include the performance of aesthetic surgical procedures; bull-, cock-, and dog fighting; and the existence of circuses that exhibit animals.

ABSTRACT: One of the main actors in the conceptualization and implementation of Intercultural Education (IE) public policies is the teacher. IE, which includes ethnoeducation, refers to education in contexts of cultural diversity and interculturality. This reflection article highlights the role of teacher education and its impact on the implementation of multilingual IE policy in Colombia, especially in Afro-Colombian ethno-educational schools, mostly in the periphery. To this end, the advances, stagnations, setbacks and challenges of IE will be analyzed from Bronfenbrenner’s Ecosystem Theory (1977) and the contextual dimension proposed by Braun et al. (2011). It is concluded that Colombian teachers are key agents whose transperipheral practices have favored the strengthening of cultural identity, autonomy, the global life project and the linguistic diversity of native populations.

OBJECTIVES: To quantify the burden of cardiometabolic risk factors in South American children (0-21 years) and identify knowledge gaps.
METHODS: We systematically searched PubMed, Google Scholar, and the Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences Literature via Virtual Health Library from 2000-2021 in any language. Two independent reviewers screened and extracted all data.
RESULTS: 179 studies of 2,181 screened were included representing 10 countries (n = 2,975,261). 12.2% of South American children experienced obesity, 21.9% elevated waist circumference, 3.0% elevated fasting glucose, 18.1% high triglycerides, 29.6% low HDL cholesterol, and 8.6% high blood pressure. Cardiometabolic risk factor definitions varied widely. Chile exhibited the highest prevalence of obesity/overweight, low HDL, and impaired fasting glucose. Ecuador exhibited the highest prevalence of elevated blood pressure. Rural setting (vs. urban or mixed) and indigenous origin protected against most cardiometabolic risk factors.
CONCLUSIONS: South American children experience high rates of obesity, overweight, and dyslipidemia. International consensus on cardiometabolic risk factor definitions for children will lead to improved diagnosis of cardiometabolic risk factors in this population, and future research should ensure inclusion of unreported countries and increased representation of indigenous populations.",,The authors received no specific funding for this work.,PLOS ONE,,Patricia Khashayar,Adult; Humans; Child; Overweight; Cardiometabolic Risk Factors; Risk Factors; Body Mass Index; Blood Glucose; Obesity; Hypertension; Waist Circumference; Dyslipidemias; Chile; Cardiovascular Diseases,2023-11-22,2023,2023-11-22,,18,11,e0293865,All OA; Gold,Article,"Singleton, Carolyn M.

METHOD: research with a qualitative approach, based on the Grounded Theory, conducted with 11 professors of the nursing course of a public university in the central region of Brazil in 2020 and 2021. Online semi-structured interviews were analyzed partially in the light of the Constructivist Grounded Theory.
RESULTS: factors that lead lecturer to experience violence are characterized by institutional culture, gender, professor's perception of violence, and the triggers that drive students to commit violence. Social status and inequalities lead to positions of domination and, consequently, create a fertile ground for violence.
FINAL CONSIDERATIONS: analyzing violence under Bourdieu's theory, it is clear that student violence towards lecturer and the reports contained in this study deserve pedagogical reflection.

However, their usage is limited as the high capital and operating costs; according to the International Renewable Energy Agency's 2020 report, the global weighted average levelized cost of electricity (L.C.O.E) for P.T.Cs was 0.185 $/kWh in 2018. This work analyses the economic, technical, and environmental potential of sustainable energy to increase the use of P.T.Cs in different sectors. To study how self-weight, heat loss, and wind velocity affect P.T.C performance, prototype testing, and wind flow analysis were used. Although P.T.Cs outperform in capacity factor, gross-to-net conversion, and annual energy production, improving their overall efficiency is crucial in reducing total energy production costs. Wire coils, discs, and twisted tape-type inserts can enhance their performance by increasing turbulence and heat transfer area. Improving the system's overall efficiency by enhancing the functioning and operation of individual components will also help decrease total energy production costs. The aim is to minimize the L.C.O.E associated with a P.T.C in order to enhance its economic viability for an extended period. When the nanofluid-oriented P.T.C was included in the conventional P.T.C workings, there was a decrease in the L.C.O.E by 1%. Of all the technologies available, ocean, geothermal, and C.S.P parabolic trough plants generate lower amounts of waste and harmful gases, with average emissions of 2.39%, 2.23%, and 2.16%, respectively, throughout their lifespan. For solar-only and non-hybrid thermal energy storage plants, the range of greenhouse gas emissions is between 20 and 34 kgCO2 equivalents per megawatt-hour. Coal, natural gas steam turbines, nuclear power plants, bioenergy, solar PV, geothermal, concentrated solar power, hydropower reservoir, hydropower river, ocean, and wind power plants all release greenhouse gases at rates of 1022, 587.5, 110.5, 633, 111, 48, 41, 82.5, 7.5, 12.5, and 41.5 gCO2-e/kWh, respectively. This information is useful to compare the environmental effect of various energy sources and help us to choose cleaner, more sustainable options for the production of electricity. The ongoing advancements and future scope of P.T.Cs could potentially make them more economically viable for domestic, commercial, and industrial applications.","Declaration of competing interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

The objective of this study was to identify the epidemiological profile of the population affiliated to the SS in Colombia and to compare the main epidemiological features of the SS to the CS.MethodsFollowing the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) methodology, the search was carried out from 1993, with no other restriction. The information was synthesized into five categories according to the most important risk populations. We estimated combined incidences from epidemiological surveillance data, prevalence ratio, and other measures to estimate the difference between the studied groups. A 95% confidence interval was considered. A random effects model was used weighted by the inverse of the variance of the cumulative incidence calculated for each disease. The risk of bias was assessed using the Joanna Briggs Institute’s critical appraisal tools.ResultsA total of 16,236 articles were identified; 14,972 were excluded after title and abstract screening, 725 articles were verified as full text, and finally 268 articles were included. The relative risk of non-communicable and communicable diseases was lower in the SS than in the CS (RR: 0.37 and 0.72, respectively, p-value < 0.05). However, the risk of presenting obstetric and maternal conditions in the SS versus the CS was RR 1.55 for frequent conditions during early childhood, and for other diseases it was RR 1.28 with a p-value of < 0.05. The use of health services was different by scheme, with less demand, access, and provision being found in health services in the SS.ConclusionsThis study allowed us to conclude that there are differences in the incidence, prevalence, and use of health services between health affiliation schemes (SS and CS) in Colombia, thereby assisting in decision-making for stakeholders.Trial registrationPROSPERO Registration number CRD42021279234.",Not applicable.,"This study is funded by the Ministerio de Hacienda y Crédito Público of Colombia and the Instituto de Evaluación Tecnológica en Salud, through inter-administrative agreement No. 7008-2021.",International Journal for Equity in Health,,,"Female; Pregnancy; Humans; Child, Preschool; Colombia; Insurance, Health; Risk Factors; Incidence; Prevalence",2023-02-07,2023,2023-02-07,,22,1,28,All OA; Gold,Article,"Mora-Moreo, Laura; Estrada-Orozco, Kelly; Espinosa, Oscar; Melgarejo, Lorena Mesa","Mora-Moreo, Laura (Epidemiology, Evidence Synthesis and Technology Management, Instituto de Evaluación Tecnológica en Salud (IETS), Bogotá, Colombia; Department of Health Services Research and Policy, Faculty of Public Health and Policy, London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, London, England); Estrada-Orozco, Kelly (Directorate of Evidence Synthesis and Management of Health Technologies, Institutode Evaluación Tecnológica en Salud (IETS), Bogotá, D.C., Colombia; Health Technologies and Policies Assessment Group, Instituto de Investigaciones Clínicas, Facultad de Medicina, Universidad Nacional de Colombia, Sede Bogotá, Colombia; Instituto de Investigaciones Clínicas, Facultad de Medicina, Fundación Universitaria Sanitas, Bogotá, Colombia); Espinosa, Oscar (Directorate of Analytical, Economic and Actuarial Studies at Instituto de Evaluación Tecnológica en Salud (IETS), Bogotá, D.C., Colombia; Economic Models and Quantitative Methods Research Group, Centro de Investigaciones para el Desarrollo, Universidad Nacional de Colombia, Bogotá, Colombia); Melgarejo, Lorena Mesa (Directorate of Qualitative Methods and Social Research, Instituto de Evaluación Tecnológica en Salud (IETS), Bogotá, D.C., Colombia)","Estrada-Orozco, Kelly (Directorate of Evidence Synthesis and Management of Health Technologies, Institutode Evaluación Tecnológica en Salud (IETS), Bogotá, D.C., Colombia; National University of Colombia; Fundación Universitaria Sanitas)","Mora-Moreo, Laura (Epidemiology, Evidence Synthesis and Technology Management, Instituto de Evaluación Tecnológica en Salud (IETS), Bogotá, Colombia; London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine); Estrada-Orozco, Kelly (Directorate of Evidence Synthesis and Management of Health Technologies, Institutode Evaluación Tecnológica en Salud (IETS), Bogotá, D.C., Colombia; National University of Colombia; Fundación Universitaria Sanitas); Espinosa, Oscar (Directorate of Analytical, Economic and Actuarial Studies at Instituto de Evaluación Tecnológica en Salud (IETS), Bogotá, D.C., Colombia; National University of Colombia); Melgarejo, Lorena Mesa (Directorate of Qualitative Methods and Social Research, Instituto de Evaluación Tecnológica en Salud (IETS), Bogotá, D.C., Colombia)",6,6,,,https://equityhealthj.biomedcentral.com/counter/pdf/10.1186/s12939-022-01818-x,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1155161601,42 Health Sciences; 4202 Epidemiology; 4206 Public Health,3 Good Health and Well Being

For this purpose, statistical methodologies such as Composite Central Design (CCD), Response Surface Methodology (RSM), and a Multi-Objective Optimization were used to find an efficient mix design that meets the strength and workability criteria using the highest RHA content in partial replacement of cement. The design optimization results show that replacing 24.9% by weight of cement with RHA in a hydraulic concrete mix produces the highest flexural strength (4.2 MPa) of the combinations proposed in the composite central design.

The objective of this research is to carry out a study and contribution on the epistemology of chemistry, in the consideration of philosophy within the thought of diversity and its educational importance. The methodology focused on a non-experimental type of exploratory level, qualitative method and historical-interpretive approach through documentary analysis. The theoretical development allows us to glimpse the participation of chemistry in the multidisciplinary, interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary dimensions; to be used in secondary and higher education institutions, avoiding continuous and dogmatic monodisciplinary learning. As a result of the investigation, it was found that history and chemistry have a fundamental and convergent dimension, the epistemological dimension. The historical evolution of chemistry accounts for the ways of accessing knowledge and categorizing it as valid knowledge. Therefore, it is concluded that the epistemology of chemistry has a causal relationship with the corresponding paradigm, and in the current era, chemistry is part of the logical positivist paradigm, by complying with the epistemological and epistemological characteristics of the same and in the prevalence of empirical testing.",,,Sophía,,,,2023-01-13,2023,2023-01-13,,,34,291-313,All OA; Gold,Article,"Vélez-Jiménez, Dolores; Mora-Rojas, Celso Obdulio","Vélez-Jiménez, Dolores (Universidad Iberoamericana); Mora-Rojas, Celso Obdulio (Universidad Del Norte)",,"Vélez-Jiménez, Dolores (Universidad Iberoamericana); Mora-Rojas, Celso Obdulio (Universidad del Norte)",2,2,,,https://sophia.ups.edu.ec/index.php/sophia/article/download/6321/6423,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1154521452,39 Education; 50 Philosophy and Religious Studies; 5002 History and Philosophy Of Specific Fields,

The aim is to explore cognitive, emotional, and attitudinal processes that hinder or enable forgiveness. A mixed-methodology was used, with two studies conducted in the departments of Atlántico and Caldas. In the first study, a phenomenological design was applied to uncover ideas and emotions regarding memory and forgiveness among leaders of victim collectives. In the second study, a non-experimental design was implemented to analyze the interaction between three factors explaining the disposition to forgive (DP): enduring resentment (RD), sensitivity to circumstances (SC), and unconditional forgiveness (PI). The qualitative study revealed meanings surrounding memory that constrain forgiveness (RD, exclusive victim beliefs, and perceived obstacles to the effectiveness of transitional justice measures), as well as memory resignifications that promote forgiveness (understanding of the conflict, inclusive victim beliefs, memory linked to transitional justice, and PI). The quantitative study indicated that SC explains PI, while RD poses an obstacle. The research progresses towards a deeper comprehension of the connection between memory and forgiveness in transitional settings, unveiling challenges in effectively managing memory with forgiveness in mind. It highlights the significance of addressing RD and fostering SC to facilitate forgiveness, not only at the national level but also at the local and regional scales.
En un contexto permeado por varios procesos de justicia transicional y aún afectado por dinámicas de violencia, este artículo analiza dimensiones psicosociales vinculadas al perdón y a la memoria en experiencias de integrantes de organizaciones sociales víctimas del conflicto armado colombiano, para conocer y explorar procesos cognitivos, emocionales y actitudinales que limitan y que facilitan el perdón. Se desarrolló una metodología mixta con dos estudios en los departamentos del Atlántico y Caldas. En el primero se aplicó un diseño fenomenológico para descubrir ideas y emociones sobre memoria y perdón en líderes de colectivos de víctimas; en el segundo se implementó un diseño no experimental para analizar la interacción entre tres factores que explican la disposición al perdón (DP): resentimiento duradero (RD), sensibilidad a las circunstancias (SC) y perdón incondicional (PI). El estudio cualitativo evidenció sentidos alrededor de la memoria que limitan el perdón (RD, creencias de víctimas exclusivas y obstáculos percibidos para la eficacia de medidas de justicia transicional) y resignificaciones de la memoria que lo favorecen (comprensión del conflicto, creencias de víctimas inclusivas, memoria vinculada a la justicia transicional y PI). El estudio cuantitativo indicó que la SC explica el PI, mientras que el RD constituye un obstáculo.

Aproximación al encuentro entre la mística y la posibilidad de ser,"The meaning of life is found beyond eschatological concepts that, on occasions, separate human beings from their constitution as a project. This meaning can be founded, from a Heideggerian perspective, in the “fact” of being-in-the-world. This conception gives rise to the need to better understand the phenomenon of religious life as a manifestation of the search for meaning that continues to question the human being who returns to the religious phenomenon that seeks an answer to his search for the meaning of life and the fact that such a searchrefers to the very mystery of existing. The human being of the religious phenomenon is not exempt from the tentatio, considered by primitive Christianity as a dispersion. Such tentatio, however, could be an element of great value in life, to the extent that it manages to lead the human being to a meaning: reflection before the very mystery of living. In this context, questions arise such as: To what extent can philosophy contribute to rethink the religious phenomenon? How has the phenomenon of religious life been read and how should it be read? Why look again at this phenomenon in today’s world? This article will take as its main reference Heidegger’sPhenomenology of Religious Life, a work from which some concepts of primitive Christianity could be better understood for a reflection and understanding such that the reader can analyze the meaning of religious life beyond institutions in a fundamentally mystical perspective.",,,Cuestiones teológicas,,,,2023-01,2023,2023-01,,50,113,1-15,All OA; Gold,Article,"Castañeda, Diego Fernando Valencia","Castañeda, Diego Fernando Valencia (Universidad de San Buenaventura)",,"Castañeda, Diego Fernando Valencia (Universidad de San Buenaventura)",0,0,,,https://revistas.upb.edu.co/index.php/cuestiones/article/download/7506/7036,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1155362026,50 Philosophy and Religious Studies; 5004 Religious Studies; 5005 Theology,

Case report,"INTRODUCTION AND IMPORTANCE: Omental torsion as a cause of acute abdominal pain is extremely rare and difficult to diagnose preoperatively given the non-specific clinical picture.
PRESENTATION OF CASE: We report the case of an adult male who went to the emergency room due to abdominal pain, presented clinical symptoms and laboratory findings consistent with acute appendicitis but was diagnosed intraoperatively with omental torsion and associated necrosis, which was successfully treated by laparoscopic omentectomy.
DISCUSSION: It is a rare entity with a low incidence. The symptoms of the cases reported in the literature are usually confused with other abdominal pathologies such as appendicitis or cholecystitis, so preoperative diagnosis continues to be a challenge. The treatment of choice is the laparoscopic approach, since it allows confirming the diagnosis, evaluating the severity of the ischemia, and ruling out other surgical pathologies.
CONCLUSION: It is important to consider omental torsion as another differential diagnosis of acute abdomen, which can be satisfactorily resolved via laparoscopy, thus avoiding the development of complications associated with its natural evolution.","Thanks to the Hospital General Tercer Milenio and the staff that make up the honorable General Surgery service, for their time, dedication and effort in teaching.

The aim of this bibliometric study is to perform a bibliometric indicator analysis of the worldwide academic production of NMOSD during the period 2017-2021.
METHODS: A bibliographic search was assessed in the Scopus database to identify NMOSD-related articles published during the period 2017-2021. Collected publications were exported and analyzed in Scival (Elsevier). Bibliographic data were described through absolute values and percentages in descriptive tables. VOSviewer was used to visualize collaborative networks.
RESULTS: A total of 1920 documents were collected, and the highest percentage of these belonged to the area of neurology. Friedemann Paul was the author with the highest scientific production, but Brian Weinshenker had the greatest impact worldwide. Three of the institutions with the highest production were North American. Multiple sclerosis and related disorders were the journal with the highest production of publications. Most papers were published in Q1 or Q2 journals.
CONCLUSION: NMOSD-related articles are mostly published in first and second quartile journals, which would reflect a high interest of the scientific community.

This study aimed to identify the psychosocial and sociodemographic factors associated with BS among resident physicians from a public hospital. Materials and methods: This cross-sectional and correlational study involved 47 resident physicians. The Occupational Burnout Scale (EDO), the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory-2 Restructured Form, and a sociodemographic questionnaire were applied. The data were analyzed by using nonparametric Spearman’s correlation test. Results: We found that 25.6% of the participants had a high level of burnout, while 51% showed a high level of emotional exhaustion. Regarding personality and sociodemographic factors associated with BS, only the impulsivity scale (r = 0.341, p = 0.019) and the hours of exercise performed in a week (r = −0.414, p = 0.004) showed a significant relationship (p < 0.05). When segmented by sex, a relationship between BS and psychoticism (r = 0.468, p = 0.018), decreased physical activity (r = −0.620, p = 0.001), and first years of residence (r = −0.396, p = 0.050) were noted only in men. Conclusions: A high level of emotional exhaustion was evidenced among the medical residents in relation to the development of their activities, which were associated with problems in the management of impulses, distortions of reality (due to psychoticism), belonging to the first years of residency, and the lack of physical exercise.

The 4a and 4b structures crystallized in monoclinic and triclinic systems with space groups P21/n and P1̄, respectively. Theoretical calculations were performed at the DFT/B3LYP level for the optimized geometries. The results were in excellent agreement with the experimental data (spectroscopic and XRD). This investigation encompasses molecular modeling studies including Hirshfeld surface analysis, energy framework calculations, and frontier molecular orbital analysis. Intermolecular interactions within the crystal structures of the compounds were explored through Hirshfeld surface analysis, which revealed the notable presence of hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interactions. This insight provides valuable information on the structural stability and potential solubility characteristics of these compounds. The research was extended to docking analysis with eight distinct kinases (BRAF, HER2, CSF1R, MEK2, PDGFRA, JAK, AKT1, and AKT2). The results of this analysis demonstrate that both 4a and 4b interact effectively with the kinase-binding sites through a combination of hydrophobic interactions and hydrogen bonding. Compound 4a had the best affinity for proteins; this is related to the fact that the compound is not rigid and has a small size, allowing it to sit well at any binding site. This study contributes to the advancement of kinase inhibitor research and offers potential avenues for the development of new therapeutic agents for cancer treatment.","The authors acknowledge the Research Group of the Laboratory of Organic Synthesis and Biological Activity of the University of Talca.

The methodology used is based on recent approaches to regional studies, especially those that emphasize the importance of conceiving regions as spaces shaped by the movement of people and ideas. The main conclusion is that Chocó’s inclusion in the Liga Costeña was motivated by two factors: first, the historical ties that existed between the inhabitants of both regions; and second, the common interest in finding a solution to the negative effects of the centralization process of the Colombian State on Chocó and the Caribbean coast in the early 20th century.",,,Sociedad y Economía,,,,2023-08-22,2023,2023-08-22,,,49,e10211983-e10211983,All OA; Gold,Article,"Flórez-Bolívar, Francisco Javier; Rhenals-Doria, Ana Milena; Flórez-Bolívar, Roicer Alberto","Flórez-Bolívar, Francisco Javier (Universidad de Cartagena, Cartagena, Colombia); Rhenals-Doria, Ana Milena (Universidad Industrial de Santander, Bucaramanga, Colombia); Flórez-Bolívar, Roicer Alberto (Universidad de Cartagena, Cartagena, Colombia)",,"Flórez-Bolívar, Francisco Javier (University of Cartagena); Rhenals-Doria, Ana Milena (Industrial University of Santander); Flórez-Bolívar, Roicer Alberto (University of Cartagena)",0,0,,,https://sociedadyeconomia.univalle.edu.co/index.php/sociedad_y_economia/article/download/11983/16049,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1163491819,"43 History, Heritage and Archaeology; 4303 Historical Studies; 44 Human Society",

This technology is potentially used for metals like Li, Cu, Ca, Mg, Na, K, Sr, and others that are mostly obtained from natural brine sources through a combination of pumping, solar evaporation, and solvent extraction steps. As the future demand for metals for the electronic industry increases, new forms of marine mining processing alternatives are being implemented. Unfortunately, both land and marine mining, such as off-shore and deep sea types, have great potential for severe environmental disruption. In this context, a green alternative is the mixing entropy battery, which is a promising technique whereby the ions are captured from a saline natural source and released into a recovery solution with low ionic force using intercalation materials such as Prussian Blue Analogue (PBA) to store cations inside its crystal structure. This new technique, called ""electrochemical ion pumping"", has been proposed for water desalination, lithium concentration, and blue energy recovery using the difference in salt concentration. The raw material for this technology is a saline solution containing ions of interest, such as seawater, natural brines, or industrial waste. In particular, six main ions of interest-Na+, K+, Mg2+, Ca2+, Cl-, and SO42--are found in seawater, and they constitute 99.5% of the world's total dissolved salts. This manuscript provides relevant information about this new non-evaporative process for recovering metals from aqueous salty solutions using hexacianometals such as CuHCF, NiHCF, and CoHCF as electrodes, among others, for selective ion removal.","This work was partially carried out by Felipe M.

Because under-five children of families that experience economic deprivation report poorer developmental outcomes, lately greater attention has been directed at studying and intervening in caregiver practices during early childhood. This study aimed to describe childcare practices utilized by caregivers of under-five children (N = 110) residing in a Colombian city; it also sought to test differences in caregiving practices across sociodemographic characteristics. Results from nonparametric statistical analyses showed that caregivers of high- and medium-income families engaged more frequently in tasks related to sleep hygiene (ꭓ2(2) = 9.34, p = .009, and less negative socio-emotional interactions (e.g., punishment) than low-income peers (ꭓ2(2) = 9.33, p = .009). Caregivers who were employed or students reported more involvement in sleep hygiene tasks and less negative emotional interactions than homemakers and retired caregivers (w = 1878, p <.001). An increase in the number of children in the household was positively associated with greater negative socioemotional care, r = .21, S = 173556, p = .02.

Three training and testing cases were designed, with different input variables and varying the network target between active power and wind speed. The dataset was obtained from the Kaggle platform, and is made up of five variables: date, active power, wind speed, theoretical power, and wind direction; each with 50,530 samples, which were preprocessed and, in some cases, normalized, to facilitate the neural network learning. For the training, testing and validation processes, a correlation coefficient of 0.9589 was obtained for the best scenario with the data from Turkey, while the best correlation coefficient for the data from Santa Marta was 0.8537.",,,International Journal of Electrical and Computer Engineering (IJECE),,,,2023-10-01,2023,2023-10-01,,13,5,4856-4867,All OA; Gold,Article,"Guillot, Jordan; Leal, Diego Restrepo; Robles-Algarín, Carlos; Oliveros, Ingrid; Niño-Suárez, Paola Andrea","Guillot, Jordan (Universidad del Magdalena); Leal, Diego Restrepo (Universidad del Magdalena); Robles-Algarín, Carlos (Universidad del Magdalena); Oliveros, Ingrid (Universidad del Norte); Niño-Suárez, Paola Andrea (Centro de Investigación y Estudios Avanzados)",,"Guillot, Jordan (University of Magdalena); Leal, Diego Restrepo (University of Magdalena); Robles-Algarín, Carlos (University of Magdalena); Oliveros, Ingrid (Universidad del Norte); Niño-Suárez, Paola Andrea (Centro de Investigación y Estudios Avanzados)",2,2,,,https://ijece.iaescore.com/index.php/IJECE/article/download/30510/16789,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1160035722,40 Engineering; 46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4611 Machine Learning,7 Affordable and Clean Energy

Case report: A seven-year-old patient was admitted to the emergency department due to fever and headache. An initial diagnostic approach of febrile syndrome secondary to skin and soft tissue infection was carried out. A subsequent simple skull tomography identified osteomyelitis of the frontal bone, pansinusitis, and right epidural abscess indicating a prolonged febrile syndrome secondary to Pott's tumor; the patient was referred to neurosurgery for comprehensive management. Conclusions: Pott's tumor being a rare entity in pediatrics, it is essential to diagnose it promptly since it implies a complication that could put the patient's life at risk.

1963,pub.1157029919,10.1109/access.2023.3264713,,,An Architecture to Improve Energy-Related Time-Series Model Validity Based on the Novel rMAPE Performance Metric,"In this paper, an architecture based on computational intelligence for time series modeling is proposed to guarantee the automatic adjustability of trained models no matter the dynamic behavior of the modeled phenomena. Time series are widely used to plan and execute operational and strategic tasks related to the need of forecasting phenomena. Several conventional and non-conventional techniques have been studied for time series modeling. However, the model performance and metrics are affected by non-stationary behaviors. In addition, determining effectively when a model fails can be problematic because the Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) metric does not necessarily reveal changes in the model predicted curve. Therefore, a novel metric to assess the performance is proposed; and then, an effective maintenance routine for the time-series model is properly devised. Thus, an auditor is created to identify when a model must be updated before losing forecast performance. Hence, using the defined rMAPE performance metric, the auditor output trustworthy detects if the updating process does not achieve better performance, and if replacing a time-series model is required. It is important to note that the devised scheme counts with several assemblies in a local knowledge base. The intelligent system allows building time-series models automatically considering exogenous variables such as weather, calendar, and statistical transformations that can lead to the number of models required for a particular application. The proposed approach has been experimentally tested for power consumption and energy price via simulation. The forecasting results showed an improvement in the MAPE of up to 23% in the tests performed.",,"This work was supported in part by the Colombian Ministry of Science and Technology, Ministerio de Ciencia, Tecnología e Innovación (MINCIENCIAS); and in part by the Educational Founding for National Doctorates under Grant 785.",IEEE Access,,,,2023-01-01,2023,2023-04-05,2023-01-01,11,,36004-36014,All OA; Gold,Article,"Mares, Jamer Jiménez; Charris, Daniela; Pardo, Mauricio; M, Christian G.

This paper proposes the utilization and control of repurposed EVBs in Community Energy Storage Systems (CESSs) in Low-Voltage (LV) distribution networks. A real-time Community Energy Management System (CEMS) is proposed for the control of the CESS, which uses repurposed EVBs and a power electronic interface comprised of a four-quadrant ac/dc converter and a bidirectional dc/dc converter together with the corresponding controllers. To assess the capability of the controller in providing CESS services in the form of active and reactive power control in an LV residential distribution network, four case studies are carried out using Hardware-in-the-Loop (HIL) simulations. The HIL simulations use an actual battery pack and a four-quadrants converter system. The impact of the proposed controller on the repurposed EVBs’ cycling performance is evaluated using a Rainflow Counting Algorithm (RCA). The distribution transformer Loss of Life (LoL) is also estimated. The HIL simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed real-time CEMS in slowing down the degradation of the battery and LoL of the distribution transformer, while improving the LV distribution system’s voltage profile.","The authors would like to thank the University of Waterloo, Waterloo, Canada, Qassim University, Qassim, Saudi Arabia, and Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia, for their valuable contributions to this research.",,IEEE Access,,,,2023-01-01,2023,2023-12-25,2023-01-01,11,,146238-146249,All OA; Gold,Article,"Alharbi, Talal; Restrepo, Mauricio; Kazerani, Mehrdad; Bhattacharya, Kankar","Alharbi, Talal (Department of Electrical Engineering, College of Engineering, Qassim University, Buraydah, Qassim, 52571, Saudi Arabia); Restrepo, Mauricio (Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, 081007, Colombia); Kazerani, Mehrdad (Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Waterloo, Waterloo, ON, N2L 3G1, Canada); Bhattacharya, Kankar (Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Waterloo, Waterloo, ON, N2L 3G1, Canada)","Alharbi, Talal (Qassim University)","Alharbi, Talal (Qassim University); Restrepo, Mauricio (Universidad del Norte); Kazerani, Mehrdad (University of Waterloo); Bhattacharya, Kankar (University of Waterloo)",2,2,,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/ielx7/6287639/6514899/10373410.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1167351058,"40 Engineering; 4007 Control Engineering, Mechatronics and Robotics; 4008 Electrical Engineering; 4009 Electronics, Sensors and Digital Hardware; 4010 Engineering Practice and Education",7 Affordable and Clean Energy

Historically, this state has been found mainly in 3-dimensional complex oxides, but so far, this state has still been elusive for the most widely studied and characterized family of 2-dimensional compounds, the transition metal dichalcogenides. In this study, we report the experimental realization of multiferroic states in this family of materials, at room temperature, in bulk single crystals of Te-doped WSe2. We observe the coexistence of ferromagnetism and ferroelectricity, evidenced in the presence of magnetization and piezoresponse force microscopy hysteresis loops.

Therefore, the objective of this paper was to characterize the development of virtual classes from the perspective of the professors of the Universidad del Norte subsidiary Itá, Paraguay, during the COVID-19 pandemic. Regarding the type of research, it consisted of a non-experimental, mixed, descriptive, and cross-sectional one, in which the investigators employed techniques such as survey and observation. In terms of the study population, it consisted of 46 teachers. Furthermore, the results indicated that the use of technologies to develop educational activities produced didactic methodological variants for teachers and learning for students, both in the development of the topics and in the way of examining or verifying the acquisition of knowledge and achievement of objectives. When using different technological resources, the professors found difficulties such as the lack of previous preparation, poor connection or access to the Internet, and a longer time spent preparing classes. However, the virtual distance modality allowed progress in the educational field despite obstacles, resulting in a useful and convenient alternative in the learning process. Nonetheless, in order to achieve greater efficiency in teaching-learning a process of continuous and comprehensive improvement of this modality must be established.",,,Revista Educación,,,,2023-07-26,2023,2023-07-26,,,,,All OA; Gold,Article,"Picón, Gerardo Armando; Samaniego, Coral Stefany Cáceres","Picón, Gerardo Armando (Universidad Privada María Serrana); Samaniego, Coral Stefany Cáceres (Universidad del Norte)",,"Picón, Gerardo Armando (Universidad Privada María Serrana); Samaniego, Coral Stefany Cáceres (Universidad del Norte)",0,0,,,https://revistas.ucr.ac.cr/index.php/educacion/article/download/53696/56619,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1162889797,39 Education; 3901 Curriculum and Pedagogy,4 Quality Education

This article shows the advances of qualitative research with a design in realistic ethnographic action research. This study explores aspects of the written and lived curriculum that align or clash with the practices of the community served by a public ethno educational institution in Colombia. It is based on cultural diversity, ethnic-education, intercultural education, and intercultural curriculum. This realistic ethnographic action research comprises several moments. We report on the Exploration moment built with the educational community, sabedores, and leaders. The results highlight the potential of community school practices to align the curriculum, that ethno-educational pedagogical experiences and classroom projects clash with the general pedagogical model.

Additionally, the increasing number of clients with mobile devices with high processing capabilities and the prevalence of non-delay tolerant traffic have led to the demand for non-feedback multicast schemes regarding distributed resource management. Current communication platforms lack gradual and dynamic coding control based on the type of data being transmitted. This paper proposes a reliable transmission scheme based on a concatenation of systematic coding and Random Linear Network Coding (RLNC) called Fulcrum coding. This hybrid rateless coding scheme with distributed characteristics allows the implementation of an adaptive resource management system to increase the decoding probability during data reception. The method ultimately results in a higher network throughput and shorter transmission times (RTT) per packet by implementing efficient Forward Error Correction (FEC).",,This work was supported by the Advance in Doctoral Research (The design of next-generation distributed codes and a balance in the performance of multicast networks).,IEEE Access,,,,2023-01-01,2023,2023-05-01,2023-01-01,11,,73839-73849,All OA; Gold,Article,"Julio, Yair Rivera; García, Ismael Gutiérrez; Díaz, José Márquez","Julio, Yair Rivera (Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, 01800, Colombia); García, Ismael Gutiérrez (Department of Mathematics, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, 01800, Colombia); Díaz, José Márquez (Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, 01800, Colombia)","Julio, Yair Rivera (Universidad del Norte)","Julio, Yair Rivera (Universidad del Norte); García, Ismael Gutiérrez (Universidad del Norte); Díaz, José Márquez (Universidad del Norte)",4,4,,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/ielx7/6287639/6514899/10113311.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1157671678,40 Engineering; 4006 Communications Engineering; 46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4613 Theory Of Computation,

Furthermore, there have been limited studies on its measurement invariance across cross-cultural subgroups, genders, and sexual orientations.
AIMS: The present study aimed to examine the fit of different measurement models for the AUDIT and its measurement invariance across a wide range of subgroups by country, language, gender, and sexual orientation.
METHODS: Responses concerning past-year alcohol use from the participants of the cross-sectional International Sex Survey were considered (N = 62,943; Mage: 32.73; SD = 12.59). Confirmatory factor analysis, as well as measurement invariance tests were performed for 21 countries, 14 languages, three genders, and four sexual-orientation subgroups that met the minimum sample size requirement for inclusion in these analyses.
RESULTS: A two-factor model with factors describing 'alcohol use' (items 1-3) and 'alcohol problems' (items 4-10) showed the best model fit across countries, languages, genders, and sexual orientations. For the former two, scalar and latent mean levels of invariance were reached considering different criteria. For gender and sexual orientation, a latent mean level of invariance was reached.
CONCLUSIONS: In line with the two-factor model, the calculation of separate alcohol-use and alcohol-problem scores is recommended when using the AUDIT. The high levels of measurement invariance achieved for the AUDIT support its use in cross-cultural research, capable also of meaningful comparisons among genders and sexual orientations.",,,Comprehensive Psychiatry,,,"Humans; Male; Female; Alcoholism; Cross-Cultural Comparison; Psychometrics; Cross-Sectional Studies; Sexual Behavior; Surveys and Questionnaires; Factor Analysis, Statistical; Reproducibility of Results",2023-09-23,2023,2023-09-23,2023-11,127,,152427,All OA; Gold,Article,"Horváth, Zsolt; Nagy, Léna; Koós, Mónika; Kraus, Shane W; Demetrovics, Zsolt; Potenza, Marc N; Ballester-Arnal, Rafael; Batthyány, Dominik; Bergeron, Sophie; Billieux, Joël; Briken, Peer; Burkauskas, Julius; Cárdenas-López, Georgina; Carvalho, Joana; Castro-Calvo, Jesús; Chen, Lijun; Ciocca, Giacomo; Corazza, Ornella; Csako, Rita; Fernandez, David P; Fujiwara, Hironobu; Fernandez, Elaine F; Fuss, Johannes; Gabrhelík, Roman; Gewirtz-Meydan, Ateret; Gjoneska, Biljana; Gola, Mateusz; Grubbs, Joshua B; Hashim, Hashim T; Islam, Md Saiful; Ismail, Mustafa; Jiménez-Martínez, Martha C; Jurin, Tanja; Kalina, Ondrej; Klein, Verena; Költő, András; Lee, Sang-Kyu; Lewczuk, Karol; Lin, Chung-Ying; Lochner, Christine; López-Alvarado, Silvia; Lukavská, Kateřina; Mayta-Tristán, Percy; Miller, Dan J; Orosová, Oľga; Orosz, Gábor; Ponce, Fernando P; Quintana, Gonzalo R; Quintero Garzola, Gabriel C; Ramos-Diaz, Jano; Rigaud, Kévin; Rousseau, Ann; Scanavino, Marco De Tubino; Schulmeyer, Marion K; Sharan, Pratap; Shibata, Mami; Shoib, Sheikh; Sigre-Leirós, Vera; Sniewski, Luke; Spasovski, Ognen; Steibliene, Vesta; Stein, Dan J; Strizek, Julian; Tsai, Meng-Che; Ünsal, Berk C; Vaillancourt-Morel, Marie-Pier; Van Hout, Marie Claire; Bőthe, Beáta","Horváth, Zsolt (Institute of Psychology, ELTE Eötvös Loránd University, Budapest, Hungary; Centre of Excellence in Responsible Gaming, University of Gibraltar, Gibraltar, Gibraltar.

1884,pub.1154838275,10.1109/access.2023.3239896,,,Effects of Body Shadowing in LoRa Localization Systems,"Applications where a person carries environmental sensors benefit from knowing the position of the individual. Researchers can locate the device by analyzing the radio signals used for sending information. However, it is necessary to know the impact of body obstruction on communication links and, therefore, on the localization system. The paper studies this impact by using field tests employing one LoRa node with an omnidirectional antenna in an outdoor parking lot with vegetation. The tests use four LoRa gateways located in the corners of the area to measure the signals with and without body obstruction.

The operation of these functionalities causes topological changes on the network that must be identified since these affect protection, volt/var control, and state estimation, among others. This paper presents a data-driven topology detector for self-healing strategies in Active Distribution Networks (ADN). This approach uses machine learning (ML) techniques to obtain a trained model as a topology detector. The ML models are integrated into the Intelligent Electronic Device (IED) of ADN so that using the voltage and current signals measured locally determine the network’s topology. A features selection and tuning technique based on a multiverse optimizer are proposed to improve the ML model accuracy. This approach allows it to be implemented in decentralized architectures since each IED detects the system’s topology from local measurements and does not depend on the availability of the communication system. The proposed topology detector was validated on a modified IEEE 123 nodes test feeder considering six topology changes, five DER outages, and five load variations. The results obtained show accuracy values above 96%, which evidences a highlighted potential for real-life applications.","This work was supported by Universidad del Norte, Colombia, and Departamento Administrativo de Ciencia, Tecnología e Innovación — COLCIENCIAS (now Colombian Ministry of Science, Technology, and Innovation - Minciencias) by call contest “Convocatoria 852 — Conectando conocimiento de 2019” — Project Integra2023, code 111085271060, contract 80740-774-2020.",,Energy Reports,,,,2023-05,2023,,2023-05,9,,377-385,All OA; Gold,Article,"Marin-Quintero, J.; Orozco-Henao, C.; Mora-Florez, J.","Marin-Quintero, J.

However, the literature needs more clarification on the determinants of ex ante determinants for community participation in ecotourism in coastal lagoon ecosystems. This paper aims to analyze community-based ecosystem management through participation in ecotourism. After a case study design, a survey-like method was used to identify the social willingness to engage in ecotourism and the benefits that the participants preferred as a result of participating. The results show that most respondents believe that ecotourism would promote environmental conservation in the area and also considered their participation essential to ensure the success of ecotourism. Therefore, this research emphasizes the importance of identifying local perceptions of ecotourism before its implementation, evaluates the willingness of locals to participate in this strategy to highlight community agency, and investigates how participation could be achieved.

The proposed method is established at the application layer level to allow for the mapping of packet segments to a finite field scheme (Galois field), which allows for exploiting the algebraic properties of the system to exercise data retrieval with encoded information. In addition, it will enable dynamic adjustment of the coding parameters according to the processing capacity of the communication devices, wireless channel conditions, network topology, and type of stream in the system. In this sense, high-performance coding is distributed to nodes that can offer higher coding complexity in the design, effectively improving the wireless network’s performance in many aspects, such as delay, energy consumption, and goodput.

Now it is impossible to create a winning strategy without innovation. From the review, it can be concluded that the strategic direction of innovation largely depends on high hierarchical levels, which should have the necessary tools for formulating and implementing an innovation strategy. The proposed management model makes it easier for managers to socialize the strategy, and also provides an opportunity for all participants involved to contextualize what is formed in daily actions, exploring and experimenting, despite the risks of innovation. In addition, by formalizing the innovation management process in the structure of these companies, a greater commitment and integration of various functional areas is created, which ensures the harmonization of activities so that the initially proposed goals can be achieved together. Task mapping differs significantly from process mapping in that the goal is to determine what customers are trying to do at each stage, rather than what they are currently doing.  At each individual stage, there are several ways to make the job easier, or faster. By planning each stage of work and finding these opportunities, companies can find new ways to differentiate their offerings.

However, the protection of these networks presents significant challenges due to operational changes, such as variations in topology, distributed energy resources connection/disconnection, and microgrid operating modes, among others. This paper proposes an adaptive protection scheme based on overcurrent devices with several setting groups based on artificial intelligence algorithms. The developed strategy is composed of two stages. In the off-line stage, a clustering technique is employed to group the active distribution network operating scenarios exhibiting similarities. The optimal settings for the protection devices are determined for each set of scenarios. On the other hand, in the on-line stage, the protection strategy’s implementation and operation, considering the active distribution network’s existing communication system, are defined. Furthermore, the approach formulates the overcurrent relay coordination as a mixed-integer non-linear optimization problem, and as a result, the optimal setting of the overcurrent protection devices is obtained. It aims to minimize the operating time, considering the transformers’ thermal limits, fuse operating curves, and overcurrent relay settings. The solution is determined by using an Augmented Lagrangian genetic algorithm. The presented protection scheme is validated on the modified IEEE 34 node test feeder, considering the main operating scenarios of the active distribution networks, such as topology changes, distributed energy resource connection/disconnection, and microgrid operating modes (on-grid and off-grid).

Identifying and understanding the mechanisms that generate internal waves require long-term data on the kinetic and viscous–turbulent parameters of the water column measured over long intervals. In this sense, this study analyzed current profiles in nearshore waters (8.9 m depths) measured over six months in the Colombian Caribbean Sea and found internal waves due to the manifestation of transient acceleration propagating in two of the three layers of the water column. The analyzed time series of currents and turbulent kinetic profiles evidenced that transient waves occurred during changes in the surface winds. The applied methodology in this research allowed, for the first time in the study area, the detection of transient accelerations (±0.25 m/s2) that modified the hydrokinetic energy of the water column over short-term periods (6–24 h).","First author acknowledges IDEHA, Universidad del Norte and Universidad del Valle for supporting the research.","This research was funded by Universidad del Norte, grant number [2013–2017 (2013–2017)], and Universidad del Valle and “The APC was funded by Universidad del Valle through the research project C.I 1214”.",Water,,,,2023-07-28,2023,2023-07-28,,15,15,2725,All OA; Gold,Article,"Rueda-Bayona, Juan Gabriel; Eras, Juan José Cabello; Caicedo-Laurido, Ana Lucía; Guzmán, Andrés; Vélez, José Luis García","Rueda-Bayona, Juan Gabriel (Natural and Environmental Resources Engineering School (EIDENAR), Faculty of Engineering, Universidad del Valle, Cali 760042, Colombia;, jose.l.garcia@correounivalle.edu.co; INCIMAR Institute of Marine Sciences and Limnology, Universidad del Valle, Cali 760042, Colombia); Eras, Juan José Cabello (Departamento de Ingeniería Mecánica, Facultad de Ingeniería, Universidad de Córdoba, Carrera 6 No. 77-305, Montería 230002, Colombia;, juancabelloe@correo.unicordoba.edu.co); Caicedo-Laurido, Ana Lucía (Dirección General Marítima, Bogotá 111711, Colombia;, acaicedo@dimar.mil.co); Guzmán, Andrés (Research Group for Structures and Geotechnics (GIEG), Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Universidad del Norte, Km 5 Via Puerto Colombia, Bloque K, 8-33K, Barranquilla 080020, Colombia;, faguzman@uninorte.edu.co); Vélez, José Luis García (Natural and Environmental Resources Engineering School (EIDENAR), Faculty of Engineering, Universidad del Valle, Cali 760042, Colombia;, jose.l.garcia@correounivalle.edu.co; INCIMAR Institute of Marine Sciences and Limnology, Universidad del Valle, Cali 760042, Colombia)","Rueda-Bayona, Juan Gabriel (University of Valle; University of Valle)","Rueda-Bayona, Juan Gabriel (University of Valle; University of Valle); Eras, Juan José Cabello (University of Córdoba); Caicedo-Laurido, Ana Lucía (Dirección General Marítima); Guzmán, Andrés (Universidad del Norte); Vélez, José Luis García (University of Valle; University of Valle)",0,0,,,https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4441/15/15/2725/pdf?version=1690531357,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1162853424,37 Earth Sciences; 3708 Oceanography; 40 Engineering; 4015 Maritime Engineering,14 Life Below Water

Organizational culture, known as the set of beliefs, behaviors, values and collective practices that characterize a group of collaborators of the same organization, is based on the combination of these individual personalities. For this reason, when managing teams to execute and implement digital projects, it is important to consider the archetypes and digital profiles that allow to identify the basis of the digital culture of the organization. In this article, a theoretical basis is presented to propose a model of digital archetypes based on previously developed archetype theories. Two personality axes are proposed in order to define 4 archetypes that combine and form 8 digital personality profiles. A case study is presented in which the identification of the digital profiles of members of a work team allowed the definition of change management strategies to enhance the results of the work team.

Even though these snuff trays are part of a large group of artifacts with prominent shared characteristics that make it possible to distinguish them in formal and iconographic terms from other styles/traditions among registered hallucinogenic implements, this task had not been undertaken previously. The tradition has two different styles; the respective iconographies are outside what is recognized for the Circum-Puna area. Thus, this analysis sheds light on a possible place of origin for the tradition in general and these styles in particular. The styles also serve as indicators for the flows of macro-regional ritual exchange. Furthermore, analysis of the funerary contexts of some of these trays provides data on the temporal location of the two styles, and the paper discusses the social identity of the individuals who owned the trays.",,,Estudios Atacameños,,,,2023-12-25,2023,2023-12-25,,69,,e5493-e5493,All OA; Gold,Article,"Tricallotis, Helena Horta","Tricallotis, Helena Horta (Universidad Católica del Norte)",,"Tricallotis, Helena Horta (Catholic University of the North)",0,0,,,https://revistas.ucn.cl/index.php/estudios-atacamenos/article/download/5493/4429,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1167355602,"43 History, Heritage and Archaeology; 4301 Archaeology",

However, there are reports on patients also suffering from concomitant renal involvement, with clinical manifestations such as hematuria, proteinuria, elevated nitrogen levels and acute kidney injury. Objective: The present study reports two clinical cases of nephrotic syndrome associated with coronavirus disease (COVID-19). Clinical case presentation: Histological imaging by electron microscopy showed, in one case, evidence of minimal changes and fusion of podocytes pedicels, and in the other one, podocytopathy with pedicels loss (70%) and focal sclerosis of capillary loops. Discussion: Proteinuria in COVID-19 can be secondary to glomerular and acute tubular lesions, with a multifactorial origin: Hemodynamic factors, cytokine storms, secondary infections, drug-induced nephrotoxicity and direct viral infection (proximal tubule cells and podocytes). The latter mechanisms could be explained by SARS-CoV2 renal tropism.

The research for alternative raw materials becomes interesting, since most of the resources come from planted forests. In addition, the investigation of new raw materials must take into account environmentally correct solutions, such as the use of alternative natural fibers, use of agro-industrial residues, and resins of vegetable origin. The objective of this study was to evaluate the physical properties of panels manufactured by hot pressing using eucalyptus sawdust, chamotte, and polyurethane resin based on castor oil as raw materials. Eight formulations were designed with variations of 0, 5, 10, and 15% of chamotte, and two variations of resin with 10% and 15% of volumetric fraction. Tests of gravimetric density, X-ray densitometry, moisture content, water absorption, thickness swelling, and scanning electron microscopy were carried out. Through the results it can be noticed that the incorporation of chamotte in the manufacture of the panels increased the water absorption and the swelling in thickness, around 100% and the use of 15% of resin decreased, more than 50%, the values of these properties. X-ray densitometry analyzes showed that the addition of chamotte alters the density profile of the panel.

The lack of biotransformation capabilities of many in vitro systems may under- or overestimate the hazard of compounds that are metabolized to more or less active metabolites in vivo. One approach to retrofitting existing bioassays with metabolic competence is the lid-based Alginate Immobilization of Metabolic Enzymes (AIME) method, which adds hepatic metabolism to conventional high-throughput screening platforms. Here, limitations of the lid-based AIME method were addressed by incorporating bioprinting, which involved depositing S9-encapsulated microspheres into standard 384-well plates with requisite cofactors for phase I and II hepatic metabolism. Objectives of this study included: 1) compare the lid-based and AIME bioprinting methods by assessing the enzymatic activity of a common cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzyme, 2) use biochemical assays with the bioprinting method to characterize additional measures of phase I and II metabolic activity, and 3) evaluate the bioprinting method by screening 25 chemicals of known metabolism-dependent bioactivity in the VM7Luc estrogen receptor transactivation (ERTA) assay. A comparison of the two methods revealed comparable precision and dynamic range. Activity of additional CYP enzymes and glucuronidation was observed using the AIME bioprinting method. The ERTA experiment identified 19/21 ER-active test chemicals, 14 of which were concordant with expected biotransformation effects (73.7%). Additional refinement of the AIME bioprinting method has the potential to expand high-throughput screening capabilities in a robust, accessible manner to incorporate in vitro metabolic competence.","The authors thank Todd Zurlinden, Madison Feshuk, and Jason Brown for assistance with running the ToxCast Data Analysis Pipeline, as well as Steven Simmons, Joshua Harrill, John Cowden, and Sid Hunter for technical review and critical reading of the manuscript.",This work was funded by U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.,Frontiers in Toxicology,,,,2023-05-04,2023,2023-05-04,,5,,1196245,All OA; Gold,Article,"Hopperstad, Kristen; Deisenroth, Chad","Hopperstad, Kristen (Center for Computational Toxicology and Exposure, Office of Research and Development, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Durham, NC, United States); Deisenroth, Chad (Center for Computational Toxicology and Exposure, Office of Research and Development, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Durham, NC, United States)","Deisenroth, Chad (Environmental Protection Agency)","Hopperstad, Kristen (Environmental Protection Agency); Deisenroth, Chad (Environmental Protection Agency)",2,2,,,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/ftox.2023.1196245/pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1157764430,34 Chemical Sciences; 3404 Medicinal and Biomolecular Chemistry; 41 Environmental Sciences,

ABSTRACT Introduction: efficient time management is emerging as a core competency for medical students. Acquiring this skill enables them to effectively manage their agendas, thus avoiding the inherent stress in their training and ensuring successful performance. It also improves their ability to balance their academic and personal commitments by improving their decision-making skills, such as effective task prioritization and preventing task-overload situations that may undermine their performance. Methodology: this was a descriptive, observational study of prevalence and cross-association conducted in medical students in Paraguay to assess their time management skills. To measure time management, the Spanish version of the Time Management Behavior Questionnaire for University Students was used. This is a self-administered instrument that includes 34 items related to how students manage their learning and study time. Results: the correlation between quantitative variables showed a relationship between age and the “setting goals and priorities” subscale; (r= -0.208; p=0.038); this association was indirect and weak. In terms of mean differences, a relationship was found between sex and the “time management tools” subscale; (t=-2.37; gl=98; p=0.020), with men (2.61 0.89) having a lower mean than women (3.04 0.74).

The aim was to assess the extent to which explicit modelled and scaffolded writing of generic exemplars resulted in freshmen’s appropriation of the generic features of the target genre. The analysis of independently produced instances showed students’ appropriation of the contextual structure of factorial explanations as well as adequate control of textual and ideational resources for making meaning across generic stages and phases. We discuss findings in connection with the contribution of Genre Based Literacy Pedagogy in the development of reading and writing skills in initial literacy education at the university level.

1782,pub.1163159848,10.1080/14786451.2023.2244605,,,A techno-economic assessment for fuel cells hybrid systems in stationary applications,"This study evaluates the techno-economic feasibility of integrating fuel cells into stand-alone power generation systems, combined with different technologies such as diesel generators, wind turbines, and batteries. An optimisation analysis was performed using the Hybrid Optimization Model for Multiple Energy Resources (HOMER) software to minimise energy costs and several system architectures were obtained for different operating scenarios. The performance and cash flow of the selected system were included. The results suggest that the combination of traditional technologies for fuel cell power generation could be feasible for a country like Colombia, depending on economic factors such as the Consumer Price Index (CPI), the discount rate, and the availability of renewable resources. The proposed system achieves a Levelized Cost of Electricity (LCOE) of $0.112/kWh, comparable to state-of-the-art systems in the literature. This research contributes to the global effort of transitioning to alternative energy sources and reducing carbon emissions.","The authors want to thank COLCIENCIAS (now Minciencias) and Fondo Nacional de Financiamiento para la Ciencia, la Tecnología y la Innovación Francisco José de Caldas for their support in the project identified with the code 1215-669-46500, and Universidad del Norte for the Doctoral Program Scholarship.","The authors want to thank COLCIENCIAS (now Minciencias) and Fondo Nacional de Financiamiento para la Ciencia, la Tecnología y la Innovación Francisco José de Caldas for their support in the project identified with the code 1215-669-46500, and Universidad del Norte for the Doctoral Program Scholarship.",International Journal of Sustainable Energy,,,,2023-08-09,2023,2023-08-09,2023-12-14,42,1,889-912,All OA; Gold,Article,"Fontalvo, Victor M.; Nelson, George J.; Pupo-Roncallo, Oscar; Sanjuan, Marco E.; Gómez, Humberto A.","Fontalvo, Victor M.

This article presents a novel model for evaluating the emissions from the production of metakaolin (MK) as a supplementary cementitious material used in ternary blended cements (e.g., 35% metakaolin, 15% limestone, and 50% portland cement) and an accompanying decisions-support tool (MKC-Tool). Applications with a case study in California showed 36%–39% reductions in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from ternary blends with MK compared to portland cement. Compared to commercially available blended cements, the ternary blend showed the lowest global warming potential. All the cements containing fly ash showed higher GHG intensities than the ternary blend (16%–42% higher GHG emissions). The development of cements made with portland cement, metakaolin, and limestone at an industrial scale will have the potential to contribute 5%–50% to the global reduction of GHG emissions from the cement industry.","Daniela M.

The objective was to determine the relationship between the predominant leadership style and educational quality reflected in these standardized evaluations. Using a quantitative-correlational methodology, data was collected through surveys and questionnaires applied to 159 teachers from six institutions. The analysis conducted with the IBM SPSS Statistics program revealed a 94,9% correlation between leadership style and SABER test results, with this relationship being statistically significant (Sig.=0,004). Transformational leadership emerged as the predominant style, encompassing around 66% of the studied institutions. This approach promotes a shared vision, positively influences the commitment of the educational community, and fosters meaningful learning. Approximately 90,1% (R-squared=0,901) of the institutions with transformational leadership surpassed the national average on SABER tests. Moreover, the pedagogical variable was identified as a fundamental pillar of educational quality.

Study design: Ecological study.
Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional ecological study based on secondary data analysis. Coverages of the first, second, and third doses of the vaccine against COVID-19 and the HDI were evaluated. The magnitude of the correlations was assessed using Spearman's rank correlation coefficients with their corresponding bootstrapped 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). Scatter plots were also constructed.
Results: A total of 196 provinces were included. There was a moderate correlation between the first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine and the HDI (r = 0.3807 [95% CI 0.2585-0.5030], p < 0.0001). The same direction was found for the second (r = 0.4064 [95% CI 0.2853-0.5276], p < 0.0001) and third dose (r = 0.4435 [95% CI 0.3201-0.5669], p < 0.0001).
Conclusions: A positive correlation was found between COVID-19 vaccination coverage and the HDI, suggesting the presence of inequalities in access to vaccines.

The analysis, based on bibliographic documentation and fieldwork, focuses on the borrowability and semantic domains of Spanish loanwords and the factors motivating Spanish loanword adoption into Wayuunaiki. The results show that, despite the typological distance, Wayuunaiki is prone to adopting lexical items from Spanish, as evident in the moderate number of lexical borrowings identified. A key motivating factor for Spanish loanword incorporation is Wayuunaiki speakers’ need for lexical items to refer to new concepts adopted from the dominant Spanish-speaking culture. This phenomenon is partly due to the contact dynamics between Wayuunaiki and Spanish. Besides expanding on the description of the Wayuunaiki language and its contact with Spanish, this study contributes to identifying factors and motivations favoring the adoption of loanwords between typologically distant languages.","We deeply appreciate the comments of our reviewers and the members of the Wayuu community who took part in this study.

Short-term symptoms include abrupt changes in behavior, difficulties in interpersonal relationships, anguish, fear and guilt. In addition, physical injuries and somatic alterations are identified. In the long term, symptoms are associated with post-traumatic stress, suicidal behaviors, eating disorders, difficulties in social interaction and sometimes with drugs abuse.   Discussions: Regarding risk factors, the use of social media is visible as a reference to be considered in current dynamics. However, the literature emphasizes the need to continue consolidating the analysis of these factors and their articulation with pertinent actions for the prevention and timely attention of abuse.

The objectives were to measure the students’ attitudes towards SBL and its impact on their academic achievement in two Economic Development courses. A Student’s t-test was applied to compare the effectiveness of SBL with traditional instruction, and performance values were analyzed using minimum, maximum, and average statistics. The focus was on how effectively SBL encouraged an inquiry-based approach in students and their understanding of a country’s objectives, and how this translated into their academic success.

Our investigations employ the full-potential linearized augmented-plane-wave (FP-LAPW) method within the density functional theory (DFT) framework. The impact of varying vanadium composition (x = 0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1) on the structural, electronic, and optical characteristics of wurtzite VxAl1−xN alloys is examined in detail. Our findings reveal a distinct nonlinear relationship between the lattice constant, bulk modulus, and the concentration of vanadium (x) in the VxAl1−xN alloys. An analysis of the electronic band structures and densities of states reveals a metallic behavior in the VxAl1−xN alloys, primarily driven by the V-d states near the Fermi energy. These results shed light on the electronic properties of the alloys, contributing to a deeper understanding of their potential for various applications. Furthermore, we calculate various optical properties, including the real and imaginary dielectric functions, refractive index, energy loss spectrum, and reflectivity. The obtained optical functions provide valuable insights into the optical behavior of the VxAl1−xN alloys.

Not only should the economic and technological aspects be considered, but also the socio-environmental impact. In this sense, the development of composites with the incorporation of waste has been highlighted, aiming not only for better and/or cheaper materials, but also optimizing the use of natural resources. To obtain better results using industrial agro waste, we need to treat this waste to incorporate engineered composites and obtain the optimal results for each application desired. The objective of this work is to compare the effect of processing coconut husk particulates on the mechanical and thermal behavior of epoxy matrix composites, since we will need a smooth composite in the near future to be applied by brushes and sprayers with a high quality surface finish. This processing was carried out in a ball mill for 24 h. The matrix was a Bisphenol A diglycidyl ether (DGEBA)/triethylenetetramine (TETA) epoxy system. The tests that were performed were resistance to impact and compression, as well as the linear expansion test. Through this work, it can be observed that the processing of coconut husk powder was beneficial, allowing not only positive improvements to the properties of the composite, but also a better workability and wettability of the particulates, which was attributed to the change in the average size and shape of particulates. That means that the composites with processed coconut husk powders have improved impact strength (46 up to 51%) and compressive strength (88 up to 334%), in comparison with unprocessed particles.",We would like to thank FAPERJ and CNPq Brazilian agencies for the financial support.,"This research was funded by FAPERJ and CNPq Brazilian agencies for the financial support, by the grant numbers: E-26/202.229/2018; E-26/203.874/2022; E-26/200.847/2021 and 302976/2022-1.",Polymers,,Carlo Santulli,,2023-02-27,2023,2023-02-27,,15,5,1195,All OA; Gold,Article,"Velasco, David Coverdale Rangel; Lopes, Felipe Perissé Duarte; Souza, Djalma; Lopera, Henry Alonso Colorado; Monteiro, Sergio Neves; Vieira, Carlos Maurício Fontes","Velasco, David Coverdale Rangel (Advanced Materials Laboratory, State University of the North of Rio de Janeiro Darcy Ribeiro—UENF, Av Alberto Lamego, 2000, Campos dos Goytacazes CEP 28013-602, RJ, Brazil); Lopes, Felipe Perissé Duarte (Advanced Materials Laboratory, State University of the North of Rio de Janeiro Darcy Ribeiro—UENF, Av Alberto Lamego, 2000, Campos dos Goytacazes CEP 28013-602, RJ, Brazil); Souza, Djalma (Advanced Materials Laboratory, State University of the North of Rio de Janeiro Darcy Ribeiro—UENF, Av Alberto Lamego, 2000, Campos dos Goytacazes CEP 28013-602, RJ, Brazil); Lopera, Henry Alonso Colorado (CCComposites, Engineering school, Universidad de Antioquia (UdeA), Medellín 050001, Colombia); Monteiro, Sergio Neves (Advanced Materials Laboratory, State University of the North of Rio de Janeiro Darcy Ribeiro—UENF, Av Alberto Lamego, 2000, Campos dos Goytacazes CEP 28013-602, RJ, Brazil); Vieira, Carlos Maurício Fontes (Advanced Materials Laboratory, State University of the North of Rio de Janeiro Darcy Ribeiro—UENF, Av Alberto Lamego, 2000, Campos dos Goytacazes CEP 28013-602, RJ, Brazil)","Lopes, Felipe Perissé Duarte (Advanced Materials Laboratory, State University of the North of Rio de Janeiro Darcy Ribeiro—UENF, Av Alberto Lamego, 2000, Campos dos Goytacazes CEP 28013-602, RJ, Brazil)","Velasco, David Coverdale Rangel (Advanced Materials Laboratory, State University of the North of Rio de Janeiro Darcy Ribeiro—UENF, Av Alberto Lamego, 2000, Campos dos Goytacazes CEP 28013-602, RJ, Brazil); Lopes, Felipe Perissé Duarte (Advanced Materials Laboratory, State University of the North of Rio de Janeiro Darcy Ribeiro—UENF, Av Alberto Lamego, 2000, Campos dos Goytacazes CEP 28013-602, RJ, Brazil); Souza, Djalma (Advanced Materials Laboratory, State University of the North of Rio de Janeiro Darcy Ribeiro—UENF, Av Alberto Lamego, 2000, Campos dos Goytacazes CEP 28013-602, RJ, Brazil); Lopera, Henry Alonso Colorado (University of Antioquia); Monteiro, Sergio Neves (Advanced Materials Laboratory, State University of the North of Rio de Janeiro Darcy Ribeiro—UENF, Av Alberto Lamego, 2000, Campos dos Goytacazes CEP 28013-602, RJ, Brazil); Vieira, Carlos Maurício Fontes (Advanced Materials Laboratory, State University of the North of Rio de Janeiro Darcy Ribeiro—UENF, Av Alberto Lamego, 2000, Campos dos Goytacazes CEP 28013-602, RJ, Brazil)",7,7,,,https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4360/15/5/1195/pdf?version=1677490340,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1155800304,40 Engineering; 4016 Materials Engineering,

The experiment was conducted in Alta Floresta D'Oeste-Rondônia, Brazil. To assess nutrient accumulation, fresh fruits were collected. These were dried, processed, separated into grains and husks, and subjected to chemical analysis. Nutrient accumulation in fruits, grains, and husks, as well as the grain/husk ratio, underwent analysis of variance through the F-test (p < 0.01.

1684,pub.1164037435,10.1002/aisy.202300094,,,ConvNets for Electroencephalographic Decoding of Attempted Arm and Hand Movements of People with Spinal Cord Injury,"Brain–computer interfaces (BCIs) facilitate communication between the brain and external devices, providing an alternative solution for individuals with upper limb disabilities. The decoding of brain movement commands in BCIs relies on signal feature extraction and classification. Herein, the BNCI Horizon 2020 dataset is employed, which consists of electroencephalographic signals from ten participants with subacute and chronic cervical spinal cord injuries. These participants perform or attempt five distinct types of arm and hand movements. To extract signal features, a novel technique is introduced that estimates movement‐related cortical potentials and incorporates them into the processing pipeline. Moreover, a time‐frequency domain representation of the dataset is used as input for the classifier. Given the promising outcomes demonstrated by deep learning models in BCI classification, a pretrained ConvNet AlexNet is adopted to decode the motor tasks. The proposed method exhibits a remarkable average accuracy of 76.0% across all five categories, representing a significant advancement over existing state‐of‐the‐art techniques. Additionally, an in‐depth analysis of the convolutional layers in the model is conducted to gain comprehensive insights into the classification process. By examining the ConvNet filters and activations, the method contributes to a deeper understanding of the electrophysiology that underlies attempted movement.",Acknowledgements This research was supported by the Dirección de Gestión y Desarrollo Académico from the Universidad del Norte through their Ph.D. scholarship program.

We present the case of a male infant with opsoclonus-myoclonus syndrome secondary to persistent diarrheal disease. Case report: A five-month-old patient was admitted due to involuntary jerk-type movements and apparent disconnection from the environment, with a history of persistent diarrheal disease; complementary tests were performed with no evidence of abnormality. During the stay, the sensory alteration was documented with alternation between drowsiness and irritability, skin erythema, pruritus, recurrent episodes characterized by involuntary trunk movements and extremities of the brief jerking type associated with crying and irritability with ruddiness, with subsequent episodes of head and chest hesitation. Therefore, a diagnosis of opsoclonus-myoclonus syndrome is made, triggered by a probable enteral etiology. Conclusions: The patient's unusual presentation allows a review of the literature to sensitize the health professional in the early detection and treatment of this clinical entity.",,,Pediatría,,,,2023-03-29,2023,2023-03-29,,55,Suplemento 2,16-19,All OA; Gold,Article,"Vergara, Paula Andrea López; Castelar, Irma Caro; Otero, Cristina Muñoz; Zapata, Tatiana Andrea Rojas","Vergara, Paula Andrea López (Residente de Pediatría Universidad del Norte); Castelar, Irma Caro (Especialista en neurología pediatrica); Otero, Cristina Muñoz (Especialista en pediatría con énfasis en Medicina Interna); Zapata, Tatiana Andrea Rojas (Medico)",,"Vergara, Paula Andrea López (Residente de Pediatría Universidad del Norte); Castelar, Irma Caro (Especialista en neurología pediatrica); Otero, Cristina Muñoz (Especialista en pediatría con énfasis en Medicina Interna); Zapata, Tatiana Andrea Rojas (Medico)",0,0,,,https://revistapediatria.emnuvens.com.br/rp/article/download/309/291,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1158259889,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3202 Clinical Sciences,3 Good Health and Well Being

Objetivo: Determinar si la comorbilidad, sexo y edad se asocian a la severidad de COVID-19 en docentes universitarios. Material y métodos: Estudio de cohorte prospectivo en 115 docentes que cumplieron criterios de elegibilidad, seguimiento clínico y de laboratorio. Los datos de exposición se obtuvieron a través de un cuestionario en línea y evaluación médica. Se confirmó COVID-19 con resultados de laboratorio y el estado de gravedad mediante entrevista telefónica y visita médica domiciliaria. Se buscó la asociación utilizando el modelo lineal generalizado. Resultados: El 30,43% presentó COVID-19; incidencia: 2 casos contagiados/100 docentes/semana de seguimiento. Se analizó la probabilidad de no contagio por COVID-19, en la semana siete fue del 87,83%, a la semana 24 descendió a 69,57%.

Nonetheless, the above is not enough to diminish the environmental impacts associated with the road infrastructure industry. Accordingly, incorporating Recycled Concrete Aggregate (RCA) as a partial replacement for Natural Aggregates (NAs) in WMA design has been gaining notoriety in the literature as a viable alternative to increase sustainability. However, the eco-friendly manufacturing of WMA with RCA contents (WMA-RCA) is not easy to obtain satisfactorily because the RCA causes alterations in the mix design. Thus, this research proposes three (3) methods to determine the optimal design conditions (coarse RCA content) that minimize the environmental burdens caused by WMA-RCA production. The first method is a mathematical model based on Multiple Linear Regression (MLR), which is used as a benchmark for the other two methods. The second and third methods are computational models based on Artificial Intelligence (AI), i.e., Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) and Genetic Algorithms (GAs), respectively. Notably, the Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) was employed as the theoretical framework to support all the proposed models. Consequently, this study concludes that: (i) all the proposed methodological alternatives achieve results with a great accuracy; (ii) the GAs model is the most precise method in terms of error minimization; (iii) the MLR model is the fastest method in terms of execution time; and (iv) the ANNs model is the method that requires the longest time of running, and its exactness is at a midpoint concerning the other models.",Declaration of competing interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

Also, to increase the amount of diagnosis training of vascular surgery (VS) in civilians.   Design/methodology/approach The operation method includes five stages: strategy development and adjustment; translation of the strategy into a real-world setting; operation logistics planning; strategy analysis and adoption. The operation plan worked efficiently in this study’s sample. It demonstrated high sensibility, efficiency and safety in a real-world setting.   Findings The authors developed and implemented a flow model operating plan for screening vascular pathologies in low-income patients pro bono without proper access to vascular health care. A total of 140 patients from rural areas in Colombia were recruited to a controlled screening session where they underwent serial noninvasive ultrasound assessments conducted by health professionals of different training stages in VS.   Research limitations/implications The plan was designed to be implemented in remote, conflict areas with limited access to VS care. Vascular injuries are critically important and common among civilians and military forces in regions with active armed conflicts. As this strategy can be modified and adapted to different medical specialties and geographic areas, the authors recommend checking the related legislation and legal aspects of the intended areas where we will implement this tool.   Practical implications Different sub-specialties can implement the described method to be translated into significant areas of medicine, as the authors can adjust the deployment and execution for the assessment in peripheral areas, conflict zones and other public health crises that require a faster response. This is necessary, as the amount of training to which VS trainees are exposed is low. A simulated exercise offers a novel opportunity to enhance their current diagnostic skills using ultrasound in a controlled environment.   Social implications Evaluating and assessing patients with limited access to vascular medicine and other specialties can decrease the burden of vascular disease and related complications and increase the number of treatments available for remote communities.   Originality/value It is essential to assess the most significant number of patients and treat them according to their triage designation. This management is similar to assessment in remote areas without access to a proper VS consult. The authors were able to determine, classify and redirect to therapeutic interventions the patients with positive findings in remote areas with a fast deployment methodology in VS.   Plain language summary Access to health care is limited due to multiple barriers and the assessment and response, especially in peripheral areas that require a highly skilled team of medical professionals and related equipment. The authors tested a novel mobile assessment tool for remote and conflict areas in a rural zone of Colombia.","The authors sincerely thank the National Colombian Vascular Surgery Association – Asovascular, who helped coordinate this event’s execution and planning and their collaborators.",,Journal of Humanitarian Logistics and Supply Chain Management,,,,2023-07-11,2023,2023-07-11,2024-04-15,14,2,171-180,All OA; Gold,Article,"Rocha, Oscar Y.

The attributes were identified based on studies of high-impact repositories. A hierarchy of the identified attributes was built through the multicriteria decision methods Fuzzy Cognitive Maps and DEMATEL. Additionally, a statistical analysis of clusters was developed to determine the most relevant attributes and apply these results in academic and industrial contexts. The main contribution of this study was the categorization of user-experience quality attributes in augmented reality applications, as well as the grouping proposal. Usability, Satisfaction, Stimulation, Engagement, and Aesthetics were found to be among the most relevant attributes. After carrying out the multivariate analysis, two clusters were found with the largest grouping of attributes, oriented to security, representation, social interaction, aesthetics, ergonomics of the application, and its relationship with the user’s emotions. In conclusion, the combination of the three methods helped to identify the importance of the attributes in training processes. The holistic and detailed vision of the causal, impact, and similarity relationships between the 87 attributes analyzed were also considered. This framework will allow the generation of a baseline for the use of multicriteria methods in research into relevant aspects of Augmented Reality.",The authors thank the universities involved in the project and the Institute of Robotics and Information and Communication Technologies—IRTIC—for allowing the articulation of an interdisciplinary team for the development of the research project.

Endoscopic management involving the topical application of 50 % trichloroacetic acid (TCA) and clipping systems has favorable results and a low incidence of complications. However, it has been reported that multiple applications are necessary to achieve adequate closure. Methods This therapeutic study describes a preliminary 5-step double endoscopic approach involving topical application of 50 % TCA and clips such as the OTS/OVESCO System. Results The rTEF was completely closed in three patients (n = 3); in 2/3 of patients, the OTS/OVESCO system was used. Postoperative esophagogram confirmed the obliteration of the defect, and no patient presented with complications during the 3-year follow-up, with complete resolution of respiratory symptoms. Conclusions This preliminary study suggests that the 5-step dual endoscopic approach for closure of the rTEF is effective for both symptom resolution and complete closure of the tracheoesophageal communication.",Declaration of Competing Interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.,,Journal of Pediatric Surgery Open,,,,2023-12,2023,,2023-12,4,,100098,All OA; Gold,Article,"Abello-Munarriz, Cristóbal; Pérez-Tirado, Amiel Alberto; Jaramillo-Guerra, Laura Vanessa; Felix-Burgos, Jovany Tarek","Abello-Munarriz, Cristóbal (Chief of Pediatric Surgery, Clínica General del Norte.

Moreover, the complexity of shipping operations and container handling justifies the use of technologies to ensure information security in the face of attacks. This work contributes a blockchain-based solution with a simulated prototype for improving electronic seals for containers on terminals in ports. An electronic seal was designed, and a blockchain prototype was constructed for a container data flow. The obtained results from the prototype were evaluated using performance tests. The security issues in the blockchain were also discussed from a strategic perspective based on game theory. Finally, the simulation concluded that the blockchain improves transaction efficiency. No studies were found that integrated blockchain technology with electronic seals.

Despite various treatment options, the prognosis for HCC patients remains poor, emphasizing the need for a deeper understanding of the factors contributing to HCC development. This study investigates the role of poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation in hepatocyte maturation and its impact on hepatobiliary carcinogenesis. A conditional Parg knockout mouse model was employed, utilizing Cre recombinase under the albumin promoter to target Parg depletion specifically in hepatocytes. The disruption of the poly(ADP-ribosyl)ating pathway in hepatocytes affects the early postnatal liver development. The inability of hepatocytes to finish the late maturation step that occurs early after birth causes intensive apoptosis and acute inflammation, resulting in hypertrophic liver tissue with enlarged hepatocytes. Regeneration nodes with proliferative hepatocytes eventually replace the liver tissue and successfully fulfill the liver function. However, early developmental changes predispose these types of liver to develop pathologies, including with a malignant nature, later in life. In a chemically induced liver cancer model, Parg-depleted livers displayed a higher tendency for hepatocellular carcinoma development. This study underscores the critical role of the poly(ADP-ribosyl)ating pathway in hepatocyte maturation and highlights its involvement in liver pathologies and hepatobiliary carcinogenesis. Understanding these processes may provide valuable insights into liver biology and liver-related diseases, including cancer.",We thank Arsen S.

Fronts thus form dynamical and ephemeral ecosystems where numerous species meet across all trophic levels. Fronts are also targeted by fisheries. Capturing ocean fronts and studying their long-term variability in relation with climate change is thus key for marine resource management and spatial planning. The Mediterranean Sea and the Southwest Indian Ocean are natural laboratories to study front-marine life interactions due to their energetic flow at sub-to-mesoscales, high biodiversity (including endemic and endangered species) and numerous conservation initiatives. Based on remotely-sensed Sea Surface Temperature and Height, we compute thermal fronts (2003–2020) and attracting Lagrangian coherent structures (1994–2020), in both regions over several decades. We advocate for the combined use of both thermal fronts and attracting Lagrangian coherent structures to study front-marine life interactions. The resulting front dataset differs from other alternatives by its high spatio-temporal resolution, long time coverage, and relevant thresholds defined for ecological provinces.","This work was supported by the Mediterranean Institute of Oceanography (MIO) and the French National Institute for Sustainable Development (IRD).

1562,pub.1160290720,10.3390/infrastructures8070109,,,Properties of Hot Mix Asphalt (HMA) with Several Contents of Recycled Concrete Aggregate (RCA) †,"Continuous research efforts have been developed in the literature to raise the sustainability components of the road infrastructure industry, i.e., reduce potential contaminants and augment financial profitability. In this regard, this investigation aims to explore the feasibility of producing Hot Mix Asphalt (HMA) with the inclusion of Recycled Concrete Aggregate (RCA) as a partial substitute for coarse Natural Aggregates (NAs). Thus, four different HMAs were considered, namely HMAs with coarse RCA contents of 0, 15, 30, and 45%. Specifically, the mechanical and sustainability properties of the asphalt mixtures were determined. On the one hand, the Marshall design parameters, resilient modulus, moisture susceptibility, rutting resistance, and fatigue life were addressed as mechanical properties. Meanwhile, regarding the sustainability properties, the environmental impacts and production costs were estimated using the Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) and the Life Cycle Cost Analysis (LCCA) methodologies, respectively. Consequently, the following conclusions were obtained: (i) as the coarse RCA content increases, the mechanical behavior of the HMA progressively deteriorates; (ii) this decrease in mechanical performance is acceptable up to a 15% RCA of coarse RCA, whereas for higher dosages this alteration is abrupt; and (iii) the RCA only generates sustainability benefits at a 15% replacement amount.","The authors sincerely thank COLCIENCIAS and the Universidad del Norte for supporting this research.

This is achieved by dwelling on the idea of adapting the notion of purity in the case of a thermal Gibbs environment, yielding what we might call the ""purity"" indicator (which we denote by the symbol D in the text). We find it interesting to define an extension of this D-IM indicator in a classical context. This generalization turns out to have useful conceptual consequences when used in conjunction with the classical Shannon entropy S.

Among them, the bacteria Bartonella spp. and Anaplasma spp. are related to this zoonotic dynamic.ObjectiveThe primary goal of the present study was to determine the presence of pathogenic bacteria in kidney and liver tissues of Didelphis marsupialis; spleen, liver, and skin of Pecari tajacu; spleen, liver, and skin of Chelonoidis denticulata.MethodologyA PCR using universal and specific primers for 16 S rRNA, of Bartonella spp. with subsequent genetic sequencing were used.ResultsThe results in this study indicate that Bartonella vinsonni was detected in the liver tissue of Didelphis marsupialis using both universal primers and those specific for Bartonella sp. Anaplasma platys was detected at the liver and spleen level using universal primers. Additionally, Bartonella spp. was found at the liver, spleen, and skin level in Pecari tajacu using the specific primers. Finally, using the universal and specific primers at the skin level, Bartonella spp. was evident in Chelonoidis denticulata.ConclusionsThe presence of the DNA of the Bartonella vinsonii was detected at the liver tissue in Didelphis marsupialis. DNA of the Anaplasma platys and Bartonella spp. were identified at the spleen and liver level. This study also identified that DNA Bartonella spp. was detected in Pecari tajacu skin. Finally DNA of Bartonella spp. was evident in Chelonoidis denticulate skin.

This article reviews neural correlates of dyslexia from both electrophysiological and neuroimaging studies. Method : In this brief review, we provide electrophysiological and neuroimaging evidence from electroencephalogram (EEG) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies in dyslexia to understand functional and structural brain changes in this condition. Results: In both electrophysiological and neuroimaging studies, the most frequently reported functional impairments in dyslexia include aberrant activation of the left hemisphere occipito-temporal cortex (OTC), temporo-parietal cortex (TPC), inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), and cerebellar areas. EEG studies have mostly highlighted the important role of lower frequency bands in dyslexia, especially theta waves. Furthermore, neuroimaging studies have suggested that dyslexia is related to functional and structural impairments in the left hemisphere regions associated with reading and language, including reduced grey matter volume in the left TPC, decreased white matter connectivity between reading networks, and hypo-activation of the left OTC and TPC. In addition, neural evidence from pre-reading children and infants at risk for dyslexia show that there are abnormalities in the dyslexic brain before learning to read begins. Conclusion: Advances in comprehending the neural correlates of dyslexia could bring closer translation from basic to clinical neuroscience and effective rehabilitation for individuals who struggle to read. However, neuroscience still has great potential for clinical translation that requires further research.",The authors thank the institutions where they work for encouraging the development of research.,,Iranian Journal of Psychiatry,,,,2023-09-18,2023,2023-09-18,2023-10,18,4,503-509,All OA; Gold,Article,"Hernández-Vásquez, Ronald; García, Ulises Córdova; Barreto, Ana Maritza Boy; Rojas, Milagritos Leonor Rodriguez; Ponce-Meza, Jacqueline; Saavedra-López, Miguel","Hernández-Vásquez, Ronald (Universidad Privada Norbert Wiener, Lima, Perú.); García, Ulises Córdova (Universidad César Vallejo, Lima, Perú.); Barreto, Ana Maritza Boy (Universidad César Vallejo, Lima, Perú.); Rojas, Milagritos Leonor Rodriguez (Universidad César Vallejo, Lima, Perú.); Ponce-Meza, Jacqueline (Universidad Privada del Norte, Lima, Perú.); Saavedra-López, Miguel (Universidad Continental, Cusco, Perú.)","Hernández-Vásquez, Ronald (Universidad Norbert Wiener)","Hernández-Vásquez, Ronald (Universidad Norbert Wiener); García, Ulises Córdova (Universidad César Vallejo); Barreto, Ana Maritza Boy (Universidad César Vallejo); Rojas, Milagritos Leonor Rodriguez (Universidad César Vallejo); Ponce-Meza, Jacqueline (Private University of the North); Saavedra-López, Miguel (Universidad Continental)",1,1,,,https://doi.org/10.18502/ijps.v18i4.13638,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1164390370,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 52 Psychology; 5202 Biological Psychology; 5204 Cognitive and Computational Psychology,

This study aimed to conduct a scientometric analysis to examine the dynamicity, emerging patterns, and trends over time in scientific production concerning the use of AC in oral health.MethodsThe Web of Science database was searched for articles published between 2005 and 2022. Various bibliometric indicators, including the H-index, annual growth, Lotka’s law, Bradford’s law, and Sankey diagram, were used for data analysis. Overlay maps, timezone visualization, and three field plots were used to evaluate visualization patterns, time–temporal relationships, and trends. Information retrieval process was performed on March 11, 2023.ResultsThe analysis revealed that only six studies constituted the top references with the highest number of citations in recent years, with Brooks’ 2017 study demonstrating the most significant increase in citation. The dual-map overlay demonstrated a close citation relationship between cluster 4 (Molecular Biology Immunology) and the areas of Environmental, Toxicology, and Nutrition. The visualization graph of publication patterns indicated the journals that accumulated the highest number of citations during the study period.ConclusionThis scientometric study provides valuable insights into the use of AC in oral health and its impact on the field of dentistry.

El tipo de investigación propuesto en este estudio fue mixto: los análisis cuantitativos permitieron formular estadísticamente dos perfiles epistemológicos para las visiones de NOS del profesorado participante; los cualitativos, caracterizar esas visiones, que resultaron eclécticas, en el marco de los perfiles epistemológicos propuestos. A partir de los resultados obtenidos, que muestran que los sujetos bajo estudio detentan unas visiones acerca de qué es la ciencia inadecuadas desde el punto de vista de las prescripciones curriculares vigentes, se plantea la necesidad de introducir un componente metacientífico explícito desde el comienzo mismo de la formación inicial del profesorado y se aportan ideas en tal sentido. Palabras clave: Naturaleza de la ciencia, visiones del profesorado, perfiles epistemológicos, épocas de la filosofía de la ciencia, aspectos de la filosofía de la ciencia. Views on the nature of science in teachers: Input to think about changes in their training Abstract: We studied the views on the nature of science (NOS) in a group of 105 teachers in post-graduate training in two Master’s programs in education in Colombia. The research proposed in our study used mixed methods: quantitative analyses made it possible to statistically formulate two epistemological profiles for the NOS views of the participating teachers; qualitative analyses allowed characterizing those views, which proved to be eclectic, in the framework of the proposed epistemological profiles. On the basis of the results obtained, which show that subjects under study hold views on what science is that are inadequate from the point of view of the current curriculum prescriptions, we argue in favor of introducing an explicit meta-scientific component from the very beginning of pre-service teacher education and we present ideas along this line.

1528,pub.1160331695,10.1109/access.2023.3291803,,,Development of a Robot-Assisted Telerehabilitation System With Integrated IIoT and Digital Twin,"Upper limb dysfunction (ULD) is common following a stroke, spinal cord injury, trauma, and occupational accidents. Post-stroke patients with ULD need long-term assistance from therapists for their rehabilitation, which generally occurs at the hospital or outpatient clinic. Physical therapists are unavailable because of geographical, financial, and scheduling concerns, and continuity of care needs to be improved due to the need to travel to multiple locations for therapy. As a result, providing specific, tailored therapy programs is challenging due to the absence of feedback and real-time monitoring. An effective telerehabilitation system can address this issue and is more cost-effective for healthcare providers and patients than traditional inpatient or person-to-person rehabilitation. Remotely operating robotic devices and using advanced technology improves patient and healthcare provider safety and reduces injuries. In this study, we developed a novel telerehabilitation framework for rehabilitation robots utilizing PTC’s Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) platform to remotely provide robot-aided therapies for individuals with ULD. With the developed telerehabilitation framework, an operator can teleoperate the rehab robots to deliver Upper-limb (UL) exercises via an Augmented Reality (AR) based graphical user interface (GUI). This AR platform communicates bidirectionally using ThingWorx IIOT. It leverages the digital twin (DT) structure facilitated by Vuforia studio to visualize the physical robot motions happening in remote places. The telerehabilitation framework was validated through a commercially available robot (xArm 5), an exoskeleton (SREx), and an end-effector type rehabilitation robot (DMRbot) developed at Biorobotics Lab, UWM. The experiment results show that the telerehabilitation system can successfully provide UL rehab exercises in 2D and 3D planes via AR. The proposed framework is developed to facilitate robust and more promising robot-aided rehabilitation sessions remotely, and it can also be applied in other medical applications.","The authors would like to thank PTC Inc., for providing Vuforia and ThingWorx support for this research.","This work was supported in part by the Connected System Institute, in part by the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, and in part by the Richard and Joanne Grigg Professorship.",IEEE Access,,,,2023-01-01,2023,2023-07-03,2023-01-01,11,,70174-70189,All OA; Gold,Article,"Khan, Mahafuzur Rahaman; Sunny, Samiul Haque; Ahmed, Tanvir; Shahria, Tanzil; Modi, Preet Parag; Zarif, Ishrak Islam; De, Javier Dario Sanjuan; Ahamed, Iqbal; Ahmed, Helal Uddin; Ketchum, Erin M.

La edad promedio de los participantes fue de 27 años. Se observó que el uso de sustancias psicoactivas en las y los trabajadores sexuales depende de factores de tipo personal y contextual. Los primeros se relacionan con estrategias de afrontamiento frente al estrés y la ansiedad durante el ejercicio del trabajo sexual, así como al uso lúdico y recreativo de estas sustancias, mientras que los factores contextuales están vinculados con el uso compartido SPA con los clientes y el aumento del rendimiento sexual durante el ejercicio del sexo transaccional. Conclusiones: El consumo de sustancias psicoactivas durante el ejercicio del trabajo sexual es multicausal, y, por lo tanto, es fundamental abordar este asunto de forma integral, considerando la interrelación entre el sujeto, la sustancia que se consume y los contextos sociales y sexuales donde se emplea, permitiendo definir las estrategias más pertinentes y apropiadas para disminuir los impactos sobre la salud de los implicados.",,,Salud Uninorte,,,,2023-09-22,2023,2023-09-22,2023-09-22,39,2,392-404,All OA; Gold,Article,"Restrepo Pineda, Jair Eduardo; Villegas Rojas, Soraya","Restrepo Pineda, Jair Eduardo (); Villegas Rojas, Soraya ()",,"Restrepo Pineda, Jair Eduardo (); Villegas Rojas, Soraya ()",1,1,,,https://rcientificas.uninorte.edu.co/index.php/salud/article/download/14791/214421446766/214421468696,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1164328127,,

Además, es una buena opción cuando hay perdida de los tejidos óseos, siendo imposibilitando la instalación de implantes dentarios. La PPR convencional presenta una estructura metálica que ofrece retención y resistencia a la prótesis, convirtiéndola en poco agradable a los pacientes, por el hecho de dejar evidente el metal en la cavidad oral. Muchos investigadores, con el objetivo de devolver más allá de la función y la estética, estudian diversas formas de presentación de la PPR, surgiendo así, a la Prótesis Parcial Flexible (PFlex). La PFlex es una prótesis parcial confeccionada con resina termoplástica, sin metal y con flexibilidad, pero su uso, para muchos profesionales, está limitado solo como prótesis temporales, aunque existen algunos clínicos que utilizan PFlex como alternativa de PPR convencional. Así, uno de los cuestionamientos constantes de los científicos es si realmente es posible utilizar a PFlex como alternativa protética definitiva. Por tanto, el proposito del presente trabajo fue realizar una revisión de la literatura para evaluar si el uso de prótesis parciales removibles con resina termoplástica puede ser una alternativa a las prótesis parciales convencionales, exponiendo las ventajas, desventajas, indicaciones, contraindicaciones y las propiedades del material protético.",,,Salud Uninorte,,,,2023-06-21,2023,2023-06-21,2023-06-21,39,01,265-283,All OA; Gold,Article,"Castillo Pedraza, Midian Clara; Mayumi Inagati, Cristiane; Wilches Visbal, Jorge Homero","Castillo Pedraza, Midian Clara (); Mayumi Inagati, Cristiane (); Wilches Visbal, Jorge Homero ()",,"Castillo Pedraza, Midian Clara (); Mayumi Inagati, Cristiane (); Wilches Visbal, Jorge Homero ()",0,0,,,https://rcientificas.uninorte.edu.co/index.php/salud/article/download/14490/214421446654/214421467108,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1160049193,,

Results: Out of 4,383 women who participated in the study, only 35% were aware of Law 1335, with awareness being the highest among white and married participants with college degrees, who have private health insurance, or residents in middle and high socioeconomic status. The degree of implementation varied across subregions, and participants percei-ved that monitoring tobacco consumption (M) and protecting the population from tobac-co smoke (P) have high levels of implementation in Antioquia, while warnings about the dangers of tobacco use (W) and enforcing the prohibitions on advertising, promotion, and sponsorship (E) are weak. In terms of offering help for quitting (O), only 8.5% of smokers or former smokers ever sought assistance from health professionals to quit smoking and, among those, only 2% received treatment covered by their health insurance plan. Conclusions: Even though tobacco control legislation is established at the national level, its enforcement relies heavily on local strategies.

Resultados: se consideraron para el análisis 2 categorías: la primera, relacionada con las oportunidades identificando una tendencia que mostró la presencia de la temática de caries dental a lo largo de todo el plan de estudios. En la segunda se identificaron 4 tendencias relacionadas con situaciones problemáticas y una de ellas reportó que la enseñanza de la caries dental continúa anclada en el enfoque de riesgo, con un escaso acercamiento a la dimensión social de la enfermedad, la otra planteó que en los aspectos teóricos hay una aproximación al paradigma actual, pero en la clínica predomina la concepción tradicional de la enfermedad y el énfasis restaurativo.

Se trazó el objetivo de determinar los patrones de utilización de anticonceptivos hormonales en mujeres mayores de 15 años afiliadas al Sistema de Salud de Colombia.  Materiales y métodos: Estudio de corte, que incluyó datos de mujeres mayores de 15 años con prescripciones y dispensaciones de algún anticonceptivo hormonal durante al menos tres meses continuos (abril- a junio-2016). Se creó una base de datos con información sociodemográfica, farmacológica (tipo de anticonceptivos, dosis, comedicaciones y comorbilidades. Se realizaron análisis descriptivos y multivariados buscando identificar factores asociados con comedicaciones de riesgo.  Resultados: Se identificaron 34309 mujeres que recibieron anticonceptivos hormonales, con edad media de 27,2±7,0 años (rango:13-60,8 años). Los anticonceptivos más utilizados fueron inyectables de aplicación mensual (63,0%), inyectables de aplicación trimestral (19,1%), de administración oral (12,1%), los implantes subdérmicos (7,4%) y finalmente los dispositivos intrauterinos hormonales con 0,4%. El 5,7% de las pacientes (n=1957), estaban recibiendo alguna comedicación, especialmente con antihipertensivos (2,9%) y antimigrañosos (1,9%). Ser mayor de 45 años (OR:2,3; IC95%:1,7-3,0), utilizar dispositivo intrauterino hormonal (OR:2,4; IC95%:1,4-4,1) y anticonceptivo inyectable trimestral (OR: 1,7; IC95%:1,3-2,3) se asociaron con mayor probabilidad de recibir comedicaciones.  Conclusiones. Las mujeres colombianas que acceden a anticonceptivos hormonales a través del Sistema de Salud están empleando principalmente presentaciones inyectables, con muy baja frecuencia de las orales, y en general tienen pocas comorbilidades que requieran tratamiento farmacológico, pese a que algunas tienen condiciones cardiovasculares que pueden implicar un potencial riesgo de eventos trombóticos.",,,Salud Uninorte,,,,2023-06-21,2023,2023-06-21,2023-06-21,39,01,80-94,All OA; Gold,Article,"Machado Duque, Manuel E.; Duarte Blandón, Carolina; Tobón, Luisa Marcela; Sánchez, Leidy Viviana; Machado Alba, Jorge Enrique","Machado Duque, Manuel E.

Furthermore, a reliable and valid measurement of the construct is necessary to capture its scope and meaning. Objective: To validate the structure of the Perceived Risk Scale for STIs in middle-aged and older adults, identify their perceived risk of STIs, and identify their relationship with some sociodemographic characteristics.Methods: The sample was composed of 295 middle-aged and older adults. A virtual online sampling was used. Males and females aged 50 years and older, sexually active in the last 12 months, were included. To measure the perceived risk of STIs, the scale of perceived risk for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) was adapted, and a confirmatory factor analysis of the proposed three-factor structure was carried out.Results: The proposed structure of the scale was found to present acceptable adjustment rates (χ2 = 48.283, p˂.001; CFI = .962, RMSEA = .079, GFI = .963, TLI = .938). 28.1% of the participants presented low perceived risk; 46.8%, medium perceived risk; and 25.1%, high perceived risk. Association between marital status and perceived risk of STIs was identified.

1500,pub.1159721164,10.1016/j.jmrt.2023.06.041,,,Environmentally friendly use of rice husk ash and recycled glass waste to produce ultra-high-performance concrete,"The issue of environmental pollution is one of the most pressing concerns today. A number of measures need to be taken to reduce the effects of waste materials such as rice husks, glass, plastic, and other types of materials on the environment. A significant reduction in environmental pollution can be achieved by utilizing these waste materials in construction. The purpose of this study was to investigate the use of rice husk ash (RHA) as a pozzolanic material to partially replace cement in a previously optimized mixture of recycled-glass-based Ultra-high-performance concrete (UHPC). Furthermore, this study included commercial mineral admixtures such as silica fume and limestone powder along with these components. Based on the results of the study, it can be concluded that the use of RHA in the optimized recycled glass UHPC renders the concrete much less workable and also leads to a marginal decrease in its compressive strength (by about 7%). Additionally, the study demonstrates a significant interaction between RHA and water content, attributed to the water-absorbing capacity of RHA particles, which also provides an internal curing effect. Ultimately, incorporating RHA as a partial replacement for cement in the optimized recycled-glass-based UHPC enables a substantial decrease in the concrete's carbon footprint, without causing significant harm to its performance, thereby promoting an environmentally friendly approach to concrete production.","Declaration of competing interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

Nevertheless, the construction and maintenance of pavements are necessary to guarantee the economic growth of the communities. In this way, finding novel methods, materials, and techniques is essential to achieve a more sustainable industry. One of the most promising alternatives is the implementation of Perpetual Pavements (PPs). Contrary to the Conventional Flexible Pavements (CFPs) and Conventional Rigid Pavements (CRPs), the PPs are designed for a long service life (even superior to 50 years). During this time, the PPs do not require major Maintenance and Rehabilitation (M&R) activities. Due to this characteristic, PPs could present greater sustainability attributes than conventional pavement structures. However, minimal literature is focused on examining these hypotheses since the state-of-the-art has concentrated on studying the mechanical behavior of materials and layers for PPs laying. Moreover, it is most worrying that few investigations have done this in the context of developing countries, where it is more decisive to perform better decisions in terms of economic-environmental sustainability. Consequently, this research conducts a case study on Barranquilla city (Colombia) to estimate the environmental burdens and monetary costs associated with the life cycle of three pavement alternatives, i.e., a PP, a CFP, and a CRP. The Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) and Life Cycle Cost Analysis (LCCA) methodologies were employed for these purposes. The results of this investigation demonstrated that PP provides less environmental damage and higher cost-efficiency than the CFP and CRP alternatives. Notably, the most significant contamination potential is provoked by the CRP structure. Meanwhile, the fewer financial profitability is caused by the CFP structure. Therefore, this study indicates that under the typical circumstances of underdeveloped nations, PPs are a more advantageous alternative than traditional ones regarding sustainability performance.","Declaration of Competing Interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

Measuring the life expectancy of Portuguese telecommunications companies using generalized log-gamma (GLG) distribution is a new research endeavor. Regarding the new theoretical contributions, original expressions for the moments and mode of the GLG distribution are presented. In this empirical study, data on the entrepreneurial fabric in the Information and Communication sector from 2004 to 2018, when some companies were born or died, were used. In addition to the GLG, three other statistical distributions with two parameters are analyzed: gamma, Weibull, and log-normal. Maximum likelihood parameters and confidence intervals for survival probabilities are estimated and compared. The Akaike information criterion is used to compare the performance of the four estimated models. The results show that GLG distribution is a promising solution to assess the resilience and longevity of a firm.","This work is partially financed by national funds through FCT—Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia under the project UIDB/00006/2020.

The methodology is qualitative, based on a case study of mototaxi drivers in Cartagena, Colombia, in order to achieve a more complete description and a holistic analysis of the phenomenon. The paper offers a novel multilevel perspective of informality that encompasses not only legal status but also social and economic aspects, and proposes an integrated approach to understanding informality that accounts for the range of activities undertaken by informal actors.","I express my sincere gratitude to the editors and reviewers for their invaluable contributions, insightful feedback and constructive criticism.

Its clinical presentation is related to variable degrees of pituitary hormone deficiencies (pan-hypopituitarism), such as growth hormone deficiency, hypothyroidism, and hypo-cortisolism due to ACTH adreno-corticotropic hormone deficiency. Some cases are diagnosed late.   Case report: Female patient who presented recurrent hypoglycemia and neonatal jaundice at birth, accompanied by neonatal crises, with a late PSIS diagnosis, made at 4 years of life. The hormonal tests reported hypo-cortisolemia, growth hormone deficiency, and central hypothyroidism; and pituitary-magnetic resonance imaging reported pituitary hypoplasia, ectopic neurohypophysis, and interrupted pituitary stalk. She received hormone replacement with human somatropin, levothyroxine, and hydrocortisone, with a good clinical response after diagnosis and initiation of treatment. Conclusion: Early diagnosis of PSIS can prevent long-term problems mainly related to metabolism, stress, growth and development.

In Colombia, over the years, this activity has represented a significant number of accidents and deaths. In order to be able to detect a possible eventuality or issue with the worker at height, this project proposed and developed an IoT prototype system to monitor biological variables, such as, heart rate and blood oxygen level, and variables of protection for the worker, such as the securing of the carabiner on the line of life and the height at which the worker is positioned. In the materials and methods section, the system architecture and its connections are explained. To measure heart rate and blood oxygen level, the plethysmography technique is selected, a high-resolution barometer is selected to measure the worker's height, and a pressure sensor is selected to measure carabiner securing. This section also explains the development of electronic instrumentation and the connection of the different modules to guarantee the acquisition of information and its sending to the cloud. The results of the characterization of the prototype indicated errors of 3.56% for the heart rate, 1.1% for the blood oxygen level and 10% for the carabiner securing measurement. As a conclusion the IoT system was designed, implemented and verified for the proposed variables.

The European Partnership for the Assessment of Risks from Chemicals (PARC) was designed to address many of the challenges that exist for the development and implementation of NAMs in modern chemical risk assessment. PARC's proximity to national and European regulatory agencies is envisioned to ensure that all the research and innovation projects that are initiated within PARC agree with actual regulatory needs. One of the main aims of PARC is to develop innovative methodologies that will directly aid chemical hazard identification, risk assessment, and regulation/policy. This will facilitate the development of NAMs for use in risk assessment, as well as the transition from an endpoint-based animal testing strategy to a more mechanistic-based NAMs testing strategy, as foreseen by the Tox21 and the EU Chemical's Strategy for Sustainability. This work falls under work package 5 (WP5) of the PARC initiative. There are three different tasks within WP5, and this paper is a general overview of the five main projects in the Task 5.2 'Innovative Tools and methods for Toxicity Testing,' with a focus on Human Health. This task will bridge essential regulatory data gaps pertaining to the assessment of toxicological prioritized endpoints such as non-genotoxic carcinogenicity, immunotoxicity, endocrine disruption (mainly thyroid), metabolic disruption, and (developmental and adult) neurotoxicity, thereby leveraging OECD's and PARC's AOP frameworks. This is intended to provide regulatory risk assessors and industry stakeholders with relevant, affordable and reliable assessment tools that will ultimately contribute to the application of next-generation risk assessment (NGRA) in Europe and worldwide.",The authors thank all the Task 5.2 partners for their work on this Task.,This work was carried out in the framework of the European Partnership for the Assessment of Risks from Chemicals (PARC) and has received funding from the European Union’s Horizon Europe research and innovation programme under Grant Agreement No 101057014.

Methods: A retrospective, descriptive, and bibliometric study was performed. We analyzed 1834 publications about COVID-19 and cerebrovascular disease from the Scopus database considering the time since the beginning of the pandemic between 2019 and 2020. Bibliometric indicators were evaluated such as number of citations, citations per publication by authors, countries, journals, and collaborations at national, international, institutional, and impact levels according to Cite Score Quartile and h-index metrics. All analysis was performed using SciVal software.
Results: The highest percentage of articles corresponded to universities in the United States, including Harvard and New York with 59 and 20 publications, respectively, and the University of Toronto in Canada with 22 publications. In relation to citation indicators, journals such as Stroke and Journal Stroke and Cerebrovascular diseases obtained 1971 and 561 citations, respectively. Regarding collaboration indicators, the national collaboration index was 39.4% and the institutional collaboration index was 31.1%. Finally, neurology, cardiovascular medicine, and cardiology and surgery were the subject areas with the highest research results, with 424, 217, and 128 studies, respectively.

The strategy used was to incorporate the source term into the flux function to rewrite the law of balance in a conservative form, in terms of global equilibrium variables that remained constant in space and time under steady states. Subsequently, the conservative variables were recalculated using the equilibrium variables. Recently, this concept was applied to shallow water and the Euler equations of gas dynamics.

Abstract: The study investigates the epidemiological aspects of hepatitis B in children and adolescents, discussing the results found in the light of bioethical principles. This is a cross-sectional, retrospective study, based on a time series of cases, whose notification data were extracted from the Notifiable Diseases Information System (SINAN) and vaccination data from the National Immunization Program Information System SIPNI, from 2011 to 2020. 889 cases of hepatitis B were reported in the study population. Most participants were aged between 15 and 19 years old 738 (83%), female 549 (62%), brown skin color 637 (72%) living in the urban area 490 (55%) and with incomplete elementary education 279 (31%). The probable source of infection was through sexual intercourse 450 (51%). The most common clinical form was Chronic Hepatitis 496 (56%). Most of those infected with Hepatitis B were unvaccinated individuals 298 (34%). In the light of bioethics, the results show that the practice of vaccination can contemplate bioethical principles, since the degree of autonomy depends on a type of planned intervention and the greater the relationship between benefit and burden, taking into account the principles of beneficence and not maleficence, the less decisive is this autonomy.",,,Acta Bioethica,,,,2023-06,2023,2023-06,,29,1,101-112,All OA; Gold,Article,"de Lima, Alessandre Gomes; da Costa, Rut Silva Lima; Bortolini, Cristiane Sores Ferreira; de Assis Pereira Roque, Carolina Pinho; Ferreira, Beatriz; de Oliveira, Vitor Hugo Leocadio; Ribeiro, Ianca; Ferreira, Fbio Reis; de Oliveira Lobato, Cirley Maria; Ribeiro, Dilza Terezinha Ambros; Nunes, Rui","de Lima, Alessandre Gomes (); da Costa, Rut Silva Lima (); Bortolini, Cristiane Sores Ferreira (); de Assis Pereira Roque, Carolina Pinho (); Ferreira, Beatriz (); de Oliveira, Vitor Hugo Leocadio (); Ribeiro, Ianca (); Ferreira, Fbio Reis (); de Oliveira Lobato, Cirley Maria (); Ribeiro, Dilza Terezinha Ambros (); Nunes, Rui ()",,"de Lima, Alessandre Gomes (); da Costa, Rut Silva Lima (); Bortolini, Cristiane Sores Ferreira (); de Assis Pereira Roque, Carolina Pinho (); Ferreira, Beatriz (); de Oliveira, Vitor Hugo Leocadio (); Ribeiro, Ianca (); Ferreira, Fbio Reis (); de Oliveira Lobato, Cirley Maria (); Ribeiro, Dilza Terezinha Ambros (); Nunes, Rui ()",0,0,,,http://www.scielo.cl/pdf/abioeth/v29n1/1726-569X-abioeth-29-01-101.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1158419963,50 Philosophy and Religious Studies; 5001 Applied Ethics,

Breast implant-associated anaplastic large cell lymphoma (BIA-ALCL) is a rare type of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, whose pathogenesis and pathophysiology are not well known, but which is seen with increasing frequency due to the increase in cosmetic procedures. To date, there are limitations in terms of knowledge about the clinical behavior of the disease, which can manifest itself in many forms, with a variable evolution time and uncertain surgical outcomes in the medium- and long-term. Based on the above, the aim of this review is to summarize evidence on the clinical considerations and surgical outcomes of breast implant-associated cancer to facilitate the identification and management of this condition. A bibliographic search was performed in the search engines and databases PubMed, ScienceDirect, Embase, EBSCO and MEDLINE. Within the clinical and surgical considerations, the type of implant used (textured), the time of the implant history, the severity of the manifestations, and the staging, must be taken into account in order to determine the opportunity for surgical intervention and neoadjuvant therapy, and to try to guarantee survival and avoid recurrence.

However, the impact of these types of interventions in intermediate levels of proficiency has yet to be conclusive when measured using speech rate as a dependent variable, e.g., word correct per minute. We studied how a listener's comprehension and intelligibility might change when read aloud protocols are used to enhance fluency. To do so, we used a data set that did not present increasing rates in speech rate after 11 weeks of practice (as reported in Rodríguez-Fuentes et al., 2023). We asked a group of independent raters to rank each participant's three (first, middle, and last) performances to assess if they could find differences in the performances over time. Seventy-nine percent of the raters perceived that the third performances were the best of each set they were provided, and that the second performances were better than the first. There was a consistent positive progression in perceived fluency. Also, a qualitative analysis of students' reflections showed significant gains from using read aloud protocols (RAPs) and increased awareness of key areas of fluency development, such as intonation, speech flow (vs. word-by-word reading), and self-confidence, among others.",Declaration of competing interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.,"This research received no specific grant from any funding agency, commercial or not-for-profit sectors.",Ampersand,,,,2023-12,2023,,2023-12,11,,100133,All OA; Gold,Article,"Rodríguez-Fuentes, Rodrigo A.; Calle-Díaz, Luzkarime","Rodríguez-Fuentes, Rodrigo A.

The cells treated with EMCHS (20 μg/mL) significantly reduced the capacity to form clones of the tumor cell. Moreover, 50 μg/mL of EMCHS extract induced apoptosis, as was shown by the Annexin-V assay. UHPLC-MS/MS analysis detected two acetogenins (Annonacinone and Annonacin) in the EMCHS, which could be largely responsible for its selective antiproliferative effect. The identification of fatty acids by GC-FID showed the presence of eight fatty acids, among which was, oleic acid, which has recognized activity as an adjuvant in antitumor treatments. Taken together, our results indicate that the EMCHS seems promising for use as a natural therapy against gastric cancer disease.","We thank Eduardo Gutiérrez and Pablo Villalobos for providing the facilities to collect the fruits of A. cherimola in the Huerto de Chirimoyos of Universidad de La Serena; Lorena Ortega-Paiva for their valuable comments; and Dawit Kidane-Mulat, from University of Texas at Austin, for kindly providing the human cells used in this study (GES-1).

They aim to deny and justify men's sexual assault against women. This study evaluates the mediating effect of modern rape myths on the relationship between gender system justification and attribution of blame to both victim and perpetrator in a fictional case of sexual violence. A total of 375 individuals residing in Chile, 255 women and 120 men, 19-81 years (M = 37.6 SD = 13.06) participated in the study. Results from a Structural Equation Model show that gender system justification is directly related to the attribution of blame to the victim, showing an indirect relationship throughout the modern rape myth. However, gender system justification and attribution of blame to the aggressor are indirectly related, being mediated by modern rape myths. The study of the relationship between the acceptance of modern rape myths, gender-specific system justification, and victim and aggressor blame for rape is a contribution to understanding beliefs justifying sexual violence against women.",We would like to express special gratitude to all the participants for their generous contributions that made this work possible.,This research received no external funding.,International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health,,,Male; Humans; Female; Rape; Crime Victims; Sex Offenses; Social Perception; Attitude,2023-01-17,2023,2023-01-17,,20,3,1663,All OA; Gold,Article,"Murray, Carol; Calderón, Carlos; Bahamondes, Joaquín","Murray, Carol (School of Psychology, Universidad Católica del Norte, Avenida Angamos 0610, Antofagasta 1240000, Chile.); Calderón, Carlos (School of Psychology, Universidad Católica del Norte, Avenida Angamos 0610, Antofagasta 1240000, Chile.); Bahamondes, Joaquín (School of Psychology, Universidad Católica del Norte, Avenida Angamos 0610, Antofagasta 1240000, Chile.)","Murray, Carol (Catholic University of the North)","Murray, Carol (Catholic University of the North); Calderón, Carlos (Catholic University of the North); Bahamondes, Joaquín (Catholic University of the North)",6,6,,,https://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/20/3/1663/pdf?version=1673943216,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1154615891,44 Human Society; 4402 Criminology; 48 Law and Legal Studies; 4804 Law In Context; 4805 Legal Systems,"16 Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions; 5 Gender Equality"

The task is to reveal in Rancière’s aesthetic visions the dominant motivation for freeing the world from the visible for a specific moment form of ordering social existence. However, it is evident that contrary to the statement of the return of politics, the way Rancière interprets it says otherwise – the usual political means are actually helpless, which is called «tragedy». However, at the same time, the attitude to change is preserved and implemented differently. Methodology. The article uses the method of in-depth reflective reading, which involves a critical-analytical explication, which concerns not so much the work itself, but those features of the anthropological situation, which are evidenced by the topic of the theoretical study. The method of dialectical-logical analysis is also significant – working with concepts that imply a subtle distinction and mutual transformation. Scientific novelty. Contrary to theses about «the end of philosophy», Rancière’s concept of politics has the features of a philosophical discourse: first, the formulation of the question itself has been typical of philosophy since the time of Kant: «how is politics possible»; secondly, the reading of his texts confirms the presence of such content, which is missed by generally accepted usage, which is related precisely to the search for truth, characteristic of philosophical discourse since antiquity. The semantic analysis of the concepts La mésentente and Le partage du sensible testifies: the very morphological structure of these concepts indicates the specific «positive negativity» of the first; in the second philosophy, there is a connection with dialogic philosophy and the philosophy of Marx, which synthesizes Hegel and Feuerbach. The lexeme partage orients to the thinking that corresponds to identity through disrupted identity; that is, the unity of the self (or the integrity of society) includes otherness rather than excluding it. The ambivalence of the lexeme sensible appears as a means by which politics is understood not as a phenomenon of state and power structures but as the primary basis of human existence for the constitution of a common cause. La mésentente and Le partage du sensible are synthesized as Dissensus. Conclusion. To some extent, Rancière’s apology for politics can be read as an apology for philosophy.",,,Human Studies a collection of scientific articles Series of «Philosophy»,,,,2023-01-10,2023,2023-01-10,,,45,89-111,All OA; Gold,Article,"ЛІМОНЧЕНКО, Віра","ЛІМОНЧЕНКО, Віра ()",,"ЛІМОНЧЕНКО, Віра ()",2,2,,,http://filos.dspu.in.ua/index.php/filos/article/download/189/180,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1154378372,"47 Language, Communication and Culture; 50 Philosophy and Religious Studies; 5002 History and Philosophy Of Specific Fields",

Intron 22 inversion (Inv22) is found in about 45% of patients with severe hemophilia A. Here, we reported a male without obvious hemophilia A phenotype but bearing an inherited segmental variant duplication encompassing F8 as well as Inv22. The duplication was approximately 0.16 Mb and involved from exon 1 to intron 22 of F8. This partial duplication and Inv22 in F8 was first found in the abortion tissue of his older sister with recurrent miscarriage. The genetic testing of his family revealed that his phenotypically normal older sister and mother also had this heterozygous Inv22 and a 0.16 Mb partial duplication of F8, while his father was genotypically normal. The integrity of the F8 gene transcript was verified by sequencing of the adjacent exons at the inversion breakpoint, which explained why this male had no phenotype for hemophilia A. Interestingly, although he had no significant hemophilia A phenotype, the expression of C1QA in his mother, sister, and the male subject was only about half of that in his father and normal population. Our report broadens the mutation spectrum of F8 inversion and duplication and its pathogenicity in hemophilia A.",The authors thank the family members for participating in this study.,This project was funded by the Basic and Applied Basic Research Foundation of Guangdong (2021A1515220152).,Frontiers in Genetics,,,,2023-02-09,2023,2023-02-09,,14,,1098795,All OA; Gold,Article,"Li, Shaoying; He, Jianchun; Chu, Liming; Ren, Shuai; He, Wenzhi; Ma, Xiaoyan; Wang, Yanchao; Zhang, Mincong; Kong, Lingyin; Liang, Bo; Li, Qing","Li, Shaoying (Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Experimental Department of Institute of Obstetrics and Gynecology, The Third Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University, Key Laboratory for Major Obstetric Diseases of Guangdong Province, Guangzhou, China); He, Jianchun (Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Experimental Department of Institute of Obstetrics and Gynecology, The Third Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University, Key Laboratory for Major Obstetric Diseases of Guangdong Province, Guangzhou, China); Chu, Liming (Basecare Medical Device Co., Ltd, Suzhou, China); Ren, Shuai (Basecare Medical Device Co., Ltd, Suzhou, China); He, Wenzhi (Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Experimental Department of Institute of Obstetrics and Gynecology, The Third Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University, Key Laboratory for Major Obstetric Diseases of Guangdong Province, Guangzhou, China); Ma, Xiaoyan (Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Experimental Department of Institute of Obstetrics and Gynecology, The Third Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University, Key Laboratory for Major Obstetric Diseases of Guangdong Province, Guangzhou, China); Wang, Yanchao (Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Experimental Department of Institute of Obstetrics and Gynecology, The Third Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University, Key Laboratory for Major Obstetric Diseases of Guangdong Province, Guangzhou, China); Zhang, Mincong (Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Experimental Department of Institute of Obstetrics and Gynecology, The Third Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University, Key Laboratory for Major Obstetric Diseases of Guangdong Province, Guangzhou, China); Kong, Lingyin (Basecare Medical Device Co., Ltd, Suzhou, China); Liang, Bo (State Key Laboratory of Microbial Metabolism, Joint International Research Laboratory of Metabolic and Developmental Sciences, School of Life Sciences and Biotechnology, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China); Li, Qing (Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Experimental Department of Institute of Obstetrics and Gynecology, The Third Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University, Key Laboratory for Major Obstetric Diseases of Guangdong Province, Guangzhou, China)","Liang, Bo (Shanghai Jiao Tong University); Li, Qing (Third Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University)","Li, Shaoying (Third Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University); He, Jianchun (Third Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University); Chu, Liming (Basecare Medical Device Co., Ltd, Suzhou, China); Ren, Shuai (Basecare Medical Device Co., Ltd, Suzhou, China); He, Wenzhi (Third Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University); Ma, Xiaoyan (Third Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University); Wang, Yanchao (Third Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University); Zhang, Mincong (Third Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University); Kong, Lingyin (Basecare Medical Device Co., Ltd, Suzhou, China); Liang, Bo (Shanghai Jiao Tong University); Li, Qing (Third Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University)",0,0,,,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fgene.2023.1098795/pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1155252381,31 Biological Sciences; 3105 Genetics,

From the beginning, risk factors for the severity and mortality of the disease were considered, as the spread of the virus was related to the living conditions of each population.MethodsIn this ecological study we have evaluated the role of geography, precisely the altitude above sea level in the incidence and mortality of COVID-19 in Peru. Incidence and mortality data were taken from the open-access database of the government of Peru until March 2021. COVID-19 cases and COVID-19 mortality were treated as cases/density population and 1000 x cases/inhabitants while altitude was treated as continuous and as a categorical variable divided in 7 categories. The relationship between COVID-19 cases or deaths for COVID-19 and altitude as continuous variable was determined using Spearman correlation test. Meanwhile when altitude was considered as a categorical variable, Poisson regression or negative binomial analyses were applied.ResultsA significant inverse correlation was found between COVID-19 cases by population density and altitude (r=-0.37 p < 0.001). By altitude categories, the lowest risk for infection was observed between 3,000 and 3,500 m (IRR 0.08; 95% CI 0.05,0.12). Moreover, we found an inverse correlation between altitude and COVID-19 mortality (r=-0.39 p < 0.001). Also, the lowest risk for mortality was observed between 3,000 and 3,500 m (IRR 0.12; 95%CI 0.08; 0.18). Similar results were found when analyses were adjusted for inhabitants and stratified by sex.ConclusionThis study reports an inverse relationship between COVID-19 incidence and mortality with respect to the altitude of residence, particularly, a u-shaped protection is shown, with a highest benefit between 3000 and 3500 m.

This article makes a conceptual and methodological contribution to this last debate. Part of the proposed reflection is meta-theoretical, allowing the identification of commonalities between the epistemological foundations of the DT and one evaluation school, in particular: pragmatic evaluation. In a second analytical moment, the text examines some epistemological limitations of pragmatism (as a research paradigm) to ground causal conclusions in social inquiry. This is not a trivial matter since the very essence of evaluation is, precisely, the identification of causal dynamics unleashed by social interventions. It is possible to amend some of these problems in a DT-based evaluation by adopting some epistemological principles from Critical Realism. A brief discussion of two applied evaluations of education interventions in Colombia led by the authors serves to illustrate some methodological implications of these last arguments.",,,Desafíos,,,,2023-02-28,2023,2023-02-28,,35,1,,All OA; Gold,Article,"Parra, Juan David; Vieira, Camilo","Parra, Juan David (Instituto de Estudios en Educación, Universidad del Norte); Vieira, Camilo (Instituto de Estudios en Educación, Universidad del Norte)",,"Parra, Juan David (Instituto de Estudios en Educación, Universidad del Norte); Vieira, Camilo (Instituto de Estudios en Educación, Universidad del Norte)",0,0,,,https://revistas.urosario.edu.co/index.php/desafios/article/download/12199/11363,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1155820880,44 Human Society; 4407 Policy and Administration,

It has been considered of academic interest to analyze its institutional capacity to respond to demands for fundamental services, education and health sector in migration crisis. For the first time, this case is studied with a constructivist approach, characterizing its fiscal, technical and political capacity; applying observation techniques and semi-structured interviews to analyze their function from the perspective of administrators of the upper, middle and operational levels. Results confirm opportunities for continuous improvement to overcome historical socioeconomic, political and environmental problems of this multicultural and multiethnic territory; increase budget; develop processes permeated by the spirit of quality and integrity; have effective social relationships; cope with the massive influx of migrants. It eventually becomes more complex because it must attend to the regular population, fellow nationals and Venezuelan citizens who arrive fleeing the conflict in their country.

The control variables are age, educational level, and experience, which are proxy variables for human capital. Inspection of data reveals that the STEM workforce is more educated and has more stability in the job. The statistical analysis suggests that the median of the STEM wage premium obtained by workers in the ten clusters is higher than observed in development countries.

Three groups of children were selected: ADHD (n = 42), high-performance (n = 20), and normo- typical development (n = 28). A brief computerized vigilance task (CSAT-R) was applied to compare attentional capacity and reaction time. The participants were divided into those with “attentional dysfunction” and those with “normal attention” to analyze clinical validity. Children with high-performance were clearly differentiated from the other two groups, with large effect sizes. The differences between normo-typical and ADHD groups were only significant in the errors and in a nonparametric index of attentional capacity, but with small effect sizes. The CSAT-R showed good specificity and an acceptable positive predictive value, but low levels of sensitivity, and a poor negative predictive value. Therefore, sustained attention could be a prominent mechanism in children with high capacities. The CSAT-R (and probably most of attentional tasks) would be moderately useful in community settings for ADHD diagnosis, but not to rule it out.",,,Anales de Psicología,,,,2023-04-27,2023,2023-04-27,,39,2,223-230,All OA; Gold,Article,"Servera, Mateu; Sáez, Belén; Rodríguez, Tania Iglesias","Servera, Mateu (Department of Psychology, Research Institute of Health Sciences, University of the Balearic Islands); Sáez, Belén (Department of Psychology, Research Institute of Health Sciences, University of the Balearic Islands, Palma (Spain).

É causada pela diminuição da atividade do fator VIII (hemofilia A) ou do fator IX (hemofilia B). Os pacientes hemofílicos carregam uma alta morbidade que influencia significativamente a qualidade de vida dos afetados. Essas complicações são agravadas quando há o desenvolvimento de aloanticorpos neutralizantes contra o fator VIII. Surge então a necessidade da aplicação de terapêuticas que visem melhorar a saúde e o bem-estar dos pacientes inclindo a prevenção de sangramento e danos nas articulações. Objetivo Descrever um caso clínico de um paciente diagnosticado com hemofilia A grave que está em tratamento com emicizumabe. Método Trata-se de um relato de caso clínico de um paciente diagnosticado com hemofilia A grave que iniciou tratamento em novembro de 2021 com Emicizumabe e realizamos uma comparação entre a prevalência de internações por sangramento no ano anterior e no ano seguinte ao tratamento específico com essa medicação que é um anticorpo monoclonal humanizado usado para restaurar o processo de coagulação sanguínea. Resultado O paciente apresentava perfil de sangramento muito grave e exibiu recorrência de inibidor mesmo após indução de imunotolerância e devido a isso iniciou tratamento profilático com Emicizumabe, sendo a única pessoa atualmente a receber esse medicamento no Hemocentro do Amazonas, tendo apresentado resposta surpreendentemente rápida. Antes do tratamento ocorreram 12 episódios de sangramento e 2 internações e após o início do Emicizumabe houve apenas 2 episódios de sangramento que ocorreram devido a procedimentos odontológicos. Discussão A partir de 2021, foi aprovado no Brasil o uso do Emicizumabe, um anticorpo monoclonal que consegue ativar a cascata da coagulação mesmo sem a presença do fator VIII, para pacientes com hemofilia A e inibidor contra o fator VIII que apresentaram falha no tratamento de Imunotolerância. As respostas apresentadas pelos pacientes com esse tratamento até agora e os dados da literatura sugerem uma evolução extremamente favorável para casos de difícil controle como o do presente caso clínico. Conclusão Surpreendeu a rápida resposta apresentada pelo paciente mesmo ainda na fase de ataque da droga, haja visto o perfil de hemorragias graves dele. Nota-se que em pacientes com hemofilia o uso do emicizumabe demonstra resultados satisfatórios em termos de segurança e prevenção de sangramento.",,,Hematology Transfusion and Cell Therapy,,,,2023-10,2023,,2023-10,45,,s460,All OA; Gold,Article,"Coelho, EO; Assunção, MDC; Cristino, JS; Melo, JFM; Coelho, EO; Bandeira, FLR","Coelho, EO (Universidade Paulista (UNIP), São Paulo, SP, Brasil); Assunção, MDC (Universidade Federal do Amazonas (UFAM), Manaus, AM, Brasil); Cristino, JS (Universidade Federal do Amazonas (UFAM), Manaus, AM, Brasil); Melo, JFM (Universidade Paulista (UNIP), São Paulo, SP, Brasil); Coelho, EO (Universidade Nilton Lins (UNL), Manaus, AM, Brasil); Bandeira, FLR (Centro Universitário do Norte (UniNorte), Manaus, AM, Brasil)",,"Coelho, EO (Universidade Paulista); Assunção, MDC (Federal University of Amazonas); Cristino, JS (Federal University of Amazonas); Melo, JFM (Universidade Paulista); Coelho, EO (Universidade Nilton Lins); Bandeira, FLR (Centro Universitário do Norte)",0,0,,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.htct.2023.09.856,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1164978071,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3201 Cardiovascular Medicine and Haematology,

Do Hispanic students find Hispanic faculty with whom to work at Hispanic Serving Institutions? In order to answer that question, this study builds on a 12-year line of research that has focused on engaged, public, metropolitan, research universities. From a national sample of 35 such universities, this study examines the eight R1 Hispanic Serving Institutions (HSIs). These eight HSIs serve as important anchor institutions in their respective metropolitan regions: (a) Florida International University (Miami, FL); (b) University of California, Riverside (Los Angeles, CA); (c) University of Houston, Houston (Houston, TX); (d) University of Illinois, Chicago (Chicago, IL); (e) University of New Mexico (Albuquerque, NM); (f) University of North Texas, Denton (Dallas, TX); and (g) University of Texas, Arlington (Dallas, TX). Using IPEDS data, this study examines for each HSI the proportional representation (ratio) of faculty to students in 18 intersectional gender-race/ethnicity categories over the 10 year period, 2011 to 2020. The study’s findings demonstrate the clear underrepresentation of Female Hispanic/Latino faculty at these HSIs and the equally clear overrepresentation of Male White faculty.

Para responder a esta pregunta, este estudio se basa en una línea de investigación de 12 años que se ha centrado en universidades públicas en zonas metropolitanas dedicadas a la investigación. A partir de una muestra nacional de 35 universidades de este tipo, este estudio examina ocho instituciones de servicio hispano R1 (HSI).

Diversos patógenos presentes em sangue e fluidos corporais podem causar infecções, incluindo HIV, Hepatite B e Hepatite C. No Brasil, esses acidentes são de notificação compulsória e tratados como emergenciais. Diante disso, o aumento desses infortúnios exige uma análise dos fatores envolvidos e a implementação de medidas de prevenção mais eficazes. Objetivo Realizar uma análise retrospectiva dos casos de exposição acidental a material biológico em serviços de saúde, além de exposição sexual. Ademais, identificar as causas dessas exposições, reconhecer casos graves que exigiram profilaxia e enfatizar o aumento percentual de acidentes por exposição sexual em relação aos anos anteriores. Métodos Estudo quantitativo, descritivo e retrospectivo, baseado em dados secundários coletados do Sistema de Gerenciamento Logístico dos Medicamentos Antirretrovirais (SICLOM), prontuário eletrônico I-doctor e fichas de dispensação de antirretrovirais. Foram analisadas variáveis relevantes para o objetivo do estudo, com inclusão de casos notificados no SICLOM nos últimos 5 anos. O estudo teve início após a aprovação no Comitê de Ética em Pesquisa da instituição, atendendo a Resolução CNS n° 466/2012 e suas complementações. A identidade dos participantes do estudo foi preservada. Resultados No ano de 2022, o hospital registrou 685 acidentes com exposição a materiais biológicos. A maioria dos casos (61,3%) envolvia indivíduos do gênero feminino. Desses acidentes, 10% foram considerados graves, 22,1% moderados e 67,9% leves. Constatou-se, ainda, que 82,7% das pessoas que procuraram profilaxia tinham entre 21 e 40 anos de idade.

The antibiotic susceptibility patterns of these bacterial isolates play a critical role in guiding effective treatment strategies We aimed to determine the most common bacterial agents causing diabetic foot infections in a tertiary-care hospital in Peru.
Methods: Clinical and microbiological data were collected from 181 patients diagnosed with diabetic foot infections and positive microbiological culture results. All the samples were analyzed with the Vitek 2 compact system and the cut-off points were defined with the CLSI M100 guide. The data were segregated based on mono-microbial or poly-microbial cultures, bacterial types, and antibiotic susceptibility profiles.
Results: A total of 32 bacterial species were identified, predominantly Gram-negative (63%). The most frequent bacterial agents isolated were Staphylococcus aureus (19.9%), Escherichia coli (12.2%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (8.3%), and Proteus vulgaris (6.6%). These bacteria commonly exhibited resistance to Ampicillin, Ciprofloxacin, Levofloxacin, Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and Cefuroxime. E. coli showed the highest antibiotic resistance (19 antibiotics), while Gentamicin, Tobramycin, and Levofloxacin demonstrated the highest sensitivity against the most prevalent bacteria. Gram-negative bacteria also exhibited notable antibiotic-susceptibility to Meropenem, Piperacillin/tazobactam, and Amikacin. Regarding the presence of Extended-Spectrum Beta-Lactamase, 54 isolates tested positive, with 35 (64.8%) and 14 (42.4%) of these being S. aureus and E. coli.
Conclusions: Bacterial agents causing diabetic foot infections pose a constant concern, particularly due to the increasing antibiotic resistance observed. This difficulty in treating the condition contributes to a higher risk of amputation and mortality. Further research on bacterial susceptibility is necessary to determine appropriate dosages for pharmacological treatment and to prevent the overuse of antibiotics.",,"The author(s) declare that no financial support was received for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.",Frontiers in Endocrinology,,,"Humans; Diabetic Foot; Cross-Sectional Studies; Peru; Staphylococcus aureus; Escherichia coli; Levofloxacin; Microbial Sensitivity Tests; Anti-Bacterial Agents; Bacteria; Staphylococcal Infections; Drug Resistance, Microbial; Diabetes Mellitus",2023-12-05,2023,2023-12-05,,14,,1267699,All OA; Gold,Article,"Moya-Salazar, Jeel; Chamana, Jackelina M.; Porras-Rivera, Daniela; Goicochea-Palomino, Eliane A.; Salazar, Carmen R.; Contreras-Pulache, Hans","Moya-Salazar, Jeel (Faculties of Health Science, Universidad Privada del Norte, Lima, Peru); Chamana, Jackelina M.

METHODS: Secondary analysis of 33,567 data from the COVID-19 Notification System of the National Epidemiology Center, Prevention and Control of Diseases (CDC-Peru), from the years 2020-2022. The variables were age, sex, belonging to the Andean or Amazonian ethnic group, number and type of symptoms and risk conditions, abnormal findings in chest X-rays, year of data collection for hospitalization and death from COVID-19. Poisson family generalized linear regression models with logarithmic linkage and robust variance were used to establish differences in mortality between ethnic groups. Crude and adjusted risk ratio (RR) with 95 % confidence intervals (CI) were calculated.
RESULTS: 33,567 participants with an average age of 33.6 years were included, 44.4 % were men and 70.2 % belonged to the Amazonian ethnic group. Most of those affected by COVID-19 presented 2 symptoms (38.8 %), 4.8 % presented some risk condition, 1451 (4.3 %) were hospitalized, and 433 (1.3 %) died. The adjusted analysis showed that the Andean group, compared to the Amazonian, tended to have a higher probability of death, and this association was statistically significant, RR =7.6, 95 % CI (5.5-10.5).

In 2017, part of the installed instrumentation was upgraded, incorporating new CC5MPX automatic photographic cameras from Campbell Scientific to acquire three daily photographs at 5Mpx in resolution, 2592 × 1984 pixels in size, and JPEG format. The photographs are taken during the central hours of the day (14, 15, and 16 h GMT) to ensure maximum brightness, even during the Antarctic winter. Powered by batteries and solar panels, two cameras were installed at each site with a panoramic view, devoid of vegetation except for small patches of moss. At each study point, the cameras are oriented in different directions, providing diverse angles of the study area, and allowing observation of various fields of view in the environment. The result is a dataset of images acquired in the 2017-2022 period, organized by site, year, and month, capturing environmental conditions and spatial distribution of the snow cover. This dataset, besides documenting the snow cover, allows assessment of meteorological conditions, prevailing wind directions in the area during snow events, even in more distant areas from the study point due to the configured field of view. In the case of the images from Livingston Island, it also enables the study of the Limnopolar Lake's fluctuating water level during spring and summer. For the images from Deception Island, it provides insight into the presence of pack ice in Foster Port, relevant for volcanic activity and the safety of numerous vessels entering the caldera of the active volcano.","Acknowledgments The author thanks chiefs and crews of the Spanish Antarctic Stations “Juan Carlos I “, in Livingston Island, and “Gabriel de Castilla”, in Deception Island, for their support during field works and help on the instrument&#x27;s maintenance, as well as “Las Palmas”, “Hespérides” and “Sarmiento de Gamboa” Spanish Research Vessels to support the logistical operations along the 2000–2022 period.

The aim of the study is to determine the variation in the levels of depressive and anxious symptomatology in children and adolescents in the North of Chile.
METHODS: A Repeated cross-sectional design (RCS) was used. The sample consisted of a total of 475 students aged 12 to 18 years (high school) from educational establishments in the city of Arica. To evaluate the changes in the mental health of students associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, the same mental health measures applied to students were compared in two waves (2018-2021).
RESULTS: An increase in the symptomatology levels of depression, anxiety, social anxiety, and problems with the family, while a decrease in problems with school and peers was observed.
CONCLUSIONS: The results show that there is an increase in mental health problems associated with the periods of time in which the COVID-19 pandemic transformed the social relation spaces and classrooms of secondary school students.

Nevertheless, not all people with obesity develop depression.
OBJECTIVE: To determine the factors associated with depressive symptoms among people aged 15 or older with obesity from the National Demographic and Family Health Survey (ENDES in Spanish 2019-2021).
METHODS: Cross-sectional analytical study. The outcome of interest was the presence of depressive symptoms, assessed using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9). Crude (cPR) and adjusted (aPR) prevalence ratios were estimated using GLM Poisson distribution with robust variance estimates.
RESULTS: The prevalence of depression symptoms was 6.97%. In the multivariate analysis, a statistically significant association was found between depressive symptoms and female sex (PRa: 2.59; 95% CI 1.95-3.43); mountain region (PRa: 1.51; 95% CI 1.18-1.92); wealth index poor (PRa: 1.37; 95% CI 1.05-1.79, medium (PRa: 1.49; 95% CI 1.11-2.02), and rich (PRa: 1.65; 95% CI 1.21-2.26); daily tobacco use (PRa: 2.05, 95% CI 1.09-3.87); physical disability (PRa: 1.96, 95% CI 1.07-3.57); and a history of arterial hypertension (PRa: 2.05; 95% CI 1.63-2.55).
CONCLUSION: There are several sociodemographic factors (such as being female and living in the Andean region) and individual factors (daily use of tobacco and history of hypertension) associated with depressive symptoms in Peruvian inhabitants aged 15 or older with obesity.

The results might help determine immunization strategies.
DESIGN AND METHODS: Unlike previous studies, we analyzed NAbs in a random sample of 110 IgG positive sera from individuals who participated in a population-based seroprevalence transversal study, carried out in May 2022 in two Chilean cities, a country with high vaccination coverage.
RESULTS: Our findings indicate that 98.2% of individuals had NAbs against Wuhan, 65.5% against Omicron, and 32.7% tested positive for Wuhan but not Omicron. Factors influencing protective immunity included a prior natural infection and the number of vaccines received. NAbs titers against the original virus were high, demonstrating vaccine effectiveness in the population. However, the level of antibodies decreased when measuring NAbs against Omicron, particularly among older individuals, indicating a decline in vaccine protection. Previous COVID-19 episodes acted as a natural booster, increasing NAbs titers against both virus strains.
CONCLUSIONS: Protective immunity against the original Wuhan SARS-CoV-2 virus is reduced when compared to Omicron variant. Updating vaccine to target emerging variants and continued monitoring of effectiveness at the population level are necessary.",Declaration of Competing Interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

Para a Associação Americana de Banco de Sangue (AABB) o teste para variante silenciosa de hemoglobina não é obrigatório, no entanto, a conduta para ambas as legislações observa que os indivíduos com HbAS podem realizar a doação de sangue, tendo como requisito que unidades com a presença de HbAS não deve ser transfundida em populações vulneráveis. Este estudo tem como objetivo avaliar a prevalência de hemoglobinas variantes, nos testes de triagem de doadores de sangue nas 5 regiões do Brasil. Material e métodos Foram analisados 234.420 doadores, sendo 5,1% (11.852) da região Norte, 26% (60.931) do Nordeste, 21,6% (50.653) do Centro-Oeste, 30% (70.238) do Sudeste e 17,4% (40.746) do Sul. O teste de triagem de hemoglobina foi realizado através da metodologia de eletroforese em gel de ágar amido pH alcalino. As amostras que apresentaram migração alterada foram confirmadas em ágar ácido para diferenciação de variantes. Resultados Dos 234.420 doadores, 5.612 (2,4%) apresentaram hemoglobina variante, sendo 1,73% HbAS, 0,63% HbAC, 0,03% HbAD, 0,01% HbAJ, 0,001% HbSC, 0,0004% HbCC e 0,0004% HbDD. Verificamos a prevalência de variantes em 2,63% na região Norte, 3,54% no Nordeste, 1,82% no Centro-Oeste, 2,44% no Sudeste e 1,21% no Sul, sendo evidenciado que a região nordeste apresentou maior prevalência de hemoglobina alterada, principalmente da HbAS 2,55% seguida de HbAC 0,97%. Foi observada ainda uma prevalência de 1,33% da HbAJ na população da região Sul. Discussão De acordo com a literatura, a prevalência do traço falciforme é maior nos países africanos e na Nigéria, podendo atingir aproximadamente 20% da população. Na população de Ghana foi encontrado em doadores de sangue 11,3% de HbAS e 1,3% de HbAC. No Brasil o traço falciforme pode afetar 6 a 10% dos negros e cerca de 1% da população geral. Naoum et al (2000), encontrou uma prevalência de HbAS de 4,49% na região norte, 4,05% no Nordeste, 3,11% no Centro-Oeste, 1,87% no Sudeste e 1,87% no Sul. Neste estudo encontramos a prevalência de HbAS de 2,27% na região Norte, 2,55% no Nordeste, 1,13% no Centro-oeste, 1,82% no Sudeste e 0,92% no Sul. A hemoglobina C (HbC) é originária do oeste da África e espalhou-se pelo mundo como a HbS, sendo o traço C (HbAC) encontrado em 2% dos negros americanos e a HbCC em 1/6000 indivíduos. Neste estudo foram encontrados 3 doadores com HbSC, na região Sul, Sudeste e Nordeste, assim como 1 doador com HbCC na região Sudeste. A HbD, comum no subcontinente indiano e a terceira variante de hemoglobina mais encontrada no Brasil, é considerada assintomática em indivíduos heterozigotos e homozigotos, com raros casos de diminuição da fragilidade osmótica e células em alvo. Neste estudo encontramos 60 doadores (0,03%) heterozigotos (HbAD) e 1 doador homozigoto na região norte. A HbAJ encontrada com maior prevalência na região Sul pode estar relacionada com a imigração europeia e o fluxo migratório da população italiana. Conclusão Os dados apresentados são condicentes com outros estudos e indicam a heterogeneidade étnica da população devido aos africanos que povoaram as regiões brasileiras, destacando a maior frequência da HbAS nos estados do Espírito Santo e Bahia.",,,Hematology Transfusion and Cell Therapy,,,,2023-10,2023,,2023-10,45,,s753,All OA; Gold,Article,"Costa, SSM; Girardo, BC; Quadros, G; Borges, T; Ribeiro, GN; Júnior, DL; Bordin, JO","Costa, SSM (Laboratório Imunolab/Instituto Hhemo de Ensino e Pesquisa, São Paulo, SP, Brasil; Universidade Federal de São Paulo, São Paulo, SP, Brasil); Girardo, BC (Laboratório Imunolab/Instituto Hhemo de Ensino e Pesquisa, São Paulo, SP, Brasil); Quadros, G (Laboratório Imunolab/Instituto Hhemo de Ensino e Pesquisa, São Paulo, SP, Brasil); Borges, T (Laboratório Imunolab/Instituto Hhemo de Ensino e Pesquisa, São Paulo, SP, Brasil); Ribeiro, GN (Laboratório Imunolab/Instituto Hhemo de Ensino e Pesquisa, São Paulo, SP, Brasil); Júnior, DL (Laboratório Imunolab/Instituto Hhemo de Ensino e Pesquisa, São Paulo, SP, Brasil; Universidade Federal de São Paulo, São Paulo, SP, Brasil); Bordin, JO (Laboratório Imunolab/Instituto Hhemo de Ensino e Pesquisa, São Paulo, SP, Brasil; Universidade Federal de São Paulo, São Paulo, SP, Brasil)",,"Costa, SSM (Laboratório Imunolab/Instituto Hhemo de Ensino e Pesquisa, São Paulo, SP, Brasil; Federal University of São Paulo); Girardo, BC (Laboratório Imunolab/Instituto Hhemo de Ensino e Pesquisa, São Paulo, SP, Brasil); Quadros, G (Laboratório Imunolab/Instituto Hhemo de Ensino e Pesquisa, São Paulo, SP, Brasil); Borges, T (Laboratório Imunolab/Instituto Hhemo de Ensino e Pesquisa, São Paulo, SP, Brasil); Ribeiro, GN (Laboratório Imunolab/Instituto Hhemo de Ensino e Pesquisa, São Paulo, SP, Brasil); Júnior, DL (Laboratório Imunolab/Instituto Hhemo de Ensino e Pesquisa, São Paulo, SP, Brasil; Federal University of São Paulo); Bordin, JO (Laboratório Imunolab/Instituto Hhemo de Ensino e Pesquisa, São Paulo, SP, Brasil; Federal University of São Paulo)",0,0,,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.htct.2023.09.1364,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1164987820,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3201 Cardiovascular Medicine and Haematology,

Materials and Methods: Four databases were searched until October 2021. Experimental animal studies evaluating the efficacy of EMD were used. The primary outcomes were bone formation (BF) and cementum formation (CF). The secondary outcomes were junctional epithelium (JE), gingival recession (GR), and clinical attachment level (CAL). Measures of effect were mean difference (MD) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Random-effects model were used for all meta-analyses. The Systematic Review Centre for Laboratory animal Experimentation tool was used to assess the risk of bias.
Results: Seven experimental animal studies (n = 40) used with a maximum follow-up period of 3 months. Compared to control, EMD did not significantly reduce BF (MD 0.02 mm; 95% CI - 1.91-1.96; I2 = 89%). However, it increased CF (MD 1.38 mm; 95% CI 0.01-2.74; I2 = 55%). For secondary outcomes it was found that compared to control, EMD only significantly reduced JE (MD - 0.54 mm; 95% CI - 1.06 to - 0.02; I2 = 55%). However, the other secondary outcomes were not significant as in the case of GR (MD - 3. 88 mm; 95% CI - 68.29-60.53; I2 = 82%), and in CAL (MD 0.02 mm; 95% CI - 0.29-0.39; I2 = 38%). Finally, according to the risk of bias assessment, all included studies had a high risk of bias.
Conclusion: EMD had no effect on BF values while it did not reduce CF. Otherwise, in the secondary outcomes, EMD only significantly reduced JE values and had no effect on GR and CAL.",,,Contemporary Clinical Dentistry,,,,2023-10,2023,2023-12-19,2023-10,14,4,249-255,All OA; Gold,Article,"Mayta-Tovalino, Frank; Diaz-Arocutipa, Carlos; Barja-Ore, John; Hernandez, Adrian V.","Mayta-Tovalino, Frank (Department of Vice-rectorate of Research, Universidad San Ignacio de Loyola, Lima, Peru); Diaz-Arocutipa, Carlos (Department of Vice-rectorate of Research, Universidad San Ignacio de Loyola, Lima, Peru); Barja-Ore, John (Academic Department, Universidad Privada del Norte, Lima, Peru); Hernandez, Adrian V.

The broad spectrum of myocardial injury in cardiovascular diseases can range from theasymptomatic elevation of cardiac troponin levels to the development of fulminant myocarditis and/or circulatory shock, which can leave significant sequelae. Despite the fact that there is no clear strategy to treat cardiac events that occur during COVID-19 infection and taking into account that treatment is mainly aimed at relieving patients’ symptoms as they arise, the objective of this work was to find out and collect current evidence on this subject, so that readers can be offered a reference guide in Spanish that contributes to the development of their health profession. The methodology used was a literature search in databases including Medline, Scopus and ScienceDirect within a time window between 2019 and 2022. The main results revealed that the molecular and pathophysiological mechanisms involved in post-COVID-19 syndrome include the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system since SARS-CoV-2 tropism is linked to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2. This causes an alteration of the neurohumoral response of the cardiovascular, renal and digestive systems,generating deficits in the signaling pathways and causing direct damage to the heart, lungs and other organs. Post-COVID-19 syndrome, in general, is defined as the occurrence or persistence of symptoms three or four weeks after the acute phase of the disease. This could then be considered as a time window of risk and strict follow-up to assess in apersonalized way the risk among the different groups of patients, especially those with a past history of cardiovascular disease. The main results revealed disorders such as heart failure, arrhythmias, pericarditis and myocarditis, which require early detection and occur days or even weeks after the acute phase of COVID-19.",,,HORIZONTE - Revista de Estudos de Teologia e Ciências da Religião,,,,2023-01-31,2023,2023-01-31,2023-01-31,23,1,e2125-e2125,All OA; Gold,Article,"Jaimes, Yelson Alejandro Picón; Lovelo, German Josue Garcia; Fritz, Jessica Valentina Ellis; Castro, Antonio Luis Castro; Navarro, Jesus Miguel Villa; Bossa, Daniela Andrea Soto; Ortega, Sebastián Danilo Rojas; Saa, Tatiana Álvarez; Sierra, Michael Gregorio Ortega","Jaimes, Yelson Alejandro Picón (Universitat Ramon Llull, Facultat de Ciències de la Salut.

The maintenance of this equipment is mostly carried out using invasive methods that are expensive, time-consuming, and even complicated. The application of non-invasive methods is sought since they offer the advantage of real-time monitoring without stopping the process, reducing component assembly and disassembly times and providing a faster response. The aim of this work is done an experimental investigation that shows evidence about how the information on the hydraulic variables can be obtained if the electrical variables are monitored for the modes of operation such as pump and turbine. This work is divided into two parts, the first part is based on a statistical analysis to perform a multivariate adjustment through copulas and probability distributions. The second part focuses on the graphical analysis of the power density spectra for the hydraulic variables, the torque, and the defined electrical variables. The amplitude peaks of each variable and which peaks are common between them are determined. A statistically significant fit for Tawn type 2 copula is obtained with the indicator variable of pressure fluctuation and a multivariate transformation of the three-phase network currents. In the spectra analysis, common amplitude peaks are observed between the spectra that indicate the information flow on the phenomena between the hydraulic variables and the electrical variables.",,,Journal of Applied Fluid Mechanics,,,,2023-04-01,2023,2023-04-01,,16,4,685-702,All OA; Gold,Article,"Monsalve, V.

Convectional TV saw its production and information models altered. The measures taken by the different Governments, confining big cities, meant that TV channels had to obtain images to contextualize their news pieces in a different way. In this context, home videos became a fundamental part of the contents broadcasted by the different channels. This research analyzes the evolution of these videos before, during and after the lock-down in Spain in 2020. For this purpose, we have carried out a case study of the evening TV news programs of Televisión Española (Corporación RTVE) as a paradigm of public TV, and of Telecinco (Mediaset), as a leading example of private TV audience. The results obtained show how these domestic contents have been increasing their presence in the different news programs, not only during the months of lock-down, but also after the lock-down. Their presence has increased with respect to the use made of them before the Covid-19, until they have been fully admitted today as a valid content.",,,Historia y Comunicación Social,,,,2023-05,2023,,,28,1,159-170,All OA; Gold,Article,"Galbe, Jorge Miranda","Galbe, Jorge Miranda (Universidad Complutense de Madrid)",,"Galbe, Jorge Miranda (Complutense University of Madrid)",0,0,,,https://revistas.ucm.es/index.php/HICS/article/download/85098/4564456564506,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1159686522,"47 Language, Communication and Culture; 4701 Communication and Media Studies",

Therefore, monitoring leaves, especially when pigment accumulation occurs, is crucial for monitoring organelles, cells, tissue, and whole-plant levels. However, accurately measuring these changes can be challenging. Thus, this study tests three hypotheses, whereby reflectance hyperspectroscopy and chlorophyll a fluorescence kinetics analyses can improve our understanding of the photosynthetic process in Codiaeum variegatum (L.) A. Juss, a plant with variegated leaves and different pigments. The analyses include morphological and pigment profiling, hyperspectral data, chlorophyll a fluorescence curves, and multivariate analyses using 23 JIP test parameters and 34 different vegetation indexes. The results show that photochemical reflectance index (PRI) is a useful vegetation index (VI) for monitoring biochemical and photochemical changes in leaves, as it strongly correlates with chlorophyll and nonphotochemical dissipation (Kn) parameters in chloroplasts. In addition, some vegetation indexes, such as the pigment-specific simple ratio (PSSRc), anthocyanin reflectance index (ARI1), ratio analysis of reflectance spectra (RARS), and structurally insensitive pigment index (SIPI), are highly correlated with morphological parameters and pigment levels, while PRI, moisture stress index (MSI), normalized difference photosynthetic (PVR), fluorescence ratio (FR), and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) are associated with photochemical components of photosynthesis. Combined with the JIP test analysis, our results showed that decreased damage to energy transfer in the electron transport chain is correlated with the accumulation of carotenoids, anthocyanins, flavonoids, and phenolic compounds in the leaves. Phenomenological energy flux modelling shows the highest changes in the photosynthetic apparatus based on PRI and SIPI when analyzed with Pearson's correlation, the hyperspectral vegetation index (HVI) algorithm, and the partial least squares (PLS) to select the most responsive wavelengths. These findings are significant for monitoring nonuniform leaves, particularly when leaves display high variation in pigment profiling in variegated and colorful leaves. This is the first study on the rapid and precise detection of morphological, biochemical, and photochemical changes combined with vegetation indexes for different optical spectroscopy techniques.","Thanks to Krzysztof Sitko from the University of Silesia in Katowice (Poland) for the encouragement and support of pipeline models, Eliemar Campostrini and Guilherme Rodrigues de Souza from the State University of the North Fluminense Darcy Ribeiro (UENF) for supporting the JIP test, Luis Guilherme Teixeira Crusiol (Embrapa Soja-National Soybean Research Center-Brazilian Agricultural Research Corporation) for supporting HVI algorithms, Glaucio Leboso Alemparte Abrantes dos Santos for supporting PLS algorithms, and Cristiane Moriwaki de Andrade from the State University of Maringá for supporting pigment profiling, and Érika Cristina Takamizawa Sato for managing funds in PGA-UEM.

A rheological analysis was performed to understand the effect of sodium metasilicate on the flow curves of concentrated pulps. The study was carried out in an Anton Paar MCR 102 rheometer, showing that, in a wide range of dosages, the reagent can reduce the yield stress of the slurries, which would result in lower energy costs for transporting the pulps by pumping. To understand the behavior observed experimentally, computational simulation has been used by means of quantum calculations to represent the metasilicate molecule and the molecular dynamics to study the adsorption of metasilicate on the hematite surface. It has been possible to obtain that the adsorption is stable on the surface of hematite, where increasing the concentration of metasilicate increases its adsorption on the surface. The adsorption could be modeled by the Slips model where there is a delay in adsorption at low concentrations and then a saturated value is reached. It was found that metasilicate requires the presence of sodium ions to be adsorbed on the surface by means of a cation bridge-type interaction. It is also possible to identify that it is absorbed by means of hydrogen bridges, but to a lesser extent than the cation bridge. Finally, it is observed that the presence of metasilicate adsorbed on the surface modifies the net surface charge, increasing it and, thus, generating the effect of dispersion of hematite particles which experimentally is observed as a decrease in rheology.",Gonzalo R.

Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT) is a program that has provided encouraging results for its treatment. However, scientific evidence about its efficacy is scarce. Therefore, we aimed to describe the scientific production on the components of the DBT program and its therapeutic efficacy in the treatment of people with BPD. Method : A systematic review with relevant keywords was conducted based on studies available in Scopus, Web of Science, and PubMed until June 2023, including studies in English, research on therapeutic intervention, studies with a randomized controlled trial (RCT) design that included people with the diagnosis of BPD. Results: We found 18 RCTs, most of which supported the effectiveness of DBT for BPD. There were a total of 1,755 participants in these studies, most of whom were women. These studies looked for treating self-injurious behaviors, suicidal thoughts or ideations, number of visits to emergency services, and frequency of hospital admissions. Most studies revealed that both short-term DBT and standard DBT improved suicidality in BPD patients with small or moderate effect sizes, lasting up to 24 months after the treatment period. Furthermore, these studies showed that DBT can significantly improve general psychopathology and depressive symptoms in patients with BPD. Improvement of compliance, impulsivity, mood instability, as well as reduction in hospitalization rate are other findings observed in the trials following DBT. Conclusion: Although DBT shows efficacy in the treatment of BPD, heterogeneity in the methodologies employed is highlighted.

The advent of machine learning offers a promising avenue for predicting the survival of at-risk neonates. Further research is required to effectively deploy this approach within distinct clinical contexts. Objective: This study aimed to assess the applicability of machine learning models in predicting neonatal mortality, drawing from maternal and clinical characteristics of pregnant women within an intensive care unit (ICU).
Methods: Conducted as an observational cross-sectional study, the research enrolled pregnant women receiving care in a level III national hospital's ICU in Peru. Detailed data encompassing maternal diagnosis, maternal characteristics, obstetric characteristics, and newborn outcomes (survival or demise) were meticulously collected. Employing machine learning, predictive models were developed for neonatal mortality. Estimations of beta coefficients in the training dataset informed the model application to the validation dataset.
Results: A cohort of 280 pregnant women in the ICU were included in this study. The Gradient Boosting approach was selected following rigorous experimentation with diverse model types due to its superior F1-score, ROC curve performance, computational efficiency, and learning rate. The final model incorporated variables deemed pertinent to its efficacy, including gestational age, eclampsia, kidney infection, maternal age, previous placenta complications accompanied by hemorrhage, severe preeclampsia, number of prenatal checkups, and history of miscarriages. By incorporating optimized hyperparameter values, the model exhibited an impressive area under the curve (AUC) of 0.98 (95 % CI: 0.95-1), along with a sensitivity of 0.98 (95 % CI: 0.94-1) and specificity of 0.98 (95 % CI: 0.93-1).
Conclusion: The findings underscore the utility of machine learning models, specifically Gradient Boosting, in foreseeing neonatal mortality among pregnant women admitted to the ICU, even when confronted with maternal morbidities.

Central to this is the need for precise global time series of plastic pollution with which we can assess whether implemented policies are effective, but at present we lack these data. To address this need, we used previously published and new data on floating ocean plastics (n = 11,777 stations) to create a global time-series that estimates the average counts and mass of small plastics in the ocean surface layer from 1979 to 2019. Today's global abundance is estimated at approximately 82-358 trillion plastic particles weighing 1.1-4.9 million tonnes. We observed no clear detectable trend until 1990, a fluctuating but stagnant trend from then until 2005, and a rapid increase until the present. This observed acceleration of plastic densities in the world's oceans, also reported for beaches around the globe, demands urgent international policy interventions.","We thank Ocean Missions for data from Iceland and Greenland and thank Ocean Research Project for data from across the Arctic.

It focuses on five countries: Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia and Uruguay. At first, a comprehensive survey presents the number of scientific papers classified based on the resource to show the tendency and importance of such subjects in the academic community. Each country’s electricity matrix and grid connection are shown to understand the region’s renewable source participation situation. The potential of offshore renewable resources is addressed by considering the published technical papers in scientific journals. The main conflicts and synergies associated with ocean space utilization are presented by considering the exclusive economic zone of each country. The status of the regulatory frameworks to promote and development of offshore renewable energies is presented. Two sections are dedicated to presenting the active, decommissioned and planned projects, research groups and laboratory infrastructures to develop the technologies. The last section discusses the future perspectives on the development of this sector in SA. It is observed that SA, with more than 25,000 km of coastline, has a great potential for offshore renewable energy; however, so far, these resources have not been explored commercially. Larger investment in the sector, establishing an adequate legal framework and deploying full-scale demonstration projects at sea are necessary for the commercialization of such technologies in SA.","The authors acknowledge the support of the thematic network REMAR (Opportunities of integration in Ibero-American Electric Grids of the Marine Energies) from the Ibero-American Program of Science and Technology for the Development (CYTED).

1282,pub.1156084516,10.3390/arts12020049,,,Performing Everydayness and Feminist Aesthetics,"As a Colombian scholar and artist, the author of this essay interrogates feminist aesthetics and artistic practice in a choreographic mode; improvising to see where movement takes her. This first impulse creates the space for performing writing and opening the space of creation. The movement starts at home, immersed in everydayness, aided by poetry and the analysis of the work of three other contemporary Colombian artists who also start at home in their artistic practice. Here, home is also a reference to all the artists’ (including the author’s) place of birth: Barranquilla, Colombia. The aesthetic philosophical tradition comes into play against the backdrop of the ideas presented by Simone de Beauvoir in her seminal The Second Sex (1949), who urges women in the middle of the twentieth century, to transcend, to fight against immanence. The works of Clara Gaviria, Raisa Galofre and Jessica Sofía Mitrani accompany the author’s journey while she arrives at the realization that it all starts with the need to transcend the quotidian while using, precisely, the apparent banality of such everyday things and tasks. Through the created art objects, the author creates an essay about, around and beyond artistic feminist practice and aesthetics.",,This research received no external funding.,Arts,,,,2023-03-08,2023,2023-03-08,,12,2,49,All OA; Gold,Article,"Gontovnik Hobrecht, Monica Margarita","Gontovnik Hobrecht, Monica Margarita (Philosophy and Humanities Department, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia)",,"Gontovnik Hobrecht, Monica Margarita (Universidad del Norte)",0,0,,,https://www.mdpi.com/2076-0752/12/2/49/pdf?version=1678272948,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1156084516,"36 Creative Arts and Writing; 3601 Art History, Theory and Criticism; 3604 Performing Arts",
1282,pub.1155367079,10.3390/app13042352,,,Effect of Finite Element Method (FEM) Mesh Size on the Estimation of Concrete Stress–Strain Parameters,"In this research, two components were developed jointly: On the one hand, an experimental plan was created to obtain specific variables of the concrete and serve as a reference for the second model, a numerical and computational type created to address the variability in parameters, such as the elasticity and flow of coarse aggregate and mortar. The experimental work reproduced a specific gradation with a 1” nominal maximum size TMN on spheroidal-shaped particles. To address the diversity of limestone in the national territory, rocks were extracted from five calcareous areas of the country, which were transformed through different activities from lamination and turning with different bits to being carved into spheres until the reference gradation formed. The next stage consisted of determining the mechanical and stress–strain properties of both the mortar and coarse aggregate. In the case of mortar, the compressive stress was obtained from 50 mm × 50 mm × 50 mm cubes and the modulus of elasticity from 100 mm × 200 mm cylinders; for the coarse aggregate, the compressive stress was obtained through tests on cylinders of the calcareous rock used to form the spherical aggregate particles. The materials were mixed according to a previous proportioning for f′c = 28 MPa and cast in cylinders of 100 mm × 200 mm. Finally, the compressive stress and the modulus of elasticity in these specimens were determined. Separately, a computational model was created to reproduce the experimental model with the same type of materials and load conditions and thereby estimate the compressive stress and modulus of elasticity of the tested material. This model was developed based on finite elements simulating concrete under a two-phase model, in which the coarse aggregate phase was arranged with spheroidal particles that were assembled with the mortar paste, thus finally reproducing a concrete cylinder of 100 mm × 200 mm. Material properties, taken from experimental work, were assigned to these materials. Initially, work was carried out in the elastic range, obtaining, as a result, the modulus of elasticity Ec, and then the specimen was brought to failure, obtaining, as a result, the maximum compressive stress f′c. To attend to the influence of the effect of the mesh size for modeling on the numerical results of both parameters, several simulations were carried out in which mesh sizes of 4.0, 3.5, 3.0, and 2.5 mm were established for the mortar and the coarse aggregate, respectively, for carrying out the modeling. The results in the computational model showed that the compressive stress turned out to be more sensitive than the modulus of elasticity to the variation in the size of the mesh. For the first, the differences between the 4 mm mesh and the 2.5 mm mesh reached 3%, but for the second, the difference only reached 1% between the results for the same meshes. When the results between the experimental and computational models were compared, we found that the experimental values had the best closeness with results in the 2.5 mm mesh.",,This research received no external funding.,Applied Sciences,,,,2023-02-11,2023,2023-02-11,,13,4,2352,All OA; Gold,Article,"Bracamonte, Alex José; Mercado-Puche, Vicente; Martínez-Arguelles, Gilberto; Pumarejo, Luis Fuentes; Ortiz, Albert R.; Herazo, Luis Carlos Sandoval","Bracamonte, Alex José (Department of Civil Engineering, University of Sucre, Sincelejo 700001, Colombia); Mercado-Puche, Vicente (Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla 080001, Colombia); Martínez-Arguelles, Gilberto (Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla 080001, Colombia); Pumarejo, Luis Fuentes (Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla 080001, Colombia); Ortiz, Albert R.

Insufficient awareness of stance, cultural attitudes about it, and poor teaching have been identified as underlying sources of stance-related difficulties. Focusing on stance may thus be a pivotal reading-to-write lens to improve English academic literacy. However, few studies have investigated pre-service teachers’ language awareness and ideologies about different stance markers. The goal of this paper is to describe the stance-focused conceptions and ideologies of a group of sixteen Mexican undergraduate pre-service teachers of English as a Foreign Language (EFL) who are also EFL learners. We used phenomenographic interviews and analysis to achieve this goal. We found three types of conceptions: stylistic, critical, and metaideological. The less sophisticated stylistic conceptions are most prevalent. Only two participants showed metaideological conceptions. Two language ideologies were found: an ideology of linguistic objectivity that dismisses all stance markers and another that values affect markers but dismisses first-person ones. These results imply that pre-service teachers should be made aware of the argumentative and epistemic functions of stance markers and diverse language ideologies about them that circulate across national and disciplinary contexts. In this way, they may deploy stance more effectively in their own literacy practices and become more effective EAP teachers.",,,Indonesian Journal of Applied Linguistics,,,,2023-01-31,2023,2023-01-31,,12,3,706-718,All OA; Gold,Article,"Perales-Escudero, Moises Damian; Cruz, Rosa Isela Sandoval; Faz, Gerardo Bañalez","Perales-Escudero, Moises Damian (Universidad Autónoma del Estado de Quintana Roo); Cruz, Rosa Isela Sandoval (Universidad Autónoma del Estado de Quintana Roo); Faz, Gerardo Bañalez (Universidad Andrés Bello)",,"Perales-Escudero, Moises Damian (Universidad Autónoma del Estado de Quintana Roo); Cruz, Rosa Isela Sandoval (Universidad Autónoma del Estado de Quintana Roo); Faz, Gerardo Bañalez (Andrés Bello National University)",1,1,,,https://ejournal.upi.edu/index.php/IJAL/article/download/45552/22043,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1156232376,"39 Education; 3901 Curriculum and Pedagogy; 47 Language, Communication and Culture; 4703 Language Studies; 4704 Linguistics",4 Quality Education

Structural and numerical alterations in centrosomes are hallmarks of neoplastic cells and contribute to tumorigenesis. We show that a Centrosome Amplification 20 (CA20) gene signature is associated with high expression of the Tripartite Motif (TRIM) family member E3 ubiquitin ligase, TRIM69. TRIM69-ablation in cancer cells leads to centrosome scattering and chromosome segregation defects. We identify Serine/threonine-protein kinase 3 (MST2) as a new direct binding partner of TRIM69. TRIM69 redistributes MST2 to the perinuclear cytoskeleton, promotes its association with Polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1) and stimulates MST2 phosphorylation at S15 (a known PLK1 phosphorylation site that is critical for centrosome disjunction). TRIM69 also promotes microtubule bundling and centrosome segregation that requires PRC1 and DYNEIN.

However, what thick description entails and how it should be carried out is often missing or insufficiently described. While expert qualitative researchers may be familiar with the concept, the wide variety of meanings and interpretations of thick description in the literature may make it difficult for novice qualitative researchers to understand this concept when reporting qualitative findings. The purpose of this paper is to propose the “MIRACLE” narrative framework for providing thick description in qualitative research. We developed this framework based on a critical review of theoretical literature about thick description and writing in qualitative research, as well as our personal experiences conducting, writing, and publishing qualitative studies. The proposed framework can be valuable for improving the reporting quality and transferability of qualitative research findings.",,"FundingThe author(s) received no financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.",International Journal of Qualitative Methods,,,,2023-02-17,2023,2023-02-17,2023-12,22,,16094069221147162,All OA; Gold,Article,"Younas, Ahtisham; Fàbregues, Sergi; Durante, Angela; Escalante, Elsa Lucia; Inayat, Shahzad; Ali, Parveen","Younas, Ahtisham (Faculty of Nursing, Memorial University of Newfoundland, Canada); Fàbregues, Sergi (Department of Psychology and Education, Universitat Oberta de Catalunya, Barcelona, Spain); Durante, Angela (University La Rioja, Spain); Escalante, Elsa Lucia (Department of Education, Universidad del Norte, Colombia); Inayat, Shahzad (Al-Nafees Medical College and Faculty of Nurisng, Isra University, Islamabad, Pakistan); Ali, Parveen (University of Sheffield, United Kingdom)","Younas, Ahtisham (Memorial University of Newfoundland)","Younas, Ahtisham (Memorial University of Newfoundland); Fàbregues, Sergi (Open University of Catalonia); Durante, Angela (University of La Rioja); Escalante, Elsa Lucia (Universidad del Norte); Inayat, Shahzad (Isra University); Ali, Parveen (University of Sheffield)",47,47,,,https://doi.org/10.1177/16094069221147162,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1155523474,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 36 Creative Arts and Writing; 3602 Creative and Professional Writing",

The results linked to the phytosynthesis of ZnONP indicate a novel method of fabricating nanostructured material, nanoparticles with spherical morphology and an average size of 30 nm. The assays were made based on the viral viability of avian coronavirus according to the mortality of SPF embryonated eggs and a Real-Time PCR for viral load estimation. This was a model to evaluate the sanitizing effects against coronaviruses since they share a very similar structure and chemistry with SAR-CoV-2. The influence of the type of textile treatment evidenced the potential effect of the sanitizing UV light, which achieved 100% of embryo viability. The response of the ZnONP + UV nebulization showed a notorious influence of photoactivation according to the exposure time, and the 60-s treatment achieved a decrease of 88.9% in viral viability, compared to 77.8% and 55.6% corresponding to the 120 and 180-s treatments, respectively. Regarding the decrease in viral load between the types of treatments, UV 180 s reduced 98.42% and UV 60 s + ZnONP reduced 99.46%, respectively. The results show the combinatorial effect of UV light and zinc nanoparticles in decreasing the viral viability of avian coronavirus, as a model of other important coronaviruses in public health such as SARS-CoV-2.",,Funding was provided by Universidad Privada del Norte (Grant Nos. 20221009).,Scientific Reports,,,Humans; Zinc Oxide; Gammacoronavirus; Antiviral Agents; Ultraviolet Rays; Zinc; Metal Nanoparticles; COVID-19; SARS-CoV-2,2023-06-14,2023,2023-06-14,,13,1,9619,All OA; Gold,Article,"Asmat-Campos, David; Rojas-Jaimes, Jesús; Icochea-D’Arrigo, Eliana; Castro-Sanguinetti, Gina R.; More-Bayona, Juan Anderson; Juárez-Cortijo, Luisa; Delfín-Narciso, Daniel; Montes de Oca-Vásquez, Gabriela","Asmat-Campos, David (Dirección de Investigación, Innovación y Responsabilidad Social, Universidad Privada del Norte, Trujillo, Peru; Grupo de Investigación en Ciencias Aplicadas y Nuevas Tecnologías, Universidad Privada del Norte, 13011, Trujillo, Peru); Rojas-Jaimes, Jesús (Dirección de Investigación, Innovación y Responsabilidad Social, Universidad Privada del Norte, Trujillo, Peru); Icochea-D’Arrigo, Eliana (Laboratorio de Patología Aviar, Facultad de Medicina Veterinaria, Universidad Nacional Mayor de San Marcos, Lima, Peru); Castro-Sanguinetti, Gina R.

However, there is only 1 national precedent that has validated the scores of this instrument in its 21-item version. Therefore, this study examined the bifactor structural equation method (SEM) and multidimensional item response theory (MIRT) structure of a 12-item human immunodeficiency virus stigma scale in Peruvian adults.
METHODS: We evaluated 342 patients (57.6% female and 42.45% male) diagnosed with HIV receiving highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) from a hospital located in East Lima, aged 18 to 45 years (M = 31.4, SD = 9.79). A SEM was used to test 2 measurement models, a 4-factor correlated oblique model and a bifactor model due to high interfactor relationships.
RESULTS: Acceptable fit indices were identified for the oblique model (χ2/df = 1.26, SRMR = 0.044, RMSEA [90% CI] = 0.028 [0.000-0.047], CFI = 0.996, TLI = 0.994). In the same way, similar results were evident for the bifactor model (χ2/df = 1.14, SRMR = 0.039, RMSEA [90% CI] = 0.020 [0.000-0.044], CFI = 0.998, TLI = 0.997), however, in the latter it showed a greater explanation for the unidimensional model (H = 0.87, PUC = 0.82, LCA = 0.70), which was also evidenced by the bifactor MIRT analysis.
CONCLUSION: It is concluded that the 12-item HIV Stigma Scale meets the psychometric properties of internal structure and unifactorial reliability.","We acknowledge the contribution of the participants and co-researchers.

This systematic review synthesizes and critically analyzes the existing literature on mental disorders in the rural Andean population in Latin America.
Methods: A systematic review with narrative synthesis was carried out following the PRISMA guidelines. We searched nine databases (PubMed/MEDLINE, Scopus, EMBASE, ScienceDirect, Web of Science, Cochrane, Scielo, LILACS, and Latindex), five public prepublication servers (SocArXiv, medRxiv, bioRxiv, SportRXiv, and Preprints), ALICIA, and Google Scholar for articles that included the analysis of mental health problems using data collected from the rural Andean population in Latin America. These were eligible for inclusion. Articles that included Non-Latin American populations (including European or African migrants) and studies conducted prior to the COVID-19 pandemic (since the declaration of national lockdown) were excluded.
Results: A total of 23,761 articles were retrieved, 14 of which met the inclusion requirements. Most were cross-sectional (n = 12) and related to anxiety (n = 9), depression (n = 8), and stress (n = 5). The mental health analysis of 5,976 rural dwellers from four countries in Latin America also included gray literature studies (n = 7) that allowed the quantification of mental health problems in adults (n = 7) and adolescents/children (n = 4). Only one study was multinational, and the quality of publications varied. Despite the high frequency of anxiety, depression, and stress symptoms among rural Latin American populations during COVID-19, published research is very limited. This review found preliminary evidence that the frequency of anxiety (45%), depression (27.6%), and stress (33.1%) in the rural population was associated with pandemic restrictions across countries. Measures of other psychiatric problems, such as distress or suicidal ideation, cannot be estimated.
Conclusion: Regional-wide studies investigating changes in the frequency of symptoms of mental health problems in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic are warranted to inform culturally adapted prevention strategies.

However, there are controversies regarding the role of fruit consumption in mitigating this disease. The objective of the present study was to analyze the association between fruit intake and body mass index (BMI) and waist circumference (WC) in a representative sample of Peruvians. This is an analytical cross-sectional study. Secondary data analysis was conducted using information from the Demographic and Health Survey of Peru (2019-2021). The outcome variables were BMI and WC. The exploratory variable was fruit intake, which was expressed in three different presentations: portion, salad, and juice. A generalized linear model of the Gaussian family and identity link function were performed to obtain the crude and adjusted beta coefficients. A total of 98,741 subjects were included in the study. Females comprised 54.4% of the sample. In the multivariate analysis, for each serving of fruit intake, the BMI decreased by 0.15 kg/m2 (β = -0.15; 95% CI -0.24 to -0.07), while the WC was reduced by 0.40 cm (β = -0.40; 95% CI -0.52 to -0.27). A negative association between fruit salad intake and WC was found (β = -0.28; 95% CI -0.56 to -0.01). No statistically significant association between fruit salad intake and BMI was found. In the case of fruit juice, for each glass of juice consumed, the BMI increased by 0.27 kg/m2 (β = 0.27; 95% CI 0.14 to 0.40), while the WC increased by 0.40 cm (β = 0.40; 95% CI 0.20 to 0.60). Fruit intake per serving is negatively related to general body adiposity and central fat distribution, while fruit salad intake is negatively related to central distribution adiposity. However, the consumption of fruit in the form of juices is positively associated with a significant increase in BMI and WC.",,This research received no external funding.,Nutrients,,,"Female; Humans; Male; Adiposity; Cross-Sectional Studies; Peru; Fruit; Obesity; Body Mass Index; Waist Circumference; Obesity, Abdominal",2023-02-27,2023,2023-02-27,,15,5,1183,All OA; Gold,Article,"Valencia, Jamee Guerra; Ramos, Willy; Cruz-Ausejo, Liliana; Torres-Malca, Jenny Raquel; Loayza-Castro, Joan A.; Zeñas-Trujillo, Gianella Zulema; Ponce, Norka Rocío Guillen; Zuzunaga-Montoya, Fiorella E.; Valladares-Garrido, Mario J.; Vera-Ponce, Víctor Juan; De La Cruz-Vargas, Jhony A.","Valencia, Jamee Guerra (Instituto de Investigaciones en Ciencias Biomédicas (INICIB), Universidad Ricardo Palma, Lima 15039, Peru; Facultad de Ciencias de la Salud, Universidad Privada del Norte, Lima 15314, Peru); Ramos, Willy (Instituto de Investigaciones en Ciencias Biomédicas (INICIB), Universidad Ricardo Palma, Lima 15039, Peru; Instituto de Investigaciones Clínicas, Universidad Nacional Mayor de San Marcos, Lima 15001, Peru); Cruz-Ausejo, Liliana (Instituto de Investigaciones en Ciencias Biomédicas (INICIB), Universidad Ricardo Palma, Lima 15039, Peru); Torres-Malca, Jenny Raquel (Instituto de Investigaciones en Ciencias Biomédicas (INICIB), Universidad Ricardo Palma, Lima 15039, Peru); Loayza-Castro, Joan A.

Therefore, this study aimed to summarize the primary characteristics of studies on accessibility, coverage, patient preferences, and factors associated with patient satisfaction or acceptance of colposcopy in primary healthcare.
METHODS: A search strategy, based on MeSH, Emtree, and free terms, was run through 5 databases (PubMed, Scopus, Embase, Ovid/Medline, and Web of Science). EndNote 20.1 © and Rayyan QCRI © were used for screening. A preset datasheet was used for data extraction.
RESULTS: The systematic search retrieved 1127 references, and after removing duplicates, screening the titles and abstracts, and reviewing the full text, 7 studies were included. The interrater reliability was 77.73% (kappa statistic = 0.1842). Most studies estimated the proportion of women that sought for colposcopy after a previous screening test for human papilloma virus. One study identifies barriers to colposcopy examination in women at risk of developing cervical cancer. Three studies assessed the decentralization of colposcopy from a tertiary healthcare center to a primary care center. Pap smear was the most common first-line screening test, followed by liquid-based cytology sample and visual inspection with acetic acid.
CONCLUSION: Only a few countries have investigated the use of colposcopy in primary care. Thus, barriers and the care structure for this implementation to be successful in reducing cervical cancer incidence and mortality should be identified.",,"Funding The author(s) received no financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.",Journal of Primary Care & Community Health,,,Female; Humans; Pregnancy; Uterine Cervical Neoplasms; Colposcopy; Vaginal Smears; Reproducibility of Results; Papanicolaou Test; Early Detection of Cancer; Primary Health Care; Mass Screening,2023-01,2023,2023-09-22,2023-01,14,,21501319231198942,All OA; Gold,Article,"Benites-Zapata, Vicente A.; Hernandez-Bustamante, Enrique A.; Acuña-Chávez, Luis M.; Escudero-Gaytan, Claudia P.; Ulloque‑Badaracco, Juan R.; Alarcón-Braga, Esteban A.; Venegas, Gino; Herrera-Añazco, Percy","Benites-Zapata, Vicente A.

Materials and methods: We conducted a cross-sectional study based on the secondary data analysis of the 2021 Peruvian Demographic and Health Survey (DHS). Our sample included Peruvian children aged 6-59 months with complete data for the variables of interest. Anemia was defined as having a hemoglobin level of less than 11 g/dL, adjusted by altitude. Erreygers Concentration Index (ECI) and concentration curves were computed to estimate the socio-economic inequality in anemia among Peruvian children. Moreover, ECI was decomposed to figure out the contributing factors to the inequality of anemia and the residual variation.
Results: Nationwide, the prevalence of anemia in Peruvian children was 29.47%. We found a pro-poor inequality regarding anemia at the national level (ECI = -0.1848). The determinants included in the model explained 81.85% of the overall socio-economic inequality in anemia. The largest contribution to inequality was from household- and community-related factors. Having a higher mother's education level (26.26%) and being from the highlands (24.91%) were the major significant contributors to the overall health inequality.
Conclusion: Almost one-third of Peruvian children have anemia. A pro-poor inequality of anemia in Peruvian children was found. Public policies ought to address the major contributing factors of anemia inequality.",,,Frontiers in Public Health,,,Humans; Child; Socioeconomic Factors; Peru; Health Status Disparities; Cross-Sectional Studies; Anemia,2023-03-31,2023,2023-03-31,,11,,1068083,All OA; Gold,Article,"Al-kassab-Córdova, Ali; Mendez-Guerra, Carolina; Robles-Valcarcel, Pamela; Iberico-Bellomo, Luis; Alva, Kenedy; Herrera-Añazco, Percy; Benites-Zapata, Vicente A.","Al-kassab-Córdova, Ali (Centro de Excelencia en Investigaciones Económicas y Sociales en Salud, Universidad San Ignacio de Loyola, Lima, Peru); Mendez-Guerra, Carolina (Facultad de Ciencias de la Salud, Universidad Peruana de Ciencias Aplicadas, Lima, Peru); Robles-Valcarcel, Pamela (Facultad de Ciencias de la Salud, Universidad Peruana de Ciencias Aplicadas, Lima, Peru); Iberico-Bellomo, Luis (Facultad de Economía y Finanzas, Universidad del Pacifico, Lima, Peru); Alva, Kenedy (Escuela de Negocios y Administración de Empresas, Universidad de Murcia, Murcia, España); Herrera-Añazco, Percy (Facultad de Ciencias de la Salud, Universidad Privada del Norte, Trujillo, Peru; Red Peruana de Salud Colectiva, Lima, Peru); Benites-Zapata, Vicente A.

Pulmonary sequestration is one of the rare causes. Case report: The present case is a neonatal patient without prenatal controls who presented with a picture of respiratory distress dependent on prolonged invasive mechanical ventilation, with suspicion of pneumonia based on the findings in the chest X-ray and CT, without improvement after antibiotic treatment, and with deteriorating cardiorespiratory status. He was assessed by pediatric cardiology and pulmonology, diagnosing the presence of a large patent ductus arteriosus with hemodynamic repercussions and persistent pulmonary hypertension. A chest CT angiography was performed, evidencing intralobar pulmonary sequestration in the right lung and aberrant circulation. It required surgical resection.

A terapêutica desse quadro exige equipe e ambiente qualificados para lidar com possíveis complicações, cuja evolução tende a ser letal se não conduzida adequadamente. Assim, apesar do avanço científico hodierno, reconhecer o quadro de forma eficiente e tratá-lo em tempo hábil persiste enquanto desafio para a medicina. O objetivo deste estudo foi realizar uma análise descritiva do número de internações e óbitos por sepse no Brasil entre 2018 a 2022, buscando compreender as taxas de infecção generalizada resultantes em internações e óbitos no Brasil. Metódos Estudo transversal, descritivo e com abordagem quantitativa, realizado com coleta de dados no Sistema de Morbidade Hospitalar do SUS, segundo variáveis de sexo, idade, ano e região relacionadas ao número de internação e óbitos por sepse entre janeiro de 2018 e dezembro de 2022 no país. Aplicada estatística descritiva por meio do software Microsoft Excel. Resultados Entre 2018 a 2022, 660.247 pacientes foram internados e 299.859 foram a óbito devido a sepse no SUS. Ao longo dos anos, o número de casos aumentou 11% entre 2018-2019, reduziu 14% entre 2019‒2020, reduziu 2,6% entre 2020‒2021 e aumentou 30,8% de 2020‒2022. A região sudeste representou 51% do total de internações durante o período do presente estudo e 55,2% dos óbitos. Em segundo lugar, encontra-se a região nordeste, concentrando 19,19% do número de internações, seguida pela região sul com 19,14% e pela região norte com 5,63%. Já, a região centro-oeste registrou os menores números, contando com 4,9% das internações e 4% dos óbitos. A faixa etária mais acometida foram os idosos a partir dos 60 anos, a qual correspondeu a 59% das internações e 74 % dos óbitos, sendo a maior taxa observada. A proporção de internações, bem como de óbitos, se aproximou da proporção 1:1 para ambos os sexos. Conclusão A região do Brasil com o maior número de internações por sepse foi o Sudeste. Já a região Centro-Oeste apresentou o menor número de internações no período analisado. Não houve diferenças de internações ou óbitos entre o sexo masculino e feminino e a faixa etária com maior vulnerabilidade foi a de idosos a partir de 60 anos.

The present research has a double objective: on the one hand, it seeks to validate the psychometric properties of the TPACK-ES scale in the Spanish context; and on the other hand, to analyse the perceptions of self-efficacy in the model of Primary and Secondary Education teachers in initial training. A total of 303 university students with a mean age of 23.12 ± 3.21 years, enrolled in a university in the north of Spain, agreed to participate in this study. The results obtained confirm the heptafactorial structure of the model, its internal consistency, structural stability and adaptation to optimal fit indices. Likewise, statistically significant differences are identified in the TK and TPK dimensions, in structuring variables of the model and in the PK (pedagogical knowledge), PCK (pedagogical knowledge of content), TPK (pedagogical technological knowledge) and TPACK dimensions, depending on the level of teacher training and the gender of the future teacher. These results indicate the need to continue to analyse the contextual factors of the TPACK model in order to ensure its suitability and true effectiveness in initial teacher training.",,,Educación XX1,,,,2023-06-13,2023,2023-06-13,,26,2,209-244,All OA; Gold,Article,"Ortega-Sánchez, Delfín","Ortega-Sánchez, Delfín (Universidad de Burgos, Spain)",,"Ortega-Sánchez, Delfín (University of Burgos)",2,2,,,https://revistas.uned.es/index.php/educacionXX1/article/download/34484/27739,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1160435264,39 Education; 3901 Curriculum and Pedagogy; 3903 Education Systems,4 Quality Education

In the study, a typical Pen70 base asphalt was modified with four different filler materials, namely limestone powder, cement, slaked (hydrated) lime, and brake pad powder, to produce different asphalt mortars that were subsequently used to prepare the asphalt mixtures. Thereafter, various laboratory tests, namely dynamic uniaxial repeated compressive loading, freeze-thaw splitting, and semicircular bending (SCB) were conducted to evaluate the moisture sensitivity, high-temperature stability, low-temperature cracking, and fatigue performance of the asphalt mixtures before and after being subjected to water saturation conditions. Overall, the study results indicated superior moisture tolerance, water damage resistance, and performance for slaked (hydrated) lime, consecutively followed by brake pad powder, cement, and limestone powder. That is, for the materials evaluated and the laboratory test conditions considered, limestone mineral powder was found to be the most moisture-sensitive filler material, whilst slaked (hydrated) lime was the most moisture-tolerant and water-damage resistant filler material.","We express our sincere gratitude to the experts, teachers and students who have provided help for this article.","This work is partially supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 52108415, No. 52108425, and No. 51803157), Natural Science Foundation of Hubei Province (Grant No. 2020CFB567), the Enterprise Technology Innovation Project of Shandong Province (202160101791), and the Science and Technology Project of Shandong Hi-Speed Maintenance Group Co., Ltd.

A Higiene das Mãos (HM) destaca-se como uma medida simples, de baixo custo e eficaz para prevenção das IRAS. Objetivo Descrever a adesão dos profissionais da saúde à HM de acordo com os cinco momentos estabelecidos pela Organização Mundial da Saúde (OMS) e o insumo (água e sabão e álcool gel) mais utilizado. Método Estudo descritivo, retrospectivo e de abordagem quantitativa, do período de maio de 2021 a maio de 2023, em uma Unidade de Terapia Intensiva (UTI) de um hospital público terciário de ensino referência em infectologia do estado de São Paulo. O estudo baseou-se na auditoria por observação direta dos cinco momentos estabelecidos pela OMS para realização da higienização das mãos, de modo a minimizar variações entre os observadores, na Unidade de Terapia Intensiva (UTI) em um hospital referência em doenças infectocontagiosas do Estado de São Paulo. Resultados Identificou-se que das 1238 observações, 545 (44,0%) dos profissionais realizaram a HM no momento oportuno. Momentos com maior adesão foram após contato com o paciente (203/315; 64,4%) e após risco de contato com fluídos e secreção (46/91; 50,5%). Os momentos com menor adesão foram antes de procedimentos assépticos (15/95; 15,8%), após contato com áreas próximas ao paciente (136/391; 34,8%) e antes do contato com o paciente (145/346; 41,9%). Das 545 oportunidades de higiene das mãos adequadas, houve utilização de álcool gel em 34,7%. Conclusão Observou-se que o momento com menor adesão à HM foi antes de procedimento asséptico. Trata-se de um momento com importante impacto para prevenção de IRAS destacando a importância de desenvolver estratégias de educação direcionadas. O principal insumo utilizado foi água e sabão em detrimento ao álcool gel; diante dos inúmeros benefícios do álcool gel (eficácia na redução da contagem bacteriana das mãos, menor ressecamento do que o sabão comum, maior facilidade de uso, menor tempo para ação, possibilidade de disponibilidade à beira do leito do paciente) esse resultado demonstra que ações de incentivo ao uso do álcool gel devem persistir, especialmente correlacionando ao momento “antes de procedimento asséptico”.",,,The Brazilian Journal of Infectious Diseases,,,,2023-10,2023,,2023-10,27,,103327,All OA; Gold,Article,"de Souza, Aline Aparecida Carneiro; Scota, Sayonara; de Andrade, Beatriz Vilela; Lian, Yu Ching; Ibanes, Aline Santos; Feijo, Regia Damous Fontenele; de Luca Ito, Raquel Keiko; Panico, Caroline Thomaz; Cavalcante, Nilton José Fernandes","de Souza, Aline Aparecida Carneiro (Instituto de Infectologia Emílio Ribas, São Paulo, SP, Brasil); Scota, Sayonara (Instituto de Infectologia Emílio Ribas, São Paulo, SP, Brasil); de Andrade, Beatriz Vilela (Instituto de Infectologia Emílio Ribas, São Paulo, SP, Brasil); Lian, Yu Ching (Instituto de Infectologia Emílio Ribas, São Paulo, SP, Brasil); Ibanes, Aline Santos (Instituto de Infectologia Emílio Ribas, São Paulo, SP, Brasil); Feijo, Regia Damous Fontenele (Instituto de Infectologia Emílio Ribas, São Paulo, SP, Brasil); de Luca Ito, Raquel Keiko (Instituto de Infectologia Emílio Ribas, São Paulo, SP, Brasil); Panico, Caroline Thomaz (Instituto de Infectologia Emílio Ribas, São Paulo, SP, Brasil); Cavalcante, Nilton José Fernandes (Instituto de Infectologia Emílio Ribas, São Paulo, SP, Brasil)","de Souza, Aline Aparecida Carneiro (Instituto de Infectologia Emílio Ribas)","de Souza, Aline Aparecida Carneiro (Instituto de Infectologia Emílio Ribas); Scota, Sayonara (Instituto de Infectologia Emílio Ribas); de Andrade, Beatriz Vilela (Instituto de Infectologia Emílio Ribas); Lian, Yu Ching (Instituto de Infectologia Emílio Ribas); Ibanes, Aline Santos (Instituto de Infectologia Emílio Ribas); Feijo, Regia Damous Fontenele (Instituto de Infectologia Emílio Ribas); de Luca Ito, Raquel Keiko (Instituto de Infectologia Emílio Ribas); Panico, Caroline Thomaz (Instituto de Infectologia Emílio Ribas); Cavalcante, Nilton José Fernandes (Instituto de Infectologia Emílio Ribas)",0,0,,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bjid.2023.103327,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1165946694,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3202 Clinical Sciences; 3207 Medical Microbiology,
1235,pub.1165032710,10.1016/j.htct.2023.09.1365,,,RASTREAMENTO DE TRANSFUSÕES INTERROMPIDAS E IDENTIFICAÇÃO DE HOTSPOTS TRANSFUSIONAIS NO ESTADO DO AMAZONAS,"Introdução Os hemocomponentes são subprodutos da doação de sangue e são empregados em várias situações patológicas. No entanto pouco se sabe a respeito das ferramentas de gestão hemoterápica de distribuição dos hemocomponentes, bem como métodos para rastreamento dos principais locais com transfusões interrompidas. Objetivo Rastrear hotspots de intercorrência transfusional no estado do Amazonas durante o período de 2015 a 2019. Materiais e métodos Este é um estudo transversal, quantitativo e descritivo. Os dados foram obtidos do banco de dados Hemosys da Fundação Hospitalar de Hematologia e Hemoterapia do Amazonas (HEMOAM) referentes aos anos de 2015 a 2019. A partir dos registros coletados, foram extraídas informações do tipo de hemocomponente, data de distribuição, hospital e município de destino das transfusões interrompidas, e organizadas em planilhas no Microsoft Excel 2010. Os hospitais e agências foram divididos com base no hemocomponente e na localização na cidade de Manaus, e em outros municípios do Amazonas. Foi utilizado o software QGIS v. 2.18.4 para construir mapas do estado do Amazonas e da cidade de Manaus, caracterizando os municípios com base no perfil de transfusões interrompidas no Amazonas, bem como bairros de Manaus. Resultados Durante o período de janeiro de 2015 a dezembro de 2019, foram registradas 418.883 interrupções de hemocomponentes em todo o estado do Amazonas. Destes, o Concentrado de Hemácias (CH) registrou 227.611 (54%) do total das transfusões interrompidas, seguido pelo concentrado de plaquetas com 117.629 (28%) das interrupções, plasma fresco congelado com 57.414 (14%) e crioprecipitado com 16.231 (4%) do total. Das transfusões interrompidas de CH, 221.403 (97%) ocorreram em Manaus, enquanto no interior, foram registradas 6.208 (2,7%) intercorrências distribuídas em 52 municípios, e 10 (16,12%) não apresentaram interrupções. Das transfusões interrompidas de concentrado de plaquetas, 117.326 (99,7%) ocorreram na cidade de Manaus, enquanto no interior foram registradas 303 (0,25%) interrupções. Do plasma fresco congelado, foram registradas 57.414 transfusões interrompidas no estado, sendo destas, 56.024 (97,58%) apenas na cidade de Manaus, e 1.390 (2,42%) distribuídas em 39 municípios. Houve registros de transfusões interrompidas do crioprecipitado somente na cidade de Manaus, com 16.231 casos. Discussão A partir dos dados obtidos, foi possível perceber que o CH foi o hemocomponente com o maior índice de interrupções, provavelmente por ser o de maior demanda, e que pode estar relacionado à densidade populacional. A capital Manaus foi detentora dos maiores números, e dentre os municípios do interior, observamos uma ampla distribuição das intercorrências em todo o estado.

1233,pub.1163171801,10.3390/su151612171,,,Towards Cleaner Ports: Predictive Modeling of Sulfur Dioxide Shipping Emissions in Maritime Facilities Using Machine Learning,"Maritime ports play a pivotal role in fostering the growth of domestic and international trade and economies. As ports continue to expand in size and capacity, the impact of their operations on air quality and climate change becomes increasingly significant. While nearby regions may experience economic benefits, there are significant concerns regarding the emission of atmospheric pollutants, which have adverse effects on both human health and climate change. Predictive modeling of port emissions can serve as a valuable tool in identifying areas of concern, evaluating the effectiveness of emission reduction strategies, and promoting sustainable development within ports. The primary objective of this research is to utilize machine learning frameworks to estimate the emissions of SO2 from ships during various port activities, including hoteling, maneuvering, and cruising. By employing these models, we aim to gain insights into the emission patterns and explore strategies to mitigate their impact. Through our analysis, we have identified the most effective models for estimating SO2 emissions. The AutoML TPOT framework emerges as the top-performing model, followed by Non-Linear Regression with interaction effects. On the other hand, Linear Regression exhibited the lowest performance among the models evaluated. By employing these advanced machine learning techniques, we aim to contribute to the body of knowledge surrounding port emissions and foster sustainable practices within the maritime industry.","We would like to acknowledge the support and computational resources provided by our institutions, and from DIMAR (Colombian General Directorate of Maritime) for supplying the datasets.","We hereby declare that no external funding or financial support was received for the execution of this research.

In this work, we first attempted to describe different algorithms to estimate neural complexity in a simple manner understandable for psychiatrists, psychologists, and neuroscientists. Then, we reviewed the findings of the brain complexity analysis in psychiatric disorders and their clinical implications. Method : A non-systematic comprehensive literature search was conducted for original studies on the complexity analysis of neurophysiological signals such as electroencephalogram, magnetoencephalogram, and blood-oxygen-level-dependent obtained from functional magnetic resonance imaging or functional near infrared spectroscopy. The search encompassed online scientific databases such as PubMed and Google Scholar. Results: Complexity measures mainly include entropy-based methods, the correlation dimension, fractal dimension, Lempel-Ziv complexity, and the Lyapunov exponent. There are important differences in the physical notions between these measures. Our literature review shows that dementia, autism, and adult ADHD exhibit less complexity in their neurophysiologic signals than healthy controls. However, children with ADHD, drug-naïve young schizophrenic patients with positive symptoms, and patients with mood disorders (i.e., depression and bipolar disorder) exhibit higher complexity in their neurophysiologic signals compared to healthy controls. In addition, contradictory findings still exist in some psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia regarding brain complexity, which can be due to technical issues, large heterogeneity in psychiatric disorders, and interference of typical factors. Conclusion: In summary, complexity analysis may present a new dimension to understanding psychiatric disorders. While complexity analysis is still far from having practical applications in routine clinical settings, complexity science can play an important role in comprehending the system dynamics of psychiatric disorders.",The authors thank the institutions where they work for encouraging the development of research.,,Iranian Journal of Psychiatry,,,,2023-09-18,2023,2023-09-18,2023-10,18,4,493-502,All OA; Gold,Article,"Hernández, Ronald Miguel; Ponce-Meza, Jacqueline Cynthia; Saavedra-López, Miguel Ángel; Ugaz, Walter Antonio Campos; Chanduvi, Roxana Monteza; Monteza, Walter Campos","Hernández, Ronald Miguel (Universidad Privada Norbert Wiener, Lima, Perú.); Ponce-Meza, Jacqueline Cynthia (Universidad Privada del Norte, Lima, Perú.); Saavedra-López, Miguel Ángel (Universidad Continental, Huancayo, Perú.); Ugaz, Walter Antonio Campos (Universidad Nacional Pedro Ruiz Gallo, Lambayeque, Perú.); Chanduvi, Roxana Monteza (Universidad Católica Santo Toribio de Mogrovejo, Chiclayo, Perú.); Monteza, Walter Campos (Universidad de San Martin de Porres, Lima, Perú.)","Hernández, Ronald Miguel (Universidad Norbert Wiener)","Hernández, Ronald Miguel (Universidad Norbert Wiener); Ponce-Meza, Jacqueline Cynthia (Private University of the North); Saavedra-López, Miguel Ángel (Universidad Continental); Ugaz, Walter Antonio Campos (Universidad Nacional Pedro Ruíz Gallo); Chanduvi, Roxana Monteza (Universidad Católica Santo Toribio de Mogrovejo); Monteza, Walter Campos (Universidad de San Martín de Porres)",3,3,,,https://doi.org/10.18502/ijps.v18i4.13637,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1164390369,52 Psychology; 5202 Biological Psychology,

Thus, it is understood that the sustainable development goals 2015–2030 (SDGs) need to be substantially operationalized in these institutions. Based on this idea, the QualEnv (quality and environment) consortium of universities stands out for having as its main objective the increase in contribution to sustainable development (SD) by universities through the implementation of systematic environmental practices and quality processes in line with the SDGs. The objective of this article is to present how the QualEnv consortium of HEIs adopts the SDGs and demonstrates their contribution to SD. For this purpose, a qualitative analysis was performed based on documentary research, a systematic review of the literature, and notes collected from participant observations. The results show that the adoption of the SDGs in the QualEnv consortium was enhanced by the contribution of the social relations within the partnership, which promoted the exchange of experiences and synergy between participants that promoted improvements in the necessary strategies. Along with the highlighted actions and concentration of different axes with dispersed interventions, a potential for central cohesion and focus on evolution in each SDG was noted. The adoption of the same indicators involves the unification of the actions planned for the SD and the common objective of involving communities more consistently, which impacts mainly SDG 04. This article discusses the practical implications in HEIs and the need to integrate the SDGs into their activities, as it demonstrates how universities belonging to the QualEnv consortium have been creating their own strategies to achieve the 2030 agenda and adopt the SDGs.","The authors would like to acknowledge support from the European Commission, Education Audiovisual and Culture Executive Agency, Erasmus+, in the context of the Qualenv Project: Change the Climate: Assuring the Quality of Environmental Strategies in Latin-American Higher Education—Project 609863-EPP-1-2019-1-PT-EPPKA2-CBHE-JP.

Objects like the baskets that are born in rural contexts materialize the relational complexity of the human technical activities and reshape spatialities allowing us to ask some question about the limits of the human, our relationships to the nature and how other species are constituent elements to us. Objects born in the countryside are an overlapping of spatial attributes allowing us to understand these sorts of materialities that have advanced some way to be recognized as handicrafts.

As IRAS são classificadas de acordo com o foco infeccioso, dentre essas, quando há a presença de um ou mais microrganismo na corrente sanguínea, cuja origem do mesmo não está relacionada a nenhum outro foco conforme definido nos critérios diagnósticos nacionais, denominamos Infecção Primária de Corrente Sanguínea (IPCS) que geralmente está relacionada ao procedimento hospitalar de inserção de cateter sanguíneo. Esse tipo de infecção pode ser identificado e seu microrganismo causador isolado no exame de hemocultura. Objetivo caracterizar o perfil microbiológico e a resistência antimicrobiana das Infecções Primária de Corrente Sanguínea em pacientes onco-hematológicos internados em um centro de referência do Amazonas nos anos de 2021 e 2022. Metodologia trata-se de um estudo epidemiológico, descritivo de abordagem quantitativa realizado a partir de dados obtidos em prontuário eletrônico por meio da análise das hemoculturas e antibiogramas realizados em um período de dois anos (01 de janeiro de 2021 a 31 de dezembro de 2022). Resultados foram identificadas um total de 280 hemoculturas positivas no sistema de prontuário eletrônico da unidade hospitalar nos anos de 2021 e 2022. Os microrganismos isolados mais incidentes pertenceram ao grupo de bactérias Gram-Negativas, dentre as quais destacaram-se: Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter sp. e Klebsiella pneumoniae. O padrão de resistência antimicrobiana encontrado neste estudo revelou que a maioria das bactérias Gram-Negativas nos dois anos apresentou resistência significativa a Ciprofloxacino, Cefepime e Piperacilina com Tazobactam. As infecções fúngicas foram a segunda mais prevalente, tendo como seu microrganismo mais comum a Candida parapsilosis que demonstrou uma prevalência de resistência de 16,6% a Anfotericina B. Discussão o perfil de prevalência das IPCS no presente estudo é preocupante pois, os quadros infecções por bactérias Gram-Negativas e Leveduras de origem intra-hospitalar são de difícil tratamento e terapêutica limitada. Em estudos que avaliaram casos de infecção intra-hospitalar observou-se que os microrganismos Gram-Negativos e Leveduras apresentaram as mais altas taxas de mortalidade. A escolha dos antimicrobianos para o tratamento de infecções intra-hospitalares depende, também, da microbiota prevalente no ambiente. Portanto, deve ser direcionada conforme a flora de cada serviço. No caso dos pacientes onco-hematológicos uma estratégia de prevenção de IPCS é a implantação de protocolos de profilaxia para os neutropênicos afebris e ou febris. Conclusão o perfil microbiológico e de resistência aos antimicrobianos do paciente onco-hematológico é característico e exige uma maior atenção visto que apresentam um padrão com mais patogenicidade e letalidade devido à alta prevalência de bactérias Gram-Negativas e Leveduras.

Semi-structured interviews were conducted remotely between the 5th andthe 18th of April 2020 in the three South African provinces hardest hit by Covid-19, namely Gauteng, KwaZulu-Natal and the Western Cape. In total, 60 qualitative key informant interviews and one focus group discussion were conducted. Study participants expressed concerns for elderly people and people with underlying health conditions because of their increased vulnerability to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). People living with HIV expressed an increased fear of infection following the advent of the Covid-19 pandemic in South Africa. The sidelining of healthcare services and stock-outs of medication proved to be an added concern in particular for vulnerable and immunocompromised groups. Overall, the data suggest that the fear of infection is ubiquitous for people who live in unstable environments such as overcrowded townships and informal settlements. Given the increased fears of infection brought on by the Covid-19 pandemic, the mental health of vulnerable communities and those caring for them becomes an added burden for people living in unstable environments.","The authors thank the study participants.

When people who migrate come into contact with a new culture, they are immersed in a process called acculturation. In this process, people oscillate between maintaining their own culture or acquiring the culture and customs of the host country, resulting in the so-called acculturation strategies. According to Berry’s proposal, there are four main acculturation strategies: assimilation, integration, marginalization and separation. The few existing studies of Latinos in an Anglo-Saxon country relate the use of the integration strategy (biculturalism) with lower cortisol levels. No studies have been found on the subject in Latino migrants in a Latino country.Methoda cross-sectional design was used to analyze the relationship between acculturation strategies and blood cortisol levels, based on the hypothesis that an integration strategy or biculturalism would be linked to lower cortisol levels. The study involved 314 Colombian migrants in Chile, who were evaluated with a scale of acculturation strategies according to the model proposed by Berry, in addition to providing blood samples to analyze cortisol levels.Resultsmigrants who show a preference for leave behind the culture of the country of origin have higher levels of cortisol ng/ml in blood. According to multiple comparisons the mean cortisol value was significantly different between integrated and assimilated subjects, with the mean cortisol of the integrated being significantly lower than that of the subjects typed as marginalized.ConclusionThe patterns of the relationship between biculturalism and cortisol found in Latino migrants in Anglo-Saxon countries are repeated in Latino migrants in a Latino country. It is necessary to explore the influence of other variables in this relationship, since it seems that the best adaptive strategy, and therefore the cortisol response, will vary according to the socio-cultural context of the host country.",We would like to thank everyone who participated in this study.,"This research was funded by Agencia Nacional de Investigación y Desarrollo—ANID, grant number FONDECYT 1180315.",BMC Psychology,,,Humans; Hydrocortisone; Acculturation; Chile; Colombia; Cross-Sectional Studies; Transients and Migrants,2023-03-31,2023,2023-03-31,,11,1,94,All OA; Gold,Article,"Urzúa, Alfonso; Aragón, Diego; Landabur, Rodrigo; Henríquez, Diego; Cortés, Leonel","Urzúa, Alfonso (Escuela de Psicología, Universidad Católica del Norte, Antofagasta, Chile); Aragón, Diego (Escuela de Medicina, Universidad de Tarapacá, Arica, Chile); Landabur, Rodrigo (Departamento de Psicología, Universidad de Atacama, Copiapó, Chile); Henríquez, Diego (Escuela de Psicología, Universidad Católica del Norte, Antofagasta, Chile); Cortés, Leonel (Departamento de Tecnología Médica, Universidad de Antofagasta, Antofagasta, Chile)","Urzúa, Alfonso (Catholic University of the North)","Urzúa, Alfonso (Catholic University of the North); Aragón, Diego (University of Tarapacá); Landabur, Rodrigo (University of Atacama); Henríquez, Diego (Catholic University of the North); Cortés, Leonel (University of Antofagasta)",1,1,,,https://bmcpsychology.biomedcentral.com/counter/pdf/10.1186/s40359-023-01147-w,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1156776523,52 Psychology; 5201 Applied and Developmental Psychology; 5202 Biological Psychology; 5203 Clinical and Health Psychology,

Human activities have significantly impacted the environment, ecosystems, and plant and animal diversity throughout history. The planet’s average temperature is estimated to increase by about 3.2 °C this century, severely affecting human health. One of the events attributed to climate change is heat waves. A popular belief states that if frog is submerged in a container and gradually heats it up, it will try to adapt until it dies; this is probably the situation faced by more and more human populations. As stated by thousands of scientists, academics, and researchers worldwide, the planet’s warming is directly related to climate change.

1226,pub.1165045352,10.1016/j.htct.2023.09.1363,,,REAÇÕES TRANSFUSIONAIS EM PACIENTES ONCOLÓGICOS DE UM HOSPITAL UNIVERSITÁRIO DO RIO DE JANEIRO,"Objetivo Avaliar e caracterizar as reações transfusionais ocorridas nos últimos 5 anos no Hospital Universitário Pedro Ernesto (HUPE) nos pacientes oncológicos, bem como os procedimentos especiais aos quais os hemocomponentes foram submetidos. Materiais e métodos Dados coletados do prontuário eletrônico do hospital e dos arquivos de Notificação do Serviço de Hemoterapia. Resultados De 2018 a 2022, 138 Reações Transfusionais (RT) foram notificadas no HUPE. Dessas, 85 ocorreram em pacientes oncológicos, o que corresponde a 61,5% do total de RT. Na população estudada, 50 eram do sexo masculino (58,8%) e 35 do sexo feminino (41,2%). A maior parte dos pacientes (63) tinha diagnóstico hematológico, o que corresponde a 74,1% da população. 64 RT (75,3%) ocorreram em vigência de algum protocolo de modificação de Hemocomponentes (HC) e 62 (72,9%) resultaram em modificação do protocolo. A principal RT notificada nesse grupo foi Reação Febril Não Hemolítica (RFNH), totalizando 48 notificações (56,4%), seguida por Reação Alérgica (RA), 25 notificações (29,4%). Das RFNH, 30 (62,5%) ocorreram devido a transfusão de concentrado de hemácias. Já em relação às RA, 18 (72%) foram relacionadas à transfusão de concentrado de plaquetas ou plasma fresco congelado. Foi observada recorrência das RT em 11 pacientes. Discussão As transfusões de HC ainda são um pilar eficaz e seguro para grande parte dos pacientes oncológicos. Essa população apresenta grande demanda transfusional, seja pela própria doença de base, seja por sangramentos decorrentes dos tumores ou pela aplasia medular provocada pelo tratamento. Por se tratarem de frações de um tecido vivo, RT podem ocorrer principalmente neste grupo específico de pacientes devido à grande exposição a estes produtos. Devido a isso, alguns desses indivíduos recebem HC com protocolo especial desde o diagnóstico. Já uma outra parte passa a receber HC modificados ou têm alteração do protocolo apenas após a ocorrência de alguma RT. A maior parte das RT notificadas no HUPE no período de 5 anos ocorreu nessa parcela de pacientes, principalmente naqueles com diagnóstico Hematológico. A maioria das RT resultou em alteração da conduta hemoterápica, seja por iniciar ou por alterar um protocolo já existente. De forma semelhante à descrita na literatura atual, a RFNH foi a RT mais frequentemente observada, seguida pela RA. Foi também observada recorrência das RT mesmo após a modificação dos HC, uma vez que os protocolos transfusionais reduzem, mas não eliminam a chance de ocorrência dessas reações. Conclusão Devido ao alto volume transfusional associado à doença de base, os pacientes oncológicos representam um grupo de risco para o desenvolvimento de RT e necessidade de uso de protocolos de modificação de HC. Vale ressaltar, que os protocolos de modificação de HC não impedem as RT, mas sim reduzem o risco de ocorrência das mesmas, portanto a sinalização precoce do diagnóstico para o Serviço de Hemoterapia permite a implantação de protocolos de modificações de HC visando prevenir e/ou reduzir a incidência dessas RT.",,,Hematology Transfusion and Cell Therapy,,,,2023-10,2023,,2023-10,45,,s752-s753,All OA; Gold,Article,"Costa; Fonseca, KB; Mesquita, CA; Silva, CS; Coelho, DP; Bandeira, FMGC","Costa (Hospital Universitário Pedro Ernesto (UERJ), Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brasil); Fonseca, KB (Hospital Universitário Pedro Ernesto (UERJ), Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brasil); Mesquita, CA (Hospital Universitário Pedro Ernesto (UERJ), Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brasil); Silva, CS (Hospital Universitário Pedro Ernesto (UERJ), Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brasil); Coelho, DP (Hospital Universitário Pedro Ernesto (UERJ), Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brasil); Bandeira, FMGC (Faculdade de Ciências Médicas da Universidade do Estado do Rio de Janeiro (UERJ), Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brasil)",,"Costa (Hospital Universitário Pedro Ernesto); Fonseca, KB (Hospital Universitário Pedro Ernesto); Mesquita, CA (Hospital Universitário Pedro Ernesto); Silva, CS (Hospital Universitário Pedro Ernesto); Coelho, DP (Hospital Universitário Pedro Ernesto); Bandeira, FMGC (Rio de Janeiro State University)",0,0,,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.htct.2023.09.1363,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1165045352,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3201 Cardiovascular Medicine and Haematology,
1225,pub.1165046271,10.1016/j.htct.2023.09.270,,,ANÁLISE COMPARATIVA ENTRE CONTAGENS CELULARES EM AMOSTRAS DE SANGUE EM HEPARINA DE LÍTIO E EDTAK2,"Introdução/Objetivos O EDTAK2 é o anticoagulante recomendado pela CLSI e pelo ISCH para a realização do hemograma. Na rotina hospitalar é interessante a possibilidade de realização de maior quantidade de exames com a mesma amostra, pois algumas situações exigem a coleta de um volume menor de sangue ou, até mesmo, em situações de extrema urgência. Seria mais eficiente a possibilidade de realização do hemograma utilizando a mesma amostra usada na avaliação dos gases sanguíneos, em presença do anticoagulante heparina de lítio (LiH). Não há estudos, com casuística considerável, que investigaram a equivalência das contagens de células sanguíneas heparinizadas em comparação ao uso do EDTAK2. O objetivo deste estudo foi comparar a contagem celular completa de sangue heparinizado provenientes de amostras coletadas para realização de gasometria e de amostras de hemograma (EDTAK2) oriundas da mesma punção. Material e métodos Foram avaliadas 500 amostras de gasometria arterial coletadas em seringa BD A-Line™ em proporção de 50 UI de LiH por mL de sangue em paralelo com 500 amostras de hemograma coletadas em EDTAK2 (BD Vacutainer®). Todas eram provenientes da rotina hospitalar do Hospital Universitário Regional dos Campos Gerais, Paraná, Brasil. As análises foram realizadas no Sysmex-XN 1000™. Os parâmetros analisados foram: RBC, HBG, HCT, RDW, VCM, HCM, CHCM, WBC e PLT. A comparação entre os valores medianos foi realizada pelo teste de Mann-Whitney U. Para avaliar o grau de concordância foi utilizado o método de Bland-Altman e os limites clinicamente aceitáveis foram RBC ±1,7%, HBG ±1,8%, HCT ±1,7%, RDW ±1,7%, VCM ±1,2%, HCM ±1,4%, CHCM ±0,8%, WBC ±5,6% e PLT ±5,9%. Resultados Os parâmetros RBC, HBG, HCT, RDW, VCM e PLT apresentaram diminuição significativa (p < 0,05) e CHCM aumento significativo (p < 0,05), nas amostras de sangue em LiH em relação ao EDTAK2. Na avaliação da concordância entre os valores dos parâmetros entre os dois anticoagulantes, observou-se um viés significativo do limite clínico aceitável, apresentando diminuição: RBC (3,4%), HBG (3,4%), HCT (6,7%), RDW (2,2%), VCM (3,2%) e PLT (116,4%) e aumento da CHCM (3,2%). Discussão Um estudo prévio, que também avaliou as contagens celulares em amostras coletadas em LiH para gasometria, não encontrou diferença significativa entre os valores de RBC, HGB e HCT em relação as amostras coletadas em EDTA, porém a casuística do trabalho era pequena, foram avaliadas apenas 5 amostras. A diferença mais impactante entre as análises foi observada nas contagens plaquetárias que foram significativamente menores nas amostras heparinizadas em relação as amostras em EDTAK2. Esse resultado está de acordo com estudos anteriores que demonstraram diminuição nas contagens plaquetárias em amostras heparinizadas, devido à adesão e a formação de microagregados plaquetários, os quais podem não ser detectados por alguns modelos de equipamentos hematológicos. Conclusão Os resultados do presente estudo demonstraram que maioria dos parâmetros do hemograma, demasiadamente a contagem de plaquetas, excederam as especificações permitidas para o viés clínico aceitável na avaliação de amostras heparinizadas. Portanto amostras de sangue em LiH não devem ser utilizadas para avaliar parâmetros do hemograma. No entanto, cada laboratório clínico deve avaliar e validar os procedimentos de contagens celulares de acordo com as particularidades da rotina inerentes a cada local.",,,Hematology Transfusion and Cell Therapy,,,,2023-10,2023,,2023-10,45,,s108-s109,All OA; Gold,Article,"Françoia, PCO; Kalva, DC; Moss, MF","Françoia, PCO (Universidade Estadual de Ponta Grossa (UEPG), Ponta Grossa, PR, Brasil); Kalva, DC (Universidade Estadual de Ponta Grossa (UEPG), Ponta Grossa, PR, Brasil); Moss, MF (Universidade Estadual de Ponta Grossa (UEPG), Ponta Grossa, PR, Brasil)",,"Françoia, PCO (Ponta Grossa State University); Kalva, DC (Ponta Grossa State University); Moss, MF (Ponta Grossa State University)",0,0,,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.htct.2023.09.270,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1165046271,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3201 Cardiovascular Medicine and Haematology,
1225,pub.1165033161,10.1016/j.htct.2023.09.857,,,LESÃO DE ANTOPOL-GOLDMAN EM HEMOFÍLICO B GRAVE: RELATO DE CASO,"Introdução A Lesão de Antopol-Goldman (LAG) é uma condição benigna rara, caracterizada por hematoma ou hemorragia subepitelial da pelve renal, podendo envolver os cálices renais e o ureter proximal. As manifestações clínicas mais comumente encontradas são hematúria macroscópica e dor lombar aguda unilateral. A Hemofilia B é uma doença hemorrágica hereditária ligada ao cromossomo X, definida pela deficiência de fator IX e consequente alteração da hemostasia secundária. Relatamos um caso de LAG em paciente portador de Hemofilia B grave. Material e método: Revisão retrospectiva do prontuário médico. Resultado Homem, 22 anos, portador de Hemofilia B grave com inibidor, sem outras comorbidades. Histórico hemorrágico relevante: síndrome compartimental em membro inferior direito devido hematoma, pseudotumor hemofílico em cotovelo esquerdo e hemartroses recorrentes em tornozelos. Em uso de profilaxia terciária. Presença de inibidor do fator IX, com pico em 102,4 Unidades Bethesda (UB)/mL em 2013, sendo submetido a protocolo de imunotolerância experimental em 2014, com erradicação inicial do inibidor e sem síndrome nefrótica. Em 2022, apresentou dor lombar à direita, com hematúria macroscópica associada. Negou trauma abdominal e calculose renal prévia. Realizados exames de imagem (ultrassonografia de aparelho urinário e tomografia de abdome) que evidenciaram dilatação pielocalicinal no rim direito, havendo conteúdo hiperdenso de aspecto hemático, sem calculose renal, hidronefrose ou alteração de ureter. Na ocasião, foi novamente detectado inibidor do fator IX em baixos títulos (1,45 UB/mL). Paciente recebeu hidratação venosa vigorosa por 48h e, por não haver resolução, foi administrado Fator IX 5.000UI a cada 12 horas por 3 dias, apresentando resolução da hematúria em 2 dias. Manteve profilaxia terciária, sem recorrência do quadro. Realizada tomografia de controle após alta hospitalar, que evidenciou resolução do conteúdo hemático. Discussão A LAG pode estar relacionada à trauma, malformação congênita, trombocitopenia, hemofilia, ou não ter uma etiologia bem definida, sendo mais comum em idosos. A tomografia computadorizada é superior à ultrassonografia, e seus achados geralmente são discretos, englobando lesões hiperdensas que podem mimetizar tumores renais, levando à nefrectomia e outros procedimentos invasivos desnecessários. Deve ser manejada de forma conservadora, com correção da provável causa subjacente e exame de imagem para controle em 1 a 3 meses, conforme relato de casos da literatura. A embolização arterial foi relatada em casos em que a lesão é refratária a medidas conservadoras. Conclusão Descrevemos um caso de um jovem com Hemofilia B com quadro clínico e radiológico sugestivo de LAG, que não possuía outros fatores predisponentes além da doença hemorrágica hereditária, e que respondeu à terapia com reposição do fator deficiente com resolução da hematúria e das alterações tomográficas em imagem de controle. Neste caso, por ser o paciente sabidamente hemofílico, o diagnóstico diferencial foi assertivo. Apesar de raro, é necessário incluir a LAG como diagnóstico diferencial nestes pacientes, a fim de evitar intervenções desnecessárias e que possam causar maior morbimortalidade.",,,Hematology Transfusion and Cell Therapy,,,,2023-10,2023,,2023-10,45,,s460-s461,All OA; Gold,Article,"Eickhoff, P; João, PJM; Rodrigues, MTC; Bregagnollo, BMB; Corrêa, VJF; Emrich, AL; Souza, LET; Jericó, PC; Piaia, C; Franco, VKB","Eickhoff, P (Centro de Pesquisas Oncológicas de Santa Catarina (CEPON), Florianópolis, SC, Brasil); João, PJM (Centro de Pesquisas Oncológicas de Santa Catarina (CEPON), Florianópolis, SC, Brasil); Rodrigues, MTC (Centro de Pesquisas Oncológicas de Santa Catarina (CEPON), Florianópolis, SC, Brasil); Bregagnollo, BMB (Centro de Pesquisas Oncológicas de Santa Catarina (CEPON), Florianópolis, SC, Brasil); Corrêa, VJF (Centro de Pesquisas Oncológicas de Santa Catarina (CEPON), Florianópolis, SC, Brasil); Emrich, AL (Centro de Pesquisas Oncológicas de Santa Catarina (CEPON), Florianópolis, SC, Brasil); Souza, LET (Centro de Pesquisas Oncológicas de Santa Catarina (CEPON), Florianópolis, SC, Brasil); Jericó, PC (Centro de Pesquisas Oncológicas de Santa Catarina (CEPON), Florianópolis, SC, Brasil); Piaia, C (Centro de Pesquisas Oncológicas de Santa Catarina (CEPON), Florianópolis, SC, Brasil; Centro de Hematologia e Hemoterapia de Santa Catarina (HEMOSC), Florianópolis, SC, Brasil); Franco, VKB (Centro de Pesquisas Oncológicas de Santa Catarina (CEPON), Florianópolis, SC, Brasil; Centro de Hematologia e Hemoterapia de Santa Catarina (HEMOSC), Florianópolis, SC, Brasil)",,"Eickhoff, P (Centro de Pesquisas Oncológicas); João, PJM (Centro de Pesquisas Oncológicas); Rodrigues, MTC (Centro de Pesquisas Oncológicas); Bregagnollo, BMB (Centro de Pesquisas Oncológicas); Corrêa, VJF (Centro de Pesquisas Oncológicas); Emrich, AL (Centro de Pesquisas Oncológicas); Souza, LET (Centro de Pesquisas Oncológicas); Jericó, PC (Centro de Pesquisas Oncológicas); Piaia, C (Centro de Pesquisas Oncológicas; Centro de Hematologia e Hemoterapia de Santa Catarina (HEMOSC), Florianópolis, SC, Brasil); Franco, VKB (Centro de Pesquisas Oncológicas; Centro de Hematologia e Hemoterapia de Santa Catarina (HEMOSC), Florianópolis, SC, Brasil)",0,0,,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.htct.2023.09.857,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1165033161,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3201 Cardiovascular Medicine and Haematology,

The study included a group of 684 students, ranging in age from 12 to 18 years, who were attending educational institutions in the city of Arica. The Child and Adolescent Assessment System (SENA) was used to measure mental health problems, the Brief Resilience Scale for Children and Youth (CYRM-12) was used to measure resilience, and the Vulnerability Index of Educational Institutions was used to measure educational vulnerability. The results suggest increases in depressive, anxious, and social anxiety symptomatologies over time (wave by year, 2018, 2020, and 2021). In addition, multiple linear regression models showed predictive effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, gender, vulnerability index, socioeconomic status, and resilient behaviors on mental health problems.

A total of 834 young people and adults between 18 and 38 years of age (Mean = 20.97, SD = 2.39) participated; 646 women (77.50%) and 188 men (22.50%), who completed the Sternberg's love scale (STLS-R), Brief Jealousy Scale (BJS), Relationship Assessment Scale (RAS) and Woman Abuse Screening Tool (WAST-2). A partial unregularized network was estimated using the ggmModSelect function. The Bridge Strength index was calculated because the aim was to identify the bridge nodes between the variables under study. The results reveal that two nodes of the love variable, Commitment, and Intimacy, had a direct and moderate relationship with the Satisfaction node. The latter is the central node in the network. However, in the male group, the most intense associations are in Satisfaction-Intimacy, Violence-Passion, Jealousy-Commitment.

This research tries to classify his works, put it in value and show the validity of his legacy to new generations of researchers in the fields of Mass Media and Communication Studies. The methodology applies quantitative and qualitative methods based on bibliographic and scientometric analysis. This paper concludes that there is a proportionate balance between books, book chapters and academic articles among the time. Fernández del Moral’s work can be classified into two main fields, which are the Specialized Journalism and Applied Communication. Finally, this paper underlines his influence and deep heritage in the rest of the academic community. He has been responsible for the creation of an epistemological and theoretical frame for Specialized Journalism as a university course, with extensions in universities all around Spain and Latin America.",,,Historia y Comunicación Social,,,,2023-05,2023,,,28,1,69-77,All OA; Gold,Article,"Lorenzo, Francisco Cabezuelo; Oceja, José Francisco Serrano","Lorenzo, Francisco Cabezuelo (Universidad Complutense de Madrid (UCM)); Oceja, José Francisco Serrano (Universidad CEU-San Pablo)",,"Lorenzo, Francisco Cabezuelo (Complutense University of Madrid); Oceja, José Francisco Serrano (CEU San Pablo University)",0,0,,,https://revistas.ucm.es/index.php/HICS/article/download/80275/4564456564509,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1159694072,"47 Language, Communication and Culture; 4701 Communication and Media Studies",

This study aimed to analyze the geochemical and environmental changes detected in soil, water, and sediments around the La Sierre mine, and to determine if contamination persists over time. The concentrations of ten trace elements (As, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, Mn, Ni, Pb, V, Zn) were measured in 20 soil samples, 10 water samples, and 6 sediment samples, sampling at the most affected points. Soil and sediment samples were analyzed by Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS) and water samples by Inductively Coupled Plasma Optical Emission Spectrometry (ICP-OES). From the Principal Component Analysis (PCA), soil samples SOI-6, 7, and 20 presented high amounts ranging from 14489.86a±7 to 3031.72b ± 1 mg/kg of Co, Cu, Ni, and As, respectively. Water samples WAT-6, 8, and 10 presented high contents of As, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, Mn, Ni, Pb, V, and Zn, being sample WAT-8 with high values of As, Co, Cu, Fe, and Ni with 48.1 ± 0.82, 368 ± 4, 68.3 ± 0.1, 97.5 ± 1.2, and 152 ± 2 μg/L, respectively, exceeding the regulation given by R.D 314/2016 (Water for human consumption). The sediment samples were compared with the IInterim Sediment Quality Guideline (ISQG) and Probable Effect Level (PEL) values given by the Canadian Sediment Quality Guidelines for the Protection of Aquatic Life. When presenting a high ISQG value, but low PEL, they partially comply with the regulations, which happens with samples SED-1, 2, and 8 for As and SED-5, 6, and 7 for Pb. On the contrary, Cr and Cu do not comply with what is established in samples SED-8 and SED-1 and 8, respectively, whereas, in samples SED-2 and 5, Cu partially complies with the established regulations. The values found for the trace elements present in the abandoned traditional mining area with abundant epithermal deposits prevail over time in soil, water, and sediments.","Acknowledgements The authors would like to thank the Universidad Politécnica de Madrid for their assistance in sampling and data collection in the field, as well as for permitting the access to and use of their laboratories for the analysis and experimental part of this article.

The synthesized compound was characterized by UV-Visible, FT-IR, HRMS, 1H NMR, and 13C NMR spectroscopic studies and X-ray crystallography, revealing that the crystal belongs to a triclinic crystal system with a P1̄ space group, Z = 2. In the present work, we focus on molecular modeling studies such as Hirshfeld surface analysis, energy framework calculations, frontier molecular orbital analysis, natural bond orbital analysis, and NLO properties of a π-conjugate system combining the chalcone and the pyrazole[3,4-b]pyridine scaffolds to describe the in-depth structural analysis thereof. Good agreement was found between the calculated results and experimental data. In addition, Hirshfeld surface analysis of the crystal structure showed that the intermolecular stabilization in the crystal packing comes mainly from H⋯H bond interactions. The chalcone crystal exhibits significant NLO properties suggesting that it could be considered a potential candidate for application in nonlinear optical devices.","A FONDECYT project number 1200531 supported this research.

(Balsaminaceae) using nanopore long-read sequencing","The plant family Balsaminaceae comprises only two genera, and they are a study in contrasts. While Impatiens is an impressively prolific genus, with over 1,000 species and more being discovered each year, its sister genus, Hydrocera, has one solitary species, H. triflora. The two genera also differ in geographic distribution and habitat type (Impatiens species are widely distributed in much of the Old World and N. America, while H. triflora is confined to wetlands specific to S. India, Sri Lanka, and SE Asia). Other contrasting features include plant habit, habitat, floral architecture, mode of seed dispersal, and a host of other traits. The family Balsaminaceae is therefore an excellent model for studying speciation and character evolution as well as understanding the proximal and evolutionary forces that have driven the two genera to adopt such contrasting evolutionary paths. Various species of the Impatiens genus are also commercially important in the ornamental flower industry and as sources of phytochemicals that are of medicinal and other commercial value. As a preliminary step towards studying the genomic basis of the contrasting features of the two genera, we have sequenced and assembled, de novo, the genome of an iconic Impatiens species from N.

This research aimed to determine the influence of corn starch percentage on the physicomechanical and microstructural properties of a diatomite-based porous ceramic. The starch consolidation casting technique was applied to fabricate a diatomite-based thermal insulating ceramic with hierarchical porosity. Diatomite mixtures with 0%, 10%, 20%, 30%, and 40% starch were consolidated. The results show that starch content significantly influences apparent porosity, and this, in turn, influences several parameters, such as thermal conductivity, diametral compressive strength, microstructure, and water absorption of diatomite-based ceramics. The porous ceramic processed by the starch consolidation casting method corresponding to the mixture of diatomite with 30% starch obtained the best properties, with a thermal conductivity of 0.0984 W/m·K, an apparent porosity of 57.88%, a water absorption of 58.45%, and a diametral compressive strength of 35.18 kg/cm2 (3.45 MPa).

Among the new detection proposals, the use of peptides mimetics has surged as an alternative to avoid the use of antibodies, of which there has been a shortage during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the use of peptides in detection systems still presents some questions to be answered, mainly referring to their stability under different environmental conditions. In this work, we synthesized an ACE2 peptide mimic and evaluated its stability in different pH, salinity, polarity, and temperature conditions. Further, the same conditions were assessed when using the ability of the peptide mimic to detect the recombinant SARS-CoV-2 spike protein in a biotin-streptavidin-enzyme-linked assay. Finally, we also tested the capacity of the peptide to detect SARS-CoV-2 from patients' samples. The results indicate that the peptide is structurally sensitive to the medium conditions, with relevance to the pH, where basic pH favored its performance when used as a SARS-CoV-2 detector. Further, the proposed peptide mimic was able to detect SARS-CoV-2 comparably to RT-qPCR results. Therefore, the present study promotes knowledge advancement, particularly in terms of stability considerations, in the application of peptide mimics as a replacement for antibodies in detection systems.",,"This research was funded by Joint Biotechnology Research Projects at COVID-19, ANID CHILE—CONCYTEC PERÚ, grant number covbio0011.",Biosensors,,,"Humans; COVID-19; SARS-CoV-2; Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2; RNA, Viral; Pandemics; Peptides; Protein Binding",2023-04-13,2023,2023-04-13,,13,4,473,All OA; Gold,Article,"Santana, Paula A; Álvarez, Claudio A; Valenzuela, Santiago; Manchego, Alberto; Guzmán, Fanny; Tirapegui, Cristian; Ahumada, Manuel","Santana, Paula A (Instituto de Ciencias Químicas Aplicadas, Facultad de Ingeniería, Universidad Autónoma de Chile, el Llano Subercaseaux 2801, San Miguel, Santiago 8910272, Chile.); Álvarez, Claudio A (Laboratorio de Fisiología y Genética Marina, Centro de Estudios Avanzados en Zonas Áridas, Larrondo 1281, Coquimbo 1780000, Chile.; Facultad de Ciencias del Mar, Universidad Católica del Norte, Larrondo 1281, Coquimbo 1780000, Chile.); Valenzuela, Santiago (Instituto de Ciencias Químicas Aplicadas, Facultad de Ingeniería, Universidad Autónoma de Chile, el Llano Subercaseaux 2801, San Miguel, Santiago 8910272, Chile.); Manchego, Alberto (Laboratorio de Microbiología, Facultad de Medicina Veterinaria y Parasitología Veterinaria, Universidad Nacional Mayor de San Marcos, Lima 3673, Peru.); Guzmán, Fanny (Núcleo Biotecnología Curauma, Pontificia Universidad Católica de Valparaíso, Valparaíso 2373223, Chile.); Tirapegui, Cristian (Instituto de Ciencias Químicas Aplicadas, Facultad de Ingeniería, Universidad Autónoma de Chile, el Llano Subercaseaux 2801, San Miguel, Santiago 8910272, Chile.); Ahumada, Manuel (Escuela de Biotecnología, Facultad de Ciencias, Ingeniería y Tecnología, Universidad Mayor, Camino La Piramide 5750, Huechuraba, Santiago 8910272, Chile.; Centro de Nanotecnología Aplicada, Facultad de Ciencias, Ingeniería y Tecnología, Universidad Mayor, Camino La Piramide 5750, Huechuraba, Santiago 8910272, Chile.)","Álvarez, Claudio A (Laboratorio de Fisiología y Genética Marina, Centro de Estudios Avanzados en Zonas Áridas, Larrondo 1281, Coquimbo 1780000, Chile.; Catholic University of the North); Ahumada, Manuel (Universidad Mayor; Universidad Mayor)","Santana, Paula A (Universidad Autónoma de Chile); Álvarez, Claudio A (Laboratorio de Fisiología y Genética Marina, Centro de Estudios Avanzados en Zonas Áridas, Larrondo 1281, Coquimbo 1780000, Chile.; Catholic University of the North); Valenzuela, Santiago (Universidad Autónoma de Chile); Manchego, Alberto (National University of San Marcos); Guzmán, Fanny (Pontificial Catholic University of Valparaiso); Tirapegui, Cristian (Universidad Autónoma de Chile); Ahumada, Manuel (Universidad Mayor; Universidad Mayor)",3,3,,,https://www.mdpi.com/2079-6374/13/4/473/pdf?version=1681371393,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1157237434,31 Biological Sciences; 34 Chemical Sciences; 3401 Analytical Chemistry,3 Good Health and Well Being

In early 2020, the spread of the virus left its mark on every affected country, impacting mental health by limiting daily activities and causing fatalities amidst public health strategies to mitigate its impact. The influence of COVID-19 on the quality of life (QoL) may vary between countries, underscoring the need to examine its effects on individuals and families during the mandatory home quarantine. We aimed to assess the QoL of individuals and families during home isolation by COVID-19 lockdown.
Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted from February to May 2020. We included adult partners (≥18 years) of families from Brazil, Colombia, Spain, Japan, Peru, Russia, and Venezuela. Using the 26-item World Health Organization Quality of Life Brief (WHOQOL-BREF) questionnaire we assess the impact of COVID-19 on their partner/family member's QoL.
Results: The survey was completed by 466 participants (mean age = 38.59 ± 13.75 years; females = 298) and 76% worked mostly as health professionals from South America (69.2%), Europe (18.4%), and Asia (12.4%). The WHOQOL-BREF mean score from 38.38 ± 11.55 (range = 22.8-43.4). The average quality of life in South America (41.9 ± 1.2) was significantly higher than that of European countries (30.9 ± 11.5) (p = 0.002). The social relations dimension was the only one with values close to 100 (mean = 83.3) in 6/7 evaluated countries, where only Spain had a low score (41 ± 33.12). Women had a slightly lower quality of life than men, but it was not significant (40.2 ± 8.8 vs. 41.5 ± 9.9, p = 0.354), while we found differences in the overall QoL between young and older, and by employment type (p < 0.05). According to family structure, we found differences on QoL between nuclear and siblings' families (p = 0.024).
Conclusion: Families from seven countries of three continents reported poor QoL during the first outbreak of COVID-19.

In 2017, a nemertean worm, Carcinonemertes conanobrieni was described from ovigerous females of P. argus in Florida, USA. A year later, the presence of the same egg predator was recorded along the southern Caribbean coast (Colombia). The effect of this egg predator on the reproductive performance, including fecundity, embryo mortality, and reproductive output, of its host is unknown. This study tested whether C. conanobrieni affects embryo mortality, fecundity, and reproductive output in brooding females of P. argus.ResultsArtisan fishers caught 90 ovigerous lobsters near Pueblo Viejo, Magdalena, Colombia. Each ovigerous female was examined for the presence/absence of the egg predator. Lobster egg mortality (%), fecundity (nº eggs female−1), and reproductive output (%) were estimated. Prevalence of C. conanobrieni in the studied population was 87.78%. The mean intensity of C. conanobrieni (all life stages) in the population was 11.68 (± 1.98) egg predators per brood mass sample. Infected females brooding late-stage embryos exhibited lower fecundity, lower reproductive performance values, and higher embryo mortality compared to infected females brooding early-stage embryos. Embryo stage and worm infection level negatively impacted fecundity and reproductive output. Worm infection level and the number of adult nemertean worms also negatively affected embryo mortality.ConclusionsThese results demonstrate an adverse effect of C. conanobrieni on the reproductive performance of P. argus. The interactive impact of this egg predator, natural stressors, and anthropogenic stressors on individual P. argus reproductive performance could facilitate losses at large-scale fisheries levels.","We would like to thank the Autoridad Nacional de Licencias Ambientales (ANLA) for awarding the permits for specimen collection.

Purpose: This study assessed the psychometric properties of the WAI-S-P in a sample of individuals from Peru who are receiving psychological therapy. Furthermore, a network analysis was conducted to investigate the direct relationships between the therapeutic alliance and several relevant sociodemographic variables.
Methods: The short version of the Working Alliance Inventory was used in a sample of 241 participants (Mage=32.58, SD=12.67) that had attended less than 6 sessions. Three models were considered, including a three-factor and a two-factor correlated model, as well as a bifactor model. In addition, a network of partial associations was created including the overall therapeutic alliance, sex, age, and number of psychotherapeutic sessions.
Results: The bifactor model, with an overall therapeutic alliance factor and two specific factors (""contact"" and ""contract""), better fit the data. Invariance of the structure by sex and age showed equitable measurement. On the other hand, network analysis revealed a positive correlation between total session attendance and therapeutic alliance. Men reported higher therapeutic alliance, while women had higher total session attendance.
Conclusion: The results of this study suggest that the therapeutic alliance is better represented by a bifactor model and demonstrates invariance across sex and age in Peruvian adults. Additionally, findings indicate that differences in life experiences and the sex of patients may need to be verified in future studies to better understand nuanced needs in forming therapeutic alliances at least in the early stages of session attendance.",,,Patient Preference and Adherence,,,,2023-09,2023,2023-09,,17,,2365-2376,All OA; Gold,Article,"Ramos-Vera, Cristian; Sánchez-Villena, Andy R; Calle, Dennis; Calizaya-Milla, Yaquelin E; Saintila, Jacksaint","Ramos-Vera, Cristian (Área de Investigación, Universidad Cesar Vallejo (UCV), Lima, Perú); Sánchez-Villena, Andy R (Facultad de Ciencias de La Salud, Universidad Privada del Norte, Cajamarca, Perú); Calle, Dennis (Área de Investigación, Universidad Cesar Vallejo (UCV), Lima, Perú); Calizaya-Milla, Yaquelin E (Facultad de Ciencias de la Salud, Universidad Peruana Unión, Lima, Perú); Saintila, Jacksaint (Escuela de Medicina Humana, Universidad Señor de Sipán, Chiclayo, Perú)","Saintila, Jacksaint (Universidad Señor de Sipán)","Ramos-Vera, Cristian (Universidad César Vallejo); Sánchez-Villena, Andy R (Private University of the North); Calle, Dennis (Universidad César Vallejo); Calizaya-Milla, Yaquelin E (Peruvian Union University); Saintila, Jacksaint (Universidad Señor de Sipán)",0,0,,,https://www.dovepress.com/getfile.php?fileID=93051,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1164391048,42 Health Sciences; 4203 Health Services and Systems,3 Good Health and Well Being

Our aim was to compare the subjective well-being, life satisfaction, mental status, and social support of representative samples of adults living in segregated settlements (colonies) and identifying as Roma with those of the general population in Hungary.
Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted with random samples of 417 individuals from the general Hungarian adult population (55.6% female, mean age = 43.89 ± 12.61 years) and 394 adults living in segregated settlements (colonies) (73.9% female, mean age = 42.37 ± 12.39 years). Demographic questions were used as well as the WHO Well-Being Index (WBI-5), the single item Life Satisfaction Scale, the 12-item version of the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12), and the Oslo Social Support Scale (OSSS-3).
Results: Residents of colonies reported significantly lower levels of subjective well-being and life satisfaction than the general population. The proportion of individuals at high risk for mental morbidity was more than twice as high among colony dwellers (16.4%) as in non-colony dwellers (7.6%). Similar unfavorable differences were seen at the expense of self-identified Roma compared to self-identified Hungarians but no difference was found in terms of social support either by type of residence or ethnicity. 32.2% of colony-dwellers self-identified themselves as Hungarian. Mental health assessed by principal component was directly determined by settlement type of permanent residence, age, educational attainment, employment, financial status, and social support but not ethnic identity.
Conclusion: The study based on representative data shows that residents of segregated settlements are in worse mental health than those not living in colonies; that housing segregation is not limited to Roma people, and that housing conditions and financial status are major social determinants of mental health for which data must be collected to avoid using self-reported Roma identity as a proxy measure of socioeconomic deprivation.",,"The project was co-financed by the European Union under European Regional Development Fund (GINOP-2.3.2-15-2016-00005), as well as by the Hungarian Academy of Sciences (MTA11010 and TK2016-78).

Thus, our study aimed to assess the factors associated with not receiving the primary series and booster dose of the COVID-19 vaccine among Venezuelan migrants in Peru.
METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study based on secondary data analysis of the 2022 Venezuelan Population Residing in Peru Survey. Our population included Venezuelan migrants and refugees over 18 years old living in Peru with complete information for the variables of interest. Two outcome variables were assessed: not receiving the primary series and not receiving the booster dose of the COVID-19 vaccine. Crude and adjusted prevalences were calculated with 95% confidence intervals.
RESULTS: A total of 7,727 Venezuelan adults were included in our study, of whom 6,511 completed the primary series. The overall COVID-19 vaccination coverage of the primary series was 84.17%, whilst the coverage of the booster dose was 28.06%. Being younger, uninsured, illegally-staying, and having a low educational level were associated with both outcomes.
CONCLUSION: Several sociodemographic and migration-related variables were associated with both outcomes. Governmental policies prioritizing vaccination among Venezuelan migrants are needed to ensure broad coverage in this vulnerable group.",Declaration of competing interest The authors declare no conflict of interest.

This systematic review evaluates the association between SIII values with overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) in testicular cancer. We searched observational studies in five databases. The quantitative synthesis was performed using a random-effects model. The risk of bias was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS). The only measure of the effect was the hazard ratio (HR). A sensitivity analysis was performed according to the risk of bias in the studies. There were 833 participants in a total of 6 cohorts. We found that high SIII values were associated with worse OS (HR = 3.28; 95% CI 1.3-8.9; p < 0.001; I2 = 78) and PFS (HR = 3.9; 95% CI 2.53-6.02; p < 0.001; I2 = 0). No indication of small study effects was found in the association between SIII values and OS (p = 0.5301). High SIII values were associated with worse OS and PFS.

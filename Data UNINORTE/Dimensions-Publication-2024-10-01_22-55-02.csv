653,pub.1128880295,10.1038/s41586-020-2421-7,32612222,,A remnant planetary core in the hot-Neptune desert,"The interiors of giant planets remain poorly understood. Even for the planets in the Solar System, difficulties in observation lead to large uncertainties in the properties of planetary cores. Exoplanets that have undergone rare evolutionary processes provide a route to understanding planetary interiors. Planets found in and near the typically barren hot-Neptune ‘desert’1,2 (a region in mass–radius space that contains few planets) have proved to be particularly valuable in this regard. These planets include HD149026b3, which is thought to have an unusually massive core, and recent discoveries such as LTT9779b4 and NGTS-4b5, on which photoevaporation has removed a substantial part of their outer atmospheres. Here we report observations of the planet TOI-849b, which has a radius smaller than Neptune’s but an anomalously large mass of 39.1−2.6+2.7$$39.1{\,}_{-2.6}^{+2.7}$$ Earth masses and a density of 5.2−0.8+0.7$$5.2{\,}_{-0.8}^{+0.7}$$ grams per cubic centimetre, similar to Earth’s. Interior-structure models suggest that any gaseous envelope of pure hydrogen and helium consists of no more than 3.9−0.9+0.8$${3.9}_{-0.9}^{+0.8}$$ per cent of the total planetary mass. The planet could have been a gas giant before undergoing extreme mass loss via thermal self-disruption or giant planet collisions, or it could have avoided substantial gas accretion, perhaps through gap opening or late formation6. Although photoevaporation rates cannot account for the mass loss required to reduce a Jupiter-like gas giant, they can remove a small (a few Earth masses) hydrogen and helium envelope on timescales of several billion years, implying that any remaining atmosphere on TOI-849b is likely to be enriched by water or other volatiles from the planetary interior. We conclude that TOI-849b is the remnant core of a giant planet.","This paper includes data collected by the TESS missions, which are publicly available from MAST.

160,pub.1131002078,10.1038/s41550-020-1142-z,,,An ultrahot Neptune in the Neptune desert,"About 1 out of 200 Sun-like stars has a planet with an orbital period shorter than one day: an ultrashort-period planet1,2. All of the previously known ultrashort-period planets are either hot Jupiters, with sizes above 10 Earth radii (R⊕), or apparently rocky planets smaller than 2 R⊕. Such lack of planets of intermediate size (the ‘hot Neptune desert’) has been interpreted as the inability of low-mass planets to retain any hydrogen/helium (H/He) envelope in the face of strong stellar irradiation. Here we report the discovery of an ultrashort-period planet with a radius of 4.6 R⊕ and a mass of 29 M⊕, firmly in the hot Neptune desert. Data from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite3 revealed transits of the bright Sun-like star LTT 9779 every 0.79 days. The planet’s mean density is similar to that of Neptune, and according to thermal evolution models, it has a H/He-rich envelope constituting 9.0−2.9+2.7$${}_{-2.9}^{+2.7}$$% of the total mass. With an equilibrium temperature around 2,000 K, it is unclear how this ‘ultrahot Neptune’ managed to retain such an envelope. Follow-up observations of the planet’s atmosphere to better understand its origin and physical nature will be facilitated by the star’s brightness (Vmag = 9.8).","Funding for the TESS mission is provided by NASA’s Science Mission directorate.

202,pub.1128090997,10.1038/s41550-020-1113-4,,,A plague of magnetic spots among the hot stars of globular clusters,"For more than six decades, the quest to understand the formation of hot (about 20,000−30,000 K) extreme horizontal branch (EHB) stars in Galactic globular clusters has remained one of the most elusive in stellar evolutionary theory. Here we report on two discoveries that challenge the idea of the stable luminosity of EHB stars. The first mode of EHB variability is periodic and cannot be ascribed to either binary evolution or pulsation. Instead, we attribute it here to the presence of magnetic spots: superficial chemical inhomogeneities whose projected rotation induces the variability. The second mode of EHB variability is aperiodic and manifests itself on timescales of years. In two cases, six-year-long light curves display superflare events that are several million times more energetic than solar analogues. We advocate a scenario in which the two EHB variability phenomena are different manifestations of diffuse, dynamo-generated, weak magnetic fields. Magnetism is therefore a key player driving the formation and evolution of EHB clusters stars and, likewise, operating in the Galactic field counterparts. Our conclusions bridge similar variability/magnetism phenomena in all radiative-enveloped hot-stars: young main-sequence stars, old EHBs and defunct white dwarfs.","We acknowledge discussions with S.

203,pub.1133485689,10.1038/s41550-020-01267-y,,,A new class of fossil fragments from the hierarchical assembly of the Galactic bulge,"The formation and evolutionary processes of galaxy bulges are still unclear, and the presence of young stars in the bulge of the Milky Way is largely debated. We recently demonstrated that Terzan 5, in the Galactic bulge, is a complex stellar system hosting stars with very different ages and a striking chemical similarity to the field population. This indicates that its progenitor was probably one of the giant structures that are thought to generate bulges through coalescence. Here we show that another globular cluster-like system in the bulge (Liller 1) hosts two distinct stellar populations with remarkably different ages: only 1–3 Gyr for the youngest, and 12 Gyr for the oldest, which is impressively similar to the old component of Terzan 5. This discovery classifies Liller 1 and Terzan 5 as sites of recent star formation in the Galactic bulge and provides clear observational proof that the hierarchical assembly of primordial massive structures contributed to the formation of the Milky Way spheroid.","This research is part of the project COSMIC-LAB at the Physics and Astronomy Department of the University of Bologna (http://www.cosmic-lab.eu/Cosmic-Lab/Home.html).

Unfortunately, there is a high percentage of misdiagnosis.ObjectiveTo design an algorithm to be used by primary care physicians to improve the diagnostic approach of the patient with joint pain, and thus improve the diagnostic capacity in four rheumatic diseases.MethodsBased on the information obtained from a literature review, we identified the main symptoms, signs, and paraclinical tests related to the diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis, spondyloarthritis with peripheral involvement, systemic lupus erythematosus with joint involvement, and osteoarthritis. We conducted 3 consultations with a group of expert rheumatologists, using the Delphi technique, to design a diagnostic algorithm that has as a starting point “joint pain” as a common symptom for the four diseases.ResultsThirty-nine rheumatologists from 18 countries of Ibero-America participated in the Delphi exercise. In the first consultation, we presented 94 items to the experts (35 symptoms, 31 signs, and 28 paraclinical tests) candidates to be part of the algorithm; 74 items (25 symptoms, 27 signs, and 22 paraclinical tests) were chosen. In the second consultation, the decision nodes of the algorithm were chosen, and in the third, its final structure was defined. The Delphi exercise lasted 8 months; 100% of the experts participated in the three consultations.ConclusionWe present an algorithm designed through an international consensus of experts, in which Delphi methodology was used, to support primary care physicians in the clinical approach to patients with joint pain.Key Points• We developed an algorithm with the participation of rheumatologists from 18 countries of Ibero-America, which gives a global vision of the clinical context of the patient with joint pain.• We integrated four rheumatic diseases into one tool with one common symptom: joint pain. It is a novel tool, as it is the first algorithm that will support the primary care physician in the consideration of four different rheumatic diseases.• It will improve the correct diagnosis and reduce the number of paraclinical tests requested by primary care physicians, in the management of patients with joint pain. This point was verified in a recently published study in the journal Rheumatology International (reference number 31).",,,Clinical Rheumatology,,,Algorithms; Arthralgia; Humans; Rheumatic Diseases; Rheumatologists; Rheumatology,2020-08-25,2020,2020-08-25,2021-04,40,4,1581-1591,Closed,Article,"Fernández-Ávila, Daniel G.; Rojas, María Ximena; Mora, Sergio A.; Varela Rojas, Paola; Vanegas-García, Lucía; Sapag-Durán, Ana María; Hormaza, Andrés Alberto; Fernández, Andres Ricardo; Cachafeiro-Vilar, Antonio; Meléndez, Belia Lucía; Caballero-Uribe, Carlo V.; Toro-Gutiérrez, Carlos Enrique; Palleiro-Rivero, Daniel Rubén; Jaimes-Fernández, Diego Alejandro; Arrieta, Dina Maria; Álvarez, Fausto; Pinto-Patarroyo, Gineth Paola; Quiceno, Guillermo Andrés; Pons-Estel, Guillermo; Gómez Puerta, Jose A.; Báez, Jossiell Then; Bello-Gualtero, Juan Manuel; Gutiérrez, Juan Martín; Segura, Juan Sebastian; Ferreyra, Leandro Gabriel; Stange, Lilith; Saldarriaga, Lina Maria; Ugarte-Gil, Manuel Francisco; Cardiel, Mario H.; Moreno, Mario Javier; Quintero, Maritza; Porras, Marlon B.; Colman, Nelly; Chávez, Nilmo Noel; Ruiz, Oscar Orlando; Méndez-Patarroyo, Paul; Machado-Xavier, Ricardo; Caicedo, Tomás; Ocampo, Vanessa; Bautista-Molano, Wilson Armando; Medina, Yimy F.; Fuentes-Silva, Yurilis Josefina; Soriano, Enrique R.","Fernández-Ávila, Daniel G.

Seabirds have the most extensive documented history of interactions with plastics, through ingestion, entanglement, and nest construction.   In the present study, eight seabird species from the South Pacific Ocean were used as a proxy to determine potential patterns of removal of marine plastic debris, and three hypotheses were tested in relation to their feeding habits and nesting areas.   Plastics from abiotic compartments (Chilean continental coast, South Pacific Gyre, and Rapa Nui beaches) and biotic compartments (surface‐feeding seabirds, diving seabirds, and nesting areas) were compared, according to their type, colour, shape, and density.   Continental beaches had a relatively wide range of colours and shapes, with many non‐buoyant plastics. Samples from the South Pacific Gyre (SPG) and Rapa Nui (Easter Island) beaches comprised mainly hard, rounded, buoyant, and white/grey plastics.   These results indicate that the composition of floating plastics from terrestrial sources changes during transport with oceanic currents, reducing the proportion of prey‐like plastics present in the subtropical gyres.   The stomach contents of surface‐feeding and diving seabirds were dominated by hard, white/grey, and round plastic items, similar to plastics from the SPG, suggesting non‐selective (accidental or secondary) ingestion.   Nesting areas had a more variable composition of brightly coloured plastics, suggesting a pattern of selective removal of plastics by seabirds, probably from oceanic sources.   The present study reveals extensive interactions of seabirds with plastics on a broader scale, which is highly relevant given that the impacts of plastics on seabirds are increasing worldwide, compromising their efficient conservation.","We wish to thank all participants of the citizen science programme Científicos de la Basura of Universidad Católica del Norte (Chile) for collecting the small plastic debris for the present study. We also thank Camila Gallardo Peña and Katharina Herzog for their valuable help during specific density analyses, and André‐Philippe Drapeau Picard, Angelika Graiff, and Yumiko Osawa for their help during colour characterization analyses.

150,pub.1126642258,10.1038/s43017-020-0040-3,,,Climate impacts of the El Niño–Southern Oscillation on South America,"The climate of South America (SA) has long held an intimate connection with El Niño, historically describing anomalously warm sea-surface temperatures off the coastline of Peru. Indeed, throughout SA, precipitation and temperature exhibit a substantial, yet regionally diverse, relationship with the El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO). For example, El Niño is typically accompanied by drought in the Amazon and north-eastern SA, but flooding in the tropical west coast and south-eastern SA, with marked socio-economic effects. In this Review, we synthesize the understanding of ENSO teleconnections to SA. Recent efforts have sought improved understanding of ocean–atmosphere processes that govern the impact, inter-event and decadal variability, and responses to anthropogenic warming. ENSO’s impacts have been found to vary markedly, affected not only by ENSO diversity, but also by modes of variability within and outside of the Pacific. However, while the understanding of ENSO–SA relationships has improved, with implications for prediction and projection, uncertainty remains in regards to the robustness of the impacts, inter-basin climate interactions and interplay with greenhouse warming. A coordinated international effort is, therefore, needed to close the observational, theoretical and modelling gaps currently limiting progress, with specific efforts in extending palaeoclimate proxies further back in time, reducing systematic model errors and improving simulations of ENSO diversity and teleconnections.","This work is supported by the National Key R&amp;D Program of China (2018YFA0605700).

This study analyzes of the marine fish fossil based on comprehensive species records belonging to the Neogene period and listed at the generic level. Joint classification and ordination techniques were used to identify and analyze data comprising 169 genera belonging to 56 families and 20 orders, which were mostly represented by the demersal species that inhabit shallow waters. Analyses of principal components were used to calculate the covariance and the variance between formations, countries, basins, and age. The results showed that the main faunistic changes along the geochronological sequence in the Neogene basins of tropical America were a consequence of paleoenvironmental changes.","This research could not have been conducted without the help of a large number of scientist, technicians and students under the scope of the Panama paleontology project and the complimentary Venezuelan and Brazilian paleontology projects, but we especially thank A.

Characterized by their long snout and small melon, these extant taxa are clustered into two clades, Iniidae in South America and Platanistidae in Southern Asia. Their evolutionary history leading to freshwater environments remains mostly unknown, because many of their related fossil species have been found in marine environments. Here, we report riverine dolphin remains (two rostral fragments and a periotic) from two stratigraphic levels of the late middle Miocene (ca. 12.5 Ma) from La Venta, Colombia. The periotic has a reduced cochlear aqueduct mediodorsally oriented, the anterior process is relatively thin, and the dorsal opening of the facial canal is located lateral to the spiral cribriform tract. The rostral fragments are dorsoventrally flattened; the mandible features two longitudinal ventral grooves, and the premaxilla-maxilla suture of the rostrum is located in a deep lateral groove. These characteristics indicate that the specimens belong to Platanistidae, the lineage of the Ganges river dolphin Platanista. Platanistids had also been recorded on coeval strata from the Fitzcarrald arch, Peru. The occurrence of middle Miocene platanistids in both the La Venta and Fiztcarrald localities suggests that members of this lineage moved into freshwater environments in South America earlier than the ancestors of the modern Amazon river dolphin Inia. The subsequent collapse of the Pebas ecosystem could have played a role in the extinction of non-marine Platanistoidea in South America.","This research was sponsored by the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute, the Anders Foundation, 1923 Fund and Gregory D. and Jennifer Walston Johnson.

1186,pub.1122861496,10.1016/j.jhydrol.2019.124396,,,The potential impact of climate variability on siltation of Andean reservoirs,"Recent changes in global climate, and especially changes in precipitation patterns, may negatively impact on siltation of Andean storage reservoirs, thereby putting at risk the provision of resources to the local population. The extent to which this may happen is poorly understood. We therefore studied the catchment of the Cañete River in the western Peruvian Coastal Range as it plays an important role in the socioeconomic development of the region. It houses the 220 MW El Platanal hydroelectric plant and the Capillucas reservoir that provide the surrounding areas with water and energy. We used a hydrological model (HEC-HMS) coupled with a sediment transport model (HEC-RAS) to simulate future changes in river discharge and sediment load. This information was then used to calculate the siltation of the Capillucas storage reservoir. Ten scenarios were developed, a combination of two different precipitation patterns and five different precipitation rates. The precipitation patterns differed in the distribution of the precipitation change during the rainfall season, and the precipitation rates differed in the extent of change in precipitation amounts. The average sediment load of the Cañete River was estimated at 981 kTon/yr upstream of the Capillucas reservoir and showed that the calculated life span of the Capillucas reservoir is about 17 years. The most pessimistic scenario suggested a reduction in the life span of the reservoir to 7 years and the most optimistic scenario to 31 years. Even under the most optimistic scenario, the life span of the reservoir is shorter than its officially expected functionality of 50 years. As such, our results demonstrated the vulnerability of Andean hydroelectric reservoirs against future climate change.","This study was supported by the Proyecto Glaciares+, implemented by CARE Peru and the University of Zurich (Switzerland) and funded by the Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation (SDC), and by the ARES POP project on “Erosion and sediment yield in response to climate change and variability” funded by the Coopération au développement de l’Académie de Recherche et d’Enseignement supérieur (Belgium).

Notwithstanding, the term remains underexplored and the majority of research does not address whether the Global North/Global South dichotomy is a useful theoretical framework for urban studies. This article provides a more detailed analysis of the term Global South in urban research and presents benefits and pitfalls of applying a Southern perspective. Using the research field ‘cities as transnational climate change actors’ as an example, I highlight both advantages and problems of categorising urban areas as ‘cities of the Global South’. Structural differences between Northern and Southern cities regarding climate change action do exist, and theory building on cities as transnational actors is well advised to consider those differences in order to avoid a Global North bias. However, the categories Global North/Global South are only one possibility to analyse cities as transnational climate change actors and – depending on the research question – should be accompanied by analytical attention to additional factors such as geographical location, city size or political regimes.",,,Third World Quarterly,,,,2020-07-21,2020,2020-07-21,2021-09-02,42,9,2055-2073,Closed,Article,"Koch, Florian","Koch, Florian (Hochschule für Technik und Wirtschaft (HTW), Berlin, Germany; Escuela de Arquitectura, Urbanismo y Diseño, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia)","Koch, Florian (HTW Berlin - University of Applied Sciences; Universidad del Norte)","Koch, Florian (HTW Berlin - University of Applied Sciences; Universidad del Norte)",18,11,,7.43,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1129534870,44 Human Society; 4406 Human Geography; 4407 Policy and Administration,11 Sustainable Cities and Communities; 13 Climate Action

This paper uses the “Ocean grabbing framework” to assess the process preceding the announcement of a LSMPA in Rapa Nui, its rejection, the reformulation of the process and the ultimately successful establishment of a Multiple Uses Marine Protected Area (MUMPA). The assessment focused on: a) the quality of governance, b) the effects on livelihoods and human security, and 3) the potentially interlinked social and ecological impacts. The rejection of the initial LSMPA process was associated with lack of transparency, inadequate participatory processes, and lack of accountable decisionmaking all of which could have had adverse social and ecological outcomes and turned the LSMPA into an “ocean grab”. Factors that contributed were associated to inappropriate use of financing, political lobbying and pressure exerted by a NGO that tried to deploy its agenda disconnected from local indigenous interests. In a major turning point stemming from the vigorous local rejection of the initial LSMPA, a bottomup process led by a local institution (CODEIPA) and other Rapanui organizations, coordinated with the Chilean Government, resulted in an unprecedented participatory process ending in the creation of the largest MPA in the Americas, that will be comanaged by Rapanui people and the Chilean Government. It is hoped that the results of this analysis can contribute to the development of good practices in marine conservation worldwide, maximizing marine conservation outcomes and avoiding undesirable social and ecological impacts.","This work was funded by ESMOI, of the Millennium Science Initiative; Ministry of Economy, Development and Tourism (Chile).

JAA also thanks support from Conicyt-PAI/Concurso Nacional Inserción en la Academia, Convocatoria 2017–79170078. The authors are grateful for the comments and suggestions of the two anonymous reviewers.","Rapanui people frequently mention lack of economic support as one of the main causes for not allocating the necessary time for meeting, discussing and planning in marine conservation (Aburto et al., 2017). The need to finance costs involved in supporting marine conservation processes (Jones et al., 2011; Nursey-Bray, 2011), and particularly in Rapa Nui, was a key lesson learned from the process for creating the MMHMP (Gaymer et al., 2013). In the present study, however, one of the actions perceived as jeopardizing wider community participation was the financial support by the BINGO to only part of the process and to only some organizations within the Working Group aligned with the BINGO conservation agenda. The use of MoUs made this intent clear and may actually have triggered mistrust and reduced the perceived independence of the local contracting parties. Thus, the funding, far from supporting the costs of transparent community decision-making processes, provided an incentive for divisiveness as a few lobbied for a goal rather than worked to achieve consensus. Similar perceptions have arisen in other indigenous community contexts such as in Papua New Guinea (Balboa, 2013). We conclude that financial support from BINGOs could help, but the purpose and ways of distributing these resources is a key aspect (Bennett et al., 2017). Perhaps financing or supporting the construction of local social capital to create legitimate governance institutions or processes should be the highest priority. But to create legitimate governance processes these would (almost by definition) have to be free of external agendas (including those of the funding BINGO) to achieve precisely the required representativeness and legitimacy, and this requires trust that the ultimate outcomes will best satisfy the objectives of all key parties.",Ocean & Coastal Management,,,,2020-12,2020,,2020-12,198,,105327,Closed,Article,"Aburto, Jaime A.; Gaymer, Carlos F.; Govan, Hugh","Aburto, Jaime A.

Results showed that most paleolimnological studies have been carried out in high-latitude regions. About 40% of the lakes on Earth, representing almost one-third of global lake surface area, lie within tropical latitudes. Yet in comparison to the number of paleolimnological investigations in higher-latitude lakes, there have been relatively few studies in the tropics. Our goal was to evaluate whether there has been a shift in the relative amount of effort directed toward paleolimnological work in tropical regions over the last quarter century, and if not, to call for more paleolimnological studies in the tropics and suggest ways to remedy the geographic disparity. Our analysis showed that paleolimnological studies in the tropics still lag far behind efforts at higher latitudes, prompting us to encourage more work focusing in tropical regions. To do so will require more funding from local research agencies to support paleolimnological work and train local scientists. We recommend that funded investigators from extra-tropical, developed countries should work in close collaboration with local scientists in the nations where studies are carried out, and that local students should be involved. Steps should also be taken to encourage students from tropical countries to attend international scientific meetings that focus on paleolimnology. Lastly, more such symposia should be held in tropical countries. Paleolimnological research at low latitudes can address pressing environmental issues in tropical environments, such as the effects of rapid land-use change, the eutrophication and pollution of local water bodies, and recent climate change.","JE and YS worked equally on the manuscript.

The aim of this systematic review was to compare the response to albuterol delivered through nebulization (NEB) with albuterol delivered through MDI+S in pediatric patients with asthma exacerbations.
METHODS: We conducted an electronic search in MEDLINE/PubMed, EMBASE, Ovid, and ClinicalTrials. To be included in the review, a study had to a randomized clinical trial comparing albuterol delivered via NEB versus MDI+S; and had to report the rate of hospital admission (primary outcome), or any of the following secondary outcomes: oxygen arterial saturation, heart rate (HR), respiratory rate (RR), the pulmonary index score (PIS), adverse effects, and need for additional treatment.
RESULTS: Fifteen studies (n = 2057) met inclusion criteria. No significant differences were found between the two albuterol delivery methods in terms of hospital admission (relative risk, 0.89; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.55-1.46; I2  = 32%; p = .65). There was a significant reduction in the PIS score (mean difference [MD], -0.63; 95% CI, -0.91 to -0.35; I2  = 0%; p < .00001), and a significantly smaller increase in HR (better; MD -6.47; 95% CI, -11.69 to -1.25; I2  = 0%; p = .02) when albuterol was delivered through MDI+S than when it was delivered through NEB.
CONCLUSIONS: This review, an update of a previously-published meta-analysis, showed a significant reduction in the PIS and a significantly smaller increase in HR when albuterol was delivered through MDI+S than when it was delivered through NEB.",ACKNOWLEDGMENTS The authors would like to thank Mr. Charlie Barret for his editorial assistance.

Almost four years after the peace accords signed between the national government and the FARC guerrilla, post‐conflict geographies are best characterised by the ongoing dispossession of local populations related to the entrenchment of extractivism. Drawing from ethnographic work carried out in the Colombian Caribbean on the ordinary practices and spaces of social reproduction, the ordinary geographies , this article explores gendered practices of care and their role in both sustaining and disrupting paramilitary violence and agrarian extractivism. The focus not just on the gendered effects of war and extractivism, but on gender’s constitutive role in the configuration of these processes and dynamics, allows us to contribute to recent literature on extractivism, dispossession and violence from a feminist standpoint. 
Resumen  La guerra y el extractivismo están profundamente entretejidos en los espacios agrarios en Colombia. Casi cuatro años después de la firma de los acuerdos de paz entre el gobierno nacional y la guerrilla de las FARC, las geografías del post‐conflicto están caracterizadas por el despojo sostenido de poblaciones locales tras el afianzamiento y la expansión del extractivismo. A partir de trabajo etnográfico llevado a cabo en el Caribe colombiano sobre las prácticas y los espacios cotidianos de la reproducción social, que definimos como geografías ordinarias , este artículo explora las prácticas de cuidado atravesadas por género y su papel en el mantenimiento y la irrupción de la violencia paramilitar y el extractivismo agrario. El enfoque, no solo en los efectos generizados de la guerra y el extractivismo, sino también en el papel constitutivo del género en la configuración de estos procesos y dinámicas, nos permite contribuir a la literatura reciente sobre el extractivismo, el despojo y la violencia desde un punto de vista feminista.","We want to thank the women and children who have shared their time, spaces, experiences, stories and theoretical insights with us during all these years.

169,pub.1131430335,10.1002/aqc.3469,,,A country's response to tackling plastic pollution in aquatic ecosystems: The Chilean way,"Abstract    Marine plastic pollution is worse than expected, and we are starting to realize its full extent and severity. Solving the plastic pollution problem is not easy, as it requires the action and commitment of all sectors of our society. With a coastline extending over 4,000 km (from 18°S to 56°S), Chile is a maritime country, and since plastics are potentially harmful for marine and coastal ecosystems, food security, and public health, plastic pollution is a real threat.   Chile is the sixth‐largest exporter of seafood (fish, invertebrates, and algae) in the world, but the extent of plastic contamination of marine organisms, its potential effects on commercial species and aquaculture, and its subsequent effects on human health are mostly unknown.   Chile has recently introduced some legislation to prevent plastics from reaching the environment and the coastal ocean. Governmental and non‐governmental organizations have joined an informal alliance to take action against plastic pollution, both at a national and regional level, but stronger involvement of producers and commerce is required for effective measures.   Chilean scientists working on plastic pollution have created the Scientific Plastic Pollution Alliance of Chile network, aiming to promote collaborative and coordinated research focused on this pollutant. The wide geographical extent of Chile, with researchers working in diverse ecosystems, provides a unique opportunity to better understand the consequences of one of the most recent and severe threats to biodiversity.   Rather than solely presenting the plastic pollution problem from the scientific perspective, this paper includes views from different sectors of society. Mitigating plastic pollution is exceptionally complex, with this study highlighting the importance of local engagement, media, solving social inequities, new legislation, and law enforcement in order to advance on decreasing plastic pollution from a country‐wide perspective.",We thank two anonymous reviewers and the editor for their constructive suggestions on an earlier version of this paper.,,Aquatic Conservation Marine and Freshwater Ecosystems,,,,2020-10-04,2020,2020-10-04,2021-02,31,2,420-440,Closed,Article,"Urbina, M.A.; Luna‐Jorquera, G.; Thiel, M.; Acuña‐Ruz, T.; Cristi, M.A. Amenábar; Andrade, C.; Ahrendt, C.; Castillo, C.; Chevallier, A.; Cornejo‐D'Ottone, M.; Correa‐Araneda, F.; Duarte, C.; Fernández, C.; Galbán‐Malagón, C.; Godoy, C.; González‐Aravena, M.; Hinojosa, I.A.; Jorquera, A.; Kiessling, T.; Lardies, M.A.; Lenzi, J.; Mattar, C.; Munizaga, M.; Olguín‐Campillay, N.; Perez‐Venegas, D.J.; Portflitt‐Toro, M.; Pozo, K.; Pulgar, J.; Vargas, E.","Urbina, M.A. (Departamento de Zoología, Facultad de Ciencias Naturales y Oceanográficas, Universidad de Concepción, Concepción, Chile; Instituto Milenio de Oceanografía, Universidad de Concepción, Concepción, Chile); Luna‐Jorquera, G.

Super-scale climatic anomalies resulted in strong vertical water column stratification that stimulated development of a dynamic P. verruculosa thin layer (up to 38 μg chl a L-1) for several weeks in Reloncaví Sound. Hydrodynamic modeling (MIKE 3D) indicated that the Sound had extremely low flushing rates (between 121 and 200 days) in summer 2016. Reported algal cell densities of 7000-20,000 cells mL-1 generated respiratory distress in fish that was unlikely due to low dissolved oxygen (permanently >4 mg L-1). Histological examination of salmon showed that gills were the most affected organ with significant tissue damage and circulatory disorders. It is possible that some of this damage was due to a diatom bloom that preceded the Pseudochattonella event, thereby rendering the fish more susceptible to Pseudochattonella. No correlation between magnitude of fish mortality and algal cell abundance nor fish age was evident. Algal cultures revealed rapid growth rates and high cell densities (up to 600,000 cells mL-1), as well as highly complex life cycle stages that can be easily overlooked in monitoring programs. In cell-based bioassays, Chilean P. verruculosa was only toxic to the RTgill-W1 cell line following exposures to high cell densities of lysed cells (>100,000 cells mL-1). Fatty acid profiles of a cultured strain showed elevated concentrations of potentially ichthyotoxic, long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) (69.7% ± 1.8%)- stearidonic (SDA, 18:4ω3-28.9%), and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, 22:6ω3-22.3%), suggesting that lipid peroxidation may help to explain the mortalities, though superoxide production by Pseudochattonella was low (< 0.21 ± 0.19 pmol O2- cell-1 h-1). It therefore remains unknown what the mechanisms of salmon mortality were during the Pseudochattonella bloom. Multiple mitigation strategies were used by salmon farmers during the event, with only delayed seeding of juvenile fish into the cages and towing of cages to sanctuary sites being effective. Airlift pumping, used effectively against other fish-killing HABs in the US and Canada was not effective, perhaps because it brought subsurface layers of Pseudochattonella to the surface, or and it also may have lysed the fragile cells, rendering them more lethal. The present study highlights knowledge gaps and inefficiency of contingency plans by the fish farming industry to overcome future fish-killing algal blooms under future climate change scenarios. The use of new technologies based on molecular methods for species detection, good farm practices by fish farms, and possible mitigation strategies are discussed.",The authors thank colleagues from the CREAN group for laboratory and field work.

In particular, marine species inhabiting upwelling ecosystems are experiencing low seawater temperatures, as well as, acidic and low oxygen conditions as a consequence of the nature of the deep upwelled waters. Our study is focused on one of the most important socio-economical resources of the Humboldt Current System (HCS): the scallop Argopecten purpuratus which has been historically subjected to intensive aquaculture in areas influenced by upwelling processes. Here, a long-term field experiment was performed to understand how tolerant and well-locally-adapted is A. purpuratus to upwelling conditions by studying a set of fitness, physiological, and biomineralogical traits. Stronger upwelling generated a minor water column stratification, with lower temperatures, pH, and oxygen conditions. On the contrary, as upwelling weakened, temperature, pH, and oxygen availability increased. Finally, upwelling intensity also determined the number, duration, and intensity of the cooling and de-oxygenation events occurring in A. purpuratus habitat, as well as, the food availability (chlorophyll-a concentration, Chl-a). Physiologically, A. purpuratus was able to cope with stressful environmental conditions imposed by higher upwelling intensities by enhancing its metabolic and calcification rates, as well, producing higher concentrations of the shell organic matter. These physiological changes impacted the total energy budget, which was highly dependent on Chl-a concentration, and revealed important traits trade-offs with significant fitness costs (higher mortalities emerged when longer and more intense upwelling events succeed). Our study increases the knowledge about the physiological performance and tolerance of this important resource to the ocean acidification and ocean-deoxygenation imposed by variable upwelling intensities, as well as, its potential vulnerability under future changing conditions driven by a potential upwelling intensification.","Declaration of competing interest The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interests.

123,pub.1130638265,10.1016/j.jsames.2020.102837,,,Hazardous faults of South America; compilation and overview,"The heterogeneous South American geology has coined a wide variety of neotectonic settings where crustal seismogenic sources do occur. This fact has led to different approaches for mapping and inventory neotectonic structures. The South American Risk Assessment project promoted the discussion and update under uniform standards of the available information on neotectonic deformation, for its application in regional Probabilistic Seismic Hazard Assessments. As a result, 1533 hazardous faults have been inventoried onshore South America, 497 of them qualifying to feed the engine model driving probabilistic maps. Main hazardous structures are concentrated throughout the eastern boundary of the Northern Andean Sliver and along the foreland-facing Andean Thrust Front. Space geodesy and seismicity illuminate the seismogenic significance of these deformation belts, although few neotectonic surveys have been conducted to date in the latter region. The characteristics of the main structures or deformation zones are here outlined according to their filiation to neotectonic domains, which are dependant on the geologic, seismotectonic, or morphotectonic settings in Andean and extra-Andean regions. The knowledge accrued on the hazardous faults in South America here compiled, reinforces the fact that some of these structures constitute significant hazard sources for many urban areas and critical facilities and should be incorporated in seismic hazard assessments. However, the available fault data are insufficient in many cases or carry significant epistemic uncertainties for fault source characterization. This contribution aims to summarize the present knowledge on the South American hazardous faults as well as the main challenges for successful fault data incorporation into seismic hazard models.","Digital neotectonic data of national repositories have been kindly made available for this compilation by SEGEMAR, Argentina, OSC, Bolivia, SGC, Colombia, IG-EPN, Ecuador, INGEMMET, Perú, and FUNVISIS, Venezuela and constituted the departure base for this effort.

Here, we examined a representative pond of the wetland landscape for dynamics of greenhouse gases, and their association with other relevant biogeochemical conditions including diel shifts of microbial communities' structure and activity over two consecutive days. Satellite image analysis indicates that the area of ponds cover 238 of 381.3 Ha (i.e., 62.4%), representing a significant landscape in this wetland. Solar radiation, wind velocity and temperature varied daily and between the days sampled, influencing the biogeochemical dynamics in the pond, shifting the pond reservoir of inorganic versus dissolved organic nitrogen/phosphorus bioavailability, between day 1 and day 2. Day 2 was characterized by high dissolved organic nitrogen/phosphorus and N2O accumulation. CH4 presented a positive excess showing maxima at hours of high radiation during both days. The microbial community in the sediment was diverse and enriched in keystone active groups potentially related with GHG recycling including bacteria and archaea, such as Cyanobacteria, Verrucomicrobia, Rhodobacterales and Nanoarchaeaota (Woesearchaeia). Archaea account for the microbial community composition changes between both days and for the secondary productivity in the water measured during day 2. The results indicate that an intense recycling of organic matter occurs in the pond systems and that the activity of the microbial community is correlated with the availability of nutrients. Together, the above results indicate a net sink of CO2 and N2O, which has also been reported for other natural and artificial ponds. Overall, our two-day fluctuation study in a representative pond of a high-altitude wetland aquatic landscape indicates the need to explore in more detail the short-term besides the long-term biogeochemical variability in arid ecosystems of the Andes plateau, where wetlands are hotspots of life currently under high anthropogenic pressure.","We are grateful to María Jesús Gálvez and Angel Rain for their technical support, to all the participants of the field trip and particularly to Pedro and Margarita Luca for their hospitality at Salar de Huasco shelter facilities.

238,pub.1130872792,10.1002/aqc.3464,,,"Progress, opportunities and challenges for marine conservation in the Pacific Islands","Abstract    The people of the Pacific have long relied on the ocean for sustenance, commerce and cultural identity, which resulted in a sophisticated understanding of the marine environment and its conservation.   The global declines in ocean health require new and innovative approaches to conserving marine ecosystems. Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) have been shown to be a highly effective means of conserving biodiversity and managing fisheries, while also restoring and preserving overall ecosystem function.   Traditional ecological knowledge held by many island peoples in the Pacific is critical to the development, design and implementation of contemporary MPAs.   Chile's offshore islands are among the few oceanic archipelagos along the west coast of South America. These islands have cultural and ecological connections to the broader insular Pacific, yet our scientific understanding of them is extremely limited.   Chile has created several large‐scale MPAs around their offshore archipelagos. By protecting these unique ecosystems, Chile has established itself as a global leader in marine conservation.   Effective management and a better understanding of social–ecological interactions are currently the biggest challenges facing MPAs in the Pacific Islands.","We would like to thank our colleagues for their great efforts in advancing knowledge for conservation of the Pacific Islands. We are also grateful to local communities that have enthusiastically shared their traditional knowledge and become involved in research that helps them to better understand their marine ecosystems.

Recent paleoclimate studies suggest that past variability of the SASM has been more heterogenous in space and time than previously thought, implying that different atmospheric drivers controlled its long-term evolution. Unfortunately, past SASM reconstructions are largely limited to the last 2000 years and mainly focused on the core of the monsoon domain where precipitation does not fall exclusively during the monsoon season, thereby limiting our understanding of its long-term changes, drivers and mechanisms. Here we present a new 4000-year SASM precipitation reconstruction based on a high-resolution pollen sequence from a mountain lake in the dry Andes of northern Chile (21°S). We provide evidence for two centennial-scale intervals of enhanced SASM precipitation between 4000–3400 and 2300-1900 cal yr BP. These intervals are replicated in records from the southern portion of the central Andes (>18°S) but not clearly detected further north, suggesting the existence of a monsoon dynamics largely decoupled from latitudinal shifts of the Intertropical Convergence Zone. A comparison with precipitation reconstructions from the entire SASM domain and modern climate datasets suggests a teleconnection with the Southern Hemisphere circulation through the intensification of the South Atlantic Convergence Zone and/or the intrusion of extra-tropical Atlantic moisture. Our results highlight that significant spatial and temporal variability of the SASM occurred during the most recent millennia, and therefore social and environmental forecast should consider that similar variations will likely occur in the future.","We thank Claudia Alcaíno for her support during the Loss on Ignition data acquisition at CEAZA, Jeremy Acevedo Cortés for field assistance and two anonymous reviewers whose comments helped to improve this manuscript.

It was associated with severe and fatal hemorrhagic fever, being similar in clinical features to Machupo (MACV). In mid-2019, CHAPV was the cause of a cluster of five cases, two of them laboratory confirmed, three of them fatal. Here, we report the main clinical findings, epidemiological features and the potential ecological aspects, of that cluster of cases in rural La Paz, Bolivia.
METHODS: For this observational, retrospective and cross-sectional study, information was obtained from the Hospitals and the Ministry of Health for the cases that were laboratory-diagnosed and related, during 2019. RT-PCR was used for the detection of the RNA of CHAPV in the blood samples.
RESULTS: Two cases were RT-PCR + for CHAPV. The median age of patients was 42 y-old (IQR 25-45), four out of five were male. All patients were hospitalized, admitted to the ICU and had fever, upper digestive hemorrhage, with two of them, presenting ARDS, and requiring mechanical ventilation. Three patients died (case fatality rate, CFR 60%).
CONCLUSIONS: Mammarenaviruses led to a high fatality rate. These cases occurred in areas with suitable ecoepidemiological conditions for rodent-borne diseases, including CHAPV infection. Socioenvironmental and occupational factors in rural areas of Bolivia may contribute with the risk of zoonotic spillover and transmission to humans.",To the Epidemiology Department of the Ministry of Health of Bolivia and the Caja Nacional de Salud for providing additional data of the patients and their laboratory results.,"Universidad Franz Tamayo, Cochabamba, Bolivia.

Nevertheless, research is scarce on the effects of natural resource booms on local governments and even more on public investment. Using a difference-in-differences strategy, this paper contributes to identifying the causal effects of the recent oil boom in Colombia (2008–2016) on subnational public investment. Our results suggest that the rise in international oil prices had mostly positive and disproportionate effects on public investment in oil producing departments and municipalities. Although municipalities and departments prioritized different sectors, both increased their investments in sectors with high social returns suggesting a lower likelihood of a resource curse. We also found that an institutional reform in 2012 was a source of heterogeneity and the main driver of the causal effects on subnational public investments.","The authors are grateful to two anonymous referees, María Claudia Llanes, Cristina Fernández, María Inés Agudelo, Carlos Medina, Cecilia Suescún, Sharmistha Bagchi-Sen, Brian Bonet, Andrés Escobar and participants at the 25th EAERE Annual Conference (Berlin, Germany – virtual), VIII Jornadas Iberoamericanas de Financiamiento Local (Mexico City, México), Seminario Interno de la Gerencia Técnica del Banco de la República (Bucaramanga, Colombia), the IEEC Seminary at Universidad del Norte (Barranquilla, Colombia), the 66th Annual Meeting of the North American Regional Science Association (NARSC) (Portlnad, USA), and 2nd Colombian Economics Conference (Bogotá, Colombia) for their valuable comments and suggestions to previous versions of this document.

For cephalopods, the main differences between semelparous and iteroparous are based on ovulation pattern and spawning type. The different reproductive strategies in coleoid cephalopods could be related to the habitat in which the species dwell (coastal vs. oceanic) and/or to environmental forces, thus, both aspects should be quantitatively evaluated under an evolutionary perspective to reconstruct: (a) the ancestral ovulation type of coleoid cephalopods, and (b) the potential of correlated evolution between ovulation type versus habitat and environment. Ancestral states of ovulation type were estimated using stochastic mapping based on literature data (i.e. synchronous or asynchronous), and this information was combined with a new molecular phylogeny including 165 species. The evolutionary correlation between ovulation type, habitat, and environment was estimated by means of the Markov model comparing the rates of gain and loss. The estimates of ancestral states of ovulation type for coleoid cephalopods resulted in a high probability that Octopodiformes evolved from synchronous ovulation type, and Decapodiformes from asynchronous ovulation type. The three traits evaluated presented phylogenetic signal, although no correlation was found between habitat and ovulation type. Overall, species in stable environments showed a tendency towards synchronous ovulation type, while the asynchronous ovulation pattern was found more frequently in species that live in unstable environments, being this last trait also responsible for triggering the change of ovulation type in some species throughout evolution.","Declaration of Competing Interest None.

1186,pub.1125159033,10.1016/j.tra.2020.02.019,,,Confronting congestion in urban areas: Developing Sustainable Mobility Plans for public and private organizations in Bogotá,"Work trips contribute the most to congestion during peak hours in urban areas. For that reason, public and private organizations can play a relevant part by developing mobility plans (MPs) to propose possible strategies to confronting congestion. Although MP strategies such as the promotion of active and public transport modes, the implementation of parking policies, telecommuting, and flexible work schedules have gained popularity for addressing traffic congestion in recent years, there has been a lack of studies reporting on the potential impact of their implementation in organizations located in Global South cities. This paper evaluates the modal choice by drivers (cars and motorcycles) in response to a series of specific mobility strategies if MPs are implemented by mid-size and large public and private organizations in the city of Bogotá (Colombia). The modal share of employee trips after implementing different travel demand management instruments was evaluated using a stated preference survey. The results of this study suggest that substantial increases of parking charges in the organization’s vicinity are likely to lead to the highest reduction of private cars use and the highest modal share increase for public transport, carpooling, bicycling, and walking. The provision of company bus services seems not to be as the most effective strategy to discourage employees from using a car. Then, these plans should contain a combination of strategies rather than consider them separately to increase the possibility of achieving better results.

The contribution of this paper is twofold. First, we construct a BI that addresses particularities of the roads in cities of the Global South and considers the preferences, perceptions and socioeconomic characteristics by type of cyclist. Second, a tool is developed for decision-makers to prioritise investments in bicycle infrastructure, considering the estimated BI and expected cyclist flows. The methodology is structured into two stages. The first stage constructs a new BI following three steps. First, we select the most important factors and components related to biking behaviour. Second, we estimate weights for selected factors and components by using a discrete choice model to analyse users’ perceptions based on results from ranking surveys. Third, we estimate the BI by type of cyclist as a weighted additive function, which are equivalent to the probabilities calculated using the discrete choice model. The second stage proposes a direct demand model to prioritise bicycle infrastructure investments based on the estimation of BIs, and expected flows of cyclists. We applied the methodology to Barranquilla, Colombia and ranked different bicycle infrastructure investments for increasing bicycle demand in the city. The results suggest that even though primary roads are currently associated with low BI values due to high rates of road accidents, they tend to be preferred by cyclists. The presence of adequate bicycle infrastructure is the most crucial factor for people who frequently cycle for sport, while traffic safety and security are the most critical factors for those who cycle to work.",,,Transportation Research Part A Policy and Practice,,,,2020-09,2020,,2020-09,139,,310-334,Closed,Article,"Arellana, Julián; Saltarín, María; Larrañaga, Ana Margarita; González, Virginia I.; Henao, César Augusto","Arellana, Julián (Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); Saltarín, María (Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); Larrañaga, Ana Margarita (Industrial and Transportation Engineering Department, Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul, Porto Alegre, Brazil); González, Virginia I.

For example, many cities lack adequate infrastructure or experience environmental conditions that do not favor cycling. We examine the potential demand for using the bicycle as a transport alternative in trips to college in Barranquilla, Colombia, a city with fairly aggressive environmental conditions for cycling. We designed a Stated Choice experiment geared to students and staff living within three kilometers of two college campuses in the city and traveling by bus or bike. We also considered people’s perceptions in an effort to understand the reasons why only 2% of Barranquilla’s daily trips are made by bicycle. Our mode choice analysis incorporated two latent variables (unsafety/insecurity and convenience), in addition to typical level-of-service attributes, such as travel time and cost. We found that the perception of unsafety/insecurity has an important negative effect on the probability of using bicycle; the possibility of suffering an accident or being mugged, weighs much more than the possible economic savings and improvements in health associated with using the bicycle. In terms of convenience, our results suggest that it could be just as important to have showers on campus as bike lanes available on the route. Also, investment in facilities such as free parking for bikes, and strategies such as planting trees in bike paths and sidewalks to provide shade, could significantly encourage cycling.",,,International Journal of Sustainable Transportation,,,,2020-04-04,2020,2020-04-04,2021-02-01,15,4,259-272,Closed,Article,"Gutiérrez, Margareth; Cantillo, Víctor; Arellana, Julián; de Dios Ortúzar, Juan","Gutiérrez, Margareth (Department of Transport Engineering and Logistics, Centre for Sustainable Urban Development (CEDEUS), Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile, Santiago, Chile, ;); Cantillo, Víctor (Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia, ;); Arellana, Julián (Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia, ;); de Dios Ortúzar, Juan (Department of Transport Engineering and Logistics, Instituto Sistemas Complejos de Ingeniería (ISCI), BRT + Centre of Excellence, Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile, Santiago, Chile)","Gutiérrez, Margareth (Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile)","Gutiérrez, Margareth (Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile); Cantillo, Víctor (Universidad del Norte); Arellana, Julián (Universidad del Norte); de Dios Ortúzar, Juan (Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile)",25,6,,8.06,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1126147399,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3509 Transportation, Logistics and Supply Chains; 44 Human Society; 4406 Human Geography",11 Sustainable Cities and Communities

In response, many reporters engage in self-censorship, eschewing stories to protect their livelihoods—and their very lives. Our in-depth interviews with sixteen journalists in the post-conflict era, some of whom have had to leave the country because of such threats, disclose the severity of the problem in deeply textured ways. The results show that dependency on sources and advertising, severe judicial and online harassment, and powerful editorial pressures prevent journalists from reporting freely. The generalized fear, the distribution of official advertising and political publicity, the media’s property, and local journalists’ vulnerability are the key factors that trigger self-censorship. Nevertheless, these journalists also have counterstrategies to circumvent the problem and further democracy, such as sharing scoops with colleagues when covering sensitive issues, finding international funding, or creating new online media.",,,Journalism Practice,,,,2020-06-12,2020,2020-06-12,2021-11-26,15,10,1423-1440,Closed,Article,"Barrios, Marta Milena; Miller, Toby","Barrios, Marta Milena (School of Communication, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia; The authors thank the research partnership of Andrea Cancino and the assistance of Lyz Vega who provided valuable support and advice in the research process and the production of this paper.); Miller, Toby (School of Communication, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia; School of Humanities and Social Sciences, Universidad Autónoma Metropolitana, Cuajimalpa, México; Sir Walter Murdoch Distinguished Visitor, Murdoch University, Murdoch, Australia; Graduate Division, University of California, Riverside, CA, USA)","Barrios, Marta Milena (Universidad del Norte; The authors thank the research partnership of Andrea Cancino and the assistance of Lyz Vega who provided valuable support and advice in the research process and the production of this paper.)","Barrios, Marta Milena (Universidad del Norte; The authors thank the research partnership of Andrea Cancino and the assistance of Lyz Vega who provided valuable support and advice in the research process and the production of this paper.); Miller, Toby (Universidad del Norte; Universidad Autónoma Metropolitana; Murdoch University; University of California, Riverside)",28,16,,21.41,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1128455091,"36 Creative Arts and Writing; 3605 Screen and Digital Media; 47 Language, Communication and Culture; 4701 Communication and Media Studies","16 Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions"

These integrated analyses allow examination of temporal and spatial variations of the soil moisture response between locations dominated by sulfate soils and those with immature, silicate-mineral soils. The radar dataset captures at least four separate rain events within the 2015–2017 timeframe, two of which were regionally devastating. The lack of vegetation in this region allows us to discriminate between contributions to the InSAR coherence from permanent changes of the landscape (e.g., erosion or deposition) and transient changes associated with soil moisture variability. The spatial distribution and character of the transient InSAR response depends strongly on soil type, and is remarkably repeatable between rain events. The areas that experienced permanent changes included river channels, steep slopes, playas, and sites of anthropogenic activity, such as roads, mines, or telescope construction. Ground-based observations of soil moisture after each event also exhibit a strong dependence on soil type. The observations presented here demonstrate how InSAR data can constrain variations in soil moisture with high spatial resolution over large regions, complementing the higher-sensitivity but sparser field sites and enabling discrimination of inter-event variability and analysis of longer-term changes in soil mineralogy in arid regions.","Chile&#x27;s CONICYT (Comisión Nacional de Investigación Científica y Tecnológica, Chile) provided partial support through Proyecto Anillo ACT1203 (Exploration and Assessment of New Groundwater Resources in the Central Depression of Antofagasta Region).

One of those processes is moral disengagement, which was originally postulated by Bandura. To test this relationship, the present research focused on studying these mechanisms in members of Colombian illegal armed groups. Total sample size was 18 (14 males and four females) demobilized members of the Self-Defense Forces of Colombia (Autodefensas Unidas de Colombia [AUC]) and guerrilla organizations (Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia [FARC], National Liberation Army [ELN], among others), which had participated directly or indirectly in violent actions against people and groups, which included murders, tortures, and massacres. Qualitative methodology was used, specifically in-depth interviews and content analysis. This analysis led to the verification in the narratives of the participants of the use of all the mechanisms of moral disengagement described by Bandura aiming to justify their behavior within the armed group. The most noteworthy mechanisms were those that minimized participation (especially, attributing behavior to obeying orders: displacement of responsibility) and moral justification, especially, the context of confrontation. Moral disengagement processes are found in armed group members (such as insurgency, terrorist organizations, or militias). These mechanisms cancel ordinary psychological reactions of rejection, fear, and moral controls that oppose the carrying out of cruelty and extreme violence.",,"FundingThe author(s) received no financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.",Journal of Interpersonal Violence,,,Aggression; Colombia; Female; Humans; Male; Morals; Terrorism; Violence,2020-03-31,2020,2020-03-31,2022-01,37,1-2,423-448,Closed,Article,"Blanco, Amalio; Davies-Rubio, Amanda; De la Corte, Luis; Mirón, Lourdes","Blanco, Amalio (Universidad Autónoma de Madrid, Spain); Davies-Rubio, Amanda (Universidad Autónoma de Madrid, Spain); De la Corte, Luis (Universidad Autónoma de Madrid, Spain); Mirón, Lourdes (Universidade de Santiago de Compostela, Spain)","Davies-Rubio, Amanda (Autonomous University of Madrid)","Blanco, Amalio (Autonomous University of Madrid); Davies-Rubio, Amanda (Autonomous University of Madrid); De la Corte, Luis (Autonomous University of Madrid); Mirón, Lourdes (University of Santiago de Compostela)",20,10,1.94,5.9,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1126024775,52 Psychology; 5203 Clinical and Health Psychology,"16 Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions"

Dating to the Early Formative period, Vaquerías pottery is the earliest polychrome ceramic in the Argentine Northwest. Questions about its provenance, use and circulation persist, however. To address these, the authors employ, for the first time, an integrated methodology comprising petrographic, morphological, iconographic and contextual analyses of ceramic samples from three regions of north-western Argentina. The results suggest five distinct modes of manufacture of Vaquerías ceramics, the non-centralisation of their production, their wide geographic distribution and their use in a variety of functional contexts. The methodology is applicable elsewhere and illustrates the potential of this approach over traditional stylistic-morphological studies.",The authors would like to thank J.M.

However, adults of cyclophyllideans have never been found in bony fishes, even though hundreds of thousands of these hosts have been examined for parasites globally over more than 250 years. In the present paper, we report on a unique example of host switching of a tapeworm from birds to teleost fish in Africa. A new genus, Ichthyolepis (Cyclophyllidea: Dilepididae), is erected to accommodate Ichthyolepis africana n. sp., which is the first cyclophyllidean tapeworm that sexually matures in teleost fishes. The new species parasitises several freshwater elephantfishes (Mormyriformes: Mormyridae) including Marcusenius macrolepidotus (type host) in South Africa, Marcusenius senegalensis in Senegal, Mormyrus caschive, M. niloticus and Pollimyrus isodori in the Sudan, and Mormyrus kannume in Egypt. Ichthyolepis n. gen. is typified by a large musculo-glandular apical apparatus with rostellar pouch and a rostellum armed with robust hooks similar in size, but different in shape, deep, sandglass-shaped genital atrium, vaginal atrium and cirrus armed with tiny spines, thick-walled, subspherical cirrus sac, large, lobulated ovary occupying a large part of the median pre-equatorial field of mature proglottids, numerous testes filling almost entirely the postequatorial median field of proglottids, long and narrow, sleeve-like lateral uterine diverticula, and spindle-shaped eggs. Molecular phylogenetics considers Ichthyolepis as a member of the lineage consisting of dilepidids from swifts (Apodidae) in Africa. All fish hosts of the new tapeworm are bottom feeders, live in muddy biotopes and are insectivorous, which indicates that its intermediate hosts may be insect larvae.","The authors express their gratitude to Božena Koubková who kindly provided her specimens from Senegal and to Millicent Kekana who provided some mormyrid specimens from the Letaba River, South Africa, for this study.

Exposure to children may lead to serious health effects due to their increased vulnerability and longer time spend inside the classrooms, making it important to assess the factors that affect air quality in preschools. Thus, this work aims to evaluate indoor-outdoor (I/O) relationships of NPs in the 10-420 nm range, BC and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) at rural and urban preschools (aged 3-5 years) between May 2016 and July 2017. Factorial analysis was applied to identify the possible emission sources. Prior communalities were estimated by the squared multiple correlations with all other variables. We used the varimax rotation method and the criterion for factor selection was the number of eigenvalues greater than one. Results indicate that BC and NP were 4- and 3.2-times higher in urban outdoor caused by traffic emissions, respectively. Highest concentrations occurred during rush hours and during the pickup time of children. In urban school, BC was directly related to accumulation mode (N49-205), while in the rural area, BC was related to local traffic and particles from pulp industries in the regional background. Nucleation mode (N11-36) was related to traffic emissions in urban school, while in the rural school was related with secondary formation of particles. Mean I/O ratios of BC and NP in the urban (0.54; 0.51) and rural (0.71; 0.91) schools, respectively, suggested that their higher concentrations occurred in outdoors. VOCs were higher indoor in urban (I/O = 1.97) and rural (I/O = 2.22) sites, indicating these pollutants are generated inside, regardless of urban or rural sites. These findings suggest the necessity of improving ventilation and commuting styles to lower the exposure of children to air pollutants in and around school environments.","We thank CNPq and CAPES for their financial support; to the FEPAM PROAR team; and to the studied preschools of this study for making available their space so that we could carry out the samplings during class schedules.

Carbon dioxide is the primary contributor to climate change, and is mainly formed by the energy sector; thus, it is imperative to expand the total decarbonisation of this industry. Another global concern is the high demand and low supply of critical metals due to the constant growth of technological advances. These elements are essential for the manufacturing of advanced technology, green technology, and emerging industries. Currently, there is global tension and unrest over how the critical metals market is developing, with one example regarding China, which has an apparent monopoly on the mining, refining, and technical expertise associated with rare earth elements. China currently provides approximately 90% of the production of rare earth elements, causing conflicts with the European Union, the USA, and Japan due to their dependence on these raw materials. Another controversial case is the production of cobalt in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, which dominates in the global production (60% of the world’s production of Co). Despite this, the Democratic Republic of the Congo is one of the poorest countries in the world. The constant depletion of high-grade minerals from the Earth's surface forces the search for new alternative sources of the critical metals. The abundance of minerals within the sea is of relevance, with large deposits of marine nodules, ferromanganese crusts, and massive polymetallic sulphides. These are of great interest to the mining industry, as it is estimated that the largest reserves of various critical metals are found on the seabed, in addition to the largest reserves of cobalt, nickel, and manganese, and a considerable amount of rare earth elements. The exploitation of mineral resources from the seabed by the company Deep Sea Mining Finance Limited (DSMF) is currently being developed, which might promote the expansion of this market throughout the world. The wealth of minerals in the seabed may be a solution to the shortage of critical metals in the market, may decrease political tensions between countries worldwide, and may promote the large-scale deployment of renewable energy.",Ricardo I.

163,pub.1128950630,10.1016/j.jvolgeores.2020.106984,,,Combining ash analyses with remote sensing to identify juvenile magma involvement and fragmentation mechanisms during the 2018/19 small eruption of Peteroa volcano (Southern Andes),"The Planchón Peteroa Volcanic Complex (PPVC) is located on the border of Chile and Argentina, and is one of the most active volcanic systems in the Andes. Holocene activity has included magma-water interaction with an evolving series of crater lakes, mainly sourced from Peteroa volcano. This study examines data from the 2018/19 eruption, together with the volcanic history of the PPVC, to elucidate the complex interplay between magmatic activity and summit water and ice. From February 2016 to mid-2019, three seismic swarms occurred in the PPVC, preceding the explosive eruption from September 2018 to April 2019. The activity originated from a small vent nested within the easternmost crater, the most active portion of the complex (Peteroa). The explosions interacted with a crater lake, producing ash plumes up to 2 km above the crater and building a small tephra cone. To investigate the eruption mechanisms, we performed remote sensing analysis of plume dispersal, thermal anomalies and ground deformation, and characterized the volcanic products, including grain size, componentry, morphology, internal textures, composition and mineralogy. Our results suggest that the precursory seismicity beginning in 2016 was related to the intrusion of a new magma batch that reached the surface during the 2018/19 eruption. The eruption was also preceded by thermal anomalies, geomorphic changes and increased hydrothermal activity at the surface, though without any ground deformation recognized through radar interferometry (InSAR). The eruption initially produced predominantly recycled ash (phreatic activity), then evolved to increasing proportions of juvenile magma (phreatomagmatic) by April 2019. The juvenile clasts had a trachyandesite composition (~59 wt% SiO2), with vesicular and dense scoria containing plagioclase and pyroxene. The ash surfaces show external quenching cracks and step fractures consistent with phreatomagmatic fragmentation within the active crater lake. Textural characteristics also point to a slowly ascending batch of magma that was relatively viscous by the time it interacted with water in the crater lake. Notably, these juvenile particles are distinctive from the pre-2018 products. Ash erupted from 2010/11 did not contain recognizable juvenile material, and is inferred to have been a mainly phreatic eruption. Our findings suggest that the interplay between phreatic and phreatomagmatic eruptions fed by small magma batches intruding at shallow levels characterize much of the eruptive behavior of the PPVC during the last three decades. Multi-parametric assessment is a powerful tool to discriminate between phreatic and phreatomagmatic eruptions.","We are especially grateful with Esteban Berríos for his help to collect some of the samples here studied and for the full photographic shooting of the eruptive cycle.

1682,pub.1126763504,10.1130/g47235.1,,,Isotope sclerochronology indicates enhanced seasonal precipitation in northern South America (Colombia) during the Mid-Miocene Climatic Optimum,"Abstract During the Mid-Miocene Climatic Optimum (MMCO, 14.7–17.3 Ma), global temperatures were warmer than present, and similar to predicted temperatures for the coming century. Limited paleoclimate data exist from the tropics during this period, despite its potential as an analog for future climate conditions. This study presents new subannual stable isotope data (δ18O and δ13C) from a large population of Miocene Turritella gastropods from the Jimol and Castilletes Formations of the Guajira Peninsula, Colombia. Turritellids are aragonitic marine mollusks that live in shallow coastal waters, and their rapid growth rates allow for high-resolution subannual records. We compare these fossils to modern Turritella gastropods from multiple tropical localities to reconstruct subannual climate conditions. The seasonal range in δ18O in the modern shells correlates with the seasonal variance of local precipitation, once temperature seasonality is accounted for. The Miocene fossils show larger (in some cases >2‰) seasonal variation in δ18O than modern Turritella from the same location, suggesting increased seasonality of precipitation in Miocene northern Colombia relative to today. We propose that this increased seasonality of precipitation was due to a more northerly position of the Intertropical Convergence Zone during the mid-Miocene. The resulting wet Miocene paleoenvironment is in stark contrast to semiarid conditions on the Guajira Peninsula today, indicating that this area of tropical South America has undergone a drastic environmental change since the Miocene.",,,Geology,,,,2020-04-17,2020,2020-04-17,2020-07-01,48,7,668-672,Closed,Article,"Scholz, Serena R.; Petersen, Sierra V.; Escobar, Jaime; Jaramillo, Carlos; Hendy, Austin J.W.; Allmon, Warren D.; Curtis, Jason H.; Anderson, Brendan M.; Hoyos, Natalia; Restrepo, Juan C.; Perez, Nicolas","Scholz, Serena R.

Background and objectives The routine practice of perioperative care of cardiac surgery patients is still non-standardised and widely variable, due to the different interpretations of the evidence. This consensus study aims to minimise clinical variability by establishing rational, graded, arguments through discussion and evaluation of evidence. Methods This study used three different techniques to accomplish formal consensus on the recommendations: Delphi, nominal groups, and consensus conference methodology. Questions for Delphi approach were prioritised. Eleven nominal groups developed recommendations for each thematic unit. Consensus conference methodology included national experts and one international expert to discuss initial results. The product of the consensus conference was evaluated in three rounds by 100 experts in cardiac surgery practice. Results A total of 100 experts participated in the final rounds. These included 54% critical care medicine specialists, 18% cardiac surgeons, and 18% cardiovascular anaesthesiologists, with the remaining 10% being cardiologists. The mean practical experience of the experts was 11.6years. A large majority (84%) were university lecturers, and 70% were published researchers. The product of the consensus process included 36 declarations on the most relevant issues of perioperative care for cardiac surgery patients that resulted in 30 recommendations (80%+ agreement), 5 discretionary recommendations (75-80% agreement), and one declaration of non-consensus (66% agreement). Some of the initially excluded issues were included as good clinical practice suggestions. Conclusions A large number of experienced practitioners established a formal consensus on the best practice for perioperative care for cardiac surgery patients. The findings from this consensus study will address a gap for establishing consensus on standardised quality care for patients before and after cardiac surgery for use across national and local tertiary health care settings.",,,Acta Colombiana de Cuidado Intensivo,,,,2020-04,2020,,2020-04,20,2,118-157,Closed,Article,"Mendoza, José Luis Accini; L, Luis Horacio Atehortua; Estrada, Victor Hugo Nieto; M, Carlos Eduardo Rebolledo; Pérez, Julio Cesar Duran; Senior, Juan Manuel; Leiva, Edgar Hernández; Valencia, Albert Alexander; Serna, José Fernando Escobar; Castell, Carmelo Dueñas; Ramos, Rafael Cotes; Beltrán, Nelly; Palacio, Rafael Thomen; García, David Andrés López; Gómez, Camilo Pizarro; Pérez, María Cristina Florián; Franco, Sergio; García, Hans; Rincón, Francisco Mauricio; Novoa, Carlos Alberto Danetra; Delgado, Juan Francisco","Mendoza, José Luis Accini (Internista, Intensivista.

In order to compare the performance profile of the naming capacity and episodic memory in patients with AD and bvFTD the present study was designed.
METHODS: Cross-sectional and analytical study with control group (32 people). The study included 42 people with probable AD and 22 with probable bvFTD, all over 60 years old. Uniform Data Set instruments validated in Spanish were used: Multilingual Naming Test (MINT), Craft-21 history and Benson's complex figure, among others.
RESULTS: A higher average age was observed among the patients with AD. The naming capacity was much lower in patients with bvFTD compared to patients with AD, measured according to the MINT and the nouns/verbs naming coefficient. All patients with bvFTD, 73.81% of those with AD and only 31.25% of the control group failed to recognise Benson's complex figure. All differences were statistically significant (p <0.001).
RESULTS: This study confirms the amnesic profile of patients with AD and reveals the decrease in naming capacity in patients with bvFTD, an area of language that is typically affected early on with executive functions, according to recent findings.
CONCLUSIONS: Patients with AD perform worse in verbal and visual episodic memory tasks, while patients with bvFTD perform worse in naming tasks. These findings open the possibility of exploring the mechanisms of prefrontal participation in episodic memory, typically attributed to the hippocampus.",,,Revista Colombiana de Psiquiatría (English ed ),,,,2020-11-08,2020,2020-11-08,2022-01,51,1,8-16,Closed,Article,"Custodio, Nilton; Montesinos, Rosa; Cruzado, Lizardo; Alva-Díaz, Carlos; Failoc-Rojas, Virgilio E; Celis, Violeta; Cuenca-Alfaro, José; Lira, David","Custodio, Nilton (Servicio de Neurología, Instituto Peruano de Neurociencias, Lima, Perú; Unidad de Diagnóstico de Deterioro Cognitivo y Prevención de Demencia, Instituto Peruano de Neurociencias, Lima, Perú; Unidad de Investigación, Instituto Peruano de Neurociencias, Lima, Perú.

However, the consumption of mussels by the shell-crushing crab Acanthocyclus hassleri creates within the mussel beds space and habitat for several other species. This crab uses its disproportionately large claw to crush its shelled prey and plays an important role in maintaining species biodiversity. This study evaluated the consequences of projected near-future ocean acidification (OA) and warming (OW) on traits of A. hassleri linked with their predatory performance. Individual A. hassleri were maintained for 10-16 weeks under contrasting pCO2 (~500 and 1400 μatm) and temperature (~15 and 20 °C) levels. We compared traits at the organismal (oxygen consumption rate, survival, calcification rate, feeding rates, crusher claw pinching strength, self-righting speed, sarcomere length of the crusher claw muscles) and cellular (nutritional status ATP provisioning capacity through citrate synthase activity, expression of HSP70) level. Survival, calcification rate and sarcomere length were not affected by OA and OW. However, OW increased significantly feeding and oxygen consumption. Pinching strength was reduced by OA; meanwhile self-righting was increased by OA and OW. At 20 °C, carbohydrate content was reduced significantly by OA. Regardless of temperature, a significant reduction in energy reserves in terms of protein content by OA was found. The ATP provisioning capacity was significantly affected by the interaction between temperature and pCO2 and was highest at 15 °C and present day pCO2 levels. The HSP70 levels of crabs exposed to OW were higher than in the control crabs. We conclude that OA and OW might affect the amount and size of prey consumed by this crab. Therefore, by reducing the crab feeding performance these stressors might pose limits on their role in generating microhabitat for other rocky intertidal species inhabiting within mussel beds.","This study was financially supported by the Fondo Nacional de Desarrollo Científico y Tecnológico, FONDECYT grant No 1181609 to PHM and CD.

212,pub.1128194030,10.1016/j.jsames.2020.102672,,,Upper crustal differentiation processes and their role in 238U-230Th disequilibria at the San Pedro-Linzor volcanic chain (Central Andes),"U-series data are combined with major and trace element constraints to construct a detailed view of the magmatic system feeding the San Pedro-Linzor volcanic chain, aiding the understanding of how stratovolcanoes in extremely thick arc crust evolve. Lavas from the Quaternary San Pedro-Linzor volcanic chain (Central Andes) have (238U/230Th) ranging from 1.015 to 1.072, with 238U excess even in the less evolved (~57 wt% SiO2) analyzed lavas. Contrary to well-established trends between fluid mobile elements and 238U excess, (238U/230Th)0 shows no systematic correlation with ratios indicative of fluid-driven melting (e.g. Ba/Hf and K/La). Moreover, the inverse correlation between (238U/232Th) with the amount of slab-derived fluid and the oxidation state of the mantle below Central Andes, which decreases eastwards, suggests that the main control of the 238U excess is not associated with hydration of the mantle wedge. Changes in (238U/232Th) and (230Th/232Th)0 are observed with variations in SiO2 and CaO + Al2O3 contents, and 87Sr/86Sr and Dy/Dy* ratios of the lavas. These changes correspond to increasing (238U/232Th) with decreasing Dy/Dy* and CaO + Al2O3 ratios, which is attributed to changes in crystallization of mineralogical phases within magmatic chambers during differentiation. Also, 230Th in-growth is produced during stagnation within magmatic chambers located below the San Pedro-Linzor volcanic chain. Finally, a positive correlation between (230Th/232Th)0 and 87Sr/86Sr indicates an important role of crustal contamination, and of new mafic inputs during evolution of the volcanic chain with time. Our observations suggest that better constraints of all magmatic processes are needed to fully understand the U-series disequilibria recognized for the different volcanic structures developed within subduction-related tectonic environments.","This work was funded by the Comisión Nacional de Investigación Científica y Tecnológica [FONDECYT PostDoctorado Nº 3160432 to B.G; CONICYT-PCHA/Doctorado Nacional/2015–21150403 to O.G.-M.], and Centro de Excelencia en Geotermia de los Andes- Universidad de Chile [FONDAP-CONICYT 15090013].

Thus, conservation has become a global challenge. In Chile, the dissociation between economic activities and conservation has triggered numerous socio-environmental conflicts in recent decades. This work explores how different projects that give rise to these conflicts can represent an underestimated threat to biodiversity. We identified socio-environmental conflicts in Chile and their associated projects by carrying out an online review of 1035 news articles published between 2004 and 2018 using the key words “environmental conflict”. We selected articles describing a socio-environmental conflict between parties caused by a project or productive sector. Conflict-generating projects were classified by productive sector and capital origin. In addition, their geographical distribution with respect to High Conservation Value Areas (HCVAs, protected areas and priority sites for conservation) was determined. A total of 283 projects were identified from 14 different productive sectors, most of them related to energy and mining, which threaten biodiversity and human well-being mainly due to pollution and habitat destruction. Chilean companies finance most of the projects, but international companies finance over half of the energy and mining projects. Moreover, 37 % of the projects were located within HCVAs either for the establishment of future protected areas or where protected areas are currently established. As countries make new efforts to maintain and recover biodiversity, it is contradictory not to consider the threats posed by conflict-generating projects to key areas for conservation, both in public policies and in spatial planning instruments.","This manuscript was prepared within the course of Socioecology and Conservation Biology of the PhD program in Applied Biology and Ecology (cooperative program between the Universidad Católica del Norte and the Universidad de La Serena).

1570,pub.1128939479,10.1002/tesj.535,,,Discriminatory job advertisements for English language teachers in Colombia: An analysis of recruitment biases,"Abstract  Numerous studies have explored the persistence of discrimination against nonnative‐English‐speaking teachers (NNESTs) of English as a foreign or second language in various contexts. However, the author of this article could find no study that explores the prevalence of “native‐speakerism” and other forms of discrimination in English language teacher recruitment in South America. The current study thus investigated the extent to which online postings for English language teachers in Colombia expressed a preference for native‐English‐speaking teachers (NESTs) and how this discrimination intersects with other inequitable hiring practices. The author conducted content analysis on job ads found on two prominent Facebook groups for English language teachers in Colombia. The findings reveal evidence of discrimination in nearly half of the 95 job ads analysed. These ads discriminate based on age, gender, nationality, variety of English, the location where a prospective teacher gained their qualifications, and “nativeness.” The study tentatively concludes that this discrimination has several dimensions, with those further from the colonial “centre” facing greater degrees of discrimination. The mutually reinforcing constructs of coloniality and native‐speakerism help account for the persistence of such discrimination, which is also reflected in the Colombian governments’ linguistic policies.","Many thanks to the anonymous reviewers for their helpful comments on this article.

Recent research has shown that perceptions have a higher power to explain the quality of service (QoS) than objective measures have; the latter being typically used in the pedestrian level of service methodologies. Despite the existing research on perceptions and QoS in other transportation fields, very little information has been found in the literature that can explain a clear cognitive structure that defines the pedestrian QoS. In this research, we propose a cognitive map to make it possible to understand and explain pedestrian sidewalk QoS of a given infrastructure when walking, based on perceptions. We gathered the perceptions of 1056 pedestrians on-site, regarding the attributes (indicators) identified in the literature review in 30 locations in Bogotá, Colombia. Based on an Exploratory Factor Analysis, we developed a conceptual model through Structural Equation Modeling. We found that seven latent variables (LVs) (i.e., Sidewalk characteristics, Externalities, Surrounding, Discomfort, Bike hassles, Protection, and Amenities) interrelate to each other, forming a pedestrian cognitive map. QoS is directly explained by how pedestrians perceive the LVs sidewalk characteristics and surrounding and indirectly by the rest of LVs. The cognitive map shows three LVs related to the interaction between pedestrians and other transportation modes (i.e., externalities, discomfort, and bike hassles) that impact the perceived QoS negatively, and four LVs related to the interaction between pedestrians and different elements of the sidewalk (i.e., sidewalk characteristics, surrounding, amenities, and protection) that impact the perceived QoS positively. To understand pedestrian perceptions when walking and the path that these perceptions follow to develop a QoS perception provides an accurate tool by which to improve the QoS from the useŕs perspective, generating a new opportunity to provide better pedestrian facilities.","The authors are grateful for the support received by MINCIENCIAS under forgivable loan 6172, as well as the School of Engineering and the Vice-presidency of Research and Creation at Universidad de Los Andes for financing the doctoral research of one of the authors of this paper.

Our objective was to analyze these changes in an open bamboo forest in Acre after forest fires occurred either in one of the extreme drought years (2005 or 2010) or in both years (2005 + 2010). We sampled 9.75 ha (in 2016 and 2017), distributed in 18 0.5 ha (100 m × 50 m) plots and three 0.25-ha (50 m × 50 m) plots. We identified a strong fire effect on the number of tree individuals per hectare, which declined by 50% if the forest was burned in only one year (2005 or 2010) and by 74% if burned in both years. This was inversely related to the expansion of bamboo stems, which increased in number by 7 to 9 times. Changes in forest structure and species composition after the fire were characterized by a high importance value for pioneer tree species; reductions in the number of trees with logging potential, in the basal area of trees, and in the number of lianas; and an increase in the density of bamboo stems. AGB in the burned forests was 51–73% that of the unburned forest. With the expansion of bamboo, its contribution to AGB increased from 1% in the unburned forest to 27% in the twice-burned forest. These forms of degradation represent serious threats to Amazon forests.","We thank Antonio Barreto (Tunico) for the botanical identification.

METHODS: Semi-structured interviews with 42 men and women aged 18-50 years (mean ± standard deviation, 29.1 ± 7.9) and living in or near Florence, Italy, were conducted between May and June 2019. Techniques from expanded grounded theory-guided data analysis allowed for a constant comparative approach to contextualise data and identify emergent themes.
RESULTS: Three themes emerged: (1) attitudes and barriers towards CVMs; (2) gender-specific purchasing influences and behaviours; and (3) CVM improvement and promotion. Women and men described varied concerns surrounding CVM purchasing, illuminating reasons for hesitancy. Focussing on CVM quality and improving product offerings were suggested by participants to increase use.
CONCLUSION: Findings offer practical recommendations to guide CVM messaging to increase access to and use of condoms and other personal care items. Men were cited as primary CVM users, expressing practical concerns surrounding CVMs, while, for women, CVM visibility was as much an advantage as a drawback. Reflecting consumer needs via diversified product offerings should be considered a priority for increased CVM use. Working to promote CVMs requires clear messaging that attends to gender norm limitations, details product safety and establishes CVMs as a reliable condom purchase outlet.","We would like to thank the students who participated in the summer 2019 Purdue University Investigating Women’s Reproductive and Sexual Health Issues in Florence, Italy, study abroad programme, for their support in data collection and transcription and overall collaboration on the project.

Machine learning strongly benefits from computing accelerators. However, such accelerators are not easily available at hospital premises, although they can be easily found on public cloud infrastructures or research centers. Nevertheless, the sensitivity of medical data poses several challenges on the access to such data, requiring security guarantees and isolation. In this paper we present an architecture that addresses this problem. It keeps critical data encrypted in memory and disk, which can only be accessed inside trusted execution environments protected by hardware extensions. Data is anonymized inside these environments and securely transferred to external sites that host accelerator devices, keeping the same network space and reducing security risks even in untrusted cloud backends. Results on the processing of data in different scenarios are presented and discussed. The results are demonstrated on a geographically-wide deployment provided by the ATMOSPHERE project.","The work in this paper is mainly developed in the context of the project ATMOSPHERE, funded jointly by the European Commission under the Cooperation Programme, Horizon 2020 grant agreement No 777154 and the Brazilian Ministério de Ciência, Tecnologia e Inovação (MCTI), number 51119.

Moreover, night surveys may contribute important information for biodiversity inventories or baselines that normally are not considered.   This study used standardized day–night visual surveys of fishes and mobile invertebrates on the same transect lines in Rapa Nui (Easter Island) and investigated how diel patterns vary between taxonomic and trophic groups.   Distinct differences between taxonomic groups were observed, with fishes being more abundant during the day (>twice), whilst invertebrate abundance and richness showed an opposite trend with higher numbers at night (>three times).   Analysis of trophic groups showed that herbivorous and planktivorous fishes were more abundant during the day. Carnivorous fishes did not show any trends. Top predators (Apex) were observed only at very low abundances. However, a replacement amongst carnivorous fish species between day and night was found, where labridae fishes were practically absent during nights.   Most of the mobile invertebrates remained concealed during the day, probably due to the influence of predation risk (labrid fishes). The results emphasize the need for consideration of nocturnally active invertebrates in biodiversity inventories or baselines of reefs, which focus heavily only on diurnal surveys.   Day–night reef surveys should be included in marine protected area planning and monitoring as this provides a better understanding of shallow benthic communities and helps inform proper management decisions.","Our thanks to Ricardo Hito, Enrique Hey, and Matias Atamu for coordinating our field trip at the Island, and also to ORCA Diving Centre for providing key supplies for the development of this study.

Fossil occurrences of the genus Sphyraena are described from the Neogene Castilletes fauna of Colombia and the Palmetto and Torreya faunas in the United States. Symphysial teeth are found to differ serially, thus allowing us to refine anatomical descriptions of common isolated fossil remains in the genus Sphyraena.

Footbridges or overpasses are pieces of infrastructure designed to allow pedestrians to cross safely. Although there is tension over whether footbridges are the most inclusive and sustainable way to support safe road crossing for vulnerable road users, footbridges are still a predominant piece of infrastructure in LMICs. Therefore, research aimed at optimising the use of footbridges could have an impact on the safety of vulnerable road users. The objective of the present study is to understand the motivational factors influencing pedestrian crossing decisions to use a footbridge in Malaysia. Additionally, the present study investigates the effectiveness of some proposed interventions to change the crossing behaviour of footbridge non-users. An intercept study was conducted in five major cities in Malaysia. Pedestrians answered questions regarding their perceptions about footbridges and previous walking experiences. The analysis was divided into two parts: Firstly, a decision tree analysis was conducted to study the relationship between the observed decision to use or not a footbridge and pedestrians’ perceptions about footbridges and experiences. Secondly, a decision tree analysis was used to identify the effectiveness of proposed countermeasures in increasing the footbridge usage among non-users. The findings showed that the footbridge height and the frequency of using it were associated with a decrease in the likelihood of utilising this structure. Being in a hurry was highly associated with crossing at the street level. In addition, footbridge non-users might change their behaviour if escalators or fences are provided as interventions. The results indicated that safety messages delivered through posters to alert footbridge non-users have the potential to sustain safe mobility.

PhotoVoice seems aphasia-friendly because it relies on personal photographs to convey opinions regarding prespecified topics. However, PhotoVoice is based on a procedure referred to as the SHOWeD method. Participants are asked to reflect upon their photos by discussing (1) what they See, (2) what is Happening, (3) the relation to Our life, (3) Why the issue or condition exists, and then to (4) explain what can be Done to address the issue(s) at hand. Due to the linguistic demand required to convey complex thoughts and ideas inherent in this methodology, adaptations are likely required to successfully implement with people who have aphasia.
AIMS: A scoping review was conducted to summarize the current literature regarding the use of PhotoVoice with people who have aphasia, to address two questions:(1) Are people with post-stroke aphasia included in PhotoVoice studies?(2) What, if any, modifications are required to address post-stroke aphasia and motor impairments?
MAIN CONTRIBUTION: This scoping review revealed that researchers often exclude people with aphasia from post-stroke PhotoVoice research. Three studies outlined adaptations that allowed successful implementation with people who have post-stroke aphasia.
CONCLUSIONS: Further inquiry regarding how best to adapt PhotoVoice for people with aphasia will facilitate their ability to be included in community-based research. This is an important step in ensuring that all post-stroke stakeholders are involved in projects related to social justice and policy for stroke survivors.","Substantial portions of this manuscript were submitted by the third author in partial fulfillment of the requirement for the Master of Arts in Communication Sciences and Disorders at the University of Cincinnati (under direction of the first author).

                  We present a full description and analysis of the complete mitochondrial genome of a Pacific Ocean specimen of the coconut crab Birgus latro (Linnaeus, 1767), the largest extant terrestrial arthropod in the world. Our de novo-assembled mitogenome has a massive 16,161 times organelle read coverage, a length of 16,411 bp, contains 22 tDNAs (20 unique), 13 protein-coding genes, two rDNAs, and a putative control region of length 1,381 bp. The control region contains three microsatellites and two pairs of inverted repeats. Contrary to the mitochondrial sentinel gene concept, two-dimensional nucleotide analysis reveals higher GC-content in cox gene families than in nadh gene families. Moreover, cox gene families are more conserved than nadh gene families among the species of Coenobitidae selected for comparison. Secondary structure prediction of the 22 tDNAs shows major deviations from the cloverleaf pattern, which points to a relatively high rate of mutation in these genes. We also present a repertoire of mitochondrial variation between our male Okinawan coconut crab and an Indian Ocean specimen that consists of one insertion, one deletion, 135 SNPs, three MNPs and nine complex polymorphisms. We provide confirmatory evidence that the superfamily Paguroidea, to which the coconut crab belongs, is polyphyletic, that all the protein-coding genes of B. latro are under purifying selection, and that a Pacific versus Indian Ocean coconut crab population divergence occurred during the Pleistocene.","We thank Ka Yan Ma, Zacary Y.H.

Evidence from the Environmental Licensing Process,"Environmental cost benefit analysis, CBA, is often the preferred method for economists to assess policy changes which have environmental consequences. It is argued that CBA can help governments focus their resources to maximize the social returns of investments or projects. CBA is also viewed as a useful framework for organizing disparate information and subsequently improve the decision process. Despite the enthusiasm for the method, there have been few attempts outside developed countries to assess CBA's influence on decisions. In this article we used content analysis of official documents to analyse the role played by CBA in the Colombian environmental licensing process. Our results show that CBA's influence on the final decisions has been limited. The problem, we conclude, does not reside in CBA but in the process. Although there is a procedural requirement to do CBA, there is no requirement that the results must be considered in the decision-making. Since the problem lies in the process, not the instrument, we think that merely using a non-monetary assessment method instead of CBA, such as multicriteria analysis, will not lead to better decisions. This latter point is a discussion missing from the ecological economics literature that deserves more attention.","We thank the attendees of the session of the 2018 Conference of the International Society for Ecological Economics where a previous version of this work was presented.

In addition to having achieved long length and substantial width, the species produces shells of exceptional thickness, even before secondary shell deposition. We investigated the paleoecology of this species through analysis of drilling and peeling frequencies with comparisons to co-occurring turritellid species. We used oxygen isotopic sclerochronology to infer the growth rate and lifespan of T. abrupta and to make comparisons with other modern and fossil tropical species, including the living species Turritella terebra, with the first sclerochronologies for both of these species presented herein. We find that T. abrupta was fast-growing, long-lived, and comparatively effective at resisting predation. T. abrupta was notably widespread geographically and temporally, but was a relatively rare component of faunas when compared with co-occurring turritellids. High rates of shell carbonate construction (in excess of 35 g in the first year of life) likely depended on habitats conducive to calcification. Late Miocene cooling and eastern Pacific carbonate limitation are implicated in the range contraction and eventual extinction of this species.","Declaration of competing interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

Indeed, these other traditions of thought, be it postcolonial critique or Black geographies, are often assimilated and integrated into the self-narration of disciplines, including geography, a process I describe as citationary alibi. Following Oswin, I am interested in not only how such assimilation can be rejected and ruptured, but also how solidarity can be built across different modes of difference. This requires, I argue, a radical break with respectability politics and its citationary practice. It also requires ontologies of subversion in the global universities of the North Atlantic.",,,Dialogues in Human Geography,,,,2020-01-08,2020,2020-01-08,2020-03,10,1,19-22,Closed,Article,"Roy, Ananya","Roy, Ananya (UCLA, USA)","Roy, Ananya (University of California, Los Angeles)","Roy, Ananya (University of California, Los Angeles)",40,23,,13.31,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1123965756,44 Human Society; 4406 Human Geography,

Although the literature includes important contributions on satisfaction evaluations of this LMS, to the best of our knowledge, no investigations exist providing a quantitative summary of them. In this sense, we focus on summarizing the degree of global technological satisfaction that users have about Moodle, specifically in the context of Higher Education. A meta-analysis of proportions was carried out on the studies published from 2001 to 2019. The degree of technological satisfaction regarding Moodle was considered the effect size. Results show that Moodle gave users a high degree of technological satisfaction (effect size of 0.78 with a 95% confidence interval of 0.72 to 0.84). These results have a moderate but significant heterogeneity of 67%. It was also observed that this effect size is not sensitive to factors such as the number of participants, the application of an evaluation standard and the comparison of Moodle with other LMSs. However, participant type (lecturer or student) was a significant moderator variable. No publication bias was observed (p-value of the Egger test $>0.05$ ).",,,IEEE Revista Iberoamericana de Tecnologias del Aprendizaje,,,,2020-10-22,2020,2020-10-22,2020-11-01,15,4,281-290,Closed,Article,"García-Murillo, Gabriel; Novoa-Hernández, Pavel; Rodríguez, Rocío Serrano","García-Murillo, Gabriel (Facultad de Filosofía, Letras y Ciencias de la Educación, Universidad Técnica de Manabí, Portoviejo, 130104, Ecuador); Novoa-Hernández, Pavel (Escuela de Ciencias Empresariales, Universidad Católica del Norte, Coquimbo, 1780000, Chile); Rodríguez, Rocío Serrano (Departamento de Educación, Universidad de Córdoba, Córdoba, 14071, España)","Novoa-Hernández, Pavel (Catholic University of the North)","García-Murillo, Gabriel (Universidad Técnica de Manabí); Novoa-Hernández, Pavel (Catholic University of the North); Rodríguez, Rocío Serrano (University of Córdoba)",14,5,,8.45,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1131999448,39 Education; 3903 Education Systems,4 Quality Education

Importance of aesthetics in young people's intention to continue using smartphones,"This research intends to understand the relationship between aesthetics and young people's intention to continue using smartphones. In particular, the study validates a research model that proposes aesthetics as an antecedent of variables that explain the intention to continue using smartphones (performance expectancy, hedonic motivation, and habit). An online questionnaire was conducted to develop the empirical study in two countries of South America, using a non-random sample of young smartphone users. A total of 306 valid answers were analysed using a structural equation modelling approach. The validation of the research model was based on partial least squares structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM). The results indicate, on the one hand, the validation of the scale of measurement of smartphone aesthetics in Latin America and, on the other hand, the research model explains 52% of the intention to continue using a smartphone. In conclusion, the findings support the idea that aesthetics is a necessary antecedent to explain the continued use of smartphones.

Two active volcanoes in northern Chile, Guallatiri and Lastarria, are characterised by vigorous and persistent fumarolic activity and the formation of zoned fumarolic deposits. Twelve minerals were identified in the studied deposits by X-ray diffraction: anhydrite, barite, gypsum, rhomboclase, orpiment, pyrite, galena, cristobalite, quartz, magnetite, sassolite, and native sulphur. Chemical analyses revealed the presence of 30 chemical elements, including metals and metalloids such as As, Hg, Pb, Sb, Te, and Tl. Backscattered-electron imaging revealed four types of rock textures in the fumarolic deposits: i) massive and poorly vesiculated, ii) highly vesiculated, iii) clastic-like, and iv) flow-like. Micro-chemical analyses showed the presence of cinnabar nataliyamalikite and unidentified mineral assemblages of AsS, TeS, PbS, HgS, TlI, and Tl-I-Pb compositions. Based on colour, outlet gas temperature, mineralogy, and chemistry, four distinct zones of fumarolic deposits are identified. (1) Grey zone: sulphide and silicate dominant with minor native elements, high concentrations of Pb and As, and a clastic-like texture (gas outlet temperature > 265 °C). (2) Red zone: sulphide and silicate dominant with minor oxides and native elements, small As, Pb, Tl, I, and Te minerals, and predominance of a flow-like texture (200–280 °C). (3) Yellow-orange zone: dominated by native sulphur and minor borates and sulphur with small As-, Sb-, Hg-, and I-containing minerals, massive and vesiculated texture (80–200 °C). (4) Yellow-white zone: formed by native sulphur, minor borates and As-rich zones, usually displaying a vesiculated texture (<100 °C).","We are grateful to the residents of Chirigualla hamlet, especially Mrs. Severina Mamani and Mr. Clemente Ticlla for their hospitality and kindness.

However, to ensure truly healthy future and efficient health systems worldwide, and in Africa especially, this requires more innovative health management systems and care for treating ailments predicated in people's IK. This paper aims to innovatively explore and examine the role of traditions and practices in influencing community and individual perceptions of health and illness, prevention, cure and management of COVID-19. It uses a qualitative research method and employs tripartite-theoretical frameworks of analysis: ethno-medical model, explanatory model, and health promotion model. It emerged that harnessing society's extant indigenous knowledge and identifying areas of improvement through genuine practices, means that the danger posed by COVID-19 can be curtailed through indigenous curative measures and initiatives.

Colombian Citizens’ Beliefs and Attitudes Vis-à-Vis the Government-FARC-EP Agreement,"The 2016 peace deal between the Colombian government and the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia - People’s Army (FARC-EP) faces several challenges concerning its implementation. This study explores the beliefs and attitudes of citizens from the Colombian Caribbean coast vis-à-vis the 2016 peace agreement as well as the first steps in its implementation in 2017 identifying barriers that are likely to undermine support for long-term peace. We detect a tendency to maintain beliefs and attitudes that hinder the de-escalation of the conflict and fuel mistrust, mostly linked to the weaponization of the peace process in a polarized political context.","We would like to thank the Centro de Pensamiento UNcaribe at the Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla as well as the German Institute of Global and Area Studies (GIGA), Hamburg, and in particular Professor Sabine Kurtenbach who provided support and feedback during the drafting of this article.

We sampled Anthropogenic Marine Debris (AMD) on 26 beaches, including one beach from Galapagos Islands. AMD was mainly composed of plastics (>60%), followed by cigarette butts, paper and metal. Average AMD density on the continental beaches was 1.31 ± 1.03 items m-2 (mean ± SD). AMD densities and the proportion of plastics were higher on some beaches located on the Gulf of Guayaquil, suggesting that many of the plastic items found on these beaches were, likely, drifted by the swift currents of the Guayas River. Additionally, the overall results indicate that most litter on continental beaches from Ecuador has local sources. Recommendations include marine pollution education and public awareness campaigns to reduce the consumption of plastic bags, as well as a ban on harmful single-use plastics.","We thank the National Fisheries Institute (INP) for having convened researchers, professors, and students in the training on the methodology developed by the citizen science program “Científicos de la Basura” (“Litter Scientists”), as well as for coordinating the first national sampling of marine debris on Ecuadorian beaches.

A previous analysis of the environmental regulation of this system is extended here by considering complementary oceanographic information (sea level, stratification indexes) and additional reproductive traits, such as maximum (MaxEPR), median (MedianEPR) and prevalence of egg producing females over a period of six months. Furthermore, field minimum-maximum pH levels were reproduced in three 96-h incubation experiments conducted under variable salinity conditions to evaluate copepod mean EPR, egg size and hatching success. Supporting previous assertions, the warm-high salinity EN 2015 was observed in the study site separately from hydrographic conditions associated with upwelling to non-upwelling regimes. Analysis of similarity-distance (Distance based Linear Model (DistLM)) and normalized data (separate-slope comparison under a General Linear Model (GLM)) showed that reproductive traits were regulated by specific combinations of ambient conditions, and that this regulation was also sensitive to the prevailing hydrographic regime. Thus, upwelling to non-upwelling transitions changing the pH, and EN-associated salinity and stratification shifts, were significantly and strongly linked to almost all reproductive traits (DistLM). Slope comparison (GLM) indicated MaxEPR and MedianEPR variations also underlie the phenology, highlighting the relationship between pH and salinity with biological variations. In conjunction with experimental observations, the current study consistently suggests that pH-variations in the upwelling realm, and EN hydrographic perturbations might underpin responses of plankton populations to climate change in productive EBUS.","I acknowledge Dr. Mauricio Cerda, Mr. Espiridion Montanares, Lucas Vega, Mario Lody and Leonel González for their valuable help during cruises and experiments.

The widely distributed red‐tailed tropicbird,  Phaethon rubricauda  , was used as a model species to assess potential anthropogenic impacts on the genetic diversity of breeding colonies in the Pacific Ocean.     Cytochrome c oxidase subunit I and control region sequences analyses were conducted across the range of the species in the Pacific Ocean. The study sites were at islands without human‐related disturbance (non‐impacted islands) and with human‐related disturbance (impacted islands). We hypothesized that (i) breeding colonies of the red‐tailed tropicbird on impacted islands have lower genetic diversity compared with colonies on non‐impacted islands, and (ii) breeding colonies of the red‐tailed tropicbird show significant fine and broad‐scale genetic structure across the Pacific Ocean. Bayesian skyline analyses were conducted to infer past changes in population sizes.     Genetic diversity was similar between impacted and non‐impacted islands. There was significant broad‐scale genetic structure among colonies separated by over 6,000 km, but a lack of significant fine‐scale genetic structure within Australasia and Hawai'i, although a significant level of differentiation was found within Chile with Φ ST analyses. Skyline analyses showed that effective population sizes remained relatively constant through time, but experienced either a slight decrease or the end of an expansion event through the last 1,000 years. These changes may be related to the arrival of humans on Pacific islands.    Impacted islands may have received immigrants from other relatively close islands, buffering the loss of genetic diversity. However, it is also possible that colonies have retained ancestral variation or that a large effective population size coupled with a long generation time (13 years) has prevented the loss of genetic diversity in human‐impacted islands. Future research using higher‐resolution markers is needed to resolve the population genetic structure of the red‐tailed tropicbird in an ecological time‐scale.","ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS Funding for this project was provided by a postdoctoral research grant awarded to A.I.

Fumarolic gases had outlet temperatures of between 80.2 and 265 °C, and showed a significant magmatic fluid contribution marked by the occurrence of SO2, HCl, and HF that are partially scrubbed by a hydrothermal aquifer. The helium isotope ratios (< 3.2) were relatively low compared to those of other active volcanoes in CVZ, possibly due to contamination of the magmatic source by 4He-rich crust and/or crustal fluid addition to the hydrothermal reservoir. Geothermometry in the H2O-CO2-CO-H2-CH4 system suggests equilibrium temperatures of up to 320 °C attained in a vapor phase at redox conditions intermediate between those typical of hydrothermal and magmatic environments. Thermal springs located 12 km northwest of the volcano’s summit had outlet temperatures of up to 50.1 °C, neutral to slightly basic pH, and a sodium bicarbonate composition, typical of distal fluid discharges in volcanic systems. Cold springs at the base of the volcanic edifice, showing a calcium sulfate composition, were likely produced by interaction of shallow meteoric water with CO2- and H2S-rich gases. A geochemical conceptual model was constructed to graphically represent these results, which can be used as an indication for future geochemical monitoring and volcanic hazard assessment.","This study was funded by the Comisión Nacional de Investigación Científica y Tecnológica (CONICYT)-PCHA/Doctorado Nacional/2016-21160172 and the project Intercambio de Investigadores Chile-Italia, convocatoria 2017, Programa de Cooperación Internacional ITAL17002 funded by CONICYT Chile and the Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation.

203,pub.1124453624,10.1111/bre.12436,,,Effects of pre‐orogenic tectonic structures on the Cenozoic evolution of Andean deformed belts: Evidence from the Salar de Punta Negra Basin in the Central Andes of Northern Chile,"Abstract We integrated new field observations, two‐dimensional (2‐D) seismic profiles and new and previously reported chronological data to understand the effects of pre‐orogenic structures on the tectonic evolution of the Salar de Punta Negra in the Central Andes. For first time a series of restored geological cross‐sections are presented, thus showing the pre‐orogenic tectonic architecture of the region and new ideas about the tectonic evolution of the inner forearc of the Central Andes. Our results show a series of east‐dipping normal faults as the main pre‐orogenic structures in the region, which resulted from lithospheric stretching of the western continental margin during the Paleozoic to Mesozoic (Triassic–Jurassic). These were later incorporated into the Andean orogen by tectonic inversion, forming west‐verging inversion anticlines. The beginning of the tectonic inversion is constrained by the first on‐lap of the Upper Cretaceous‐Palaeocene syn‐kinematic deposits on the top of the Mesozoic syn‐rift successions, highlighting that inversion occurred during this period. These syn‐kinematic deposits display zircons with older age peaks between ca. 200 and 300 Ma, thus indicating that some Carboniferous to Triassic sources of sediments were eroded during the uplift of the orogen. Other basement reverse faults affect the footwalls of normal inverted faults and the shoulders of ancient half‐graben structures. These truncate and decapitate previous inverted faults and completely cut the infill of the basin, leading to exhumation of the pre‐rift basement rocks. We propose that the propagation of these structures was favoured by the modified thermal‐tectonic state of the lithosphere from the eastward migration of the volcanic arc, and not by the previous pre‐orogenic structures. The structural and stratigraphic relationships recognized both in the field and 2‐D seismic profiles indicate that many reverse faults originated after the initial tectonic inversion and continued to be active from the Eocene until the Pleistocene period.","This work was supported by Fondecyt Research Project no. 11170098 “Structure and tectonics of the pre‐Andean Depression, Central Andes: A case of study of the Salar de Punta Negra Basin”.

In this article, we analyse the spatial dimensions of local content policies at a regional scale in the context of global fragmentation of production in the extractive industries. We do so through a multi-scalar analysis of changes that have taken place in the organization of extractive industries, with special emphasis on how this has reduced the territorial embeddedness of activities in mining regions. We study the evolution of these regions in Chile, an ideal case to explore the consequences of the lack of application of local content policies at a regional scale. Empirical results depict an ongoing process of ‘hollowing out’ in extractive regions in terms of opportunities for linkages development, creation of thick labour markets and knowledge transfer, and justifying the application of specific local content policies with an explicit and clear regional dimension and long-term perspective.",,,The Extractive Industries and Society,,,,2020-04,2020,,2020-04,7,2,292-301,Closed,Article,"Atienza, Miguel; Arias-Loyola, Martín; Lufin, Marcelo","Atienza, Miguel (Departamento de Economía, Instituto de Economía Aplicada Regional (IDEAR), Universidad Católica del Norte, Avenida Angamos, 0610, Antofagasta, Chile); Arias-Loyola, Martín (Departamento de Economía, Instituto de Economía Aplicada Regional (IDEAR), Universidad Católica del Norte, Avenida Angamos, 0610, Antofagasta, Chile; Melbourne School of Design, Faculty of Architecture, Building and Planning, University of Melbourne, Australia); Lufin, Marcelo (Departamento de Economía, Instituto de Economía Aplicada Regional (IDEAR), Universidad Católica del Norte, Avenida Angamos, 0610, Antofagasta, Chile)","Atienza, Miguel (Catholic University of the North)","Atienza, Miguel (Catholic University of the North); Arias-Loyola, Martín (Catholic University of the North; University of Melbourne); Lufin, Marcelo (Catholic University of the North)",35,9,,18.2,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1122581036,44 Human Society; 4407 Policy and Administration,

We consider different concepts of labor market informality and use empirical definitions for employment in the informal sector and informal employment. Since the Ecuadorian earthquake may be considered a natural experiment, we perform a two stage identification strategy using both coarsened exact matching (CEM), and nonlinear difference in differences (DD) using individual panel data. We use a fully exogenous measurement of intensity (Peak Ground Acceleration, PGA), which is continuous, and has not been subject to possible arbitrariness in its definition. We found that the earthquake had a positive effect in the likelihood of being part of informal sector if workers are located in the affected areas; we also identified significant gender differences, since a causal effect for men was found, but not for women. When we use the concept of informality based in jobs (informal employment) instead of companies (informal sector), no robust evidence of a causal effect was found. Our results suggest that the government's reconstruction efforts could had attenuated the effect of the disaster over informality in the most affected zones.",,,Regional Science Policy & Practice,,,,2020-02,2020,,2020-02,12,1,125-157,Closed,Article,"Mendoza, César Andrés; Jara, Benjamin","Mendoza, César Andrés (GIER – Facultad de Ciencias Económicas y Administrativas, Universidad de Cuenca, Av. 12 de Abril y Av.

Given the increasing awareness about environmental litter, many communities have banned SUPBs in the recent past. Here we explore an emerging economy to document the rise and demise of SUPBs in society. Through a review of scientific and grey literature (including governmental documents and media coverage) we reconstruct the timeline of SUPBs in Chile, including the development of the plastic industry and retail business within Chile, the introduction, spread and finally the demise of SUPBs. Focused on the demise phase, we document the creation and succession of municipal ordinances to reduce SUPBs in local commerce, and the development of a national law to regulate the use of SUPBs. In order to document the involvement of the general public during the demise phase, we also examined current behavior and behavioral intentions of people in (i) a local project introducing reusable cloth bags to reduce the use of SUPBs, and (ii) a consumer survey about public perception of SUPBs and their use. Plastic bags were introduced in Chile in the 1970s, then spread with the emergence of supermarkets and retail stores in the 1980s and 1990s, and were widely used in commerce by the turn of the century. During the first decade of the 21st century the first scientific studies reported large amounts of plastic litter and high proportions of single-use plastics in coastal environments, public awareness grew, and numerous initiatives aiming to reduce consumption and littering of plastics developed. The first municipal ban of SUPBs in 2013 was emulated during the following five years by 62 other Chilean municipalities and in 2018 translated into a national law, which was highly approved and supported by the population. We conclude that the ban of SUBPs in Chile was facilitated by a broad concern among the general public, which led to a bottom-up movement culminating in the national government taking stakes in the issue. Finally, we argue that this can only be a first step that must be followed by further actions to abolish single-use products in order to effectively protect the environment and in particular the world's oceans.","This study was partly financed with funds from the United Nation Environment Programme – Global Programme of Action through the Comisión Permanente del Pacífico Sur (CPPS).

However, due to the signing of the peace agreement and the growing number of fatalities in road crashes, it is possible that soon traffic fatalities will be the primary cause of violent deaths in the country, particularly in urban areas. This study is an exploratory analysis focused on identifying the main factors associated with the severity of traffic crashes in urban areas, using Cartagena as a case study. We analyzed three levels of crash severity, namely fatal, injury, and property-damage-only, considering factors in several different dimensions: victim, vehicle, road infrastructure, traffic and control, day and time, and environmental factors. A modeling approach based on multinomial ordered discrete models was used to properly identify the main factors associated with the severity levels. We found that the probability of fatal accidents is higher on streets with speed limits over 40 km/h, and that males and people aged 60 years or older are the victims with the most significant risk of fatal crashes. Motorcycles were also identified as vehicles with the highest probability of fatal crashes in the city. We showed that the probability of fatal crashes occurring is higher on streets where pedestrian bridges, traffic lights, and crosswalks are present. These findings are worthy because, in Colombia and other developing countries, the authorities normally expect to reduce the probability of fatal accidents through investments in pedestrian bridges, signaling devices, and crosswalk markings. However, according to our results, it possibly will not occur unless further countermeasures are taken. Based on these findings, reducing speed limits, operational improvements at signalized intersections, zero tolerance for traffic violations related to pedestrians, an awareness campaign on pedestrian safety focused on males and people aged 60 or older, and improving motorcycle safety are the countermeasures we proposed. Furthermore, as the authorities make significant efforts to investing in pedestrian bridges, we propose a further investigation into the traffic crashes in streets where there is this infrastructure since more severe events occur near them.",Declaration of Competing Interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.,,Accident Analysis & Prevention,,,"Accidents, Traffic; Adult; Aged; Built Environment; Colombia; Female; Humans; Injury Severity Score; Male; Middle Aged; Urban Population; Wounds and Injuries; Young Adult",2020-09-09,2020,2020-09-09,2020-10,146,,105749,Closed,Article,"Cantillo, Víctor; Márquez, Luis; Díaz, Carmelo J","Cantillo, Víctor (Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia.

Researchers that endorse this research paradigm privilege intensive, over extensive, research designs, focussing, hence, in ethnographic methods and qualitative interviewing. However, and despite some recent academic proposals, there is little guidance in the literature on how to analyse qualitative data using the lenses of CR to produce causal knowledge about the operation of education policies in society. The current piece elaborates on the tenets of dialectical CR to develop some methodological arguments on how to engage in this type of empirical work. These reflections are then applied to analyse qualitative information retrieved in three ‘failing’ schools from Northern Colombia as an exemplar.","We would like to thank members of both of the communities that we visited during our field research for sharing their experiences with us in such an open and transparent way.

We presented a fictional profile to the study participants – university students from Spain – of a 15-year-old person, called Manuel or María, with two possible levels of academic record. The participants were asked to evaluate the student’s mathematical ability and provide guidance regarding whether or not he or she should study engineering in the future. We assumed that the effect of being a male target on the recommendation to study engineering is partially mediated by the fact that the participants attribute a greater mathematical ability to males.

These production chains have generated a direct interaction between biofuels and the agri-food industry. Thus, this paper seeks to analyze whether the national biofuels policy allowed a reconfiguration of the production dynamics of both the sugar and palm sectors in Colombia, in the period 2008–2018. The analysis methodology used is based on the time series models approach of the autoregressive distributed lag models type. The results show that this policy of promoting the use of biofuels has transformed the dynamics of the sugar and palm sectors, in such a way that ethanol production generated a substitutive production relationship with sugar for export, while biodiesel allowed a greater expansion of the entire palm sector. These results open the debate on whether to gamble on the continuity of the biofuel-promoting policy around these two current sectors or productive alternatives should be considered through an adjustment of incentives.","The authors would like to acknowledge to Carlos A.

However, few studies have considered the relevance of seasonal acclimation to elevated temperatures and whether native and non-native species have similar tolerances to warming. We tested the hypotheses that the susceptibility to warming in two species of sea anemones from temperate latitudes is (i) higher in winter than in summer, and (ii) higher in the native than in the non-native species. Seasonal variability in the upper thermal tolerance limit of Anthothoe chilensis (native) and Anemonia alicemartinae (non-native) individuals from the northern-central coast of Chile was assessed in laboratory experiments during the austral winter 2015 and summer 2016. In line with our predictions, seawater warming (up to 16 °C above natural levels) significantly suppressed individual performance proxies such as survival and asexual reproduction (longitudinal fission) in the native species, but not in the non-native species. However, asexual reproduction in the non-native sea anemone was rare across warming treatments, and the native species showed a stronger capacity to detach from the substratum under adverse thermal conditions. Negative effects of warming on survival and fission were evident only in winter, when asexual reproduction is more intense in these taxa. Finally, water temperatures of 30 °C or more were lethal for both native and non-native sea anemones. These results show that the non-native species may have a broader thermal tolerance (in terms of survival) than the native taxonomically related species, but the latter displays behavioral adaptations to avoid adverse conditions of high temperatures. We suggest that knowledge about life history traits related to seasonal variations in water temperature and the invasion status of a species can help to predict its performance in a warming ocean.","We thank the GAME (Global Approach by Modular Experiments) program of the GEOMAR Helmholtz Centre for Ocean Research Kiel, Germany, for the financial, technical, and logistical support to carry out this investigation.

213,pub.1128392082,10.1002/aqc.3359,,,Exploring overlooked components of remote South‐east Pacific oceanic islands: Larval and macrobenthic assemblages in reef habitats with distinct underwater soundscapes,"Abstract    Identifying the diverse assemblage of species inhabiting rocky and coral reef habitats in isolated oceanic environments, and the important sound cues emitted from the reef, are crucial components to understand how species locate suitable habitats for the completion of their life‐cycle and, thus, the functioning of these vulnerable ecosystems.   Recent field information suggests that the majority of reef biodiversity comprises small cryptic invertebrates; however, knowledge on these small components is extremely scarce.   The present study used light attraction methods to explore the diversity of larval, post‐larval and macrobenthic cryptic fauna, and hydrophones to characterize the natural soundscape of rocky and coral reef habitats at the Robinson Crusoe island (Juan Fernandez Archipelago; 33°38′S, 78°50′W), and Rapa Nui (Easter Island; 27°7′S, 109°21′W), respectively.   Pelagic collections found important site‐specific patterns and identified two main species assemblages: early‐life stages (e.g. eggs, larval and juvenile stages of crustaceans, molluscs, and fishes) and emerging macrobenthos (e.g. demersal zooplankton such as peracarid crustaceans, ostracods, copepods, and polychaetes), with the latter contributing between 73 and 98% to the total catches.   The soundscape records showed marked differences among sites and seasons at Robinson Crusoe island, with variable differences found between day and night. However, at Rapa Nui, there were no differences between sites, but the ambient sound was higher at night possibly due to higher snapping shrimp activity.   This information highlights the importance of considering small‐scale (site‐to‐site) patterns when evaluating overlooked components of diversity (i.e. biological or acoustic) in oceanic habitats, and provides the basis for understanding the importance of natural noise in the settlement of most reef‐associated species, crucial features for the conservation of these remote and vulnerable ecosystems.","ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS The authors would like to thank to Cristian Véliz and María de los Angeles Gallardo for their help during species identification in laboratory (Sala de Colecciones Biológicas UCN [SCBUCN]).

In order to understand this successful expansion, we evaluated the effects of different salinities, light intensity, temperatures, nitrogen (N) forms and nitrogen/phosphate (N:P) ratio levels on the growth performance, using clones isolated from different locations across its wide geographic distribution. Results showed that the growth responses were plastic and, in some cases, different reaction norms among clones were observed. Despite plasticity, the optimal growth of A. catenella (i.e. highest growth rate and highest maximal cells density) was reached within a narrow thermal range (12–15°C), while salinity (20–30 PSU) and light intensity (20–120 μmol m−2 s−1) ranges were wider. These results are partially consistent with the highest cell densities recorded in the field. Furthermore, optimal growth was reached using reduced forms of nitrogen (i.e. urea and NH4+) and in unbalanced N:P ratios (18:1 and 30:1). These characteristics likely allow A. catenella to grow in highly variable environmental conditions and might partly explain the recent expansion of this species.","We thank Andrea Zuñiga, Karen Correa, Bianca Olivares, Adrian Villarroel and Jaen Mayorga for taking the samples, the strain isolation and culture maintenance.

Several studies have focused their analyses on this model, and its relation to mining, from a political ecology perspective; however, this has minimized the broader historical context. In this paper, we followed a geohistorical standpoint to gain an extensive understanding of the processes of mining development and the related water extraction in the Atacama Desert. By analyzing different official documents, historical sources and scientific discourses of the 19th and early 20th centuries, we aimed to denaturalize the idea of the Atacama Desert as hyper-arid space, rich in mineral resources. By doing so, from a political ecology perspective, and with a critical approach to territory, we interrogated the mining development in the Taltal district (1840–1920). This exercise led us to understand the Atacama Desert as a socially-produced mining territory, or miningscape, where foreign actors have produced hegemonic discourses and uneven materialities. Here, water, minerals, global markets, scientific knowledge, political and legal discourses, and colonialism have inevitably become interwoven in a territorial long-standing production process. Thus, we propose that the production of miningscapes and waterscapes are entangled process in the Andes mining territories. In turn, this process has enabled the reproduction of the Chilean state, capital accumulation, and the consolidation of a modern project at the expense of local populations and rationalities, which have been invisibilized.","The authors appreciate the helpful comments from Matthew Himley, Andrea Marston and Valentina Figueroa on early drafts of this paper and the comments of three anonymous reviewers and the editor.

A Trans-Holocene record of paleoceanographic and archaeological fish remains","The Humboldt Current System (HCS) is one of the most productive marine ecosystems on earth. Humans have inhabited the desert coast of Chile and Peru for the last 12,000 years and have consistently based their subsistence and economy on the marine resources obtained from this rich ecosystem. Archaeological evidence on prehistoric coastal fisheries from the southern coast of the Atacama Desert, shows a Trans-Holocene record on knowledgeable fishers that developed gear to catch species from a wide array of habitats. However, the Holocene was a period with important changes in climate and paleoceanographic conditions that should have played an important role modulating natural conditions of fish habitats. In addition, fishing gear used in the past along the Atacama Desert coast varied through time, providing us clues on changing fishing patterns through the Holocene. Hence, the objective of the study is to examine our understanding of prehistoric fisheries from the area of Taltal (25°S) together with our present knowledge of the environmental factors that modulated it. We present fish data from ten archaeological sites with occupations dated between 12,000 and 1500 cal yrs BP, and discuss patterns of fishing behavior and their relationship to paleoceanographic conditions and fishing gear throughout the Holocene. Our results suggest that fishing strategies used by past communities adapted and took advantage of the dynamics of marine and coastal habitats. Furthermore, Trachurus murphyi, a neritic species and a staple fishery, plays a key role to help us understanding changes in fishing activities throughout the Holocene.","This work was supported by the National Fund for Scientific and Technological Development (FONDECYT #1151203, 11150210, 3170913, 1181300) and the Millenium Scientific Initiative through the Center for the Study Multiple Drivers on Marine Socio–Ecological Systems (MUSELS).

Barranquilla is a Caribbean city located in the North of Colombia that has approximately 1.200.000 inhabitants and possesses a warm, humid climate. In order to obtain the concentration of the contaminant in an adequate resolution, 137 Passive diffusion tubes from Gradko© were installed. Tubes prepared with 20% Triethanolamine/De-ionised water were located at the roadside between 1 and 5 m from the kerb edge. The sampling period was two weeks, from 3/16/2019 to 3/30/2019. Samples were analyzed on the UV CARY1 spectrophotometer by Gradko©. Results showed an average of 19.92 ± 11.50 μg/m3, with a maximum and minimum value of 70.27 and 0.57 μg/m3, respectively. NO2 correlation with load traffic load was higher than with maximum traffic. The expected results include the analysis of the areas of the city with high concentrations of this pollutant that exceed the limit values established by the WHO in six (6) points; however, they never exceed the local legal limit for annual exposure, which is significantly less restrictive. Overall, the multiregression analysis is a very effective method to enrich the understanding of NO2 distributions. It can provide scientific evidence for the relationship between NO2 and traffic, beneficial for developing the targeted policies and measures to reduce NO2 pollution levels in hot spots. This research may subsidize knowledge to serve as a tool for environmental and health authorities.","We thank Universidad del Norte for financial support.

Since December 2014 the Western Guiana Hospital (WGH) has used Antivipmyn Tri TM, a Mexican polyvalent antivenom. The aim of the study was to assess its benefit on the correction of snakebite-related coagulopathy.
METHODS: This retrospective study included patients hospitalized at the WGH with snakebite and a coagulopathy defined by: a prothrombin rate (PR) lower than 45%, an activated partial thromboplastin time ratio (aPTTr) greater than 2 or a fibrinogen lower than 100 mg.dL-1. The antivenom group included patients receiving Antivipmyn Tri TM from December 2014 to September 2017. The control group included patients admitted between January 2013 and November 2014 (when antivenom was unavailable) or admitted between December 2014 and September 2017 during times of antivenom shortage. We graphically compared the time courses of PR, aPTTr and fibrinogen between groups. Other endpoints were the length of hospital stay and the need for surgery or dialysis.
RESULTS: 84 patients were included: 42 in the antivenom group, 42 in the control group. Both groups were similar for age, sex-ratio, proportion of bleedings, necrosis, and severity. Most patients in the antivenom group received 3 vials. There were no significant differences in recovery of PR, aPTTr and fibrinogen through the first 24 h. Fibrinogen declined again in the control group at 30 h and showed a slower rise to normal concentration. There were no significant differences in any secondary endpoint.
CONCLUSION: Antivipmyn Tri TM as currently used did not show any benefit in recovery from coagulopathy.","The authors would like to thank Misses Avilon and Edwards, Doctors Kezza Crépin, Pousset François, Ntab Balthazar and Mr. Beneteau Samuel for their kind help and careful reading of the manuscript.",,Clinical Toxicology,,,Adolescent; Adult; Animals; Antivenins; Blood Coagulation Disorders; Bothrops; Case-Control Studies; Crotalid Venoms; Crotalinae; Crotalus; Female; French Guiana; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Retrospective Studies; Snake Bites; Treatment Failure; Viperidae; Young Adult,2020-07-01,2020,2020-07-01,2021-03-04,59,3,193-199,Closed,Article,"Heckmann, Xavier; Lambert, Véronique; Mion, Georges; Ehrhardt, Adrien; Marty, Christian; Perotti, Frédérique; Carod, Jean-François; Jolivet, Anne; Boels, David; Andi, Ibrahim Lehida; Larréché, Sébastien","Heckmann, Xavier (Department of Emergency, Western Guiana Hospital, Saint-Laurent-du-Maroni, French Guiana; French Red Cross, Cayenne, French Guiana); Lambert, Véronique (Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Western Guiana Hospital, Saint-Laurent-du-Maroni, French Guiana); Mion, Georges (Department of Anaesthesiology, Cochin Hospital, Paris, France); Ehrhardt, Adrien (INRIA Lille-Nord Europe, Villeneuve-d’Ascq, France); Marty, Christian (French Red Cross, Cayenne, French Guiana); Perotti, Frédérique (Department of Pharmacy, Western Guiana Hospital, Saint-Laurent-du-Maroni, French Guiana); Carod, Jean-François (Department of Medical Biology, Western Guiana Hospital, Saint-Laurent-du-Maroni, French Guiana); Jolivet, Anne (Department of Public Health, Western Guiana Hospital, Saint-Laurent-du-Maroni, French Guiana); Boels, David (Poison Control Center, Angers University Hospital, Angers, France); Andi, Ibrahim Lehida (Department of Anaesthesiology and Reanimation, Western Guiana Hospital, Saint-Laurent-du-Maroni, French Guiana); Larréché, Sébastien (Department of Medical Biology, Bégin Military Teaching Hospital, Saint-Mandé, France)","Heckmann, Xavier (Department of Emergency, Western Guiana Hospital, Saint-Laurent-du-Maroni, French Guiana; French Red Cross, Cayenne, French Guiana)","Heckmann, Xavier (Department of Emergency, Western Guiana Hospital, Saint-Laurent-du-Maroni, French Guiana; French Red Cross, Cayenne, French Guiana); Lambert, Véronique (Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Western Guiana Hospital, Saint-Laurent-du-Maroni, French Guiana); Mion, Georges (Hôpital Cochin); Ehrhardt, Adrien (Inria research centre Lille - Nord Europe); Marty, Christian (French Red Cross, Cayenne, French Guiana); Perotti, Frédérique (Department of Pharmacy, Western Guiana Hospital, Saint-Laurent-du-Maroni, French Guiana); Carod, Jean-François (Department of Medical Biology, Western Guiana Hospital, Saint-Laurent-du-Maroni, French Guiana); Jolivet, Anne (Department of Public Health, Western Guiana Hospital, Saint-Laurent-du-Maroni, French Guiana); Boels, David (Centre Hospitalier Universitaire d'Angers); Andi, Ibrahim Lehida (Department of Anaesthesiology and Reanimation, Western Guiana Hospital, Saint-Laurent-du-Maroni, French Guiana); Larréché, Sébastien (Hôpital d'Instruction des Armées Bégin)",17,8,2.63,5.6,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1128912949,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3202 Clinical Sciences,3 Good Health and Well Being

While the burden of disease is heaviest in Sub-Saharan Africa, South, and Southeast Asia, malnutrition in Latin America remains high, especially within indigenous communities. This study evaluates the prevalence of malnutrition and its relationship with access to healthcare resources within 172 indigenous Wayuú communities in La Guajira, Colombia. Healthcare workers administered a health questionnaire and collected anthropometric measurements on all children 6 months to 5 years of age within the Wayuú households. These data were utilised to calculate the prevalence of acute malnutrition, stunting, and underweight. Of all surveyed Wayuú children, 22.9% and 18.3% met criteria for moderate and severe malnutrition, 33.4% and 28.1% met criteria for moderate and severe stunting, and 28.1% and 16.6% were moderately and severely underweight. Across all categories, malnourished children were older, less likely to have had a medical professional present at birth, less likely to have received medical care after birth, and more likely to have been born in a non-medical, community setting.

To conduct an ethnobiological study regarding the knowledge related to venomous snakes, snakebites and the attitudes of people who frequent areas of floodplain forests in the Alto Juruá (Brazilian Amazon), and correlate this information with data on snakebites in the region and the ecology of the ophiofauna, 100 residents, who are actively involved in extractivism, fishing, or hunting in the forests of the region were interviewed. Boards with photographs of venomous snakes from the region were used to ask questions about their experiences. The sampling of snakes was carried on trails in a forest used by residents of the region in their extractivism activities. Four venomous species (Bothrops atrox, B. bilineatus smaragdinus, Micrurus lemniscatus and M. surinamensis) were recorded. Among the interviewees, 31% claimed that they had already suffered at least one snakebite. The B. atrox snake is the species that the inhabitants encounter most and the one that is most associated with snakebites. Bothrops b. smaragdinus was the most common snake found during the search. Regarding accident prevention, 60% of them reported wearing boots when walking in the forest. In relation to practices adopted after a bite, the majority stated that they would seek medical attention; however, many reported using first aid measures that would not be medically effective for the victim's recovery. Despite B. b. smaragdinus being the most common snake found by researchers, it is responsible for very few snakebites. This is probably due to its arboreal habits, since it is found at a higher than average height (6.3 m) which is much higher than the height of a human being. The surveyed population demonstrated knowledge of the main preventive measures against snakebites, although some inadequate and/or ineffective first aid measures are still adopted.","We are grateful to the Instituto Chico Mendes de Conservação da Biodiversidade (ICMBio) for providing collection permits (SISBIO/12.178), and to CNPq for the Institutional Scientific Initiation Scholarship Program (PIBIC/UFAC) grants given to the authors RRC and ASO.",,Toxicon,,,"Animals; Brazil; Forests; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Humans; Rural Population; Snake Bites; Snakes; Walking",2020-09-23,2020,2020-09-23,2020-11,187,,232-244,Closed,Article,"Silva, Jéssica Lima da; Fonseca, Wirven Lima da; Mota da Silva, Ageane; Amaral, Gardênia Lima Gurgel do; Ortega, Givanildo Pereira; Oliveira, Andesson de Souza; Correa, Radraque Rodrigues; Oliveira, Igor; Monteiro, Wuelton Marcelo; Bernarde, Paulo Sérgio","Silva, Jéssica Lima da (Laboratório de Herpetologia, Centro Multidisciplinar, Campus Floresta, Universidade Federal do Acre, Cruzeiro do Sul, Acre, Brazil; Universidade Federal do Acre, Programa de Pós-Graduação Stricto Sensu em Ciências da Saúde na Amazônia Ocidental, Rio Branco, Acre, Brazil.); Fonseca, Wirven Lima da (Laboratório de Herpetologia, Centro Multidisciplinar, Campus Floresta, Universidade Federal do Acre, Cruzeiro do Sul, Acre, Brazil; Programa de Pós-Graduação Bionorte, Universidade Federal do Acre, Campus Universitário - BR 364, Rio Branco, Acre, Brazil.); Mota da Silva, Ageane (Programa de Pós-Graduação Bionorte, Universidade Federal do Acre, Campus Universitário - BR 364, Rio Branco, Acre, Brazil; Instituto Federal do Acre, Campus de Cruzeiro do Sul, Cruzeiro do Sul, Acre, Brazil.); Amaral, Gardênia Lima Gurgel do (Laboratório de Herpetologia, Centro Multidisciplinar, Campus Floresta, Universidade Federal do Acre, Cruzeiro do Sul, Acre, Brazil.); Ortega, Givanildo Pereira (Laboratório de Herpetologia, Centro Multidisciplinar, Campus Floresta, Universidade Federal do Acre, Cruzeiro do Sul, Acre, Brazil; Programa de Pós-Graduação Bionorte, Universidade Federal do Acre, Campus Universitário - BR 364, Rio Branco, Acre, Brazil.); Oliveira, Andesson de Souza (Laboratório de Herpetologia, Centro Multidisciplinar, Campus Floresta, Universidade Federal do Acre, Cruzeiro do Sul, Acre, Brazil.); Correa, Radraque Rodrigues (Laboratório de Herpetologia, Centro Multidisciplinar, Campus Floresta, Universidade Federal do Acre, Cruzeiro do Sul, Acre, Brazil.); Oliveira, Igor (Laboratório de Pesquisa em Etnociências, Ecologia e Conservação (EtnoLab), Centro de Educação e Letras, Universidade Federal do Acre, Cruzeiro do Sul, Acre, Brazil.); Monteiro, Wuelton Marcelo (Universidade do Estado do Amazonas, Manaus, Amazonas, Brazil; Fundação de Medicina Tropical Dr. Heitor Vieira Dourado, Manaus, Amazonas, Brazil.); Bernarde, Paulo Sérgio (Laboratório de Herpetologia, Centro Multidisciplinar, Campus Floresta, Universidade Federal do Acre, Cruzeiro do Sul, Acre, Brazil; Universidade Federal do Acre, Programa de Pós-Graduação Stricto Sensu em Ciências da Saúde na Amazônia Ocidental, Rio Branco, Acre, Brazil; Programa de Pós-Graduação Bionorte, Universidade Federal do Acre, Campus Universitário - BR 364, Rio Branco, Acre, Brazil.

The present work reviews 79 documents published from 2007 to 2019 on the occurrence, concentrations, and sources of PhACs and hormones in surface water (SW), wastewater (WW), and treated wastewater (TWW) in LATAM and on the circumstances of their release to the environment. Research efforts are reported in only ten countries and confirm the presence of 159 PhACs, mainly analgesics and anti-inflammatories, although extraordinarily high concentrations of carbamazepine (830 μg/L) and ethinylestradiol (6.8 μg/L) were found in Ecuador and Brazil, respectively. The analysis of maximum concentrations and the ecotoxicological risk assessment corroborate that (1) these values exceed the environmental concentrations found in other parts of the world, (2) the environmental risk posed by these concentrations is remarkably high, and (3) there is no statistically significant difference between the maximum concentrations found in WW and those found in TWW. The main source of PhACs in LATAM’s aquatic environment is WW; hence, these countries should direct substantial efforts to develop efficient and cost-effective treatment technologies and plan and apply WW management strategies and regulations. This analysis presents the current states of occurrence, concentrations, and sources of PhACs in the aquatic environment of LATAM and outlines the magnitude of the environmental problem in that part of the world.","The authors thank the University of Arizona-CONACYT Binational Consortium for the Regional Scientific Development and Innovation (CAZMEX) for the economic support in the investigation of PhACs as a special case of EC.

Among these technologies, long-range WAN (LoRaWAN) transmits through several kilometers with data rates up to 5.5 kb/s, making it useful for applications such as smart city monitoring, precision agriculture, and environmental tracking. However, LoRaWAN supports only one-hop communication between end nodes and gateways. Because links can be kilometers long, LoRaWAN signals may encounter obstacles or interference, affecting packet reception. Therefore, different studies have proposed using routing schemes to create multihop communication and improve LoRaWAN performance. The article has the following contributions: first, we present the main approaches to build multihop communication in LoRa networks. Second, we summarize different routing protocols proposed for the technology. Finally, we describe different challenges to improve the performance of routing protocols for LoRaWAN.",,,IEEE Communications Magazine,,,,2020-06-01,2020,,2020-06-01,58,6,72-76,Closed,Article,"Osorio, Alfonso; Calle, Maria; Soto, Jose D.; Candelo-Becerra, John E.","Osorio, Alfonso (Universidad del Norte in Barranquilla); Calle, Maria (Universidad del Norte in Barranquilla); Soto, Jose D.

We used aggregated choice models to estimate overall price, income, speed and frequency elasticities for urban public transport demand in the country. The model successfully accounts for unobservable information about attributes of alternative public transport modes. The results suggest high demand elasticities to price and frequency, while demand responds moderately to speed. We also find a negative income elasticity, which classifies public transport as an inferior good. Results provide relevant information for the current discussion about new transport systems in cities of developing countries, with a deeper understanding of the elements to consider in the design of public transport policies.","Declaration of Competing Interest On behalf of all authors, the corresponding author states that there is no conflict of interest.",,Research in Transportation Business & Management,,,,2020-09,2020,,2020-09,36,,100514,Closed,Article,"Toro-González, Daniel; Cantillo, Víctor; Cantillo-García, Víctor","Toro-González, Daniel (Universidad Tecnológica de Bolívar, Cartagena, Colombia); Cantillo, Víctor (Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); Cantillo-García, Víctor (Proyectos Técnicos Ltda., Barranquilla, Colombia)","Cantillo, Víctor (Universidad del Norte)","Toro-González, Daniel (Universidad Tecnológica de Bolívar); Cantillo, Víctor (Universidad del Norte); Cantillo-García, Víctor (Proyectos Técnicos Ltda., Barranquilla, Colombia)",24,10,,7.5,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1128673221,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3509 Transportation, Logistics and Supply Chains",11 Sustainable Cities and Communities

The traditional format for discrete choice experiments involves the use of text and images. However, there is a growing tendency for using tools that offer a more realistic representation of complex and dynamic attributes in discrete choice experiments. The Virtual Immersive Reality Environment (VIRE) emerges as a resource for a better understanding and presentation of variables that are difficult to understand using text-only experiments. Despite its advantages, VIRE experiments are costly and have additional complications in their practical use. This study aims to analyse the benefits of using VIRE in discrete choice modelling, comparing with the traditional text-only format with image surveys in two contexts. The first context considers the study of pedestrian behaviour when choosing alternatives for crossing an urban street. The second context deals with the behaviour of people during an emergency exit situation inside a covered sports arena. The results suggest that the assisted use of VIRE allows respondents to perceive environmental dynamics better than traditional choice experiments. VIRE adds realism and seems to improve a respondent's cognitive understanding of complex elements in the environment created by the modeller.","Declaration of competing interest The authors whose names are listed immediately below certify that they have NO affi liations with or involvement in any organization or entity with any fi nancial interest (such as honoraria; educational grants; participation in speakers’ bureaus; membership, employment, consultancies, stock ownership, or other equity interest; and expert testimony or patent-licensing arrangements), or non-fi nancial interest (such as personal or professional relationships, affi liations, knowledge or beliefs) in the subject matter or materials discussed in this manuscript.",,Journal of Choice Modelling,,,,2020-12,2020,,2020-12,37,,100251,Closed,Article,"Arellana, J.; Garzón, L.; Estrada, J.; Cantillo, V.","Arellana, J.

The designated land courts normally covers voluntary sales at the going market price at the time of dispossession, presuming buyers took advantage of the IDPs’ need for money and their low expectations of returning from their current sites of refuge. We study the rise and fall of a commercial cassava operation that started to buy land from IDPs openly in the Montes de María region on Colombia’s Caribbean coast after peace returned in 2007. After losing several land restitution court cases, the company shifted from dairy cattle that required high investments to the less demanding, but also less productive, buffalo to minimize losses in case of future successful restitution claims. The land restitution law will probably be extended beyond the initial 2021 limit due to slow progress, thereby perpetuating the insecure property rights situation that hinders investments in agriculture.",We thank the referees for very useful input.

This article identifies the barriers that people with disabilities face in their daily lives and in their surroundings. Using data from the 2017 National Discrimination Survey, we performed a multinomial logit regression model. Our results reveal that people in situations of disability are less likely to access social services and educational opportunities, and to participate fully in work; therefore, they are more prone to earn a lower income to cover their basic needs. One of the main barriers to these individuals is the design of the urban infrastructure, such as streets and sidewalks, and the lack of adequate urban transport, which facilitates or deters transportation. Similarly, our study indicates that this vulnerable group has difficulties covering expenses related to care, therapies, and treatments, so performing basic activities such as bathing, dressing, or eating is difficult for them. In addition, the findings indicate that they perceive economic insecurity and discrimination.

From specimens seasonally sampled during a 2‐year period, a histological study was performed in order to describe the gonad structure and stages of gonadal development for each species. The morphological structure of the gonad was similar in the three species, with sexual cells developing from the gonad wall towards its center. The three species were gonochoric and iteroparous, with asynchronous gamete maturation at population level; in all seasons, sexual maturity was evident in small to large individuals of each species (≥25 mm in total length for C. cumingsii and C. granosus , and ≥47 mm for C. magnificus ).","This study was funded by Fondo Nacional de Desarrollo Científico y Tecnológico (Project FONDECYT 1130266 granted to C.M.I. and J.S.).

To detect the ecological effects of a dam on genetic diversity, genetic structure, and their progress in time, two riverine fishes living upstream and downstream of an irrigation reservoir were studied at two periods after its construction in 2004 in central Chile.    Samples of the Neotropical silverside  Basilichthys microlepidotus  and the pencil catfish  Trichomycterus areolatus  were obtained 2 and 7 years after the Corrales Dam was built. The microsatellite DNA variability of both species upstream and downstream of the dam was analysed.    Fish analysed 2 years after dam construction did not show genetic differences between upstream and downstream populations; however, fish obtained 7 years after dam construction showed differences between populations above and below the dam and differences from individuals collected 5 years earlier.   The current effective population sizes of both species were smaller in samples obtained upstream than in samples obtained downstream. Simulations showed a migration equal to zero as most probable after reservoir construction, suggesting that the dam is an impermeable barrier to the movement of individuals of these species. These results showed that population fragmentation in time could be related to the barrier imposed by the dam.   In a scenario of no new contact between populations located upstream and downstream of the dam, the simulation predicts a reduction of genetic diversity ranging from 3.98 to 8.09% over the next 60 years.   Analyses suggest that the Corrales Reservoir may be affecting the evolutionary potential of the populations upstream and downstream from the dam.","ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS The authors thank Basal Grant PFB 023, ICM P05–002 and the Chilean Millennium Initiative, ESMOI.

We focus on the Bolivian presence in eight villages and camps involved in sulphur and borax mining. We present the entry periods of Bolivian workers, as well as their origin, trade and profession, gender, marital status, age, and literacy. Results give an account of the central role played by the Bolivian migrant labour force for the development of non-metallic and high-altitude mining industries in the region.

This study investigated the movement of two top predators: the Galapagos shark,  Carcharhinus galapagensis  , and the yellowtail amberjack,  Seriola lalandi  , in and around the Motu Motiro Hiva Marine Park (MMHMP) using MiniPAT satellite tags to determine the effectiveness of this MPA for the protection of these species.     The Galapagos sharks ( n = 4) spent most of their tag deployment periods inside the MMHMP. However, high intraspecific variability was observed in their movement dynamics. Daily individual maximum movements ranged from 17 to 58 km and the maximum distance from Salas y Gómez Island, the only emergent island within the MMHMP, ranged from 31 to 139 km.    The maximum linear distance travelled for a female juvenile Galapagos shark (152 cm total length) was 236 km, which is greater than the maximum distance previously documented for juveniles of this species (<50 km).    For the yellowtail amberjack ( n = 1), 91% of the satellite geolocations were within the MMHMP, with a maximum daily distance travelled of 6 km. The maximum distance travelled between points was 111 km and the maximum distance from Salas y Gómez Island was 62 km.    All archival tagged fish spent most of their time at depths of <50 m and never left the epipelagic zone. Daytime versus night‐time differences were pronounced in all individuals but showed high interindividual variability.   This study provides a baseline on the movement of these two top predators in the MMHMP and provides valuable insights for the creation of MPAs in the region and elsewhere.","ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS We would like to thank the Chilean Navy and the crew of the Cabo de Hornos, the Orca Diving Centre, Dr Pelayo Salinas de Leon and Loti Garcia for their help with fieldwork.

182,pub.1133745997,10.1093/mnras/staa3942,,,On ancient solar-type stars – II,"ABSTRACT
                  We report on the progress of our survey on ancient solar-type stars down to main-sequence effective temperatures Teff ≥ 5300 K and within 42 pc of the Sun. High signal-to-noise, high-resolution spectroscopy is presented for a second major subset of the Population II (τ ≥ 12 Gyr) and the intermediate-disc stars (τ ≃ 10 Gyr) within that volume. In conjunction with updates and the analyses of the single and composite sample spectra, we discuss evidence for new companions or candidates from their radial velocities, chromospheric activities, lithium and barium enrichments, and we also draw attention to related sources in the Gaia DR2 data. Among the Population II stars we note a substantial fraction of degenerates, mass transfer, and merger systems that possibly amount to about 20 per cent of that population, with inherently important consequences on the involved stellar ages and the baryonic mass budget. At the present stage, the survey has reached a two-thirds level of local volume-completeness. Key to that objective will be the forthcoming Gaia data, in terms of new companions, companion masses, and precision parallaxes from orbital solutions, in particular at the sample periphery, where many of the sources inevitably reside. In an appendix we describe a subset of about fifty a priori survey candidates, whose analyses discard them as Population I stars.","Based on observations with the MPG 2.2 m telescope at the European Organisation for Astronomical Research in the Southern Hemisphere under ESO programme 0100.A-9022(A) and data obtained from the ESO Science Archive Facility.

Identifying breeding sites and surveying abundance of immature phlebotomine sand flies in urban foci of leishmaniasis are useful tool to design new vector control strategies. The objective of this study was to describe the natural breeding sites of Lu. evansi in peridomiciliary vegetation in a peri-urban area of the Colombian Caribbean region. Between 2013 and 2015, 466 microhabitats were sampled, collecting 621 kg of soil samples. The explored microhabitats were bases and tree holes, fallen trees, animal caves, leaf litter, domestic animal shelters, and the inside of dwellings. The immature phlebotomines were recovered by direct search under the stereoscope and incubation of soil samples. In total, 103 microhabitats, associated with 17 arboreal species, were identified as natural breeding sites. Of 422 immature sandflies detected, 98.6% were found in soils at the base of the trees. Eight species of the genus Lutzomyia were identified, of which Lu. evansi (52.6%) was the most abundant, followed by Lu. rangeliana, Lu. cayennensis cayennensis, Lu. atroclavata, Lu. micropyga, Lu. trinidadensis, Lu. dubitans and Lu. gomezi. The arboreal species Cordia alba was the most used by phlebotomines for the development of their immature stages. From 63 natural breeding sites identified 268 immatures were recovered including 176 Lu. evansi. The accumulated precipitation showed correlation (R2 = 0.643, p = 0.013) with the abundance of developmental stages, which increased in September and October. The natural breeding sites of Lu. evansi exhibited a local pattern of occurrence dependent on rainfall. The physicochemical analysis of the soil samples showed that the natural sites for C. alba were categorized as fertile loam soils. This is the first systematic study that estimates the temporal variation of immature sand flies in peridomiciliary vegetation in a peri-urban focus of leishmaniasis in Colombia.","Administrative Department of Science, Technology and Innovation Colciencias – Colombia (code no. 537-2011).

Our data reveal a bimodal pattern for both species related with low precipitations and preference for forest habitat. Altitude, proximity to the forest, and the river were the variables that determine the hypervolume of the spatial distribution of relative abundance, where the overlap of these two species increases the risk of translocation and circulation of the etiological agent of leishmaniasis in sylvatic environments to rural-tourist-biosphere reserve areas and vice versa.

It affects doctors, patients and their inter-relationship. There is a lack of data on BOS in Mexico. The main objective of the present study is to evaluate the prevalence of BOS in physician members of the Mexican gastroenterological association (MGA) and Mexican association for gastrointestinal endoscopy (MAGE).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Cross sectional, prospective study through anonymous electronic survey via e-mail, sent to members of the MGA (n = 1192) and MAGE (n = 600). The survey included questions about basic sociodemographic information, Maslach Burnout Inventory, and factors potentially associated with BOS. Continuous variables were summarized as means and ANOVA or Kruskal-Wallis test were used to compare groups. Nominal variables were summarized as proportions and Fisher's exact test or Χ2 test were used, as appropriate.
RESULTS: A total of 1792 e-mail invitations were delivered and 411 answers were received with a response rate of 22.9%. The prevalence of BOS according to the Maslach Burnout Inventory was 26.3% (108/411). The prevalence of BOS according to the single-item self-defined burnout question (SISDBOQ) was 32.6% (134/411). The Kappa coefficient for emotional exhaustion between the SISDBOQ and Maslach inventory was 0.48 (p = 0.0001).

Characterization of sludge ash and mortars includes XRF, XRD, particle size distribution by laser diffraction, compressive strength, and SEM-EDS. The results show that SiO2, Al2O3, and Fe2O3 compose 90 % of the sludge ash, and it has potential pozzolanic activity. It is evidenced that there is a significant influence of the variable ratio of sludge ash:cement in the compressive strength of the mortar cubes over other variables. Overall, this study showed that the sludge ash could be considered as a viable and sustainable alternative for the construction sector. Despite the benefits of the suggested replacement, the presence of amorphous SiO2 requires a review of long-time chemical behavior.","Authors thank the Universidad del Norte in Barranquilla for allowing the use of their facilities, and special thanks to the company Saybolt de Colombia, for its collaboration in the execution of the characterization tests required for this investigation.","This research did not receive any specific grant from funding agencies in the public, commercial, or not-for-profit sectors.",Materials Today Communications,,,,2020-06,2020,,2020-06,23,,100930,Closed,Article,"González, Kevin Bohórquez; Pacheco, Emmanuel; Guzmán, Andrés; Pereira, Yoleimy Avila; Cuadro, Heidis Cano; Valencia, Javier A.F.","González, Kevin Bohórquez (Department of Chemical Engineering, Universidad del Atlántico, Carrera 30 N° 8- 49 Puerto Colombia, Atlántico, Colombia); Pacheco, Emmanuel (Department of Chemical Engineering, Universidad del Atlántico, Carrera 30 N° 8- 49 Puerto Colombia, Atlántico, Colombia); Guzmán, Andrés (Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Universidad del Norte, km 5 Vía Puerto Colombia, Área Metropolitana de Barranquilla, Colombia); Pereira, Yoleimy Avila (Instituto Superior Técnico, Universidade de Lisboa, Av.

In this paper, the feasibility of implementing SGE in hypersaline coastal lagoons is addressed, taking the coastal lagoon La Carbonera in Yucatan, Mexico, as an exemplary case. A realistic approach to the exploitation conditions and potential that could occur in a SGE plant in these ecosystems is presented. We first analyzed the variability of salinity and temperature in the three characteristic zones of the coastal lagoon and the correlation of these variables with atmospheric forcing. This was done using 1 year records of in situ measurements. Then the theoretical potential for SGE and the intra-annual variability of that potential were assessed considering the three possible harvesting configurations of mixing among fresh, sea, and hypersaline water. Results show that the thermohaline structure may vary significantly for the three locations at different time scales (diurnal to seasonal) depending on the tides, winds, air temperature, atmospheric pressure, and solar radiation. That suggests that the highest annual energy yield would be obtained from alternating throughout the year among the mixing configurations, depending on the specific seasonal thermohaline structure of the lagoon.",Part of this research was performed with grant from CONACYT-SENER-SUSTENTABILIDAD ENERGÉTICA project: FSE-2014-06-249795 “Centro Mexicano de Innovación en Energía del Océano (CEMIE Océano)”.

In our animal studies using Wistar rats, we observed the existence of two rat populations that exhibit differential physiological responses during hypoxic exposure. These rats were classified as hypoxia-induced hypertensive rats and nonhypertensive rats. A decrease in nitric oxide levels was reported in different hypertension models associated with increased concentrations of asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA) and homocysteine, and we recently described an increase in arginase type II expression under hypoxia. ADMA and homocysteine decrease nitric oxide (NO) bioavailability; however, whether ADMA and homocysteine have a regulatory effect on arginase activity and therefore regulate another NO synthesis pathway is unknown. Therefore, the aim of this study was to measure basal ADMA and homocysteine levels in hypoxia-induced hypertensive rats and evaluate their effect on arginase II activity. Our results indicate that hypoxia-induced hypertensive rats presented lower nitric oxide concentrations than nonhypertensive rats, associated with higher concentrations of homocysteine and ADMA. Hypoxia-induced hypertensive rats also presented lower dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase-2 and cystathionine β-synthase levels, which could explain the high ADMA and homocysteine levels. In addition, we observed that both homocysteine and ADMA had a significant effect on arginase II activation in the hypertensive rats. Therefore, we suggest that ADMA and homocysteine have dual regulatory effects on NO synthesis. The former has an inhibitory effect on eNOS, and the latter has a secondary activating effect on arginase II. We propose that arginase II is activated by AMDA and homocysteine in hypoxia-induced hypertensive rats.",We acknowledge CONICYT for a scientific research grant from FONDECYT (11075096).,,Hypertension Research,,,"Animals; Arginase; Arginine; Disease Models, Animal; Homocysteine; Hypertension; Hypoxia; Nitric Oxide; Rats; Rats, Wistar",2020-11-04,2020,2020-11-04,2021-03,44,3,263-275,Closed,Article,"López, Vasthi; Uribe, Elena; Moraga, Fernando A.","López, Vasthi (Departamento de Ciencias Biomédicas, Facultad de Medicina, Universidad Católica del Norte, Coquimbo, Chile); Uribe, Elena (Departamento de Bioquímica, Facultad de Ciencias Biológicas, Universidad de Concepción.

In this paper, the effect of base geometry on pile resistance is studied by performing a series of tests in a half-cylindrical calibration chamber that allows observation of the sand domain through the chamber symmetry plane during installation and loading. Two model piles, one with a flat base and one with a conical base with an apex angle of 60°, were installed and load-tested in dense and medium-dense sand samples. Digital images taken during the loading of the model piles were processed using the digital image correlation (DIC) technique. Detailed displacement and strain fields obtained with the DIC technique and base resistance measurements demonstrate that the addition of a conical base to a pile changes the deformation pattern in the sand below the base during loading. Furthermore, the base resistances of both the jacked and preinstalled model piles with a conical base were less than those for the piles with a flat base for the same conditions, with the corresponding ratio ranging from 0.64 to 0.78 at relative displacement levels less than or equal to 10% of the diameter B of the model pile and from 0.70 to 0.84 at greater relative displacements. The results have implications also for the use of cone resistance from the cone penetration test (CPT) in the pile base resistance estimation.","The first author is very grateful for the support provided by the Ministerio de Ciencias de Colombia—Minciencias and Fundacion para el Futuro de Colombia, Colfuturo.",,Journal of Geotechnical and Geoenvironmental Engineering,,,,2020-12-28,2020,2020-12-28,2021-03,147,3,04020180,Closed,Article,"Tovar-Valencia, Ruben D.; Galvis-Castro, Ayda; Salgado, Rodrigo; Prezzi, Monica","Tovar-Valencia, Ruben D.

Rich and dense fouling communities are known from floating objects in the HCS, but they have not been studied in the SPSG and it is not known which factors are influencing their richness and abundance. Here we present the first extensive study of rafting by marine invertebrates on floating anthropogenic debris in the eastern SPSG. We compared the effect of 9 raft-related categorical predictors on epibiont richness and fouling cover. Raft complexity was the most important predictor of richness. Fouling was dominated by thin crusts and biofilms, with more advanced communities only observed on few items. Fouling cover could not be predicted by any of the categorical factors tested. However, when tested as continuous predictors, raft volume and surface area were significantly correlated with both cover and richness. The most frequently encountered epibionts were common pelagic rafters, particularly Lepas spp., Planes spp., and Jellyella spp. Low fouling cover suggests that the SPSG's hyper-oligotrophic conditions strongly limit fouling growth, while the low frequency of coastal taxa points to the HCS/SPSG nutrient gradient acting as a filter for such organisms.","We would like to thank several collaborators for their help with species identification: Dennis Gordon (Bryozoa), Jan Beermann, José Manuel Guerra García, Andrea Desiderato and M.

Few studies have explored how urban infrastructure expansion affects the spatial connectivity of coastal ecosystems by provoking their fragmentation and loss. Here we explore changes in the spatial connectivity of coastal ecosystems due to urbanization, analyzing ecosystem extent and concatenation with urban infrastructures (shared perimeter) in four bays of the Coquimbo region of northern Chile (from 29°S to 32°S) as model systems. Increase in natural-to-urban concatenation patterns were observed in most urbanized bays; sandy beaches and wetlands were the habitats most connected with urban infrastructures like roads and coastal artificial defenses. Availability of ecosystem services is compromised by progressive loss of natural connectivity and poor governance structure, which seems to confer high vulnerability to urbanized bays with future urban expansion. Complementary actions are proposed to reduce the vulnerability of coastal urban systems, considering 1) investment in nature-based infrastructures for coastal defenses, 2) restoration-rehabilitation of natural (remnant) urban ecosystems and eco-engineering of current artificial infrastructures, focusing on reestablishment of biodiversity patterns and habitat connectivity, and 3) limitation of coastal town and village expansion. Management strategies can improve coastal adaptation to natural hazards, stabilizing changes in the natural-urban concatenation mosaic present in coastal urban systems like bays.","The project was financed by FONDECYT Grant # 1160223.

At the end of each trial, we assessed Critical Thermal maximum (CTmax) and minimum (CTmin) via self-righting success, calculated partial thermal tolerance polygons, measured somatic growth, determined transcription of Heat Shock Proteins 70 (HSP70) and measured oxygen consumption rates. Regardless of pCO2 level, HSP70 transcript levels were significantly higher in juveniles after exposure to extreme temperatures (10 °C and 25 °C) indicating physiological stress. Oxygen consumption rates increased with increasing temperature from 10 °C to 20 °C though showed a decrease at 25 °C. This rate was not affected by pCO2 or the interaction between temperature and pCO2. Juveniles exposed to present-day and near future pCO2 levels at 20 °C showed similar thermal tolerance polygonal areas; whilst changes in both CTmin and CTmax at 25 °C and 10 °C caused narrower and broader areas, respectively. Temperature affected growth, oxygen consumption and HSP70 transcription in small juvenile C. concholepas. Exposure to elevated pCO2 did not affect thermal tolerance, growth or oxygen consumption at temperatures within the thermal range normally experienced by this species in northern Chile (15-20 °C). At elevated pCO2 conditions, however, exposure to warmer (25 °C) or colder (10 °C) temperatures reduced or increased the thermal area, respectively. This study demonstrates the importance of examining the thermal-tolerance edges to better understand how OA and temperature will combine to physiologically challenge inter-tidal organisms.","This study was supported by the project ‘Climate driven Changes in the Habitat Suitability of Marine Organisms’ (CLIMAR, ELAC2015/T01-0495) financed by the Network of the European Union, Latin America and the Caribbean Countries on Joint Innovation and Research Activities.

In the late 1970s, the embryonic UK research community in molecular simulation – physicists and physical chemists – organised itself around CCP5, one of a set of Collaborative Computational Projects in different fields. CCP5 acted to develop and use the software required by an evolving and expanding scientific agenda, to exploit quickly and efficiently the revolution in computing hardware and to educate and nurture the careers of future generations of researchers in the field. This collaboration formally began in 1980, and is still fully active now, 40 years later. Today, molecular simulation techniques, many of them pioneered by CCP5, are now used very widely, including in several other CCPs in the UK’s current family of Collaborative Computational Projects. This article tells the story of molecular simulation in the UK, with CCP5 itself at centre stage, using the written records in the CCP archives.

They have been recognized in many places within the Central Andean backarc regions of Perú, Argentina, and Bolivia. In contrast, these structures have not been broadly studied in forearc regions. To understand the geometry and kinematics of this style of tectonism in a forearc setting related to Andean-type subduction zones, we used field and industrial 2D seismic data to study the Potrerillos thrust and fold belt and the Salar de Pedernales Basin in northern Chile (26°S). Our results indicate that the structure in this region consists of a dominantly east-verging contracting system composed of large basement thrusts, Mesozoic inverted normal faults, and shallow thrust-related folds. Large basement thrust ramps and imbricated wedges represent the most prominent basement structures, which accommodated major crustal shortening. Reactivated and tectonically inverted Mesozoic extensional structures also constitute an important structural component, especially beneath the Salar de Pedernales Basin. These exhibit asymmetrical inverted anticlines with arrowhead shapes on the hanging walls of the inverted normal faults. The subsidiary shallow thrust-related folds commonly display fault bend and propagation folds that primarily accommodated the shortening of the Mesozoic and Cenozoic stratified deposits overlying the basement thrusts and cored anticlines. The age of the contraction in this region is poorly constrained; however, many of the oldest sequences accumulated in the top of the syn-rift sequences and related to synorogenic deposits, can be correlated with those identified in neighboring regions (e.g., Salar de Atacama, Salar de Punta Negra basins and Frontal Cordillera, among others), which have reported Upper Cretaceous ages. Based on this stratigraphic correlation we suggest that orogenesis may have begun in the Late Cretaceous with basin inversion, and then continued during the Cenozoic with basement thrusting.","We thank ENAP-Sipetrol for providing the seismic data used in this study, as well as Nunns and Rogan for providing the license for the StructureSolver software used to model and restore the balanced cross-sections in this work.

325,pub.1125498760,10.1002/sd.2054,,,A dynamic sustainability framework for petroleum refinery projects with a life cycle attitude,"Abstract For developing countries, energy infrastructure projects are not only important from a political and strategic point of view, but they are also of major significance in terms of sustainability. Energy infrastructure projects have major impacts on all three pillars of sustainability, that is, social, economic, and environmental. Refinery projects can have an even bigger impact on all three pillars, in terms of magnitude and severity of the consequences. Therefore, it is important to introduce methods and solutions to improve the level of sustainability at which petroleum refinery projects are designed, constructed, and operated. Petroleum refinery projects are multidisciplinary, multiattribute, and multistakeholder projects and decisions in this regard are always difficult to make and unclear about sustainability in the life‐cycle of the project. To deal with these complexities, a dynamic sustainability assessment framework has been proposed in this study. In this framework, different petroleum refinery project's properties such as location, size, functions, stakeholders, products, environmental resiliency, and so on are considered in various life‐cycle phases and are used to come up with a customized framework. Accordingly, a hierarchy of the latest and the most suitable Multiple Criteria Decision Making methodologies are utilized for different decision‐making environments to realize the required dynamicity in these projects. The methods used here are Grey Weighted Aggregated Sum Product Assessment, Fuzzy Evaluation based on Distance from Average Solution, and Combinative Distance‐Based Assessment, each of which are proposed for different decision‐making levels. The proposed methodology is applied to a real petroleum refinery project as a case study. Based on the case study results, the economical pillar gets nearly 50% of the importance based on the project's specific situation. Also, health, atmosphere, and economic performance are the most important indicators among social, environmental, and economic pillars, respectively. At the lowest level, quantitative factors are also ranked and weighted. For instance, the frequency of labors' illness is the highest health factors in the social pillar of sustainability.",,,Sustainable Development,,,,2020-03-09,2020,2020-03-09,2020-09,28,5,1033-1048,Closed,Article,"Hasheminasab, Hamidreza; Gholipour, Yaghob; Kharrazi, Mohammadreza; Streimikiene, Dalia; Hashemkhani, Sarfaraz","Hasheminasab, Hamidreza (School of Civil Engineering, College of Engineering, University of Tehran, Tehran, Iran); Gholipour, Yaghob (Engineering Optimization Research Gr., College of Engineering, University of Tehran, Tehran, Iran); Kharrazi, Mohammadreza (Office of Sustainable Development, Amir Kabir University of Technology, Tehran, Iran); Streimikiene, Dalia (Laboratory of Complex Energy Research, Lithuanian Energy Institute, Kaunas, Lithuania); Hashemkhani, Sarfaraz (School of Engineering, Catholic University of the North, Coquimbo, Chile)","Streimikiene, Dalia (Lithuanian Energy Institute)","Hasheminasab, Hamidreza (University of Tehran); Gholipour, Yaghob (University of Tehran); Kharrazi, Mohammadreza (Amirkabir University of Technology); Streimikiene, Dalia (Lithuanian Energy Institute); Hashemkhani, Sarfaraz (Catholic University of the North)",10,5,,2.74,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1125498760,33 Built Environment and Design; 3302 Building,7 Affordable and Clean Energy

A secondary female treehopper has frequently been observed near a family (primary female guarding its egg clutch). Intraspecific brood parasitism, communal breeding or alloparental care may be suggested as possible mechanisms to explain secondary female presence. To distinguish between these phenomena, we performed relatedness analyses of genetic samples of groups including one A. grossa primary female, a secondary female and the associated offspring using polymorphic microsatellites. Furthermore, we characterized the behavioral interaction between both females during maternal care and the reproductive strategy (monandry or polyandry) of A. grossa females by estimating the number of male parents. We observed the presence of secondary females in 35.9% of monitored families. The behaviors characterized suggest the occurrence of brood parasitism in the interaction between both females. Nevertheless, all offspring within a family were descendants only of the primary female and a single male, thus showing that A. grossa females are monandrous. The results, taken together with data on the reproductive biology reported for other treehoppers, are consistent with the occurrence of brood parasitism in A. grossa.",We are indebted to Noemí Rojas-Hernández for her support and advice on DNA extraction and genetic analyses.

At a finer scale, the seasonal changes in seabird species composition in the current seabird assemblage was assessed to better understand the dynamics of the long‐term inferred patterns.   For Rapa Nui, the composition of the seabird assemblage between the prehistorical, historical, and current time has changed significantly. The most critical change, probably associated with human colonization, was observed between prehistoric and current times. The current diminished number of nesting seabird species was probably the result of local extirpation without evidence of colonization by new species.   For Motu Nui, changes in species composition were also followed by changes in trait structure, which were smaller than observed in Rapa Nui. This is probably due to the presence of a relatively high number of related species (i.e. Procellariids) with high similarities in their foraging behaviour.   The nesting seabird assemblages in Rapa Nui and Motu Nui differ in exposure to risk; thus, conservation strategies applied to the islands should be planned on a fine spatial scale. For Rapa Nui, which is an urban wildlife area with several invasive species and a low number of remaining native seabird species, management should focus on fencing and pets control. For Motu Nui, management should instead focus on the establishment of quarantine and other biosecurity tools to avoid both the entry and proliferation of new invasive species.","We are grateful to Pedro Lazo, Max Ika, and Erick and Tannia Ramírez for assistance in the field.

237,pub.1131390784,10.1111/jbi.13973,,,The role of island physiography and oceanographic factors in shaping species richness and turnover of nesting seabird assemblages on islands across the south‐eastern Pacific,"Abstract  Aim For seabirds, food supplies and nest sites are largely driven by oceanographic gradients and island habitats, respectively. Research into seabirds’ ecological roles in insular ecosystems is crucial to understanding processes that structure seabird nesting assemblages. We examined the influence of island physiography and oceanographic factors on the spatial variation in α‐ and β‐diversity of nesting seabird assemblages.   Location South‐eastern Pacific Ocean.   Taxon Birds.   Methods We compiled data from 53 seabirds breeding on 41 coastal and oceanic islands using different sources: our field records, online databases, environmental reports and literature. We used generalized linear models (GLM) to describe the effect of island physiography (area, elevation and isolation) and oceanographic factors (surface temperature, salinity and primary productivity) on seabird species richness (α‐diversity). We applied multivariate GLM to test the effects of physiographic and oceanographic predictors on species composition (β‐diversity). We used Jaccard dissimilarities on species occurrences per island to calculate β‐diversity partitioned into turnover and nestedness. Polynomial models allowed us to model these metrics against geographical and environmental gradients and so analyse patterns in seabird β‐diversity across spatial scales.   Results Species richness was highest in Galápagos, Pitcairn and Rapa Nui. Changes in seabird α‐diversity across islands were determined by island area and distance to South America but not by oceanographic variables. Physiographic and oceanographic factors were significant in determining β‐diversity. Changes in β‐diversity were mostly due to species replacement (β‐turnover) across three major island Systems (Galápagos Archipelago, Chilean coastal islands and oceanic islands of the south‐eastern Pacific). The contribution of β‐nestedness was restricted to small scales (within archipelagos).   Main conclusions Physiographic and oceanographic factors explain species diversity of seabird assemblages on islands of the south‐eastern Pacific. Oceanographic variables did not affect species richness but significantly influenced species composition. Change in species composition reflects gradients across three marine biogeographical realms: Temperate South, Eastern Indo‐Pacific and Tropical Eastern Pacific. The low degree of species nestedness may reflect multiple evolutionary origins.",This study was funded by the Millennium Nucleus for Ecology and Sustainable Management of Oceanic Islands ESMOI.

It has become a focal point for memorials and annual commemorations. Few South Africans know anything else about the school. This paper argues that, while the school did in fact play an important role in the Uprising, it has a longer and possibly more important history as an educational institution catering to often extremely poor, working class families in the heart of Soweto. I discuss Morris Isaacson in historical memory, including an analysis of the filming of Sarafina! and conclude that in educational terms, Morris Isaacson has been much neglected.

One argument that this paper makes is that the politics of archival repatriation and preservation are linked intrinsically to broader questions of South African politics and historiography. There is however an underlying point of more general significance. An acute awareness about the making of any archival collection is essential, particularly in the context of the highly contested and controversial field of South African liberation politics. In this context, the author argues that most heritage sites and monuments erected in the post-apartheid South Africa are a reflection and celebration of ANC history and heritage. Considering this, it is possible for individuals to conclude that the repatriation of the BCM consignment to Fort Hare is of no significance and that no lessons can be drawn from this experience. Yet, the BCM experience is equally important in further understanding the nuances and challenges of the repatriation of archival material.",,,South African Historical Journal,,,,2020-07-02,2020,2020-10-21,2020-07-02,72,3,470-494,Closed,Article,"Maaba, Brown Bavusile","Maaba, Brown Bavusile (University of Johannesburg)","Maaba, Brown Bavusile (University of Johannesburg)","Maaba, Brown Bavusile (University of Johannesburg)",0,0,,0.0,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1131954330,"43 History, Heritage and Archaeology; 4302 Heritage, Archive and Museum Studies",

Petrographic and lithological characteristics allow us to identify three main lithostratigraphic units at La Poruña scoria cone. The first unit consists of agglutinated lapilli, spatter beds, and clastogenic lavas that are related to the construction of the cone. The other two units are associated with a lava flow field and consist of flow of andesitic composition, which differ both in their degree of weathering and in their development of channel, surface, and internal structures (e.g., levées, ogives, and joints). With these lithostratigraphic analyses, we interpret that the construction of La Poruña occurred during four main eruption phases involving Strombolian, Hawaiian, and transitional eruptive styles. Furthermore, differences in the degree of erosion, alteration, and weathering of the lithostratigraphic units in the lava field of La Poruña suggest that this flow field was formed during two eruptive events. The excellent outcrop conditions and preservation state of the volcanic products of La Poruña allow new stratigraphic insights that advance the wider and more general understanding and the dynamics of this important type of volcanism and the potential hazards of a scoria cone eruption. The polycyclic style of the eruption needs to be included in the hazards assessment of these centers type, especially when the cone is associated with structures that can be reactivated. This process could correspond to a second phase of activity, involving ash fall, bomb, and lava emission.","Valuable and constructive comments by Dr. Scott Rowland, an anonymous reviewer and, especially, editor Dr. Hannah Dietrich helped to improve the manuscript, and Dr. Andrew Harris for your important input and comments.

It introduced innovative measures including a mandatory front-of-pack nutrition labelling scheme for food products high in sodium, free sugars, fats, and calories, and strict advertising and marketing restrictions of unhealthy foods to children under 14 years of age. However, food-exporting countries have questioned the lawfulness of these measures in the context of the World Trade Organization’s Technical Barriers to Trade Committee, and multinational food companies have filed several complaints before Chilean courts challenging their implementation.

It is situated at 3,554 m a.s.l., on the top of the Cordón de Tujle ridge forming a north-south striking morphological element in the Central Volcanic Zone of the Andes, in northern Chile. The material erupted at Cerro Tujle lies over the Tucúcaro Ignimbrite (3.2 ± 0.3 Ma), covering the whole area. The origin of the magma source, as well as the evolution and control of the volcanic eruptive styles, were determined by fieldwork, stratigraphic, morphometric, textural (density and vesicularity), petrographic, and geochemical analyses. The Cerro Tujle maar features an elliptical crater (333 × 279 m wide in east-west and north-south directions, respectively) surrounded by lava flow and tephra deposits. The total Dense Rock Equivalent volume of the products was calculated in 1.53 × 105 m3, and mainly correspond to andesites (58.62–59.80 wt% of SiO2). The lava flow can be categorized in at least two types: i) brown-red and green-to-gray andesites located on the north-northwestern flank of the crater, and ii) black andesites with felsic rock clasts distributed around the crater underlying the other lavas. In contrast, the pyroclastic deposit displays breccias of juvenile pyroclasts with xenoliths of rhyolitic composition. These felsic clasts suggest magma assimilation with a shallow magma reservoir during a relatively fast ascent of the magma. This is evidenced by disequilibrium textures in mineral levels, such as reaction rim, and skeletal and sieve textures of the phenocrysts. The field evidence and results of the different analyses suggest a change in the eruptive style from effusive to explosive. This transition is associated with a decrease of the magma flux and a withdrawal of magma below the groundwater table, which has produced a phreatomagmatic eruption by magma-water interaction.","The authors wish to thank the Collaborative Research Center 1211–Earth Evolution at the Dry Limit and Dr. Eduardo Campos who provided the vehicle used during fieldwork.

The survey assessed demographics, academic variables, and several mental health scales and indexes, including: World Health Organization Well-being Index, Satisfaction With Life Scale, Family APGAR (Adaptability, Partnership, Growth, Affection, and Resolve), Self-Reporting Questionnaire, Athens Insomnia Scale, Eating Attitudes Test, and Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test. Sexual orientation was assessed using self-identification and responses dichotomized as heterosexual and non-heterosexual. Findings: 554 students completed the survey (response rate: 70%). Mean age was 20.6 years, and the sample was 58.7% women. Eighty-two participants (14.8%) self-identified as non-heterosexual; this group comprised mostly males, fewer of whom lived with their family, and more of whom used loans or scholarships to pay university tuition fees. After adjustment for sex and tuition fee payment, non-heterosexual orientation was significantly associated (adjusted Odds Ratios [aOR] above 3.00) with rating mental health as bad, self-perceiving a need for mental health evaluation/treatment, and reporting last-year use of psychiatric medication. Lastly, non-heterosexual respondents reported more frequent psychiatric symptoms (depression/anxiety scores, suicidal ideation, eating disorder symptoms and substance use) with an aOR between 2.17 and 2.51. Insights: This study suggests that self-identified non-heterosexual medical students exhibit worse mental health outcomes evaluated through validated self-report scales and subjective perception of mental health status. This report specifically indicates that non-heterosexual medical students report family dysfunction more often and have less social support, which serve as additional risk factors. Future studies must assess social support, clarify the impact of family and peer support in mental health problems, and explore students' views on their sexual identity and the burden imposed by experiences of discrimination.",,,Teaching and Learning in Medicine,,,"Adult; Colombia; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Humans; Male; Mental Disorders; Mental Health; Quality of Life; Self Concept; Sexual Behavior; Sexual and Gender Minorities; Students, Medical; Substance-Related Disorders; Young Adult",2020-08-28,2020,2020-08-28,2021-01-01,33,1,1-9,Closed,Article,"Suárez, Daniel E.; Cardozo, Andres C.; Villarreal, Miguel E.; Trujillo, Elena M.","Suárez, Daniel E.

To analyse the significant aspects of the accident rate of motorcyclists in Colombia from 2016 to 2018 and estimate cost social value of motorcycle-related deaths. The global numbers of fatalities and injuries were compared to the Colombian context. Descriptive and inferential statistics were conducted to explore the association of fatal trauma and motorcycle accidents. P values and odds ratios were calculated. Bogotá, Cali, and Medellín were the cities with the most accidents. The month, day, time, age of the victims, and climatic conditions had a statistically significant association with the fatal trauma. Most victims were between the ages of 20-29 years. Motorcycles were involved in more than 60% of accidents. The social cost of a life lost in a motorcycle accident was estimated at $2,418 million Colombian pesos (725,400 USD) per year.

                  The thermomechanical modeling of a sleeve rehabilitation system for pressure pipes is studied including temperature effect on system behavior. The rehabilitation system consists of a multicylinder axisymmetric layer system, with an intermediate layer of epoxy resins and two outer steel covers that are longitudinally welded forming a sleeve. The analysis is conducted over several stages; initially, the incidence of temperature on the rigidity of three types of resins currently available on the market is experimentally evaluated. Then, nonlinear relationships between rigidity and temperature are established from the evaluation of the resins, which are typical of an inhomogeneous material. The resins exhibit a significant loss of rigidity with temperature, generating a risk of delamination that could drastically reduce the effectiveness of the rehabilitation system in the event of possible temperature rises. An analytical model was developed to calculate contact pressures between the resin layer and the external sleeve, internal pipeline displacements, stresses, and deformations. Finally, contour plots were developed for different temperature, pressure levels, and pipe thickness as a graphics tool to predict pipeline failure due to plastic deformation or rupture.",,,Journal of Pressure Vessel Technology,,,,2020-08-05,2020,2020-08-05,2020-12-01,142,6,,Closed,Article,"Pérez, José David; Maury, Heriberto; Bris, Jorge; Ojeda, Marianella","Pérez, José David (Mechanical Engineering Department, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla 081007, Colombia); Maury, Heriberto (Mechanical Engineering Department, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla 081007, Colombia); Bris, Jorge (Mechanical Engineering Department, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla 081007, Colombia); Ojeda, Marianella (Promigas S.A.

However, most of the research in this area has focused on Recycling, Recovering and final disposal. Strategies for lifespan extension such as Reuse, Repair, Refurbish, Remanufacture and Repurpose lead to higher circularity and value throughout the lifecycle but are less studied. Here we propose a single generic indicator based on durability and environmental footprint for material selection as an early step in the design process towards extending product lifespan. The material durability indicator or MDI integrates into a single calculation chemical and mechanical durability, together with environmental impacts associated with the material. The proposed indicator incorporates parameters such as flammability resistance, resistance to ultraviolet radiation, resistance to water, resistance to organic solvents, mechanical strength, energy consumption, and carbon footprint, among others. A case study based on polymer materials selection demonstrates the usefulness of the MDI indicator, providing a holistic calculation and comparison of selection alternatives, including conventional and multicriteria approaches. The proposed indicator offers a balanced and technical measurement of durability and environmental burdens in the material selection process and can potentially be applied to any engineering material.",This work was supported by COLCIENCIAS through the Ph.D. National Scholarship Program No 617-2.

1416,pub.1127475278,10.1007/s10236-020-01377-1,,,Interannual variability of wave climate in the Caribbean Sea,"Low-frequency interannual climatic oscillations have been reported to influence the precipitation regimes, river discharges, winds, and sea level in the Caribbean Sea. Here, we analyzed the presence and relevance of low-frequency oscillations in the waves’ climate of the Caribbean Sea using data from WAVEWATCH III (NOAA) reanalysis and applying frequency domain wavelet transform technique. Results show a clear sectorization of the Caribbean Sea according to the presence and relevance of interannual oscillations in wave climate, where the southwestern region (Colombian basin) exhibits a larger number of statistically significant oscillations (at 95% confidence levels) with recurrence periods of 2–4, 4–8, and 8–12 years. Only some of these frequencies are observed in the rest of Caribbean basin. Two climatic events occurring in the periods 1997–1998 and 2010–2011 stand out in the study zone for their high energy in wavelet analysis. These events have been associated with the occurrence of the warm and cold phases of the El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO), respectively, and are well known due to their strong global effects on hydroclimatology. Thus, an additional analysis was performed in the time domain to investigate the effect of the two events on Caribbean Sea waves. The results revealed an influence of ENSO on significant wave height and peak period comparing with multi-year average conditions, producing highly variable spatial and temporal wave patterns, with more evident effects during the cold phase of ENSO (La Niña). These results confirm the sectorization of the Caribbean Sea regarding the energy and interannual variability of waves.",,,Ocean Dynamics,,,,2020-05-09,2020,2020-05-09,2020-07,70,7,965-976,Closed,Article,"Vega, Marco J.; Alvarez-Silva, Oscar; Restrepo, Juan C.; Ortiz, Juan C.; Otero, Luis J.","Vega, Marco J.

Although much research has been dedicated to understanding the impact of secondary task demands or specific road traffic environments on driving performance, there is little information on how drivers adapt their behaviour to their combined presence. This paper aims to describe driver behaviour while negotiating different sources of task complexity, including mobile phone use while driving (i.e., calling and texting) and different road environments (i.e., straight segments, curves, hills, tunnels, and curves on hills). A driving simulator experiment was conducted to explore the effects of different road scenarios and different types of distraction while driving. The collected data was used to estimate driving behaviour through a Generalized Linear Mixed Model (GLMM) with repeated measures. The analysis was divided into two phases. Phase one aimed to evaluate driver performance under the presence and absence of pedestrians and oncoming traffic, different lanes width and different types of distraction. The second phase analysed driver behaviour when driving through different road geometries and lane widths and under different types of distraction. The results of the experiment indicated that drivers are likely to overcorrect position in the vehicle lane in the presence of pedestrians and oncoming traffic. The effect of road geometry on driver behaviour was found to be greater than the effect of mobile phone distraction. Curved roads and hills were found to influence preferred speeds and lateral position the most. The results of this investigation also show that drivers under visual-manual distraction had a higher standard deviation of speed and lateral position compared to the cognitive distraction and the non-distraction condition.","We want to acknowledge the assistance of Dr. Md.

Blurring and point sources make this inverse problem harder to solve. The conventional approach requires in a first step to identify and mask the point sources. Instead we model all astrophysical components in a single Poisson generalized linear model. To enforce sparsity on the parameters, maximum likelihood estimation is regularized with two penalties with weights λ 1 for the radial emissivity and λ 2 for the point sources. The method has the advantage of not employing cross-validation to select λ 1 and λ 2. To judge the significance of interesting features, we quantify uncertainty with the bootstrap. We apply our method to two X-ray telescopes (XMM-Newton and Chandra) data to estimate gas emissivity. The results are more stable and seems less biased than the conventional method, in particular in the outskirt of galaxy clusters.

Although previous studies have offered evidences of reliability and validity for the BYNDS scores, results are not conclusive as regards its factor structure. The aim of this research was to assess the factor structure of the BYNDS via Confirmatory Factor Analyses (CFA). The BYNDS was administered to a sample of 832 drivers aged from 18 to 25 years (Argentina = 270, Colombia = 350, and Mexico = 212). Six models were examined: three derived from previous literature, one emerged from an exploratory factor analysis, a unidimensional model, and a bifactor model. Results showed that none of the models analysed offered a completely acceptable fit to the data. However, the original model hypothesizing five orthogonal factors showed the best fit indices, with all of the items loading onto the associated factor. Results of the bifactor analysis suggested that three of the subscales (transient violations, fixed violations, and misjudgements) share a strong common basis and their scores would not offer much information above and beyond the total score. On the contrary, the items in the subscale of risk-exposure are clearly influenced by a specific domain factor, contributing to the multidimensionality of the BYNDS. In line with previous studies, males scored higher than females in driving violations, fixed violations, and risk-exposure. This study contributes to the psychometric refinement of a novel measure of risky driving in youth population. This self-report could be a valuable tool in the evaluation of road safety performance.","Our research is supported by the Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Científicas y Técnicas (CONICET - Argentina), the Center for Transdisciplinary Research in Psychology (Mexico), Research Institute on Traffic and Road Safety (Universitat de València) and the Centre for Accident Research and Road Safety-Queensland (CARRS-Q).

However, the mechanisms by which this occurs are still poorly understood. The role of root fungal endophytes in nitrogen mineralization and nutrient uptake, as well as their impact on the performance of Antarctic plants, were studied. We tested root endophytes, isolated from Colobanthus quitensis and Deschampsia antarctica, for lignocellulolytic enzyme production, nitrogen mineralization, and growth enhancement of their host plants. Penicillium chrysogenum and Penicillium brevicompactum were identified using a molecular approach as the main root endophytes inhabiting C. quitensis and D. antarctica, respectively. Both root endophytes were characterized as psychrophilic fungi displaying amylase, esterase, protease, cellulase, hemicellulase, phosphatase and urease enzymatic activities, mainly at 4 °C. Moreover, the rates and percentages of nitrogen mineralization, as well as the final total biomass, were significantly higher in symbiotic C. quitensis and D. antarctica individuals. Our findings suggest that root endophytes exert a pivotal ecological role based not only to breakdown different nutrient sources but also on accelerating nitrogen mineralization, improving nutrient acquisition, and therefore promoting plant growth in Antarctic terrestrial ecosystems.","We thank Chilean Antarctic Institute (INACH), the Chilean Navy (AP-41 “Aquiles” and AP-46 “Almirante Oscar Viel&quot;), and the Arctowski Polish Antarctic Station for their logistical support.

Transport models are prone to this problem and applications that properly correct for it are scarce. This paper focuses on how to address this issue in the case of strategic urban mode choice models (i.e., the third stage of classic strategic transport models), possibly the main tool for the assessment of costly transport projects. To address this problem, we propose and validate, for the first time, adequate instruments that may be obtained from data that is already available in this context. The proposed method is implemented using the Control Function approach, which we use to detect and correct for endogeneity in a case study in Valparaiso, Chile. The effects arising from the neglected endogeneity in this case study reflect on an overestimation between 26–49% of the subjective value of time and an underestimation of 33–75% of modal elasticities.","The authors would like to thank SECTRA (Secretaría de Planificación de Transporte de Chile) and, in particular Alan Thomas, for the provision of the real data used in the study.

However, its use can also involve many risks. Examples include mobile devices, digital cameras and video surveillance cameras, which offer excellent performance and generate a large number of images and video. These files are generally shared on social platforms and are exposed to any manipulation, compromising their authenticity and integrity. In a legal process, a manipulated video can provide the necessary elements to accuse an innocent person of a crime or to exempt a guilty person from criminal acts. Therefore, it is essential to create robust forensic methods, which will strengthen the justice administration systems and thus make fair decisions. This paper presents a novel forensic technique to detect the post-processing of digital videos with MP4, MOV and 3GP formats. Concretely, detect the social platform and editing program used to execute possible manipulation attacks. The proposed method is focused on supervised machine learning techniques. To achieve our goal, we take advantage that the social platforms and editing programs, execute filtering and compression processes on the videos when they are shared or manipulated. The result of these transformations leaves a characteristic pattern in the videos that allow us to detect the social platform or editing program efficiently. Three phases are involved in the method: 1) Dataset preparation; 2) data features extraction; 3) Supervised model creation. To evaluate the scalability of the technique in real scenarios, we used a robust, heterogeneous and far superior dataset than that used in the literature.",This project has received funding from the European Unions Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under grant agreement No. 700326.

Existing literature is scattered and does not allow us to clearly conclude what characteristics this technological acceptance has as well as its main progress. The study aimed to provide an overview of the scientific literature on the application of TAM in the study of the acceptance and technological use of Moodle through a Systematic Mapping Study (SMS). Results from 24 selected studies indicate that the topic is of increasing interest and that the literature is characterized by studies that 1) use extended versions of TAM; 2) are based on university students from different programs; 3) take place in Europe or Asia; 4) are published in journals with different impact factors; and 5) have focused on testing mainly the original TAM hypotheses. Although a lot of hypotheses have been studied (271), only 16 have been accepted more times than rejected by 2 or more studies, with Perceived Ease of Use being the most commonly present construct in the hypotheses.

The instrumental techniques used included X‐ray elemental and mineralogical chemical analysis, Raman spectroscopy, and scanning and light microscopy. The results indicate there are several clay types, although they show similarities, such as the use of a plant‐based temper. The red colour of the decoration is hematite, and manganese oxides such as jacobsite are present in the black. The white colour is a mixture of gypsum and clay, and the orange is a mixture of hematite and clay. The use of colours, the quality of the clays and the temperatures reached during pottery firing point to expertise in ceramic production and to complex decision‐making processes. The multi‐elemental archaeometric approach documented here could become an important tool to shed a light on ancient ceramic technology and the internal variance of Tiwanaku pottery.","The authors thank the Alfred Kordelin Foundation (Finland) for financing this study.

However, two vascular plant species (Deschampsia antarctica and Colobanthus quitensis) have been able to colonize this hostile environment. Although it has been proposed that C. quitensis possesses tolerance mechanisms and adaptations allowing survival and growth under such stressful conditions, the underlying molecular/transcriptional mechanisms are currently unknown. Furthermore, the impact of global warming on the endophytic and epiphytic organisms associated with C. quitensis remains unclear. Here, a metatranscriptomic approach was used to determine the effect of an in situ simulated global warming scenario on C. quitensis plants. We found a large number of differentially expressed genes successfully annotated (2,997), suggesting that climate change modulates the metatranscriptome of C. quitensis plants and associated endophytes and epiphytes. Interestingly, 50.5% and 26.8% of up- and down-regulated genes, respectively, are from non-plant species (putative endophytic and epiphytic organisms, such as fungi). Interestingly, Gene Ontology analysis pointed out several biological processes differentially enriched in non-plant microorganisms associated with C. quitensis grown in a simulated global warming scenario. Taken together, these results suggest that climatic drivers are shaping plant-microorganism interactions, and that endophytes/epiphytes may play crucial roles in plant adaptation to extreme environmental conditions.","We thank Instituto Antártico Chileno (INACH), the Chilean Navy and the Polish Academy of Sciences for logistics and field support.

A systematic review methodology was employed comprised of review protocol, requirements for study selection, and analysis of paper classification. The review aims to answer the following research questions: (1) what techniques are currently used to predict student retention rates, (2) which techniques have shown better performance under specific contexts?, (3) which factors influence the prediction of completion rates in higher education?, and (4) what are the challenges with predicting student retention? Increasing student retention in higher education is critical in order to increase graduation rates. Further, predicting student retention provides insight into opportunities for intentional student advising. The review provides a research perspective related to predicting student retention using machine learning through several key findings such as the identification of the factors utilized in past studies and methodologies used for prediction.

These fans record the episodic sedimentological behaviour of the hillslope response to rainstorm events within tributary catchments, together with the influence on the main fluvial systems. In this paper, we benefit from the March 2015 event (23–26 March 2015), which produced 75–46 mm of precipitation over four days in the southern portion of the Atacama Desert. This storm event triggered several debris flows in El Huasco River watershed tributaries and, therefore, tributary-junction alluvial fans received a total of ∼106 m
                    3
                    of sediments across 49 activated catchments. We find that the characteristic storm signature across the catchments can be synthetised in a conceptual fan formation model based on field mapping of facies (F1 to F6) present in the fans. The characteristic signature is a record of initially high sediment-to-water flows restricted to the fan environments (mainly debris flows) followed by later, more dilute (mainly hyper-concentrated to fluvial) flows that incise the tributary-junction alluvial fan deposits and link tributary catchments with the main river. These later-stage flood event deposits, locally, are capable of ponding and compartmentalising the main river where the longitudinal connectivity of the tributary-junction catchment is effective. This situation improves tributary-junction fan slope and main-trunk-channel linkages. This approach provides a reference framework for understanding the distribution and routing of effective runoff from similar rainfall events that control the aggradation and incision of the fluvial system, which is of great value when studying past stratigraphic arrangements in these arid alleys.",,,Progress in Physical Geography Earth and Environment,,,,2020-01-24,2020,2020-01-24,2020-10,44,5,679-699,Closed,Article,"Cabré, Albert; Aguilar, Germán; Mather, Anne E.; Fredes, Víctor; Riquelme, Rodrigo","Cabré, Albert (Departamento de Ciencias Geológicas, Universidad Católica del Norte, Chile); Aguilar, Germán (Advanced Mining Technology Center, Universidad de Chile, Chile); Mather, Anne E.

Employing an in-depth qualitative research approach, 32 traditional and community development leaders as well as local government officials were interviewed to ascertain local the present community development paradigms and proposed future pathways. Drawing from local insights and a range of scholarly perspectives this paper assessed how meaningful indigenous knowledge systems and indigenous people can actively engage and sustain community-driven development programmes. Utilizing a process analysis, the paper, established that there is a disconnect between indigenous community knowledge systems, values, norms and other cultural realities and contemporary participatory community development approaches. It further illustrates, the absence of local participation in community development and proposed a framework for the integration of indigenous knowledge systems, institutions and other cultural realities in community-based development programmes to ensure development sustainability.",,,Journal of Asian and African Studies,,,,2020-12-20,2020,2020-12-20,2021-11,56,7,1658-1677,Closed,Article,"Boadu, Evans Sakyi; Ile, Isioma; Oduro, Madonna Yaa","Boadu, Evans Sakyi (); Ile, Isioma (School of Government, University of the Western Cape, South Africa); Oduro, Madonna Yaa (Global Communities, Ghana)","Boadu, Evans Sakyi ()","Boadu, Evans Sakyi (); Ile, Isioma (University of the Western Cape); Oduro, Madonna Yaa (Global Communities, Ghana)",13,8,,7.8,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1133749348,44 Human Society; 4404 Development Studies,11 Sustainable Cities and Communities

En ese sentido, el objetivo del estudio fue traducir al español, evaluar la estructura factorial, confiabilidad e invariancia factorial con respecto al género del Dimensions of Anger Reactions (DAR-5), así como examinar la validez convergente y discriminante del DAR-5 con base en sus correlaciones con otra medida de propensión a la ira, bienestar, atención plena y ansiedad en estudiantes universitarios. Material y método Se realizó un análisis factorial confirmatorio para explorar la estructura interna de la escala y un análisis factorial multigrupo para probar la invariancia a través de género en una muestra de 420 estudiantes universitarios (M edad = 21.14, DT = 3.01) que contestaron las siguientes escalas: el DAR-5, Escala de propensión a la ira de García (APS-G), Mindful Attention Awareness Scale (MAAS-5), Satisfaction with Life Scale (SWLS) y Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale-2 (GAD-2). Resultados Los resultados indicaron que el DAR-5 es un instrumento esencialmente unidimensional y que proporcionan puntajes precisos (ω = .86 para la muestra total, ω = .87 para la submuestra de mujeres y ω = .86 para la submuestra de hombres). Se comprobó la invarianza configural, métrica y escalar del DAR-5, lo que lleva a asumir que mide el mismo constructo en hombres y mujeres. Asimismo, elevados niveles de ira se asociaron con una mayor ansiedad generalizada y una disminución de la satisfacción con la vida y la atención plena. Conclusión El DAR-5 es una medida de ira confiable, válida e invariante entre los estudiantes universitarios y puede recomendarse como un indicador de ajuste psicológico en esta población. Introduction and objectives Anger is related to mental and physical health, so its evaluation is important for many health sciences where anger management interventions have been implemented. In this sense, the objective of the study was to translate into Spanish, evaluate the factor structure, reliability and factor invariance regarding the gender of the Dimensions of Anger Reactions (DAR-5), as well as examine the convergent and discriminant validity of DAR-5 based on its correlations with another measure of anger propensity, well-being, mindfulness, and anxiety in college students. Material and method A confirmatory factor analysis was performed to explore the internal structure of the scale and a multigroup factor analysis to test the invariance through gender in a sample of 420 university students (Mage = 21.14, DT = 3.01) who answered the following scales: DAR-5, Garcia's Anger Propensity Scale (APS-G), Mindful Attention Awareness Scale (MAAS-5), Satisfaction with Life Scale (SWLS), and Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale-2 (GAD-2). Results The results indicated that the DAR-5 is an essentially one-dimensional instrument and that it provides precise scores (ω = .86 for the total sample, ω = .87 for the subsample of women and ω = .86 for the subsample of men). The configurational, metric and scalar invariance of the DAR-5 was verified, which leads to the assumption that it measures the same construct in men and women. Likewise, elevated levels of anger were associated with increased generalized anxiety and decreased life satisfaction and mindfulness. Conclusions The DAR-5 is a reliable, valid and invariant measure of anger among university students and can be recommended as an indicator of psychological adjustment in this population.",,,Ansiedad y Estrés,,,,2020-07,2020,,2020-07,26,2-3,120-128,Closed,Article,"Caycho-Rodríguez, Tomás; Cabrera-Orosco, Isabel; Barboza-Palomino, Miguel; Ventura-León, José; Gallegos, Walter L.

Through 35 oceanographic campaigns conducted between January 2015 and April 2016 in the Humboldt EBUS (23°S), intraseasonal (i.e., daily‐to‐bimonthly) hydrographic variations and nearshore changes in surface carbonates system were assessed during the 2015 El Niño event. Collected hydrographic and carbonates system data (sea surface temperature (SST), subsurface temperature, salinity, oxygen, chlorophyll a , pH, total alkalinity ( A  T  ) and p CO 2 ), were analyzed and interpreted considering local (i.e., satellite winds and tide gauge sea level) and remote (i.e., equatorial Kelvin waves) forcing. Permanent alongshore wind conditions prompted a relatively deep mixed layer favoring elevated acidity (7.8–7.9 pH T ) and CO 2 saturated (>450 μatm) conditions throughout most of the study period. Between austral summer‐fall and fall‐winter transitions, intermittent warm events increased water temperature (SST) above the long‐term climatological state (2000–2010), and gave rise to high acidity‐warm conditions. However, despite warm water particularly high in salinity (>35) and A  T  (>2,300 μmol kg −1 ) associated with downwelling Kelvin waves activity observed during the developing phase of the 2015 El Niño event, phytoplankton production and CO 2 uptake were favored because of the maintenance of mean upwelling conditions. These results are discussed in terms of data limitations, coastal processes adding variability to carbonates system variability, and requirements for a better understanding of hydrographic forcing and responses in the Humboldt EBUS. 
Plain Language Summary  Little is known of the El Niño‐related variations affecting the CO 2 fluxes in productive upwelling ecosystems. Through 35 oceanographic campaigns conducted between 2015 and April 2016 in a Humboldt upwelling system (23°S), we evaluated daily‐to‐bimonthly hydrographic variations and coastal changes in the carbonates system during the 2015 El Niño event. Collected hydrographic and carbonates system data were analyzed and interpreted considering local (i.e., satellite winds and tide gauge sea level) and remote (i.e., equatorial Kelvin waves) forcing. Wind mixed the upper layer, favoring elevated acidity (7.8–7.9 pH) and CO 2 saturated (>450 μatm) levels in the surface layer during most of the study period. Between austral summer‐fall and fall‐winter transitions, intermittent warm events increased water temperature above the long‐term climatological state (2000–2010), and gave rise to high acidity‐warm conditions. However, despite the developing El Niño conditions yielding to surface waters particularly high in salinity (>35) and alkalinity (>2,300 μmol kg −1 ), phytoplankton production and CO 2 uptake were favored due to persistent mean upwelling conditions. We discussed limitations of our approach and how our study can contribute to a better understanding of hydrographic forcing and responses in productive upwelling ecosystems. 
Key Points     Low temperature and pH, and CO 2 −saturated water was continuously found in the nearshore system despite the developing strong El Niño    Intraseasonal hydrographic variations during the 2015 El Niño event significantly shifted physical‐chemical drivers of coastal upwelling    El Niño‐induced warming overlapped high acidity background conditions favoring the biological regulation of pH and p CO 2 levels","Conflict of Interest All authors declare no competing interests.

203,pub.1131431628,10.1016/j.enbuild.2020.110531,,,The shading effects of Green Infrastructure in private residential areas: Building Performance Simulation to support urban planning,"Over the past decades, intense urbanization processes have produced built environments with a low energy efficiency and a severe lack of green spaces, which represent the main providers of ecosystem services in cities and play a relevant role in regulating the local microclimate. Among the different natural processes involved in climate regulation, a fundamental role is played by the shading effects of urban vegetation on buildings and built environment. Consequently, urban planning strategies aimed at designing a Green Infrastructure (GI) can have significant impacts on reducing the summer-time energy demand of cities while providing new green spaces for the local community. This is particularly relevant in high density settlements, where urban morphology types such as multi-storey apartment buildings represent an important percentage of the entire built environment. For these morphology types, the implementation of the GI depends on the different possibilities and limitation offered by private open spaces around residential buildings. Despite its importance, the implementation of a GI from public administrations must often challenge the lack of economic resources to acquire and manage private land to be set as new urban green spaces. This article investigates the potential energy savings for multi-storey apartment buildings that can be achieved by shading effect of trees. Particularly, building performance simulations are carried out considering different configurations of key parameters, such as trees species, distance to buildings, orientations of buildings and actual room of open spaces beside buildings where to plant new trees. The simulations are run for a real urban case study located in the metropolitan area of Catania in southern Italy, characterized by different types of urban morphologies. Simulations of shading effect consider three species of trees and 41 different spatial configurations depending on actual availability of open spaces around buildings. Results show that relevant energy savings can be obtained when the entire façades of buildings are shaded. The range of reduction of cooling loads of buildings varies between 2% and 50%, depending on the species and configurations: for half of considered 41 configurations 15% of average reduction is obtained. From an urban design point of view, results also suggest that the distance of trees from buildings and the actual availability of room for trees are key aspects to consider when designing where and how to plant new trees. Not in all configurations simulated, planting trees can result in a significant reduction of cooling energy loads. Findings of this work support urban planning for the choice of different scenarios and alternatives of GI to better balance public and private costs and generate wider benefits for the local communities.","The research was partly funded by the Department of Civil Engineering and Architecture, University of Catania, through the Funds: Incoming Teachers (2019) and PlaNatures (2016-2018).",,Energy and Buildings,,,,2020-12,2020,,2020-12,229,,110531,Closed,Article,"Palme, Massimo; Privitera, Riccardo; La Rosa, Daniele","Palme, Massimo (Escuela de Arquitectura, Universidad Católica del Norte, Antofagasta, Chile; Centro de Investigación Tecnológica del Agua en el Desierto, Universidad Católica del Norte, Antofagasta, Chile); Privitera, Riccardo (Department of Civil Engineering and Architecture, University of Catania, Italy); La Rosa, Daniele (Department of Civil Engineering and Architecture, University of Catania, Italy)","La Rosa, Daniele (University of Catania)","Palme, Massimo (Catholic University of the North; Catholic University of the North); Privitera, Riccardo (University of Catania); La Rosa, Daniele (University of Catania)",32,20,,17.45,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1131431628,33 Built Environment and Design; 3301 Architecture,11 Sustainable Cities and Communities; 7 Affordable and Clean Energy
203,pub.1126661802,10.1002/esp.4868,,,Mapping rainstorm erosion associated with an individual storm from InSAR coherence loss validated by field evidence for the Atacama Desert,"Abstract Extreme high‐magnitude and low‐frequency storm events in arid zones provide the necessary runoff to entrain sediments from source areas and therefore dictate the linkages between hillslopes and channels. Nevertheless, the erosive impact of large storms remains difficult to predict. Most of the uncertainty lies in the lack of topographic change maps associated with single hydro‐meteorological events. Consequently, event‐based erosion models are poorly constrained and their extrapolation over long time periods remains uncertain. In this study, a 15‐month Sentinel‐1A coherence time series, optical and field data are used to map the spatial patterns of erosion after the 5‐day storm occurred on March 2015, in the Atacama Desert. The coherence change detection (CCD) analysis suggests that temporal loss of coherence is related to variations in soil moisture, while permanent loss of coherence is related to modification of soil texture by erosion and sedimentation. Importantly, permanent loss of coherence is more apparent on gentle rather than steeper slopes, likely reflecting differences in regolith cover and thickness. These findings can contradict the landscape models predicting higher erosion on steeper hillslopes. The CCD technique represents a promising tool for analysing and modelling sediment connectivity in arid areas, giving a clear picture of the relation between sediment sources and sink pathways. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","Acknowledgements This work forms part of the PhD research grant of A.

Éste, al mediar entre lo cultural y lo ambiental, proporciona información vital para una mejor comprensión de la relación entre naturaleza y cultura construida por estas sociedades.

Por consiguiente, proponemos que la intervención humana en la Pampa del Tamarugal puede ser entendida como un cambio no sólo ecológico y económico, sino también cosmológico.
In this article, we illustrate the relationships that human societies established with their environment during the Formative period in the Pampa del Tamarugal (3000–1000 BP), Atacama Desert, Chile. We employed a theoretical-methodological perspective that emphasizes the explanatory potential of ecofacts. By mediating between humans and environment, this perspective provides a better understanding of how these societies constructed nature and culture. The purpose is to show that this process was part of a long history of rationalization of the desert, its resources, and the lived experience of the Formative communities that occupied that landscape. Therefore, we propose that this human intervention in Pampa del Tamarugal can be understood not only as an ecological and economic change but also a “cosmological” one.","Proyectos Anillo SOC-1405, FONDECYT 1181829, FPCI 100417, CAPES FB-0002-2014, FONDAP 151100 (CR2), FONDECYT Postodoctorado 3160759, PCI PII20150081, UTA Mayor-3070.

Despite mixed evidence among socially disadvantaged groups, recent evidence shows that members of disadvantaged groups minimize perceptions of discrimination in order to reap palliative benefits. We tested this hypothesis in a sample of gay men and lesbians in Chile ( N = 467). Specifically, we examined the effects of system justification on psychological distress, and the mediating role of perceived sexual stigma. As expected, system justification was negatively associated with psychological distress via minimizing perceptions of sexual stigma towards the in-group. Our study replicates previous results, and unveils a soporific mechanism of system-justifying beliefs: that of providing palliative benefits to sexual minorities’ well-being by minimizing perceptions of their in-group as target of sexual stigma. Considerations for the well-being and status of sexual minorities and their unwitting compliance with heteronormativity are further discussed.","This work was supported by CONICYT under a PhD scholarship # 72170456 awarded to the first author; CONICYT under a FONDECYT Grant #1140887 awarded to the third author; Proyectos Basal USA 1555 – Vridei under Grant # 031793BD_MOV, Universidad de Santiago de Chile, awarded to the third author. / Este trabajo ha recibido el apoyo de CONICYT mediante una beca de doctorado #72170456 otorgada al primer autor; y mediante la ayuda FONDECYT #1140887 también de CONICYT otorgada al tercer autor, así como de Proyectos Basal USA 1555 – Vridei mediante la ayuda # 031793BD_MOV de la Universidad de Santiago de Chile, otorgada al tercer autor.",,International Journal of Social Psychology,,,,2020-05-01,2020,2020-05-01,2020-05,35,2,282-309,Closed,Article,"Bahamondes, Joaquín; Gómez, Fabiola; Barrientos, Jaime; Cárdenas, Manuel; Guzmán-González, Mónica","Bahamondes, Joaquín (University of Auckland); Gómez, Fabiola (Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile); Barrientos, Jaime (Universidad Alberto Hurtado); Cárdenas, Manuel (Universidad de Valparaíso); Guzmán-González, Mónica (Universidad Católica del Norte)","Bahamondes, Joaquín (University of Auckland)","Bahamondes, Joaquín (University of Auckland); Gómez, Fabiola (Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile); Barrientos, Jaime (Alberto Hurtado University); Cárdenas, Manuel (University of Valparaíso); Guzmán-González, Mónica (Catholic University of the North)",10,3,,6.28,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1127386858,44 Human Society; 4405 Gender Studies,3 Good Health and Well Being

Therefore, an understanding of the underlying electronic correlations and their effects associated with their complex energy landscape is an important and ongoing task. One key parameter in oxide-based perovskite multiferroics is their sensitivity to strain effects under confinement. Here, we report on the ferromagnetism induced by strain-engineering at the nanoscale on BiFeO3 (BFO) nanoparticles. By controlling synthesis parameters, we were able to modify the BFO lattice parameters up to 0.15% and as a consequence, induce ferromagnetism in otherwise antiferromagnetic bulk BFO. In order to understand the driving mechanisms behind such an effect, we performed density functional theory calculations (DFT) using the BFO parameters obtained from the experiment. We found that small distortions of the structural lattice parameters of the order of 0.01% are sufficient to induce a significant spin imbalance close to the Fermi energy at the Fe sites. This may explain the appearance of weak ferromagnetism in strained BFO thin films reported earlier and offers a new route to novel voltage-controlled spintronic devices based on multiferroic materials.","This work was initiated at the Nanomagnetism Laboratory at Universidad de los Andes.

It is one of the most efficient solutions for sludge reduction along with biogas production. However, the knowledge of the microbial consortium involved in this process is still unknown in full-scale anaerobic digesters from Latin America. This study aimed to elucidate the dynamics of the microbial community of a full-scale anaerobic digester for a year using 16S rDNA amplicon sequencing with the Illumina Miseq platform. The results showed fluctuations in the frequencies of dominant phyla with a decrease of Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes after a temporary suspension of anaerobic digester. The core community was affiliated with bacterial phyla Firmicutes, Actinobacteria, Proteobacteria, and Chloroflexi. The core community was represented by 154 OTUs that accounted for 74% of all the processed reads. The Anaerolineaceae family, within Chloroflexi phylum, was the most frequently observed taxonomic group in all samples analyzed. Despite the microbial fluctuations, the biogas production was stable over the studied year (average 66% methane production), which might indicate a functional redundancy in the microbial consortium.","This research was supported by the Colombian Administrative Department of Science, Technology, and Innovation, COLCIENCIAS.

Using a case study of Vietnam, this research aimed to understand the effect of problematic mobile phone use (also known as mobile phone addiction or compulsive mobile phone use), attitudes and beliefs, and perceived risk on the frequency of mobile phone use among motorcyclists and car drivers. A self-administered questionnaire was distributed to motorcyclists (n1= 529) and car drivers (n2= 328) using an online survey and face-to-face survey. The survey took around 20-min to complete and participants were entered into a lottery for supermarket vouchers. Of the motorcyclists, 42% of the sample (the highest proportion) was in the 18-25 age group while the 36-45 age group accounted for the highest proportion among car drivers (34.8%). Using structural equation modelling (SEM), key findings showed that each construct influenced mobile phone use, but in different ways for motorcycle riders and car drivers. Attitudes and beliefs had the largest effect on mobile phone use while riding among motorcyclists, with problematic mobile phone use having the smallest influence. In contrast, problematic mobile phone use had the largest effect on mobile phone use while driving a car, with attitudes and beliefs having the smallest effect. The findings of this study point to the need for tailored interventions involving a range of actors (policymakers, police enforcement, mental health professionals, advocacy groups and the wider community) to raise awareness, modify attitudes and increase risk perception associated with mobile phone use while driving/riding. This can be achieved thorough educational tools and road safety campaigns which are focused on reducing this risky driving behaviour. This includes customising road safety programs for individuals and groups affected by problematic mobile phone use such as targeted advertising.","The authors would like to thank the reviewers for their thoughtful comments and insight.

However, this behaviour has been increasing in recent years. Effective enforcement of mobile phone bans while driving faces several obstacles; as such, it is important to consider additional countermeasures. Applications designed to prevent distracted driving are a promising solution, yet more research is needed that examines their effectiveness in reducing dangerous phone use while driving behaviours. Additionally, these applications are voluntary in nature; therefore, an understanding of drivers' perceptions of the applications is necessary to determine how to improve uptake. A mixed methods design was utilised to examine these factors in a comprehensive manner. A total of 40 participants used the smartphone application ""Do Not Disturb While Driving"" for iOS phone operating systems or ""Android Auto"" for Android phone operating systems for approximately one week and completed three diary entries reporting on their experience. Two questionnaires that examined phone use while driving behaviours were also administered to participants; one before and one after completing the study. The quantitative results found that engagement in 1) visual-manual, 2) cognitive-auditory and 3) music mobile phone interactions significantly decreased while using the application. Distraction engagement and mental workload while driving also significantly decreased while using the application. The qualitative results identified a number of areas of improvement that need to be addressed, e.g. activation of the application and Bluetooth connection reliability. The features that required improvement presented an obstacle for effective use of the applications, and in some cases resulted in drivers deciding to stop using the application. Positive perceptions of the application were associated with the experiences of the application functioning appropriately and activating automatically. These results show that applications designed for voluntary use to prevent mobile phone distracted driving are a promising countermeasure, although current applications require several improvements.",,,Accident Analysis & Prevention,,,"Accidents, Traffic; Adolescent; Adult; Australia; Cell Phone Use; Distracted Driving; Female; Frustration; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Mobile Applications; Risk Factors; Self Report; Young Adult",2020-01-29,2020,2020-01-29,2020-03,137,,105412,Closed,Article,"Oviedo-Trespalacios, Oscar; Truelove, Verity; King, Mark","Oviedo-Trespalacios, Oscar (Centre for Accident Research and Road Safety-Queensland (CARRS-Q), Queensland University of Technology (QUT), Kelvin Grove, 4059, Australia; Queensland University of Technology (QUT), Institute of Health and Biomedical Innovation (IHBI), Kelvin Grove, 4059, Australia; Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); Truelove, Verity (Centre for Accident Research and Road Safety-Queensland (CARRS-Q), Queensland University of Technology (QUT), Kelvin Grove, 4059, Australia; Road Safety Research Collaboration, University of the Sunshine Coast (USC), Sippy Downs, Queensland, 4556, Australia); King, Mark (Centre for Accident Research and Road Safety-Queensland (CARRS-Q), Queensland University of Technology (QUT), Kelvin Grove, 4059, Australia)","Oviedo-Trespalacios, Oscar (Queensland University of Technology; Queensland University of Technology; Universidad del Norte)","Oviedo-Trespalacios, Oscar (Queensland University of Technology; Queensland University of Technology; Universidad del Norte); Truelove, Verity (Queensland University of Technology; University of the Sunshine Coast); King, Mark (Queensland University of Technology)",42,20,1.65,10.81,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1124406084,42 Health Sciences; 4206 Public Health,3 Good Health and Well Being

This fact suggests an urgency in the discovery of new drugs or alternative approaches for treating this disease. The objective of this study was to evaluate the antileishmanial activity of combined therapy between crotamine (CTA) from Crotalus durissus terrificus and the pentavalent antimonial Glucantime® (GLU). The assays were in vitro performed measuring the inhibition of Leishmania amazonensis amastigotes, followed by the evaluation of cellular production of cytokines and nitrites. After that, analytical methods were performed in order to characterize the molecules involved in the study by Mass Spectrometry, molecular affinity through an in silico assay and Surface Plasmon Resonance. In vivo experiments with BALB/c mice were performed by analyzing parasitemia, lesion size and immunological mediators. In the in vitro experiments, the pharmacological association improved the inhibition of the amastigotes, modulated the production of cytokines and nitric oxide. The therapy improved the effectiveness of the GLU, demonstrating a decreased parasitemia in the infected tissues. Altogether, the results suggest that the combined approach with CTA and GLU may be a promising alternative for the treatment of cutaneous leishmaniasis.","The authors thank PDTIS-FIOCRUZ for the use of its facilities.

In this study, we deepen in the understanding of the mechanisms involved in the immunoregulatory activity of L. casei CRL431 during a nutritional repletion process by evaluating (a) platelet and endothelial activation, (b) tissue factor (TF) expression, and (c) protease-activated receptor (PAR) activation in an experimental bacterial respiratory infection model in malnourished mice. Our findings demonstrate for the first time that the repletion diet supplemented with L. casei CRL431 was effective to normalize platelet counts in blood, modulate platelet activation and their recruitment into the lung, and regulate local and systemic TF expression and endothelial activation, which were affected by malnourishment. Streptococcus pneumoniae challenge induced local and systemic increase of platelet counts, PARs activation, P-selectin and TF expression, as well as endothelial activation in both well-nourished and malnourished mice. Malnourished animals evidenced the highest alterations of the parameters evaluated while the mice fed with the probiotic bacterium had similar behavior to normal controls but with lower PAR activation in lung. These results demonstrate that supplementation of repletion diet with L. casei CRL431 is effective to modulate alterations induced by malnourishment and pneumococcal infection, restraining coagulation activation, the inflammatory process, and lung damage.

Investigations of such ties are very scarce. In the present study, focused on Latin American migrant women, transnational ties are considered a protective factor of family functioning, conditioned by premigratory variables. The working hypothesis is that increased frequency of reunited mothers' communication with and remittances to their children during the period of separation prior to the reunion will be linked to better communication, cohesion, flexibility, satisfaction, and family resources, according to the reunited mothers' perception.
METHOD: The sample consisted of 81 mothers of Latin American reunited families. Most of them (61.7%) have 2 or 3 children and 75.3% have already reunited all of their children in Bizkaia. The frequency of communication between family members in the societies of origin and destination and the frequency of remittances were the transnational variables. To observe family functioning, we used the Circumplex Model. A mediation model was tested through structural equation modeling.
RESULTS: The results of the study confirmed the mediator role of the transnational variables, especially the frequency of transnational communications, partially or fully moderating the impact of the premigratory variables, and positively associated with family functioning, in terms of greater cohesion, flexibility, communication, satisfaction, and perception of resources.
CONCLUSIONS: This study has highlighted the role of these ties, which lead to more functional family dynamics. It is necessary to promote new forms of transnational communication that favor subsequent family reunification.

This work describes a validated heuristic model based on GA, to select JONSWAP spectra parameters, regardless of water depth restrictions and sea state conditions. The identification of the JONSWAP spectra parameters is difficult, as the alpha and gamma coefficients have scattered distributions that modulate the spectral peak energy. In addition, the selection of alpha and gamma coefficients from in situ free surface records may be difficult and time-consuming, because of the amount of data and nonlinearities involved. The proposed model uses either in situ or numerically modelled wave data and has three main steps: (1) generation and crossover, (2) minimisation of the cost function ΔHs, defined as the minimum difference between the calculated artificial significant wave height and the in situ wave height (instrumented or modelled), and (3) mutation and natural selection. To apply the model, in situ wave data measured by an acoustic Doppler current profiler over 5.5 months was used in this research. The results show a high correlation (r2), of 0.95, between the best fitted curves of modelled spectra and measured data.",The authors thank Professor Germán Rivillas for facilitating the wave buoy data measured by the Universidad del Norte.,The authors wish to thank the Universidad Militar Nueva Granada and the Universidad del Norte for financial support through the research project INV-ING-2985.,Ocean Dynamics,,,,2020-01-09,2020,2020-01-09,2020-04,70,4,561-571,Closed,Article,"Rueda-Bayona, Juan Gabriel; Guzmán, Andrés; Silva, Rodolfo","Rueda-Bayona, Juan Gabriel (Engineering Faculty, Civil Engineering, Water and Energy (AyE) Research Group, Universidad Militar Nueva Granada, Carrera 11 No. 101-80, Bogotá, Colombia); Guzmán, Andrés (Research Group for Structures and Geotechnics (GIEG), Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Universidad del Norte, Km 5 via Puerto Colombia, Bloque K, 8-33K, Barranquilla, Colombia); Silva, Rodolfo (Instituto de Ingeniería, Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México, Mexico City, Mexico)","Rueda-Bayona, Juan Gabriel (Military University Nueva Granada)","Rueda-Bayona, Juan Gabriel (Military University Nueva Granada); Guzmán, Andrés (Universidad del Norte); Silva, Rodolfo (National Autonomous University of Mexico)",12,4,,3.25,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1123979832,37 Earth Sciences; 3704 Geoinformatics; 3708 Oceanography,

The Magdalena River has one of the highest sediment yields among the major rivers of the world. In addition, it is a laterally constrained river mouth due to a series of man-made structures inhibiting its morphological response. Thus, it provides an illustrative example to study siltation processes in a river mouth system where a low capacity of morphological response interacts with a high-magnitude sediment transport regime. The river mouth exhibited an overall slow-pace deepening trend between 2000 and 2017. However, it experienced cyclic shifts between erosive and siltation states, both at interannual and intra-annual scales. The rates of erosion were 310 mm yr−1 on average during the erosional stages. Whereas sedimentation rates were 293 mm yr−1 on average during the sedimentation stages. Maximum rates of erosion and sedimentation were 1450 mm yr−1 and 2625 mm yr−1, respectively. However, intra-annual rates of sedimentation/erosion were of the same magnitude or larger compared with the interannual rates. Such high rates and the rapid changes in the sedimentary balance is the result of the cumulative effect of its limited morphological response capacity and its large suspended sediment load. These rapid processes generate constraints and threats to navigation. Particularly, at intra-annual scales. Consequently, innovative intervention proposals, recognizing the rapid transitions and geomorphological adaptations, are required for managing this type of river mouths.",This study constitutes a contribution from the research project “Hacia el entendimiento de la turbulencia y la floculación en desembocaduras tropicales – procesos fundamentales en la formación de zonas de máxima turbidez y el transporte de sedimentos” funded by Colciencias (Proyecto 121571250890 Convocatoria 745).

                    This article analyzes the evolution, between 2010 and 2020, of the organizations created during the Latin American post–liberal regionalism wave. It describes their rise and decline and includes recent public opinion data to claim that there is no demand or supply for an eventual fifth wave of regionalism that would replicate the previous models. Considering the failure of national governments in fulfilling basic human needs, it nonetheless claims that the deepening of the critical social and economic conditions, especially in the COVID-19 pandemic context, could lead to a fifth wave of regionalism in Latin America. Nevertheless, to succeed, such a wave could be inspired by international and regional technical organizations in a way that would recall the principles of David Mitrany’s functionalist theory.

Describe su auge y caída e incluye datos recientes de opinión pública para plantear que no existe una demanda ni una oferta para una quinta ola de regionalismo similar a las olas anteriores. Sin embargo, el fracaso de los Estados en asegurar las necesidades sociales básicas y la degradación de las condiciones socioeconómicas, particularmente en el contexto de la pandemia COVID-19, podrían llevar a una quinta ola de regionalismo latinoamericano.

The proposed approach differs from previous works in the literature because it attempts to minimize the levels of overstaffing and understaffing, but also the possible negative impacts associated to a strategy of multiple breaks. The approach is built around four modules that implement a sequential iterative process to solve the scheduling problem. The first two modules use novel heuristic procedures to construct efficient break profiles that define the distribution of multiple breaks across a shift. The third module consists of a mixed-integer programming model that assigns shifts to full-time employees over a one-day planning horizon. The model uses the best break profiles constructed by the first two modules to minimize over/understaffing arising from demand seasonality. The fourth module compares the level of over/understaffing minimized by the model to the minimum possible level of over/understaffing, and if the former is not within a percentage considered to be satisfactory the entire procedure is iterated until a satisfactory solution is found. A test case using different daily demand profiles generated results showing that the level of over/understaffing obtained by the methodology under each profile was within 1 percentage point of the minimum possible despite assigning only one break additional to the mandatory meal break.","This research was supported by “Fundación para la Promoción de la Investigación y la Tecnología (FPIT)” under Grant 4.254 and Universidad del Norte under Grant 2017-13.

Methods A cross-sectional study was carried out on an open population involved in a community-oriented program for control of rheumatic diseases (COPCORD) study in Colombia, using EQ-5D-3L for estimating QOL, and the health assessment questionnaire disability index (HAQ-DI) for functional capacity. Results Out of the total 4020 individuals evaluated, 2274 had rheumatic diseases, 642 had non-rheumatic diseases, and 1104 were healthy subjects. Spondyloarthritis (SpA) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients had more complaints regarding pain/discomfort and mobility. As for daily activities, the diseases that mostly affected them were systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and RA. RA and fibromyalgia (FM) patients had the worst scores as regards anxiety/depression and self-care dimensions. FM patients had the lowest QOL measured by EQ-VAS (57.7±26.2). The most frequent non-rheumatic diseases were cardiovascular and mental disorders, with 20% of these patients having a moderate level of pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. The rheumatic patients reported a decrease in functional capacity (HAQ: 0.49), in contrast to the healthy population (0.01), and the population having other diseases (0.06). Conclusion Rheumatic disease patients in Colombia had the worst QOL compared to the healthy population and patients with other comorbidities. Rheumatic patients had greater functional limitations, even more so when having comorbidities.

1327,pub.1129425919,10.1177/0361198120927005,,,Effect of Speed Bumps on Pavement Condition,"Speed bumps are efficient traffic calming devices that allow transport authorities to control vehicle speeds and improve safety in specific locations. Though frequently used in residential areas, they have become increasing prevalent in other higher volume roadways (particularly in developing countries), because of their effectiveness, low-cost of implementation, and easy installation process. However, in these countries there is no proper technical guidance for speed bump design and implementation, which is why one can often find these devices placed on an arterial highway or on roads where the proportion of trucks is high. The most important consequence of placing a speed bump on a road with large numbers of trucks is that the pavement deterioration process will accelerate as a result of the induced vibrations and bouncing of a truck’s suspension. In this paper the relationship between the bump geometry—length and height—and the dynamic load transmitted to the pavement is studied. A full truck model has been used to simulate the vehicle dynamics while passing over the bump, to estimate the demand imposed over the pavement. Damage was calculated for each simulation scenario using a combination of linear-elastic analysis and empirical damage functions. The geometry that leads to less damage is the circular, with a minimum length of two meters and a maximum height of ten centimeters.",,,Transportation Research Record Journal of the Transportation Research Board,,,,2020-07-16,2020,2020-07-16,2020-09,2674,9,66-82,Closed,Article,"Goenaga, Boris; Underwood, Shane; Fuentes, Luis","Goenaga, Boris (Department of Civil, Construction, and Environmental Engineering, North Carolina State University, Raleigh, NC); Underwood, Shane (Department of Civil, Construction, and Environmental Engineering, North Carolina State University, Raleigh, NC); Fuentes, Luis (Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia)","Goenaga, Boris (North Carolina State University)","Goenaga, Boris (North Carolina State University); Underwood, Shane (North Carolina State University); Fuentes, Luis (Universidad del Norte)",6,5,,1.63,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1129425919,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3509 Transportation, Logistics and Supply Chains; 40 Engineering; 4005 Civil Engineering",3 Good Health and Well Being

Using low coverage short Illumina 250bp pair-end reads sequencing, this study reports, for the first time, the genome size, mitochondrial chromosome, and nuclear repetitive elements, including microsatellites, in M. mercenaria. The average haploid genome size estimated using a k-mer approach was 33 Mbp which is smaller than the 1.76 Gbp size estimated using static cell fluorometry. The mitochondrial genome of M. mercenaria is 15,644bp in length and comprised of 13 protein-coding genes, 2 ribosomal RNA genes, and 22 transfer RNA genes. Repetitive elements constituted ~83.5% of the nuclear genome while ~16.5% of the genome represented single- or low-copy sequences. A large portion of repetitive sequences could not be assigned to known repeat element families. Considering only annotated repetitive elements, the most ubiquitous belonged to Class I-LINE and Class I-LTR-Ty-3/Gypsy elements. A total of 66 SSRs were identified. These newly developed genomic resources will contribute to the better understanding of meta-population connectivity, hybridization with the congeneric M. adina, and putative genomic mechanisms involved in the acclimatization and adaptation to climate change of the Florida stone crab.","JAB thanks Dr. Vince P.

Gender, household composition and land restitution process in Colombia","This article analyses the gender context of the land restitution process in Colombia using our own survey data of beneficiaries in Montes de María region on the Atlantic Coast. We find that the fulfilment of legal gender provisions takes place in cultural frames and social structures that could undermine the program's gender distributive potential. As studies on land policies and their gender impacts show, context matters greatly. Our findings confirm main insights of earlier literature with respect to occupation, origin of property and household composition as sources of gender differentiation in Latin America, but advance the agenda in two directions: by showing more nuanced differences between genders, and by highlighting the relevance of household composition in respondents’ decision-making. In particular, it is more likely that women live in one-parent households than men. Furthermore, female respondents expect other family members to work their land, while male respondents intend to work the land themselves. Such differences might have distributional effects so far not sufficiently understood and investigated.",We thank the referees for very useful input.

The course introduces computational methods and tools in the context of disciplinary problems for materials science and engineering students. Initial course offerings suggested that students were overwhelmed by the interdisciplinary nature of the course. Therefore, the research team evaluated different scaffolding strategies for supporting students’ learning, and how those may have provided students with agency to self-scaffold when needed. Three rounds of data collection included 17 students who participated in individual semi-structured interviews to explore how they used (or not) different scaffolds. Five of the participants were recruited for the first iteration; six of them were recruited in the second iteration, and six more in the third one. The iterative process allowed us to adapt the scaffolding procedures for the third iteration from the data collected in iterations 1 and 2. The purpose of this study is to understand how students used different scaffolds, and what implementation strategies were effective according to student uses of these scaffolds in the context of computational science. The results suggest that students developed agency to self-scaffold when needed, as they benefited from multiple scaffolds at different steps of the problem-solving process. Moreover, providing worked examples without engaging students in their active exploration can be ineffective, but this engagement can be achieved using written explanations. Additional support may be needed at an early stage of skill development, so students have an idea of how to validate their model.",,,Journal of Computing in Higher Education,,,,2020-11-23,2020,2020-11-23,2021-08,33,2,328-366,Closed,Article,"Vieira, Camilo; Magana, Alejandra J.; Roy, Anindya; Falk, Michael","Vieira, Camilo (Universidad del Norte, Km 5 Via Puerto Colombia, Barranquilla, Colombia); Magana, Alejandra J.

Whole cells from different fungal strains were capable of biotransforming diterpenes through a variety of reactions, most of them involving enzymes that promote carbon oxidations. In this paper, we report the first biotransformation of the cytotoxic pimarane-type diterpene annonalide (1) into nor-annonalide (2) by growing cells of the filamentous fungus Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. tracheiphilum (UFCM 0089). Lipase, decarboxylase and alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) enzymes mediated this unprecedented bioconversion. Theoretical studies (DFT analysis, molecular docking and molecular dynamics) were performed as an attempt to propose a plausive pathway involved on the formation of product 2, and binding interactions of intermediate 1a into the catalytic site of pyruvate decarboxylase enzyme were identified.","We are thankfull to CNPq (Proc.: 405001/2013-4, 303365/2014-5 and 437373/2018-5), FUNCAP (Proc.: PNP-0058-00137.01.00/11) and CAPES for financial support as well as CENAUREMN/UFC for the aquisition of NMR data.

Selecting an appropriate traffic-opening temperature of newly laid asphalt airport runway overlay would avoid early damage – while also minimising the disruption to the airport service due to prolonged runway closure in a busy airport. This study aims to investigate the allowable traffic-opening temperature of freshly paved asphalt during nighttime construction through a series of laboratory tests with regard to asphalt rutting and interface shear failure potential. Additionally, a transient heat transfer model is developed to study the cooling response of freshly laid asphalt and, along with stress analysis, used to deduce the effect of selected critical traffic opening to traffic on airport closure. The results suggest that mixtures with polymer-modified bitumen (PMB) can be re-opened to air traffic at a considerably higher temperature (up to 80°C) than conventional traffic-opening temperature as set by many agencies (60°C). This result encourages airport authorities and agencies to be more adaptive with the traffic-opening temperature specification, particularly for asphalt with PMBs. For the cases studied, raising the critical trafficking temperature would reduce the runway/airport closure during nighttime construction by 17–114 minutes (26–63% reductions).",The authors gratefully thank LPDP for providing the financial support for this research.

One potential contributor to these challenges is the use of pesticides, particularly aquatic herbicides applied to aquatic habitats inhabited by amphibians. Critical issues of concern are the potential toxicity and teratogenicity of these herbicides towards amphibians. Using the FETAX protocol, three globally used formulations, including diquat dibromide (Midstream), glufosinate ammonium (Basta), and imazapyr (Arsenal), were assessed for embryotoxicity, teratogenicity, and growth inhibition. Developing Xenopus laevis embryos were exposed for 96 h at concentrations of 0.5–3.0 mg/L, 1.6–3.0 mg/L, and 20–45 mg/L for Midstream, Basta, and Arsenal respectively. The 96-h LC50 estimates were 0.83 mg/L acid equivalent (a.e.), 36 mg/L a.e., and 2.2 mg/L a.e., whereas the EC50 estimates were 0.24 mg/L a.e., 28.13 mg/L a.e., and 2.01 mg/L a.e. for the Midstream, Arsenal, and Basta formulations, respectively. These two estimates produced Teratogenic Index of 3.5, 1.3, and 1.1 for Midstream, Arsenal, and Basta, respectively, indicating a high risk of malformation induction by Midstream and moderate risk for Arsenal. Regarding growth inhibition, lowest observable effect concentrations of 0.5 mg/L, 25 mg/L, and 2.0 mg/L were computed for Midstream, Arsenal, and Basta, respectively, producing the minimum concentration inhibiting growth (MCIG) ratios of 0.62, 0.69, and 0.89 for the three formulations. These MICG values are higher than the standard 0.30 growth inhibitors benchmark, suggesting that the formulations are not growth inhibitors at the evaluated concentrations.

A ranking survey was conducted and analyzed unveiling levels of acceptance to the proposed policies for three types of stakeholders (Carriers, Receivers, and Citizens). Though some methodologies attempt to understand stakeholders’ perspectives towards urban freight policies, often only a certain type of stakeholder is considered; perceptions of Citizens are usually overlooked. The results suggest that stakeholders agree on the importance of having space to conduct freight operations in their urban areas. However, different stakeholders perceive policies differently and local context plays a key role, suggesting that decision-makers must consider these aspects before transferring initiatives from other urban settings. When space for freight operations cannot be provided, the results show that Carriers prefer a Receiver-led Consolidation program, Receivers consider an Urban Consolidation Center as the best alternative, and Citizens prefer Off-hour deliveries. While all of the preferred alternatives call for a more active role played by the other stakeholders, they also call for more sustainable practices and move away from traditional, restrictive policies. The results from this study serve as a tool for planners and decision-makers seeking input on the preferences of various stakeholders to, and the potential acceptability of, urban freight policies.",,,Transportation Research Part A Policy and Practice,,,,2020-02,2020,,2020-02,132,,329-348,Closed,Article,"Amaya, Johanna; Arellana, Julian; Delgado-Lindeman, Maira","Amaya, Johanna (Department of Supply Chain Management, Iowa State University, 2167 Union Drive, Ames, IA 50011, USA); Arellana, Julian (Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Universidad del Norte, Km 5, Via a Puerto Colombia, Barranquilla, Colombia); Delgado-Lindeman, Maira (Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Universidad del Norte, Km 5, Via a Puerto Colombia, Barranquilla, Colombia)","Amaya, Johanna (Iowa State University)","Amaya, Johanna (Iowa State University); Arellana, Julian (Universidad del Norte); Delgado-Lindeman, Maira (Universidad del Norte)",38,18,,11.35,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1123020733,"33 Built Environment and Design; 3304 Urban and Regional Planning; 35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3509 Transportation, Logistics and Supply Chains",11 Sustainable Cities and Communities

These straits are in the northern Antarctic Peninsula (NAP) continental shelf. In the study area, temperature in the surface mixed layer during January 2017 was warmer than recorded in other years, contemporaneous with an extreme decrease in Antarctic sea ice extent at the end of 2016. This was probably caused by warm water advected from the north into Gerlache Strait, a consequence of northeasterly surface winds over the NAP, forced by a Southern Annular Mode (SAM) negative phase. Optimum multiparameter analysis indicated that relatively warm, salty and low-oxygenated modified Circumpolar Deep Water (mCDW) intrudes over the NAP continental shelf and dominates the Bismarck Strait, where it enters the Gerlache Strait, especially through its southern extremity. The mCDW mixes with relatively cold, fresh and recently ventilated modified High Salinity Shelf Water (mHSSW), producing temporal variations in water proportions. HSSW forms in the Weddell Sea and is advected southward along the deep basins of the Bransfield Strait, entering as bottom water into Gerlache Strait via its northern limit. There were two fronts in Gerlache Strait during both summers. First was a surface thermal front in the mixed layer represented by the 1 °C isotherm (~64.5°S), which separated colder waters toward Bismarck Strait. Second was a sub-pycnocline front, represented by the 0.4 °C and 220 μmol kg−1 dissolved oxygen contours below ~100 dbar, which separated mCDW toward Bismarck Strait from mHSSW on the northern side of the strait. This frontal position varies as a consequence of temporal variations in source water fractions. Moreover, changes in Ekman transport, forced by enhanced westerly winds associated with a SAM positive phase, appeared responsible for a major fraction of mCDW in Gerlache Strait during 2015 relative to 2017. The spatiotemporal variability of source water mixing in the water column structure of the Gerlache Strait might have implications for local biological and chemical cycles, and for regional climate feedbacks, because warm mCDW accelerates glacier retreat in the western Antarctic Peninsula.","The Colombian National Navy, Colombian Antarctic Program, Colombian Ocean Commission, and General Maritime Directorate are acknowledged for making possible the expeditions from Colombia to Antarctica.

Nevertheless, there is scarce evidence about the impacts of MP on the energy balance of marine invertebrates. We evaluated the mid-term effect of the microplastic ingestion at the current higher environmental concentrations in the ocean on the energy balance of the giant mussel Choromytilus chorus. We exposed juvenile mussels to three concentrations of microplastics (0, 100, and 1000 particles L-1) and evaluated the effect on physiology after 40 days. The impacts of MP on the ecophysiological traits of the mussels were minimum at all the studied concentrations. At intermediate concentrations of MP, Scope for Growth (SFG) had little impact. Other relevant key life-history and physiological processes, such as size and metabolism, were not affected by microplastics. However, individuals treated with MP presented histopathological differences compared to control group, which could result in adverse health effects for mussels.","We thank Luisa Saavedra for her help in the field activities.

Here, we examined how geographic origin influences UV stress tolerance of the red seaweeds Chondracanthus chamissoi and Gelidium lingulatum distributed along the South-East Pacific coast between 20° S and 42° S. Seaweeds from six (C. chamissoi) and five (G. lingulatum) populations were grown under common-garden conditions and then exposed to consecutive UV stress events and essential biological traits (e.g., growth, photosynthetic responses, antioxidant capacity, and UV-absorbing compounds) were analyzed. In C. chamissoi, a strong UV sensitivity occurred in populations from mid-latitudes (27° S and 29° S) where the lowest recovery of maximum quantum yield (Fv /Fm ; between 32.3% and 66.8% of control) and growth rate were observed. Likewise, the lowest amount of mycosporine-like amino acids (MAAs) and a significant decrease in phycobilins were registered in these populations. In G. lingulatum, recovery of Fv /Fm ranged from 82.0% to 97.7% of control, and antioxidant activity, carotenoid, and MAA contents were positively influenced by UV exposure. The multivariate analysis indicated a significant influence of PAR, cloud cover, and UV index on physiological traits, depending on species. The ecotypic differentiation index (EDI) indicated a higher phenotypic variation in C. chamissoi (EDI = 0.10) than G. lingulatum (EDI = 0.03). This study shows that the spatial distribution of UV stress tolerance in the studied seaweeds does not follow linear latitudinal or central-edge gradients.

It’s problematic to modify, forge, and track. Blockchain can record all kinds of information that has already happened. The implementation of blockchain technology can solve these problems and realize the sustainable development of agriculture. The present study aims to investigate the convenience analysis of sustainable electronic agriculture based on blockchain technology, and analyze the application prospect and challenges of blockchain in the agricultural field. In this experiment, five villages with similar development rates in China were selected as the objects.Firstly, blockchain technology was applied to sustainable e-agriculture by using data statistics to explore its convenience. Furthermore, the big data analysis method is used to fit and analyze the data to see which groups of people in each age group are the real benefits of blockchain technology. Using the single variable method to compare the convenience of traditional e-agriculture and sustainable e-agriculture based on block chain. Variance analysis and comparison of data were performed using SPSS19.0 analysis software one-way ANOVA program. Data results were expressed in the form of mean value. According to the experimental data, the e-commerce applications of fresh commodities, whole grains and aquatic products have reached a high degree of convenience, while the convenience of valuable commodities and fragile commodities is lower. However, compared with the traditional e-agriculture, the convenience has increased by more than 15%. In the middle and young age, blockchain projects all get outstanding convenient data; only in the middle and old age, the data is lower. Experimental data show that sustainable electronic agriculture based on blockchain technology brings great convenience to farmers’ sales, increasing by 25% on average compared with traditional electronic agriculture, which will bring vigorous vitality to the sustainable development of agricultural products.","This work was supported by General Project of Shaoyang Science and Technology Bureau 2018NS26 Research on the Application of Collaborative filtering recommendation algorithm in Personalized Agricultural Information recommendation Service.This work was supported by Provincial Key Laboratory of Informational Service for Rural Area of Southwestern Hunan of Shaoyang University.This work was supported by Guangxi Science and Technology Program Project of China (GK-AA17202037), (GK-AD18281072), (GK-AD19245169).",,Journal of Cleaner Production,,,,2020-10,2020,,2020-10,271,,122503,Closed,Article,"Li, Xiaohong; Wang, Daobo; Li, Maolin","Li, Xiaohong (Department of Information Engineering, Shaoyang University, Shaoyang, 422000, Hunan, China; Graduate School, Adamson University, Manila, 1000, Philippines); Wang, Daobo (College of Agriculture, Yulin Normal University, Yulin, 537000, Guangxi, China); Li, Maolin (Department of Information Engineering, Shaoyang University, Shaoyang, 422000, Hunan, China)","Wang, Daobo (Yulin Normal University)","Li, Xiaohong (Shaoyang University; Adamson University); Wang, Daobo (Yulin Normal University); Li, Maolin (Shaoyang University)",49,22,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1128675142,33 Built Environment and Design; 40 Engineering,2 Zero Hunger

Primarily, this research work is focused on the provenance of obsidian recovered in lithic assemblages of the Alero Cuevas, Abrigo Pozo Cavado, Abra de Minas and Cueva Inca Viejo sites, located in the Puna of Salta. These sites have radiocarbon dates between ca. 10000 BP and 500 BP. Specifically, the obsidian sources were determined through the analysis of samples by energy dispersive X-ray fluorescence (XRF). As a result, the circulation of obsidian from diverse areas of the Puna allowed me to analyse human interaction on different spatial scales, which even covered distances of around 300 km. Likewise, a brief description of other archaeological indicators was made in order to study this topic, including morphological and technological changes in the lithic material, the presence of feathers, wood and seeds from the lowlands, and the caravans of camelids in the rock-art. Finally, the results presented are also important for understanding the transmission of cultural information within processes of interaction on broad spatial and chronological scales in the South-central Andes.","First of all, I would like to thank Michael Glascock for the analysis and the detailed report about the obsidian recovered at the sites presented.

However, these are ephemeral behaviors which are difficult to reconstruct archaeologically. Here, we employ geospatial approaches to reconstruct mobility corridors likely used by Tiwanaku migrants during the Andean Middle Horizon, ca. AD 500–1000. Prehispanic mobility relied on caravans of Andean camelids. We reconstruct probable mobility corridors while comparing cost- and permeability-based modeling approaches. We further use remote sensing to examine how modern ecological dynamics relate to modeled mobility corridors. Imagery from the Landsat family of multispectral satellites is used to document the response of green vegetation to seasonal and interannual moisture variability. We find that there is a statistically significant increase in the amount of perennially-green vegetation land cover along the corridor linking Tiwanaku with its principal colonial enclaves on the Pacific coast. Such perennially-green vegetation provides a critical resource for prehispanic caravans. The data indicate a relationship between high volumes of migration and enhanced vegetation. We explore whether Tiwanaku migration routes were established in part on the basis of this resource, or if modern land cover reflects an anthropogenic legacy.",Landsat and Shuttle Radar Topography Mission Global 1 arc second data data were made available by NASA&#x27;s Land Processes Distributed Active Archive Center (LP DAAC) at: https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/.

552,pub.1124280374,10.1016/j.palaeo.2020.109624,,,Timing of the Late Palaeozoic glaciation in western Gondwana: New ages and correlations from Paganzo and Paraná basins,"During the Late Palaeozoic, the Gondwana supercontinent formed an extensive Southern Hemisphere landmass that was affected by multiple glacial episodes, known collectively as the Late Palaeozoic Ice Age (LPIA). This resulted in the deposition of glacial, periglacial and deglacial sediments over much of the supercontinent. The Mississippian to early Pennsylvanian phase of glaciation is widely represented along the western margin of Gondwana. This constitutes one of the largest glaciations of the Phanerozoic in terms of its recorded extent and the widespread erosional hiatus it produced in the stratigraphic record. It was this mid Carboniferous glaciation, recorded in the Paganzo Basin of NW Argentina, that carved most of the paleovalleys and paleofjords present there. We report new U-Pb zircon ages from a single glacial succession (Guandacol Formation) of 326 ± 3 Ma and 320 ± 5 Ma, that in comparison with neighbouring dated sequences allow for the first time a reliable estimate of the timing and duration of glacial cycles. Palynological studies of these glacial-deglacial events yielded palynoassemblages of the MQ (Late Visean) and DMa (Sepukhovian-Bashkirian) Palynozones. The Carboniferous glacially-related strata and glacial cycles of the Paganzo Basin are compared here with equivalent units of the Paraná Basin of SE Brazil, suggesting a similar climate record for most of western Gondwana. We propose a new correlation between these two basins. The new U-Pb zircon ages reported here indicate that a regional glacial peak occurred almost coincident with the Mississippian-Pennsylvanian boundary, suggesting that the ensuing postglacial transgression is the best regional marker to differentiate the Mississippian and Pennsylvanian as it forms an identifiable interbasinal horizon. The biostratigraphic and chronostratigraphic comparison with other LPIA successions from South America reinforces that the First Appearance Datum of monosaccate pollen grains occurs in the late Serpukhovian. Their correlation confirms that similar climate conditions prevailed across most of western Gondwana during this phase of the LPIA.","This work is part of a research project supported by BG Brazil E P Ltd. entitled “Carboniferous de-Glacial record in the Paraná Basin and its analogue in the Paganzo Basin of Argentina: Impacts on reservoir predictions”.

377,pub.1124832412,10.1002/jac5.1208,,,Evaluation of pharmacy students' perceptions of clinical pharmacy in South Africa,"Abstract  Introduction The University of the Western Cape (UWC) is integrating clinical, hospital‐based experiential learning into the final year of its pharmacy education. As clinical pharmacy continues to expand in South Africa, students' perceptions of the evolving field are not yet described in the literature.   Objectives The purpose of this study was to describe UWC's pharmacy students' perceptions of clinical pharmacy practice as it continues to develop in South Africa.   Methods This study was a cross‐sectional, observational study of second, third, and fourth year pharmacy students at UWC. The 18‐item questionnaire was distributed via an online survey tool to participants during the second semester of the 2018 academic year.   Results One‐hundred forty nine (52%) students completed the survey. Ninety‐four percent of students had previous experience in a pharmacy setting but only 28.2% had experience observing a clinical pharmacist. UWC students felt that practicing clinical pharmacy is valuable (median 5 ± 0) and did not think it takes too much time and effort (median 2 ± 1), but also believed that there are barriers to its practice (median 4 ± 1). Overall, they did not think they had adequate training in clinical pharmacy (median 3 ± 2) and agreed that further training is required in order to practice clinical pharmacy (median 5 ± 1).   Conclusion Pharmacy students at UWC had an overall positive outlook on the practice of clinical pharmacy. Students at UWC School of Pharmacy are exposed to an innovative clinical experiential program that may have influenced their perceptions of clinical pharmacy, but still feel further clinical training beyond their curricula is required to adequately practice clinical pharmacy. Future research should focus on other pharmacy students' and pharmacists' perceived barriers to practicing clinical pharmacy as the field continues to evolve in South Africa.",CONFLICT OF INTEREST The authors declare no conflicts of interest.,,JACCP JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN COLLEGE OF CLINICAL PHARMACY,,,,2020-02-11,2020,2020-02-11,2020-09,3,6,1065-1071,Closed,Article,"Ilcewicz, Haley N.; Coetzee, Renier; Taylor, Mary; Piechowski, Kara; Martello, Jay L.; Wietholter, Jon P.","Ilcewicz, Haley N.

The observations were carried out using the first prototype of the high-resolution fiber-opticspectrograph of the 6-m BTA telescope, and with the BOES spectrograph of Bohyunsan Optical Astronomy Observatory of the Korea Astronomy and Space Science Institute. The MASCARA-3b mass estimates are presented to demonstrate the performance of the new BTA spectrograph and do not differ from the measurements of other authors within the errors. The KOI-974 mass estimate upper constraint is new. Assuming a circular orbit, the exoplanet mass does not exceed 0.16 MJup. More complex orbital shapes are not visible at the radial velocity half-amplitude level of more than 20 m s−1, which classifies this exoplanet as the neptunes. Only four observations were obtained for the planetary candidate TOI-1797.01, which is insufficient for its confident classification. Meanwhile, the candidate’s radial velocity values based on these four observations rule out its stellar nature.",,,Astrophysical Bulletin,,,,2020-10,2020,2021-01-14,2020-10,75,4,437-439,Closed,Article,"Gadelshin, D.

The objective of using magnesium as a dopant was to evaluate its impact on crystal growing mechanisms and on the defects so as to employ the diamonds in cutting tools, once the synthetic parameter values are smaller than those found in the literature. The crystal morphology depicted a transformation from octahedral to cube-octahedral shape as Mg was weight increased. According with the results from Raman spectroscopy, full width at half maximum (FWHM), residual stress, X-ray diffraction (XRD), the high Mg crystals presented a solubility limit during the diamonds synthesis, with druses at 4 and 5 wt% of Mg and a noticeable displacement peak in XRD and Raman spectra.",The authors thank FAPERJ and CNPq agencies.,,Journal of Crystal Growth,,,,2020-11,2020,,2020-11,550,,125888,Closed,Article,"Soffner, L.T.S.; dos Santos, A.A.A.; Trindade, D.W.; Filgueira, M.; Azevedo, M.G.","Soffner, L.T.S.

Comparatively, low GO:G ratios with alkali GO suspension promoted GO–G interactions for covalent aerogels. In contrast, high GO:G ratios under acidic conditions promoted noncovalent interactions. Scanning electron microscopy showed heterogeneous structures with pore sizes of 53.26 ± 25.53 µm and 25.31 ± 10.38 µm for covalent and noncovalent aerogels, respectively. The synthesis method did not influence the surface charge; however, differences were depending on the GO content and their chemical activation, shifting from 15.63 ± 0.55 mV to − 20.53 ± 1.07 mV. Noncovalent aerogels presented higher absorption ratios in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) solution (35.5 ± 2.4 gPBS/gaerogel–49.6 ± 3.8 gPBS/gaerogel) than covalent aerogels. Therefore, due to these properties, noncovalent aerogels could be more useful than covalent aerogels for absorption potential applications, as biomedicine or water-treatment, where the promotion of surface interactions and high absorption capability is desired.","We thank the FONDECYT-Chile for their financial support of this investigation, Project No. 1170681.

Reported perovskite oxynitrides show centrosymmetric structures, and for some of them high permittivities have been observed and ascribed to local dipoles induced by partial order of nitride and oxide. Reported here is the first hexagonal perovskite oxynitride BaWON 2 , which shows a polar 6H polytype. Synchrotron X‐ray and neutron powder diffraction, and annular bright‐field in scanning transmission electron microscopy indicate that it crystalizes in the non‐centrosymmetric space group P6 3 mc, with a total order of nitride and oxide at two distinct coordination environments in cubic and hexagonal packed BaX 3 layers. A synergetic second‐order Jahn–Teller effect, supported by first principle calculations, anion order, and electrostatic repulsions between W 6+ cations, induce large distortions at two inequivalent face‐sharing octahedra that lead to long‐range ordered dipoles and spontaneous polarization along the c axis. The new oxynitride is a semiconductor with a band gap of 1.1 eV and a large permittivity.","Acknowledgements This work was supported by the Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovación, Spain (MAT2017‐86616‐R, MAT2017‐85232‐R, SEV‐2015‐0496, MDM‐2017‐0767, PGC2018‐096955‐B‐C44 and PGC2018‐093863‐B‐C22) and the Generalitat de Catalunya (2017SGR1377, 2017SGR581, 2017SGR1506 and 2017SGR1289).

Nonetheless, in undergraduate courses, the modeling of binary systems typically disregards the time of contact and the effects of gravity, which yields to a constant coefficient of restitution (COR) and, as a consequence, prevents students from elucidating the real dependence of COR with impact speed. In this work, we proposed a simple experimental setup to investigate the impact dynamics of a spring-mass body that bounces on a rigid plate as well as a theoretical framework that captures the velocity dependence of the COR for low-impact speeds. Our analytical expression for the COR highlights the role-played by gravity, impact speed and collision time on the collision dynamics. Our results suggest that the inclusion of gravity force allows an adequate estimation of the critical impact speed and maximum deformation distance, crucial parameters to differentiate between repulsive and attractive interaction regimes.

This macroalga grows naturally on the Chilean coast and has been cultivated for several years. However, to achieve a sustainable exploitation over time, it is necessary to increase the effectiveness of the commercial cultivation of this seaweed. In order to carry this out, we study a system of bottom cultivation in 6.4 ha of sea in the Coquimbo Region, north of Chile. Our results suggest that cultivation is cost effective under the conditions used for the majority of commercial cultures of this type in Chile. We found that the culture provides a positive net present value, but only in the long term, specifically if the cultivation continues operating for at least 8 years. Finally, results show that saving money in all steps of the production process is important to improve the profitability of this culture.",,,Journal of Applied Phycology,,,,2020-06-26,2020,2020-06-26,2020-10,32,5,3233-3242,Closed,Article,"Zuniga-Jara, Sergio; Contreras, Catalina","Zuniga-Jara, Sergio (Escuela de Ciencias Empresariales, Universidad Católica del Norte, Larrondo, 1281, Coquimbo, Chile); Contreras, Catalina (Escuela de Ciencias Empresariales, Universidad Católica del Norte, Larrondo, 1281, Coquimbo, Chile)","Zuniga-Jara, Sergio (Catholic University of the North)","Zuniga-Jara, Sergio (Catholic University of the North); Contreras, Catalina (Catholic University of the North)",11,2,,2.82,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1128799236,"30 Agricultural, Veterinary and Food Sciences; 3005 Fisheries Sciences",
268,pub.1126818962,10.1111/oik.07156,,,A tradeoff between fitness‐related traits mask facilitation in a semiarid ecosystem,"In stressful environments, a nurse plant can ameliorate harsh biotic and abiotic conditions for another plant species that grows within its canopy. This canopy can act as a barrier for herbivores, reducing damage to the protected plants inside, but it can also reduce access to pollinators possibly resulting in a tradeoff between survival and reproductive output. In a semi‐arid ecosystem, the shrub Porlieria chilensis acts as a nurse, increasing soil moisture, nutrients and reducing temperature inside its canopy compared to open areas. Flourensia thurifera is one of the beneficiary shrubs that can grow inside P. chilensis , where it shows increased survival and performance compared to open areas. However, growing inside P. chilensis ’ canopy may reduce pollinator visit. We aim to evaluate the possible tradeoff between survival and reproduction in F. thurifera individuals growing inside and outside the canopy of P. chilensis . This was achieved through a field experiment were we measured survival, pollinator visits and seed output of F. thurifera plants growing inside and outside the canopy of P. chilensis . Flourensia thurifera individuals had a higher survival when growing within the canopy of P. chilensis and had lower pollinator visits and seed output compared to plants growing in open areas. Thus, we found a significant negative correlation between plant survival and seed output considering both conditions (inside or outside nurses), evidencing a tradeoff between these traits. The tradeoff evidenced here could have large impact at the population and community level. On one hand, this tradeoff could mask possible nurse effects in other species, since they could show a similar net fitness in both microhabitat (inside or outside nurses). Finally, we propose a theoretical model to assess the change in the shape of this tradeoff under future climatic conditions where temperature and precipitation are predicted to vary due to climate change.",,,Oikos,,,,2020-05-08,2020,2020-05-08,2020-08,129,8,1196-1203,Closed,Article,"Molina‐Montenegro, Marco A.; Baldelomar, Mariela; Atala, Cristian; Torres‐Díaz, Cristian","Molina‐Montenegro, Marco A.

We compute analytically the effective potential in the high- and low-temperature approximations up to sixth order, including the contribution of the ring diagrams to account for the plasma screening properties. We determine the model parameters, namely, the couplings and mass-parameter, from conditions valid at the first order phase transition at vanishing temperature and, using the Hagedorn limiting temperature concept applied to finite baryon density, for a critical baryochemical potential of order of the nucleon mass. We show that when using the set of parameters thus determined, the second order phase transition line (our proxy for the crossover transition) that starts at finite temperature and zero baryon chemical potential converges to the line of first order phase transitions that starts at zero temperature and finite baryon chemical potential to determine the critical end point to lie in the region 5.02<μBCEP/Tc<5.18$$5.02<\mu _B^{\tiny {\text{ CEP }}}/T_c<5.18$$, 0.14","A.

239,pub.1127992981,10.1093/zoolinnean/zlaa067,,,Phylogenetic position and morphological descriptions of Chiton species from the south-eastern Pacific,"Abstract In the south-eastern Pacific Ocean (SEP), six species of the genus Chiton have been recorded. However, the taxonomic status and geographic distribution of some of these species is controversial. In this study, we compare and describe Chiton species in the SEP. More than 3000 specimens of six species from 49 localities were analysed for morphological features. Among these, 27 specimens of the six species from the SEP were sequenced for the mitochondrial barcode region (COI) and ribosomal 16S and 18S to infer phylogenetic relationships. Phylogenetic reconstruction indicates that the genus Chiton in the SEP represents a polyphyletic group and confirms the placement of C. barnesii in Chiton and not in Radsia, as previously suggested. Among Chiton s.s., C. cumingsii is the sister-species of C. magnificus, while C. granosus is a sister-species of C. barnesii. This analysis also indicates that C. bowenii is a junior synonym of C. magnificus. Our results improved the knowledge of systematics and distribution of Chiton species in the SEP, suggesting the presence of five valid species of the genus. In this study, we designate a lectotype for C. cumingsii and a neotype for C. granosus.","This study was supported by Fondo Nacional de Desarrollo Científico y Tecnológico (FONDECYT) 1130266 and FONDECYT 11181320 granted to C.

From an optical point-of-view, pure thin metal films yield enhanced light absorption due to their cavity effects. However, an ideal metal–semiconductor photodetector requires not only high absorption, but also long hot carrier attenuation lengths in order to efficiently collect excited carriers. Here we demonstrate that Ag-Au alloys provide an ideal model system for controlling the optical and electrical responses in nanoscale thin metal films for hot carrier photodetectors with improved performance. While pure Ag and Au have long hot carrier attenuation lengths >20 nm, their optical absorption is insufficient for high efficiency devices. Instead, we find that alloying Ag and Au enhances the absorption by ∼50% while maintaining attenuation lengths >15 nm, currently limited by grain boundary scattering, although the electron attenuation length of pure Au outperforms pure Ag as well as all of the alloys investigated here. Further, our density functional theory analysis shows that the addition of small amounts of Au to the Ag lattice significantly enhances the hot hole generation rate. Combined, these findings suggest a route to high efficiency hot carrier devices based on metallic alloying with potential applications ranging from photodetectors and sensors to improved catalytic materials.","We thank the FabLab at the Maryland Nanocenter for access to all fabrication equipment, including, but not limited to, the e-beam evaporator, the AJA sputter deposition tool, and the Woollam Spectroscopic Ellipsometer.

It argues that this shift reveals three important features of social movements and movement intellectuals more generally. Firstly, it uncovers the meaningful, value-driven, emotional and collective-identity bases for action, alongside the more familiar instrumental motivations. Secondly, given the inevitable clash between movement intent and the contingent constraints under which movements invariably operate, it argues that movement success is better judged not by external criteria that are assumed to hold universally, but instead by reference to the unique strategic intentions articulated by movements themselves. Finally, it shows how, given heterogeneous audiences, the deployment of a diversity of grounded intellectual strategies can help augment the resonance of a movement’s core political message.","This paper benefited from feedback from participants at the ‘Aspiring to Public Engagement’ panel at the ECPR conference at the University of Hamburg in 2018, and the conference on ‘Intellectuals and Politics: Historical and Sociological Perspectives’ at Selwyn College, Cambridge in 2019.",,The Sociological Review,,,,2020-01-10,2020,2020-01-10,2020-09,68,5,1124-1142,Closed,Article,"Morgan, Marcus","Morgan, Marcus (University of Bristol, UK)","Morgan, Marcus (University of Bristol)","Morgan, Marcus (University of Bristol)",5,1,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1124014690,44 Human Society,

We choose a biographical methodology that allows us to magnify the life story of a female union leader working in a male-dominated field in Chile. The findings show that female miners are under constant tension of subordination and subversion as members and leaders of a union that, until recently, had been dominated by males. Likewise, these women have had to search for validation while working during complex periods of female emancipation characterized by, on the one hand, grants of autonomy, and on the other hand, a means for domination caused by gender and labor gaps in the workplace.","Thanks to FONDECYT team 1180079, Jimena Silva Segovia, Pablo Zuleta Pastor and Estefany Castillo Ravanal.",This work was supported by the FONDECYT (National Fund for Scientific and Technological Development) 1180079.,Gender Place & Culture,,,,2020-11-12,2020,2020-11-12,2021-09-02,28,9,1286-1305,Closed,Article,"Chinga, Tarut Segovia","Chinga, Tarut Segovia (School de Psychology, Faculty of Humanities, Universidad Catolica del Norte, Antofagasta, Chile)","Chinga, Tarut Segovia (Catholic University of the North)","Chinga, Tarut Segovia (Catholic University of the North)",2,2,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1132590025,44 Human Society,5 Gender Equality

Strain gauges glued to specimens directly measure electrical resistance, while displacement sensors, typically linear variable differential transformers (LVDTs), indirectly measure linear displacements. However, no guidance is available regarding how to position the LVDTs to accurately measure axial or radial strain. A common practice is to measure axial strain with displacement sensors on the basis of the reduction in span between steel platens in relation to specimen height. If the deformational response for axial strain measured using strain gauges and displacement sensors is compared, however, it may be that neither maximum axial strain nor elastic constants are the same. This paper describes an approach to correcting platen-to-platen displacement measurements based on energy calculations at different scales in Olkiluoto gneissic rock specimens, with control specimens tested by combining strain gauge and displacement sensor measurements. It is suggested that the approach may be adaptable to other rocks.",Posiva Oy (Helsinki) is acknowledged for publication permission of partial findings associated with the development of the research project entitled “Scale effect of intact Olkiluoto gneissic rocks through uniaxial compressive testing and geophysical measurements” by the University of Vigo.,,Bulletin of Engineering Geology and the Environment,,,,2020-06-18,2020,2020-06-18,2020-11,79,9,4975-4997,Closed,Article,"Alejano, Leandro R.; Arzúa, Javier; Estévez-Ventosa, Xián; Suikkanen, Johannes","Alejano, Leandro R.

During the real estate crisis, the rate of property tax delinquency in the city exceeded 50%. The demolition of dilapidated structures could lead to improvements in tax compliance in two ways. The first is through an amenity effect: removal of blighted structures improves the neighborhood and thus may increase the likelihood that neighbors pay their property taxes. The second is via the existence of a peer effect in property tax compliance decisions. We use a 6-year panel database to examine the degree to which demolitions affect nearby residential property tax delinquency. Even though we are unable to disentangle the amenity and peer effects, our analysis shows that when a dilapidated property is demolished, tax delinquency within the neighborhood is reduced, providing evidence that demolitions improve tax compliance.",The authors wish to thank all the anonymous reviewers that participate in this process; their helpful comments strengthened the paper in multiple dimensions.

This work analyzes the spatio-temporal dynamics of municipal business start-up rates in Chile between 2005 and 2015 using spatial panel data for 342 Chilean municipalities from the Internal Revenue Service (SII) database and the National Municipal Information System (SINIM). We employ descriptive statistics, spatial analysis, Markov chains and econometric models to identify persistence and change in the start-ups rates and identify the determinants of the spatio-temporal dynamics in entrepreneurship rates. Results confirm a high level of persistence in the most and least entrepreneurial areas of the county but, at the same time, show mobility in the intermediate municipalities. Econometric models confirm that past rates of entrepreneurship can explain current business start-up rates, and also validate the influence of spatially sticky characteristics, in many cases related to extreme differences in economic development among Chilean municipalities. Increasing diversity and urbanization favour persistence and change, while density, poverty, mining activity and the percentage of large firms and mining have a negative impact.

As a result of its high affinity, there is shift of the oxyhemoglobin dissociation curve, compromising oxygen transport and delivery to tissues. Our study aim was to evaluate COHb elevation on admission as a predictor of worse outcomes in burn patients.
METHODS: This is a 10-year retrospective review of the American Burn Association Burn Registry from 2002 to 2011. We stratified the patients into 2 groups: adult patients with normal COHb on admission (group 1) versus elevated COHb (group 2). Elevated COHb levels were defined as greater than 10% on the first arterial blood gas. Outcome measures included in-hospital mortality rate, hospital length of stay (LOS), intensive care unit LOS (ICU-LOS), and ventilator days. χ and t test analyses were used with significance defined as a P value of less than 0.05.
RESULTS: A total of 6365 burn patients meet our inclusion criteria. There were 5775 patients in group 1 and 590 patients in group 2. Group 1 had an average age of 39.29 years compared with 42.62 years in group 2. The total body surface area was higher in group 1 compared with group 2 (6.24 vs 4.65) and with a statistically significant increase in partial thickness burns at 4.97 in group 1 compared with 3.27 in group 2. There was no statistically significant difference between the 2 groups in terms of full thickness total body surface area. The hospital LOS was significantly higher in group 2 compared with group 1 (15.34 vs 9.66). There was a significantly higher ICU-LOS at 12.89 days in group 2 compared with 4.01 in the group 1 (P = 0.0001, t test). There were higher ventilator days in group 2 at 9.23 than those in group 1 at 2.05 (P < 0.0001, t test). The in-hospital mortality was also significantly higher in group 2 at 15.59% than in group 1 at 1.33% (P = 0.0001, χ).
CONCLUSIONS: Elevated COHb on admission was associated with an increased hospital and ICU-LOS, average ventilator days, and in-hospital mortality. The presence of elevated COHb of greater than 10% on an initial arterial blood gas suggests worse outcomes and increased need of resource utilization during the index hospital admission.",,,Annals of Plastic Surgery,,,Adult; Biomarkers; Burns; Carboxyhemoglobin; Humans; Intensive Care Units; Length of Stay; Retrospective Studies; Treatment Outcome,2020-07-06,2020,2020-07-06,2020-10,85,4,376-378,Closed,Article,"Puyana, Salomon; Ruiz, Samuel; Amador, Francisco; Hai, Shaikh; Young, Elizabeth; Lim, Rizal; Askari, Morad; McKenney, Mark; Mir, Haaris","Puyana, Salomon (From the Department of Surgery, Kendall Regional Medical Center, Miami.); Ruiz, Samuel (From the Department of Surgery, Kendall Regional Medical Center, Miami.); Amador, Francisco (Department of Medicine, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia.); Hai, Shaikh (From the Department of Surgery, Kendall Regional Medical Center, Miami.); Young, Elizabeth (From the Department of Surgery, Kendall Regional Medical Center, Miami.); Lim, Rizal (From the Department of Surgery, Kendall Regional Medical Center, Miami.); Askari, Morad (From the Department of Surgery, Kendall Regional Medical Center, Miami.); McKenney, Mark (); Mir, Haaris (From the Department of Surgery, Kendall Regional Medical Center, Miami.)",,"Puyana, Salomon (Kendall Regional Medical Center); Ruiz, Samuel (Kendall Regional Medical Center); Amador, Francisco (Universidad del Norte); Hai, Shaikh (Kendall Regional Medical Center); Young, Elizabeth (Kendall Regional Medical Center); Lim, Rizal (Kendall Regional Medical Center); Askari, Morad (Kendall Regional Medical Center); McKenney, Mark (); Mir, Haaris (Kendall Regional Medical Center)",2,0,0.13,0.66,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1129021308,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3202 Clinical Sciences,

These infections are hard-to-treat mainly due to the increasing incidence of resistance. The overexpression of ATP-binding cassette and major facilitator superfamily transporters is the main responsible for the failure of antifungal therapies. In a Saccharomyces cerevisiae model, β-lapachone inhibited Pdr5p, a transporter homologous to those found in Candida albicans.
AIMS: To determine whether β-lapachone reverses the resistance phenotype mediated by efflux transporters in C. albicans clinical isolates.
METHODS: The antifungal activity of β-lapachone combined with fluconazole was measured by agarose chemosensitization and microdilution assays. CaCdr2p and CaMdr1p activities were evaluated through fluorescent dyes accumulation. ATPase activity was assessed using transporter-enriched plasma membranes.
RESULTS: β-lapachone reverted antifungal resistance of S. cerevisiae and C. albicans strains overexpressing CaCdr2p and CaMdr1p transporters by inhibiting these proteins activities. CaCdr2p ATPase activity was not impaired by the compound.
CONCLUSIONS: β-lapachone is a promising drug candidate to be used as an adjuvant in the treatment of candidiasis caused by fluconazole-resistant C. albicans strains.","We thank Brayan Bayona Pacheco (UNINORTE - Colombia) for correcting the Spanish version of the abstract, and Ms. Geralda Rodrigues Almeida for her technical support.",This work was supported by the Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior – Brazil (CAPES) – Finance Code 001.,Revista Iberoamericana de Micología,,,"Antifungal Agents; Candida albicans; Drug Resistance, Fungal; Fluconazole; Humans; Microbial Sensitivity Tests; Naphthoquinones; Saccharomyces cerevisiae",2020-07,2020,2020-11-20,2020-07,37,3-4,104-106,Closed,Article,"Moraes, Daniel Clemente; Reis de Sá, Leandro Figueira; Domingos, Levy Tenorio Sousa; Pinto, Maria do Carmo Freire Ribeiro; Soares, Rosangela Maria de Araújo; Ferreira-Pereira, Antônio","Moraes, Daniel Clemente (Laboratório de Bioquímica Microbiana, Departamento de Microbiologia Geral, Instituto de Microbiologia Paulo de Goés, Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.); Reis de Sá, Leandro Figueira (Laboratório de Bioquímica Microbiana, Departamento de Microbiologia Geral, Instituto de Microbiologia Paulo de Goés, Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.); Domingos, Levy Tenorio Sousa (Laboratório de Bioquímica Microbiana, Departamento de Microbiologia Geral, Instituto de Microbiologia Paulo de Goés, Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.); Pinto, Maria do Carmo Freire Ribeiro (Instituto de Pesquisas de Produtos Naturais, Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.); Soares, Rosangela Maria de Araújo (Laboratório de Bioquímica Microbiana, Departamento de Microbiologia Geral, Instituto de Microbiologia Paulo de Goés, Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.); Ferreira-Pereira, Antônio (Laboratório de Bioquímica Microbiana, Departamento de Microbiologia Geral, Instituto de Microbiologia Paulo de Goés, Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.

Therefore, it requires that patients with this condition to be attended in centers that have trained personnel and specific infrastructure. We aimed to identify the hospitals in Colombia that count on the minimum amount of medical specialties to manage this pathological condition and describe their general care practices.
METHODOLOGY: Observational study in 87 obstetric tertiary care centers in Colombia. The requested information was collected using a predesigned survey, applied to the reported hospitals, and stored in an electronic database.
RESULTS: Eighty-six hospitals were identified as possessing the capacity to care for women with accreta, of which 71 provided information (82.55% compliance). Although 83.09% of hospitals choose to treat patients with accreta, only 36.6% has a fixed group of specialists, 32.21% did not have interventional radiology, 25.36% did not have a blood bank, and 67.79% did not have intraoperative cell recovery devices; 77.46% of the surveyed hospitals had cared for five or fewer patients with accreta per year.
CONCLUSION: Most hospitals manage a low number of MAP cases per year, which are handled by shift specialists and not by a fixed group of professionals, which increases the difficulty of achieving expertise.","We would like to thank Dr. Francisco Edna and María Constanza Vargas, improvement and standardization coordinator, Fundación Valle de Lili.

Using a case study of Vietnam, this research aimed to explore the role of environmental characteristics, perceived risk, beliefs and lifestyle behaviours on the frequency of turn signal use at intersections. A self-administered questionnaire was distributed to motorcyclists (n = 527) and car drivers (n = 326) using online and offline methods. Using partial least squares structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM), key findings indicate that perceived risk, beliefs and environmental characteristics play a significant role in affecting the frequency of turn signal use among motorcycle riders and car drivers at intersections. While lifestyle behaviours were not found to be a good predictor of turn signal use among car drivers, they were found to indirectly affect turn signal use among motorcycle riders through the mediation of beliefs and perceived risk. The findings can help inform the development of more targeted measures to increase turn signal use.","The authors would like to thank the reviewers for their thoughtful comments and efforts towards improving the manuscript.

METHODS: We carried out an analytical observational cross-sectional study. The sample was composed of 494 students. A univariate analysis was carried out that estimated the prevalence of physical barriers faced by disabled people perceived by students and participation in university life. Given that the dependent variable, participation, was dichotomized, a bivariate logistic analysis was performed to explore the relationship between physical barriers perceived by students and participation in university life. Finally, a logistic regression model was conducted, obtaining an explanatory model to meet the objectives set.
RESULTS: Around 58% of students perceived that the snack bar and toilets inside the institution had low accessibility, because of inadequate signalling, ventilation and lighting. After adjustment of the logistic regression model for all the selected variables, transportation to the university was the only physical barrier related to participation in university life.
CONCLUSIONS: Accessibility is a key point for a truly inclusive educational institution. Therefore, universities should periodically carry out a survey to identify physical barriers.",,,Rehabilitación,,,Architectural Accessibility; Colombia; Cross-Sectional Studies; Disabled Persons; Humans; Students; Universities,2020-07-13,2020,2020-07-13,2021-01,55,1,22-29,Closed,Article,"Bolívar, S.M.

A systematic review and meta-analysis,"There are numerous epidemiological and experimental evidences to suggest that Ascaris lumbricoides infection is a neglected risk factor for development of asthma. For this purpose, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis for better understanding of this relationship. Systematic searching (PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science and Google Scholar) was done, up to September 30, 2019 to identify the relevant studies. We applied random-effects meta-analysis model to generate the overall odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Heterogeneity was assessed with I2 and τ2 statistic. Finally, 19 studies (totally 25 datasets), including 14 datasets with microscopic methods (1830 asthmatic patients (APs) and 3802 healthy controls (HCs)) and 11 datasets with serological methods (1543 APs and 3507 HCs) met the eligibility criteria. Considering to the serological methods, our results demonstrated that the APs had higher seroprevalence rate of A. lumbricoides (48.3% vs. 35.1%) than HCs, showing a significant association (pooled crude OR, 1.53; 95%CI, 1.07-2.18). Moreover, microscopic methods showed a higher prevalence of A. lumbricoides infection in the APs compared to the HCs (37.2% vs. 30.2%), but no significant association was found between APs and HCs (pooled crude OR, 1.19; 95%CI, 0.92-1.55). After adjustment for confounders, results showed no significant association for both serological (pooled adjusted OR, 1.43; 95%CI, 0.93-2.19) and microscopic (pooled adjusted OR, 1.05; 95%CI, 0.78-1.42) methods. Despite heterogeneous results, accurate and better quality studies are needed to determine the effect of A. lumbricoides infection on induction or exacerbation of asthma.","We thank the scientists and personnel of the Medical Parasitology Department in Tarbiat Modares University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, for their collaboration.","This research did not receive any specific grant from funding agencies in public, commercial, or not-for-profit sectors.",Microbial Pathogenesis,,,,2020-02-23,2020,2020-02-23,2020-05,142,,104099,Closed,Article,"Taghipour, Ali; Rostami, Ali; Sepidarkish, Mahdi; Ghaffarifar, Fatemeh","Taghipour, Ali (Department of Parasitology, Faculty of Medical Sciences, Tarbiat Modares University, Tehran, Iran.

The psychometric properties of PHQ-2 in the Colombian population are unknown.
METHODS: PHQ-2 were assessed in 243 patients in general medical consultations using the Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI) as the gold standard. Internal consistency, convergent validity and criterion validity were calculated by analyzing the Receptor Operating Characteristics (ROC) and the area under the curve (AUC).
RESULTS: Cronbach's alpha and McDonald's omega coefficients were 0.71. Spearman's rho coefficients for correlations with PHQ-9 and HADS-D scores were 0.63 and 0.59 (p<0.01). AUC was 0.89. The optimal cut point was ≥2 with the following indicators: sensitivity 0.87 specificity 0.74; Youden index 0.60; PPV 0.47; NPV 0.95; (LR+) 3.24; (LR-) 0.18 (95% CI 0.09-0.37). Kappa coefficient between PHQ-2 and MINI for depression was .458 and 0.46 for HADS-D.
LIMITATIONS: Since this study was done with people attending hospital, which could has implications for the prevalence of depression, affecting the validity indicators of the instrument.

The review mainly covers studies performed in the year 1995-2019 and the first-hand experience of the authors. References on the historical and prehistorical uses of the natural resource were also included.
RESULTS: In the last decades, most studies on the edible South American Prosopis focused on the constituents of pods meal, traditional preparations and by-products. Total 45 flavonoids, ellagic acid derivatives, catechin and simple phenolics were identified. Alkaloids occur mainly in the leaves, that are not used for human nutrition but as food for domestic animals. Piperidine alkaloids, tryptamine, tyramine and β-phenethylamine were isolated and identified from several species. The (bio)activity studies included mainly the antioxidant effect, antiinflammatory and enzyme inhibition associated with metabolic syndrome. The products showed no toxicity or mutagenic effect.
CONCLUSION: While data on the chemistry, some (bio)activities and toxicity are available for the pods meal and byproducts, little is known about the composition of the fermented Algarrobo beverages. Further studies are needed on the digestion of Algarrobo products both in humans and cattle.",Declared none.,,Current Pharmaceutical Design,,,Alkaloids; Animals; Anti-Inflammatory Agents; Antioxidants; Humans; Phytochemicals; Phytotherapy; Plant Extracts; Prosopis,2020,2020,,2020,26,5,542-555,Closed,Article,"Schmeda-Hirschmann, Guillermo; Theoduloz, Cristina; Jiménez-Aspee, Felipe; Echeverría, Javier","Schmeda-Hirschmann, Guillermo (Instituto de Química de Recursos Naturales, Universidad de Talca, Campus Lircay, 3460000, Talca, Chile, ;); Theoduloz, Cristina (Laboratorio de Cultivo Celular, Facultad de Ciencias de la Salud, Universidad de Talca, Campus Lircay, 3460000, Talca, Chile, ;); Jiménez-Aspee, Felipe (Departamento de Ciencias Básicas Biomédicas, Facultad de Ciencias de la Salud, Universidad de Talca, Campus Lircay, 3460000, Talca, Chile, ;); Echeverría, Javier (Departamento de Ciencias del Ambiente, Facultad de Química y Biología, Universidad de Santiago de Chile, Santiago de Chile, Chile)","Schmeda-Hirschmann, Guillermo (University of Talca)","Schmeda-Hirschmann, Guillermo (University of Talca); Theoduloz, Cristina (University of Talca); Jiménez-Aspee, Felipe (University of Talca); Echeverría, Javier (University of Santiago Chile)",11,3,0.54,2.16,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1123778918,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3214 Pharmacology and Pharmaceutical Sciences,

The system allows transparent commutation/combination among generators using a DC diode-based OR-gate scheme taking advantage of the renewable-sources nature and avoiding complex synchronization algorithms for the AC regime. The use of a diode-based structure is justified because an efficiency analysis shows that the associated efficiency of the scheme is close to 96%. Given the geographical location, the use of the solar resource is prioritized over other generators, whose operating voltage is therefore adjusted using DC/DC converters. Since a solar panel maximum power voltage is in fact a dynamic parameter, a fuzzy-logic controller is implemented to adjust the DC/DC converters output, which in turn minimizes grid consumption. Testing results show that the controller works properly with high accuracy and precision. Since reliability and grid consumption reduction are targeted, an automatic configuration agent is incorporated to operate the system in one of four predefined states. In tests spanning a complete day with blackout scenarios, the system can provide about 40% more energy to the users with a total grid consumption reduction close to 30%.","The authors thank Universidad del Norte for support given through the Energy Strategic Program and for the Renewable Energy Laboratory, UniGRID, supported by the autonomous patrimony national of funding for science, technology and innovation FRANCISCO JOSE DE CALDAS, COLCIENCIAS Code 57598 Grant 037-2018.",,International Journal of Electrical Power & Energy Systems,,,,2020-12,2020,,2020-12,123,,106253,Closed,Article,"Navarro, Loraine; M., Christian G.

In many of these countries, licensing examinations place added significance on terminology competence by requiring health science graduates to demonstrate mastery of English-language anatomy terms. In recent years, a wealth of research has shown active learning can offer many benefits over lecture-based, didactic approaches. Despite this work, very little has been done to test the potential of active learning in improving medical terminology performance. The present study explores this potential in two human gross anatomy lecture courses in South Korea, collecting performance and survey data from 399 undergraduates over a period of four years. Jigsaws, retrieval practice, and regular cumulative quizzing were used to mitigate three learning challenges specific to the study context: high vocabulary volume, low feelings of control over learning, and difficulties with exam preparation. The results show the reforms significantly improved both performance and learning attitudes, with students overwhelmingly favoring the use of new methods over lecture when taught using a mixture of both. Given that science learning often resembles the process of learning a foreign language, this study offers broad potential for improving terminology competence across disciplines, even for non-EFL students.","The author would like to thank the two instructors who were willing to take the leap of faith and join this study.

Fatigue cracking and rutting can be considered as the main distresses occurring in the pavement structure. Studies conducted in the past have shown improved mechanical performance of asphalt rubber mixtures, but only few of these studies are inclined in investigating the long-term mechanistic performance and the cost-effectiveness of the addition of rubber into asphalt mixtures. A mechanistic analysis utilising 3D Move software package was performed to assess the long-term fatigue performance and rutting performance of two different mixtures, namely: conventional hot mixed asphalt (HMA) and asphalt rubber (AR). Two different pavement construction scenarios were investigated as a newly constructed pavement structure and a rehabilitated overlay. Each mixture was analysed for two different vehicle speeds and two different pavement thicknesses that totalled 16 different 3D Move mechanistic analysis scenarios (2 asphalt mixtures × 2 construction scenarios × 2 vehicle speeds × 2 pavement thicknesses). The maximum tensile strain at the bottom of the asphalt layer for each scenario was utilised to establish a fatigue ratio that compared AR to the corresponding conventional HMA pavement sections. In addition, a cost-effectiveness analysis was carried out for the same 16 scenarios. Overall, the mechanistic analysis showed that the fatigue life of an AR was six times greater than that of conventional HMA layer for a new construction, and for the overlay, AR had 40 times more fatigue life than a conventional HMA. The rutting life was also increased with the use of asphalt rubber. In the case of cost-effectiveness analysis, AR exhibited four times lower cost per 1000 fatigue life cycles and three times lower cost per cycle of rutting when compared to a conventional HMA in a new construction. For an overlay scenario, AR exhibited 23 times lower cost per 1000 fatigue life cycles and around four times lower cost per cycle of rutting compared to a conventional HMA overlay.",,,Road Materials and Pavement Design,,,,2020-03-09,2020,2020-03-09,2020-09-14,21,S1,s76-s90,Closed,Article,"Souliman, Mena I.; Gc, Hemant; Isied, Mayzan; Walubita, Lubinda F.; Sousa, Jorge; Bastola, Nitish Raj","Souliman, Mena I.

In general, high temperatures were observed to be beneficial to the bottom of the asphalt layer – both the tensile and shear stresses decreased as the temperature was increased. By contrast, the shear stresses increased on the surface of the asphalt layer with an increase in temperature – thus, increasing the propensity to surface shear failure as the temperature increased. Overall, the results indicated that under elastic modelling assumptions, there is a high propensity for failure at the bottom of the asphalt and/or base layer due to high tensile stresses. With viscoelastic modelling assumption, however, the asphalt layer is more likely to suffer from surface shear failure due to high shear stresses on the surface.","The authors would like to express our gratitude to the editors and the reviewers for their constructive and helpful review comments.

The hexagonal phase ( α ) is obtained from three atomic layers truncated along the [001] direction of trigonal Te and Se bulk in the equilibrium structure. We found the α ‐Se structure dynamically stable. The calculated electronic structures of α ‐Se and α ‐Te show interesting semiconductor character for both electronic and optoelectronic applications. Furthermore, the obtained elastic properties show that hexagonal tellurene is a softer material than selenene. The thermoelectric figure of merit for hexagonal 2D phase (∼1.0) is larger than those reported for the tetragonal 2D phase (∼0.75) of selenium and tellurium. Additionally, the computed electrical and phonon transport parameters indicate that selenene and tellurene are promising thermoelectric materials; both offer an alternative to recovering residual heat and transforming it into electricity.","This work has been carried out with the support of Colciencias (Administrative Department of Science, Technology and Research of Colombia) under “Convocatoria 757 ‐ Convocatoria Doctorados Nacionales 2016.” The calculations reported in this paper were performed using GRANADO and HPC facilities at the Universidad del Norte.

                    The purpose of this paper is to provide a comprehensive methodology and a case study about the successful integration of FCA with continuous improvement tools for strategic decision-making processes. Reliable knowledge of the condition of tangible assets and their ability to fulfill their target activities over time are required for an assertive strategical decision process. Facility condition assessment (FCA) is a recognized methodology that allows the systematic evaluation of this performance. For those companies whose primary objective is the production of goods, decisions associated with improvements on the productive system or re-adaptation of existing assets may also require the implementation of alternative methodologies, with a direct impact on the indicators of the company and therefore on the FCA.
                  
                  
                    Design/methodology/approach
                    This study presents a methodology for the integration of FCA and lean manufacturing (LM) as a tool in strategic decision-making process that involves the integration of continuous improvement processes or significant changes in the production process, in which the condition of the installation impacts decisively the productivity of the system.
                  
                  
                    Findings
                    The results of the implementation on an insecticide and herbicide production plant indicate an increase of 33 per cent in the capacity of the formulation process and over 20 per cent reduction in the internal quality claims associated with the packaging system.

1900,pub.1131101452,10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2020.120761,,,Correlating the asphalt-binder high-temperature properties (DSR) to HMA permanent deformation (RLPD) and field rutting: A laboratory-field study,"Asphalt-binders are part of the key material constituents affecting the performance of hot-mix asphalt (HMA), and ultimately, the field performance of flexible pavement structures. Quite often, it is desired/useful to predict the HMA permanent deformation (viscoelastic) properties and field rutting from the asphalt-binder properties. Using the Texas flexible pavements and overlays database, namely the Texas Data Storage System (DSS), as the data source, this laboratory-field study was conducted to correlate the asphalt-binder properties to HMA permanent deformation (viscoelastic) properties and field HMA-layer rutting performance of in-service highway sections. Data extracted from the Texas DSS included asphalt-binder high-temperature rheological properties measured using the dynamic shear Rheometer (DSR) test, HMA permanent deformation (PD) and viscoelastic properties from the repeated load permanent deformation (RLPD) test, and field rut depth (RD) data for the HMA layers of in-service highway test sections. Two Texas asphalt-binder types, four HMA mixes, and four in-service field highway sections were used in the study. For some parametric comparisons, the corresponding results indicated good statistical correlations among the asphalt-binders, HMA mixes, and field rutting performance, with a coefficient of determination (R2 ) over 60%. Overall, the study findings indicated that the HMA PD properties and field HMA-layer rutting can be predicted from the asphalt-binder high-temperature rheological properties, with a linear or logarithmic model, to an accuracy exceeding 60%.","The authors thank the Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT) and the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) for their support, in particular to the Texas flexible pavements and overlays database (the Texas DSS) project that valuably served as the data source for the work presented in this paper.

The objective is to determine the staffing levels required to meet a desired service level at a minimum cost. First, data of the number of different requests were analysed to estimate hourly workload requirements. Then, an aggregate planning model were implemented to obtain an initial solution of the staffing levels considering workforce costs, service level, personnel hiring/migration and work supplements. These results were input of a discrete-event simulation model to assess the system performance based on queuing characteristics, demand variability and resources utilisation. Alternative schedules and capacity levels were evaluated to outperform current service quality and a better match with the demand variability. Proposed options provided better results with lower waiting times and more balanced resource utilisation. The approach is useful for planning capacity levels in projects and locating new centres.

Using a database comprising of a wide array of typical layer moduli and thicknesses of traditional flexible pavements, that were generated based on multiple Monte Carlo numerical simulations, as a reference datum, this study successfully developed probabilistic models that allow for analysing the condition of a flexible pavement, at the network level, from FWD surface deflection data, namely the Deflection Bowl Parameters (DBPs), to identify which layers of the pavement structure present a probability of structural failure or damage.","The authors thank all those who assisted, in one way or another, during the course of this study as well as the documentation of this paper.

In this mixed-methods study, we viewed 670 reflective tweets from 105 students in advanced English language courses at a private university in Latin America to measure the relationship between the depth of reflection of student tweets and their learning as demonstrated through their exam scores. We also applied a survey to capture students’ self-perceived ability to write deep reflections and the extent to which they believe this helped them succeed in the course. The result of regression analysis revealed a correlation between deeper reflections and better performance on student exams. We also found that students tended to overestimate their abilities to write deep reflections as the majority of tweets were more superficial. Furthermore, many students did not see a direct connection between their reflective practice and their final grade in the course but viewed reflection positively in terms of contributing to their learning.",,,Reflective Practice,,,,2020-06-19,2020,2020-06-19,2020-07-03,21,4,484-498,Closed,Article,"Corrales, Kathleen A.; Erwin, Trey Collier","Corrales, Kathleen A.

This study describes the challenges and opportunities for the scientific community devoted to bed form dynamics research in adopting such scientific paradigms through, for example, engineered data sharing, formal recognition of scientists who collect the data, and collaborative development of free accessible software. It highlights that once these actions are completed, the potential application of deep learning techniques could substantially improve bed form models and the scientific understanding of bed form dynamics. Likewise, it discusses the potential of Bedforms‐ATM, a free available software, to standardize some bed form data analysis techniques. We propose that the technical challenges be tackled by following scholarly accepted/proposed standards (e.g. FAIR Guiding Principles, Geoscience Papers of the Future), using the body of knowledge being built on the matter by some institutions (e.g. Federation of Earth Science Information Partners), and through technical discussions at scientific meetings such as MARID. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","Acknowledgements Ronald R.

Among these wastes, recycled concrete aggregate (RCA), due to its good residual physical, mechanical, mineralogical, and chemical properties, has attracted promising potential for re-use and incorporation in the construction of new infrastructural elements. These infrastructure applications include construction of sidewalks, curb and gutters, subbase/base layers, and/or as a partial replacement of natural aggregates (NA) in the production of hot mix asphalt (HMA) mixtures. In this laboratory study, experimental research work was conducted to evaluate the influence of RCA on the mechanical properties and performance of RCA modified HMA mixtures against a control HMA mixture without any RCA. RCAs were obtained from two different concrete sources, namely: (a) one from the demolition of a building (RCAB), and (b) another one from the rehabilitation of a Portland cement concrete pavement (RCAP). Both NA and RCA were characterized taking into account physical and mechanical properties. HMA mixtures were produced using the Marshall mix-design method by replacing 0.0% (control), 15%, 30%, and 45%, respectively, of the coarse NA fraction with RCA. Thereafter, laboratory testing (i.e., Scanning Electron Microscopy [SEM], resilient modulus, indirect tensile strength, etc.) including material property characterization and performance evaluation were conducted on HMA samples. Overall, the laboratory test results showed that the RCA modified mixtures exhibited a similar behavior to conventional HMA mixtures, but with greater environmental benefits and potential cost savings through the recycling and reuse of waste concrete aggregates. However, it was observed that the laboratory performance of RCA modified mixtures is strongly dependent on the RCA source and dosage, with RCAP exhibiting superior performance over RCAB. HMA mixtures produced with RCA provided higher optimum asphalt-binder content (OAC) than that of mixes with NA.","The authors thank the Administrative Department of Science, Technology and Innovation – Colciencias – Research Grant 745/2016, Contract 037 of 2017/Code 1215-745-59105, Universidad del Norte for sponsoring this research and the Universidad Distrital Francisco José de Caldas.

Among these strategies we can find grants and scholarships, financial aids, and others. Many have been the options that have been proposed to raise the provision of higher education programs, such as offering technology-supported education modalities like blended-learning, Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs), and distance and online education. This paper aims to explore the potential of the provision of distance education programs to close learning gaps in Colombia’s higher education. In order to do so, we present an estimatation of the effects that students and programs characteristics can have on the results of the test “Saber PRO” (a Colombian standardized test that measures the level of competences developed by students in different higher education programs). This estimation was done applying a mixed model (Hierarchical Linear Modeling-HLM) based on the information of 451,358 students who were assessed in their last phase of their university major. Data were collected from 2016 to 2018. The econometrics estimations show that controlling individuals’ backgrounds and the characteristics of different academic programs, the variables that were highly associated with the reduction of learning gaps among individuals registered in distance programs compared to face-to-face programs are the students’ age and their cognitive backgrounds (grades in standardized tests taken before their undergraduate studies). The results show that we could expect distance education to become an efficient mechanism to contribute to the reduction of learning gaps in higher education. The quantitative findings suggest a series of research questions that invite to reflect about the potential of distance education in medium-income countries.",Los autores agradecen de manera especial al Observatorio de Educación del Caribe Colombiano – OECC- por el apoyo brindado en la consecución de la Base de Datos del ICFES actualizada y en el procesamiento estadístico de los datos para la realización de los análisis del presente artículo.,,American Journal of Distance Education,,,,2020-04-02,2020,2020-05-26,2020-04-02,34,2,157-176,Closed,Article,"Ricardo, Carmen; Parra, Juan David; Borjas, Mónica; Cobo, Jorge Valencia; Cano, John","Ricardo, Carmen (Universidad Del Norte); Parra, Juan David (Universidad Del Norte); Borjas, Mónica (Universidad Del Norte); Cobo, Jorge Valencia (Universidad Del Norte); Cano, John (Universidad Del Norte)","Ricardo, Carmen (Universidad del Norte)","Ricardo, Carmen (Universidad del Norte); Parra, Juan David (Universidad del Norte); Borjas, Mónica (Universidad del Norte); Cobo, Jorge Valencia (Universidad del Norte); Cano, John (Universidad del Norte)",5,2,,3.33,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1127885965,"39 Education; 3902 Education Policy, Sociology and Philosophy; 3903 Education Systems",4 Quality Education

The causes of these cerebrovascular diseases are various, i.e., high blood pressure, heart disease, etc. For those who survive strokes, this affectation causes loss in the mobility of extremities, requiring the intervention of long sessions with a therapeutic professional to recover the movement of the impair limb. Hence, the investment to threaten this condition is usually high, motivating researchers to implements exoskeletons in the rehabilitation process. Those devices permit the user means to conduct the therapies without the constant supervision of a professional. Furthermore, exoskeletons are capable of maintaining a detailed recording of the forces and movements developed for the patients throughout the session. However, the construction of an exoskeleton is not cheap principally for the actuation systems, especially if the exoskeleton requires the actuator to be placed at the joints of the user; in which, the actuator at a joint would have to withstand the load of the actuator of the following joint and so on. Researchers have addressed this drawback by applying cable transmission systems that allow the exoskeleton to place their actuator at a fixed base, reducing the weight of their design, and decreasing their cost. Thus, this paper reviews the principal models of cable-driven exoskeleton for stroke rehabilitation focusing on the upper-limb. The analysis departs from the study of the anatomy of the arm, including the shoulder, elbow, wrist, fingers, and thumb. Besides, it also includes the mechanical consideration to design a proper exoskeleton. Then, the article presents a compendium of the different transmission systems found in the literature, addressing their advantages, disadvantages and their requirements for the design. Lastly, the paper reviews the cable-driven exoskeleton for stroke rehabilitation of the upper limb. Again, for this analysis, it is included the design consideration of each prototype, focusing on their advantages in terms of anatomical mechanics.",Declaration of Competing Interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.,,Robotics and Autonomous Systems,,,,2020-04,2020,,2020-04,126,,103445,Closed,Article,"Sanjuan, J.D.; Castillo, A.D.; Padilla, M.A.; Quintero, M.C.; Gutierrez, E.E.; Sampayo, I.P.; Hernandez, J.R.; Rahman, M.H.","Sanjuan, J.D.

1672,pub.1129476128,10.1016/j.apor.2020.102283,,,Morphodynamic response to extreme wave events of microtidal dissipative and reflective beaches,"In this work, the morphodynamic response of microtidal dissipative and reflective beaches to extreme wave events generated by hurricanes and cold fronts in the Colombian Caribbean was established. Two sandy beaches were used as case studies, Bocagrande (Cartagena, Bolívar Department) (dissipative) and Costa Verde (Ciénaga, Magdalena Department) (intermediate–reflective). The numerical models SWAN and XBeach were used to investigate wave propagation during storm conditions for selected cases and to determine morphological changes on the two beaches. Both models were calibrated using hydrodynamic and bathymetric data obtained in field campaigns pre and post-cold fronts. The results of the numerical models satisfactorily represented the real conditions on both beaches. It was shown that regardless of beach configuration, whether dissipative or intermediate–reflective, erosive processes had a greater magnitude during cold fronts (March 2009 and December 2017) than under hurricanes conditions. Bocagrande beach is more exposed to extreme wave events, mainly due to its characteristic dissipative profile. Infragravity wave energy, fundamental in sediment transport dynamics, is not reflected on the beach front, but is dissipated along the swash zone and drags sediment to the sea. By contrast, Costa Verde shows conservative coastline retreats: its intermediate–reflective morphologic configuration played a transcendental role. Infragravity wave reflection on the beach front does not allow a longer water extension over dry areas in the swash zone under storms.",This study was partially funded by Colciencias (FP44842-266-2016 Proyecto 121571250570 Convocatoria 712: “Turbulencia y mecanismos de disipación de energía de ondas gravitatorias e infragravitatorias en la zona de rompientes”).

Thermal performance of the devices was studied from experimental and mathematical approaches. For experimental approach, both collectors were operated and analyzed simultaneously under the same real outdoor conditions. An experimental set-up monitored solar radiation, water inlet and outlet temperature, ambient temperature, wind speed, and temperatures of main components as glass cover, absorber plate and PCM. Heat transfer rates losses, internal PCM behavior as liquid fraction of PCM and accumulated energy were estimated and discussed using a mathematical approach. In this method, experimental results were evaluated to assess the performance of both collectors under the same operating conditions. In addition, different experimental cases were considered in order to improve the thermal performance of the prototype. Two different PCMs, a contact thermal conduction enhancement, and inclination of the collectors were analyzed. Experimental and analytical results indicate that the contact conduction between the absorber and PCM, and the selection of the PCM itself are key factors to increase the collector performance respect to conventional FPSC, while tilting the collector presented no significant improvement in latitude of the experimental tests. The prototype with PCM increased the night outlet temperature in 2 °C and maximum accumulated energy increased 630 Wh respect to the collector without PCM. The proposed improvements for collector with PCM rose the maximum liquid fraction of PCM from 0.3 to 0.9.","This study was made thanks to the help of the “Formación de Capital Humano de Alto Nivel” program for the Norte de Santander department, national master, and the program “Es tiempo de volver” of COLCIENCIAS.",,Solar Energy,,,,2020-08,2020,,2020-08,206,,708-721,Closed,Article,"Palacio, Mario; Rincón, Anggie; Carmona, Mauricio","Palacio, Mario (Faculty of Mechanical Engineering, Universidad Pontificia Bolivariana, Montería, Colombia); Rincón, Anggie (Faculty of Engineering, Universidad Francisco de Paula Santander, Ocaña, Colombia); Carmona, Mauricio (Mechanical Engineering Department, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia)","Carmona, Mauricio (Universidad del Norte)","Palacio, Mario (Pontifical Bolivarian University); Rincón, Anggie (Francisco de Paula Santander University); Carmona, Mauricio (Universidad del Norte)",66,32,,16.27,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1128622821,"40 Engineering; 4009 Electronics, Sensors and Digital Hardware",7 Affordable and Clean Energy

The levels of four toxic heavy metals (Hg; Cr; Cd; Ni) present in 17 sediment samples of the Mallorquin lagoon Barranquilla (N Colombia) were investigated in order to assessing the potential risks of accumulation. The sample preparation was performed by acid microwave digestion with Multiwave system, carried out using GFAAS. High contamination levels, especially for Hg, Cr and Cd, were detected in samples M4 (0.199; 96.71; 1.212 g.g-1), M5 (0.153; 100.38; 1.076 g.g-1), M6 (0.140; 97.74; 1.850 g.g-1), M8 (0.122; 90.41; 1.023 g.g-1) y M9 (0.143; 100.92; 1.086 g.g-1). The results reflect the anthropogenic activities, as accelerated urbanization without planning, deposit for solid waste, contribution from the Magdalena River, affected by illegal mining. In addition, the Leon stream drains the entire metropolitan area by pouring into the lagoon a great amount of untreated sewage every day.

The introduction of domesticated plants into ancient hunting and gathering economic systems expanded and transformed human societies worldwide during the Holocene. These transformations occurred even in the oases and hyperarid environments of the Atacama Desert along the Pacific coast. Human groups inhabiting this desert incorporated adjacent habitats to the semi-tropical valleys through transitory or logistic camps like Morro Negro 1 (MN-1), in the Lluta valley (~12 km from the littoral in northernmost Chile), into their settlement patterns. During the earliest occupation (Late Archaic period, 5140–4270 cal yr BP) people collected and consumed wild plants, although crops such as Lagenaria were present. Following a gap of more than 2000 years between 4270 and 1850, people returned and introduced new domesticated plants at the site (Gossypium, Zea mays, Capsicum), which displaced the use of wild reed (Schoenoplectus) rhizomes as the chief staple during the first occupation. This change in food consumption was linked to the transformations that took place during the Archaic-Formative transition, but did not entirely shift the ways of life of these coastal marine hunter-gatherers.","We thank Prof. Eliana Belmonte for helping us to identify plant remains; Paola Salgado and Marco Villar for fixing the figures, and Carolina Santoro for English editing.

In the Drift Flux Model, the mean drift velocity of the gas phase is estimate using the drift velocity closure relationship. This study investigates the motion of a single elongated bubble in high viscosity stagnant liquids in order to propose a comprehensive closure relationship for the bubble drift velocity. Different cases were run with inclination angles varying from 0° (horizontal direction) to 90° (vertical upward). OpenFOAM, an open source Computation Fluid Dynamics software, was used to numerically solve the two-phase incompressible flow problem. Drift velocities based on the movement of the bubble tip and the void fraction weighted averaged were compared to clarify the ambiguity in the drift velocity calculation and measurement. For horizontal pipe cases, the deformation of the bubble caused the drift velocity to be higher at the tip of the bubble than the drift velocity inside the bubble. For inclination angles more than 0°, the drift velocity at the tip is the same as inside the bubble. The closure relationship proposed is validated against experimental data in the literature. The results indicate that the closure relationship has a maximum 10% absolute average relative error for the viscosity range of 0.14–1.120 P a · s , pipe size up to 0.152 m and pipe inclinations from 0° to 90°. The limitations of the closure relationship and potential enhancements for future studies are discussed.","OpenFOAM cases and files used to post-process the data are distributed with CC0 license to allow transparency.

Using data from the world economy and adopting the model of structural autoregressive vectors (VAR) employed by Kilian et al. (2009), oil prices shocks are estimated according to three types of origin: oil supply, oil demand and aggregate demand. Subsequently, using data from the Colombian economy, the effects that these shocks have on sectoral production in Colombia are estimated through the use of VAR models which allow direct impacts to be separated from those that are transmitted through the interrelations between sectors. The results obtained show that only the specific demand for oil and aggregate demand shocks affect significantly the total production in Colombia, although not in all sectors. Only manufacturing industry, and electricity, gas and water sectors are directly and significantly affected by both types of demand shocks. However, when considering the indirect effects, transmitted through the interrelations between sectors, it was found that the total impacts of these two types of shocks affect the construction, transport and trade, restaurants and hotels sectors. As the effect is positive, the Colombian economy benefits from increases in oil prices due to demand factors, but responds negatively when the opposite situation occurs.",,,Energy Economics,,,,2020-02,2020,,2020-02,86,,104691,Closed,Article,"Otero, Jorge David Quintero","Otero, Jorge David Quintero (Instituto de Estudios Económicos del Caribe, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia)","Otero, Jorge David Quintero (Universidad del Norte)","Otero, Jorge David Quintero (Universidad del Norte)",17,9,,6.79,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1124341892,38 Economics; 3801 Applied Economics; 3802 Econometrics,

The main challenge for further studies about optimization and design relies on finding accurate energy and exergy models capable of predicting diverse operating cycles with reduced computational resources. This paper describes the simulation and experimental validation of a PCM storage tank under multiple operational scenarios required in practice. Paraffin wax is used as PCM, contained in cylindrical bottles, to store and release energy during solid–liquid phase transformation. Simulation is addressed by using an integrated approach with both analytical and numerical methods, in which classic thermodynamic and heat transfer techniques are used to model the tank and the working fluid, and a finite difference formulation of the two-dimensional enthalpy method is implemented for the PCM. Experimental results were obtained by testing the system in laboratory conditions with different full 24-hour typical operating cycles, considering constant or variable inlet conditions during the thermal charging process along with constant flow rate discharge or batch-wise discharge. Predictions are in good agreement with experimental data. Lastly, the effects of key design parameters on the energy and exergy efficiencies of the PCM storage tank are also evaluated under different scenarios via parametric analysis of the model. Parameters considered in this study include the properties of PCM (mean melting temperature and latent heat of fusion), water flow rate, aspect ratio of the tank, and percentage of PCM inside the tank.","This study was made thanks to the help of the “Formación de Capital Humano de Alto Nivel” program for the Norte de Santander department, national master, and the program “Es tiempo de volver” of COLCIENCIAS.",,Energy Conversion and Management,,,,2020-10,2020,,2020-10,222,,113189,Closed,Article,"Carmona, Mauricio; Rincón, Anggie; Gulfo, Luis","Carmona, Mauricio (Department of Mechanical Engineering, Universidad del Norte, Colombia); Rincón, Anggie (Department of Mechanical Engineering, Universidad Francisco de Paula Santander Ocaña, Colombia); Gulfo, Luis (Department of Mechanical Engineering, Universidad del Norte, Colombia)","Carmona, Mauricio (Universidad del Norte)","Carmona, Mauricio (Universidad del Norte); Rincón, Anggie (Department of Mechanical Engineering, Universidad Francisco de Paula Santander Ocaña, Colombia); Gulfo, Luis (Universidad del Norte)",40,20,,6.79,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1129777898,40 Engineering; 4004 Chemical Engineering; 4008 Electrical Engineering; 4017 Mechanical Engineering,7 Affordable and Clean Energy

This paper shows a mathematical model as a decision support tool for crop maintenance planning problems. The model seeks the minimization of waste generated by the use of resources necessary for the task of crop maintenance. The model is inspired on the types of wastes from Lean Manufacturing (LM), which includes labor, use of machinery and operations in time windows that preserve the quality of harvest. The problem is modeled as a Mixed Integer Nonlinear Program (MINLP) in a case study on banana farms in Colombia. The model was tested with different scenarios, operations for crop maintaining, and number of workers. Then, we used the Response Surface Methodology (RSM) for sensitivity analysis, and obtain a significant reduction in cost, resources optimization, wastes, and schedule of crop maintenance activities: a reduction of 59% on the total cost was obtained, as well as a new approach for activities and task scheduling. The contributions of this paper to the body of knowledge in agricultural planning are at least twofold. Firstly, in contrast with traditional modeling approaches, this paper integrates the principles of lean manufacturing (LM) into the definition of parameters and constraints in a mathematical model for crop maintenance. Secondly, the paper couples nonlinear mathematical programming with response surface methodology (RSM) to carry out sensitivity analysis on the results obtained by the mathematical model. It is to note also that, although the modeling and solution methodology follow a case study research approach, it can be applied to other agricultural planning problem at operational level, being an economic option to minimize wastes and resources in others crops.","This work was funded by Departamento del Atlántico and the Colombian Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation of Colombia through a scholarship from the Program for High-Level Training (Grant number 673–2014).

To validate the proposed framework, a fuzzy inference system was developed with the aim to estimate reproductive performance (Juvenile infertility period - JIP, Generational time – GT, Average fertility – AF, Reproductive frequency – RF, Reproductive events number – REN and Longevity - Long) of the marine copepod cyclopina sp. submitted to different thermal water and pH values conditions and compared with other computational intelligence techniques (Artificial Neural Networks models and Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System - ANFIS). The results show that the determination coefficients (R2) for the six output variables for the Fuzzy Inference System – FIS were 0.991, 0.996, 1.0, 1.0, 0.999 and 1, respectively. The mean values of the standard deviations were 0.054 days, 0.047 days, 0.037 eggs, 0.061 h, 0.027 reproductive events, and 0.027 days respectively, representing mean percentage errors of 0.782, 0.583, 0.240, 0.181, 1.039, and 0.091%, showing a better accuracy, allowing the prediction of the reproductive performance to be more realistic. The Fuzzy Model produced more accurate predictions than other techniques (ANN and ANFIS). The proposed framework may provide an effective means to draw a pattern to the development of fuzzy systems.","The first author expresses his deep thanks to the Administrative Department of Science, Technology, and Innovation – COLCIENCIAS of Colombia and the Universidad del Norte for the Doctoral scholarship.

However, there is no standardised laboratory test methodology for screening and selecting grid materials during the HMA overlay design stage. This laboratory study was conducted to comparatively evaluate, characterize, and quantify the crack resistance potential of grid-reinforced HMA using the flexural bending beam fatigue (FBBF) test based on the AASHTO T 321 concept. Two grid materials, denoted as FA-30 and FA-75, were comparatively evaluated against Control (unreinforced) HMA beam samples as the reference datum. The study findings indicated that the FBBF test setup, in a load-controlled mode based on the AASHTO T 321 concept, has promising potential as a test method for evaluating and screening grid materials in the laboratory. Overall, the grid-reinforcements used in the study exhibited over 4.0 times superiority in terms of laboratory flexural cracking-resistance performance improvement with the potential of over 25% reduction in the HMA layer thickness. The average laboratory interlayer crack performance benefit factor (ICPF), computed based on the indicative mirroring of the AASHTO R 50-09 concept, was 10.60 for FA-75 versus 5.14 for FA-30 with respective to laboratory performance.","The authors would like to thank Ing.

Extensions of the Relative Concentration of Chain Carriers method, originally developed for predicting ignition delay time under variable thermodynamic conditions of surrogate liquids fuels, were proposed. These extensions are composed of four formulations, which were deduced from the Glassman's kinetic model for predicting knock occurrence crank angle in spark-ignition engines fueled with gaseous fuels. Cases of study of engines fueled with CH4/H2, H2/CO/CO2 and iC8H18/nC7H16 mixtures under Spark Ignition and Homogeneous Charge Compression Ignition mode were considered to assess the performance of the formulations working with hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), formaldehyde (CH2O), hydroperoxyl (HO2) and hydroxyl (OH) as chain carriers. According to the experimental measurements of knock occurrence crank angle for mixtures of CH4/H2, the formulation 1 defined as CC / CC crit = 1 , had the best performance working with H2O2 as a chain carrier. Moreover, to understand the role of the so-called chain carrier, a thermal sensitivity analysis, based on the relative contribution of key elementary reactions of the GriMech3.0 chemical kinetic mechanism on the total volumetric heat release rate was carried out. The analysis revealed that the elementary reactions that play an important role in the autoignition of a stoichiometric mixture of CH4/H2/50/50 were the chain propagating reactions R36, R116, and R168, the third body reactions R85 and R33, and finally, the chain branching reaction R119.","The authors would like to acknowledge the support granted by the Departamento Administrativo de Ciencia, Tecnologia e Innovacion (COLCIENCIAS, now MINCIENCIAS), the Universidad Técnica Federico Santa María and the Engines and Energy Conversion Laboratory at Colorado State University.",,Fuel,,,,2020-11,2020,,2020-11,279,,118352,Closed,Article,"Amador, German; Yepes, Hernando A.; Gonzalez-Quiroga, Arturo; Bula, Antonio","Amador, German (Grupo de Investigación de Motores y Combustibles Alternativos, Departamento de Ingeniería Mecánica, Universidad Técnica Federíco Santa María, Avenida España 1680, Valparaíso, Chile); Yepes, Hernando A.

In the field of foreign languages, academic failure is particularly concerning since English language instruction is compulsory in most universities. To address the issue of poor student performance and high dropout rates, the University of Colombia has set up a peer tutoring scheme (PTS) for English as a foreign language (EFL) students in order to inform programme development. The paper aims to discuss this issue.   Design/methodology/approach The study was informed by realist evaluation principles. Qualitative in-depth interviews were conducted with eight PTS stakeholders supplemented by documentary analysis of the programme’s publicity material on the PTS website. The data were analysed using thematic analysis.   Findings Findings reveal discrepancies between the “espoused theory” about how the programme operates and the “theory-in-use”. In particular, according to stakeholders, the programme does not appear to be used by many of those EFL students who would benefit from it, which suggests that the programme is not as effective as it could be. Student and teacher contextual factors and mechanisms may explain the reasons for issues with programme effectiveness.   Research limitations/implications Formative evaluations such as the current study can provide rich contextual information, but cannot be generalised to other settings. Also, this study does not explore the perspective of peer tutors and tutees, which means key variables may have been overlooked. Further research into the perspectives of tutors and tutees would therefore be needed to firm up these conclusions.   Practical implications Due to the scarcity of literature into EFL peer tutoring interventions in higher education (HE), it is hoped that these findings will have relevance for similar contexts. The current evaluation highlights the influence of contextual factors such as willingness to ask for help, student motivation, student priorities, tutor credibility, teacher workload, timetabling and scheduling issues and involvement from teachers on the success of open-access peer tutoring programmes for EFL students in higher educational settings.   Originality/value As far the researcher is aware, this is the first evaluation of an EFL peer tutoring programme in a private HE context in Colombia, and one of only a handful of studies into EFL peer tutoring programmes. The findings therefore have implications for those working in similar contexts.",,,International Journal of Educational Management,,,,2020-04-16,2020,,2020-04-16,34,5,869-880,Closed,Article,"Mackenzie, Lee","Mackenzie, Lee (Institute of Languages, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia)","Mackenzie, Lee (Universidad del Norte)","Mackenzie, Lee (Universidad del Norte)",0,0,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1123797327,39 Education,4 Quality Education

A reliable methodology is necessary to maintain the lifespan of these costly devices. This research presents a method for manipulating the heliostats’ aiming within a solar field by using a group behavior that relies on a single manipulated variable. This methodology addresses the problem by accounting for the heliostat position over the field, and a reduced number of the required groups. The work relies on the adaptation of an ordinary differential equation, commonly used to model conventional control valves, to establish the mean movement of the heliostats’ aiming within the group. Afterward, these values are coupled to predefined paths that set the direction of motion for each point. It is shown that the proposed approach can promote changes in the heat flux profiles on the receiver, thereby allowing for the reduction of the peak heat fluxes about 30% of the initial value, while maintaining spillage below 15% for a spread aiming point distribution.","Declaration of competing interest All the authors declare no conflict of interest.

Standard MR test procedures are often complex, lengthy, and cost-prohibitive for most routine daily applications. Therefore, correlative models relating to easy-to-obtain basic soil index properties, such as the Atterberg limits, have been historically used to predict and estimate MR ; such index properties, however, are not always effective for obtaining correct MR values. Alternatively, the California bearing ratio (CBR) and nonlinear stress–strain constitutive models have also been used to estimate MR . The work presented in this paper proposes the implementation of an enhanced hyperbolic constitutive model (eHCM) for the estimation of MR based on small-strain modulus measurements from the free-free resonant column (FFRC) test. The proposed approach aims to circumvent some of the challenges and complexity associated with the lengthy MR laboratory testing. Using the Texas flexible pavements and overlays database (namely the DSS) as the data source, the research methodology included: (a) formulating and developing the eHCM, (b) estimating MR values using the eHCM model along with FFRC test measurements, (c) calibrating and validating the eHCM model using modulus measurements obtained through conventional MR testing, and (d) establishing statistical correlations between eHCM model parameters and routinely measured soil properties. Ten in-service highway test sections from the DSS, encompassing both granular (flex) base and raw subgrade soil materials, were used for the study. From the corresponding results and findings, the eHCM model was found to be satisfactory in terms of adequately quantifying the mechanical behaviour of granular base and subgrade soil materials, yielding coefficient of variation values comparable to the literature. Overall, the proposed eHCM model indicated promising potential as a viable alternative, surrogate, and/or supplement for rapid MR estimation based on simple and inexpensive field or laboratory small-strain modulus testing such as the FFRC.","The authors thank the Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT) and the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) for their support, in particular to the Texas flexible pavements and overlays database (the Texas DSS) project that valuably served as the data source for the work presented in this paper.

                  Southern and central regions of Argentina moved from being relatively poor in the sixteenth century to being the richest in the country today. Although there is some evidence of this reversal, the process of regional growth in Argentina in the first half of the twentieth century is, in the main, unknown. In this paper, we present an estimation of the GDPs of Argentina's 25 provinces in 1914: this is the first consistent estimation of this variable for any period before the 1950s. Our results confirm that in 1914 the city of Buenos Aires and some districts in Patagonia had the highest per capita GDP, and a comparison with the available data for 1953 shows strong persistence in incomes per capita in this period; sectoral analysis of provincial GDPs suggests that growth in the leading districts was driven by economies of agglomeration in some cases and land abundance in others.

Methods A cross-sectional study was carried out on an open population involved in a community-oriented program for control of rheumatic diseases (COPCORD) study in Colombia, using EQ-5D-3L for estimating QOL, and the health assessment questionnaire disability index (HAQ-DI) for functional capacity. Results Out of the total 4020 individuals evaluated, 2274 had rheumatic diseases, 642 had non-rheumatic diseases, and 1104 were healthy subjects. Spondyloarthritis (SpA) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients had more complaints regarding pain/discomfort and mobility. As for daily activities, the diseases that mostly affected them were systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and RA. RA and fibromyalgia (FM) patients had the worst scores as regards anxiety/depression and self-care dimensions. FM patients had the lowest QOL measured by EQ-VAS (57.7±26.2). The most frequent non-rheumatic diseases were cardiovascular and mental disorders, with 20% of these patients having a moderate level of pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. The rheumatic patients reported a decrease in functional capacity (HAQ: 0.49), in contrast to the healthy population (0.01), and the population having other diseases (0.06). Conclusion Rheumatic disease patients in Colombia had the worst QOL compared to the healthy population and patients with other comorbidities. Rheumatic patients had greater functional limitations, even more so when having comorbidities.

Material ascending through mud volcanoes carries with it fragments from the subsurface, allowing us to examine the stratigraphic record of the Sinú Basin. For instance, calcareous microfossils from the ejected material provide chronological information in which diapirs were formed. Previous studies have inferred the age of the Colombian Caribbean mud diapirism and volcanism from indirect proxies such as 2D seismic lines combined with regional studies, but very little evidence-based on micropaleontology. Our biostratigraphic analyses using calcareous nannofossils and planktonic foraminifera extracted from mud volcanoes and their host rocks in the Sinú Basin indicate ages ranging from Middle Eocene to Late Miocene. The well-constrained biostratigraphic ranges of microfossils indicate four chronostratigraphic intervals: 1) Middle to Late Eocene, 2) Late Oligocene 3) Early to Middle Miocene, and 4) Late Miocene. This analysis shows that the ages of muddy materials are younger in the south and older in the north of the study area. We observe that there is a good correlation between the ages of calcareous microfossils and oceanic geological formations of the Sinú Basin. Therefore, our micropaleontological analyses are the first direct evidence to date the sediment involved in the mud diapirism and vulcanism in the Colombian Caribbean region.","The authors thank the students of Marine Geology and Paleoclimate courses of the Universidad de Caldas in 2014 and 2015 who were part of the process of collecting samples used in this work.

Recently, the development of mobile technology has enabled this transport mode to become an app-based motorcycle taxi service, leading to a rapid increase in travel demand. However, the emergence of app-based motorcycle taxi riders is considered to contribute directly and indirectly to the high proportion of road traffic crashes through their risky riding behaviours. The associations between unhealthy habits such as smoking, drink riding and other risky behaviours among motorcyclists have received less attention. Therefore, the aim of this study is to explore the effect of unhealthy lifestyle behaviours on risky riding behaviours among app-based motorcycle taxi riders. This study also explores the prevalence of risky riding behaviours and their associations. Methods An online survey and field surveys were carried out to obtain information about app-based motorcycle taxi riders’ demographics, work patterns and risky riding behaviours. More than 600 riders (mean age = 25.74 years, SD = 7.3), who were working in the three largest cities in Vietnam, completed a structured questionnaire. Results Binary logistic regression modelling showed that riders who regularly smoked and drunk alcohol were more likely to engage in the risky behaviours of smoking while riding and drink riding (Adj. OR = 18.61, 95%CI, p < 0.001 and Adj. OR = 9.02, 95%CI, p < 0.01 respectively). The results also indicated that those who sometimes smoked cigarettes were more likely not to wear helmets when riding (Adj. OR = 2.55, p < 0.01). While smoking habits were associated with smoking while riding and not wearing a helmet, most surveyed risky riding behaviours were associated with drinking habits. Significant associations between smoke/drink riding and all other risky riding behaviours were also found in this study. Conclusion A better understanding of these relationships will help authorities and ride-hailing firms to improve safe riding behaviours among app-based motorcycle taxi riders.",,,Journal of Transport & Health,,,,2020-03,2020,,2020-03,16,,100666,Closed,Article,"Nguyen-Phuoc, Duy Quy; Oviedo-Trespalacios, Oscar; Nguyen, Teron; Su, Diep Ngoc","Nguyen-Phuoc, Duy Quy (Division of Construction Computation, Institute for Computational Science, Ton Duc Thang University, Ho Chi Minh City, Viet Nam; Faculty of Civil Engineering, Ton Duc Thang University, Ho Chi Minh City, Viet Nam); Oviedo-Trespalacios, Oscar (Queensland University of Technology (QUT), Centre for Accident Research and Road Safety, Queensland (CARRS-Q), Faculty of Health, 130 Victoria Park Road, Kelvin Grove, QLD, 4059, Australia; Department of Industrial Engineering, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); Nguyen, Teron (Faculty of Bridge and Road Engineering University of Science and Technology, The University of Danang, 54 Nguyen Luong Bang Street, Lien Chieu District, Danang City, Viet Nam); Su, Diep Ngoc (Faculty of Tourism University of Economics, The University of Danang, 71 Ngu Hanh Son, Danang City, Viet Nam)","Nguyen-Phuoc, Duy Quy (Ton Duc Thang University; Ton Duc Thang University)","Nguyen-Phuoc, Duy Quy (Ton Duc Thang University; Ton Duc Thang University); Oviedo-Trespalacios, Oscar (Queensland University of Technology; Universidad del Norte); Nguyen, Teron (University of Da Nang); Su, Diep Ngoc (University of Da Nang)",45,17,,13.45,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1124346694,"33 Built Environment and Design; 3304 Urban and Regional Planning; 35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3509 Transportation, Logistics and Supply Chains",3 Good Health and Well Being

The mathematical formulation uses a generalized equation for the estimation of the fault distance, which does not depend on the fault type, and its solution is obtained by the application of a least squares method. The method considers available voltage and current measurements at both terminals of the transmission line as well as the line parameters. Additionally, the proposed method shows an adequate performance for the fault detection. Moreover, you can use it for locating high and low impedance faults. The paper presents extensive numerical experiments demonstrating that the method has high accuracy; specifically, the error in fault location accuracy is under 10% for more than 80% of the test cases. The easiness of method implementation and encouraging test results indicate potential for real-life applications.",Declaration of Competing Interest The authors declared that there is no conflict of interest.,,International Journal of Electrical Power & Energy Systems,,,,2020-01,2020,,2020-01,114,,105387,Closed,Article,"Doria-Garcia, J.; Orozco-Henao, C.; Iurinic, L.U.; Pulgarín-Rivera, Juan Diego","Doria-Garcia, J.

Experimental and theoretical studies,"Abstract  Biohybrid nanocomposite films were obtained through a simple two‐step methodology. Films of chitosan/poly(3‐hexylthiophene) (CS/P3HT) were used as polymer matrices for the in‐situ synthesis and stabilization of CdSe quantum dots. The biohybrid materials were characterized by attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ATR‐FTIR), Raman spectroscopy, UV–visible spectroscopy, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM), high‐resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), and photoluminescence spectroscopy (PL). The effects of the P3HT composition on the properties of the QDs in the films were analyzed. The results confirmed that CS/P3HT films provided an adequately confining matrix for the growth of CdSe QDs with a fairly uniform size and revealed that the interactions between the CdSe nanoparticles and the CS/P3HT matrix mainly involved the OH and NH 2 groups. The optical band gaps of the biohybrid nanocomposite films were estimated. The results of photoluminescence revealed that a charge transfer phenomenon occurred in the polymer system. Finally, theoretical analyses suggest that the CdSe QDs would be preferentially located onto the chitosan domains.","ACKNOWLEDGMENTS The authors thank FONDECYT 1161159 and FONDAP 15110019 projects for partial funding support of this research.

These low-energy impacts can affect the structural integrity of the hull and could be an example of impact fatigue. Certain fast boats manufactured with composite materials are designed in such a way that the hull and deck are assembled with adhesive joints. However, in most of these cases, the adhesive thickness is not measured or controlled. The purpose of this research is to evaluate the effects of the adhesive thickness on the durability and crack growth rate behaviour of adhesive joints used in certain types of high-speed crafts under constant amplitude fatigue and impact fatigue regimes. This study was performed by using experimental procedures with double cantilever beams and single lap joints specimens. The results showed that the durability at impact fatigue conditions is two orders of magnitude lower than constant amplitude fatigue at comparable force levels. In addition, the crack growth rate in impact fatigue conditions showed improvement of fatigue properties when a lower thickness of adhesive was used. On the other hand, the crack growth rate was lower in the constant amplitude fatigue regime in comparison to impact fatigue.","The authors are very grateful for the constant support of The Science and Technology Corporation for Naval, Maritime and Riverine Industry Development (COTECMAR) and Universidad del Norte, Colombia.",,Engineering Fracture Mechanics,,,,2020-02,2020,,2020-02,225,,106393,Closed,Article,"Carvajal, David Ricardo Alvarado; Correa, Ricardo Alfonso Mejía; Casas-Rodríguez, Juan Pablo","Carvajal, David Ricardo Alvarado (Universidad de los Andes, Bogotá DC, Colombia); Correa, Ricardo Alfonso Mejía (The Science and Technology Corporation for Naval, Maritime and Riverine Industry Development, Cartagena, Colombia); Casas-Rodríguez, Juan Pablo (Universidad de los Andes, Bogotá DC, Colombia)","Casas-Rodríguez, Juan Pablo (Universidad de Los Andes)","Carvajal, David Ricardo Alvarado (Universidad de Los Andes); Correa, Ricardo Alfonso Mejía (Science and Technology Corporation for Naval, Maritime and Riverine Industry Development); Casas-Rodríguez, Juan Pablo (Universidad de Los Andes)",12,4,,1.3,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1113304082,40 Engineering; 4016 Materials Engineering,

Our main motivation for this paper lies in the absence of surveys on the PCS literature, hence the purpose of this paper is to perform a structured literature review on PCS to establish promising research gaps. Such review was conducted surveying the literature about PCS from 2001 until 2019. The study introduces a detailed and current worldwide PCS inventory using a proposed evolution framework and a taxonomy, the latter built upon commonly cited factors from the IT systems development literature in the context of port communities, which are synthesized into three frames: a Business frame, an Integration frame, and a Legal frame. Findings show that literature on PCS is scarce and fragmented, oftentimes with PCS research published in non-specialized documents on the topic, with few comparative studies between countries and several countries receiving little attention. Few authors have high specialization on the topic while most authors in average contribute less than once to the body of knowledge. Additionally, it was found that industry is ahead of scientific research in terms of documenting PCS development and technical features. The results also show a lack of innovation regarding PCS research studies, which risks relegating PCS research to irrelevance. A major critique to extant PCS literature is about its inertia, as research tends to be excessively comfortable with the legacy PCS, neglecting its need to evolve and adapt to new markets (in response to the growth of emerging economies) or to extended functionalities (taking advantage of the surge of new technologies). Furthermore, it was found that the future of PCS research should aim for addressing practical needs, while fostering collaboration among practitioners and scholars.",,,Transportation Research Part A Policy and Practice,,,,2020-03,2020,,2020-03,133,,27-46,Closed,Article,"Moros-Daza, Adriana; Amaya-Mier, René; Paternina-Arboleda, Carlos","Moros-Daza, Adriana (Departamento de Ingenieria Industrial, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia; Institute of Information Systems (IWI), University of Hamburg, Germany); Amaya-Mier, René (Departamento de Ingenieria Industrial, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); Paternina-Arboleda, Carlos (Departamento de Ingenieria Industrial, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia)","Moros-Daza, Adriana (Universidad del Norte; Universität Hamburg)","Moros-Daza, Adriana (Universidad del Norte; Universität Hamburg); Amaya-Mier, René (Universidad del Norte); Paternina-Arboleda, Carlos (Universidad del Norte)",34,15,,13.66,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1124210417,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3507 Strategy, Management and Organisational Behaviour",

These tricorns appear inside tongue-like structures that are created through simple Shi'lnikov bifurcations. As the linewidth enhancement factor-α of the laser increases, these tongues invade the laser locking zone and extends over the zone of stable period-1 orbits. This invasion provokes a rich overlap dynamics of the parameter planes that produces an abundant multistability. As α increases, the tricorn exhibits a phenomenon of codimension-3 rotating in the clockwise and counterclockwise directions in the plane of the injected field rate K vs its detuning ω. We hope that the numerical evidence of the tricorns presented herein motivates the study of mathematical conditions for their genesis. We also encourage the experimental verification of these tricorn-like structures because our results also open new possibilities for optical switching between several different laser outputs in the neighborhood of these structures.","C.A.T.C. acknowledges Centro Latino-Americano de Física, Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico (CNPq), Brazil, for a Doctoral Fellowship.

However, the majority of injuries and fatalities occur disproportionately in low-income and medium-income countries. Previous studies have concluded that risky behaviours were the main contributing factor of traffic crashes. Turn signal neglect (TSN) when making a turn is one of those risky behaviours. Unfortunately, research on TSN has been very limited. This study investigates the prevalence of TSN-related crashes and factors affecting TSN among motorcyclists and car drivers. Data was obtained from self-administered questionnaires conducted in Vietnam. The findings showed that 17.54% of motorcyclists and 14.76% of car drivers have experienced at least one crash caused by their failure to turn signals in the last three years. Additionally, fewer years having a riding/driving license, longer daily travelling time, lower frequency of turn signal use, and having received a fine due to TSN were found to be positively associated with TSN-related crashes for both motorcyclists and car drivers.

1278,pub.1131329108,10.1016/j.trf.2020.08.031,,,Risky riding behaviours among motorcyclists in Malaysia: A roadside survey,"Motorcyclists are over-represented in fatal crashes in Low- and Middle-Income Countries (LMICs). In Malaysia, motorcyclists comprise about 60% of all fatalities in road crashes. However, the prevalence and determinants of risky riding behaviours have been rarely studied in the country. This study aims to investigate motorcycle-related risky riding behaviours at signalised intersections. A total of 72,377 observations were made during six days at six different signalised intersections in Terengganu, Malaysia. Four risky riding behaviours were observed together (i.e. helmet non-use, red-light running, mobile phone use, turn signal neglect) along with additional demographic and contextual factors. The most prevalent risky riding behaviour was turn signal neglect (29.7% of all observations), and the least prevalent was mobile phone while riding (0.2% of all observations). Four logistic regressions were fitted to predict the four risky riding behaviours using the demographic and contextual explanatory factors. The results suggest that helmet non-use increases among female riders, riders wearing industrial uniforms, carrying passengers, riding during the weekend, during off-peak hours, during clear weather, at T-junctions, on multi-lane roads, and on minor road approaches. Red light running increases among female riders, riders wearing industrial uniforms, carrying passengers, during clear weather, at T-junctions, on multi-lane roads, and on major road approaches. Mobile phone use increases among female riders, riders wearing industrial uniforms, carrying passengers, and at cross-junctions. Turn signal neglect increases among male riders, riders not wearing industrial uniforms, solo riders, on weekends, during off-peak hours, during clear weather, on single-lane roads, and on minor road approaches. The findings of this study have significant implications for the development of targeted countermeasures such as education programs and road policing.",Dr Oscar Oviedo-Trespalacios is the recipient of an Australian Research Council Discovery Early Career Researcher Award [DE200101079] funded by the Australian Government.,,Transportation Research Part F Traffic Psychology and Behaviour,,,,2020-10,2020,,2020-10,74,,446-457,Closed,Article,"Rusli, Rusdi; Oviedo-Trespalacios, Oscar; Salam, Suhaila Azura Abd","Rusli, Rusdi (Politeknik Sultan Mizan Zainal Abidin, 23000 Dungun, Terengganu, Malaysia); Oviedo-Trespalacios, Oscar (Queensland University of Technology (QUT), Centre for Accident Research and Road Safety – Queensland (CARRS-Q), 130 Victoria Park Road, Kelvin Grove, QLD 4059, Australia; Department of Industrial Engineering, Universidad del Norte, Km 5 via Puerto Colombia, Barranquilla, Colombia); Salam, Suhaila Azura Abd (Politeknik Sultan Mizan Zainal Abidin, 23000 Dungun, Terengganu, Malaysia)","Rusli, Rusdi (Politeknik Sultan Mizan Zainal Abidin, 23000 Dungun, Terengganu, Malaysia)","Rusli, Rusdi (Politeknik Sultan Mizan Zainal Abidin, 23000 Dungun, Terengganu, Malaysia); Oviedo-Trespalacios, Oscar (Queensland University of Technology; Universidad del Norte); Salam, Suhaila Azura Abd (Politeknik Sultan Mizan Zainal Abidin, 23000 Dungun, Terengganu, Malaysia)",44,26,,13.75,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1131329108,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3509 Transportation, Logistics and Supply Chains",3 Good Health and Well Being
1273,pub.1130358590,10.1016/j.energy.2020.118658,,,Simulation model of the characteristics of syngas from hardwood biomass for thermally integrated gasification using unisim design tool,"Gasification is a potential clean technology for producing thermal and electric power from biomass. Major issues with gasification are the presence of heavy compounds known as tar in the syngas and the provision of thermal energy to the process. These issues discourage the low-scale implementation of gasification technology because of high capital and operating costs. This paper proposes a simulation model that harnesses a thermal integration between low-temperature and high-temperature gasification stages. The proposed configuration can potentially generate condensable low-temperature gasification vapors as well as syngas with relatively low tar content. The UniSim model uses hardwood biomass and steam as the gasifying agent. Results show that CO decreases while H2 increases with an increase in the steam/biomass-ratio within the temperature range 600–1200 °C. The minimum mole fraction of CO approached 3.1% at 600 °C, while H2 exhibited a maximum with 35.2% at that temperature. The maximum mole fraction of CO was 13.2%, while H2 approached 31.2% at 1200 °C. The heating value of syngas decreased with an increase in steam/biomass ratio but increased with a rise in temperature. This work provides a first indication of the thermodynamic feasibility of the concept; the next step is validation in a dedicated setup.",Declaration of competing interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.,,Energy,,,,2020-11,2020,,2020-11,211,,118658,Closed,Article,"Usmani, Sameer; Quiroga, Arturo Gonzalez; Padilla, Ricardo Vasquez; Palmer, Graeme; Lake, Maree","Usmani, Sameer (School of Environment Science and Engineering, Southern Cross University, Lismore, 2480, NSW, Australia); Quiroga, Arturo Gonzalez (UREMA Research Unit, Department of Mechanical Engineering, Universidad Del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); Padilla, Ricardo Vasquez (School of Environment Science and Engineering, Southern Cross University, Lismore, 2480, NSW, Australia); Palmer, Graeme (School of Environment Science and Engineering, Southern Cross University, Lismore, 2480, NSW, Australia); Lake, Maree (School of Environment Science and Engineering, Southern Cross University, Lismore, 2480, NSW, Australia)","Padilla, Ricardo Vasquez (Southern Cross University)","Usmani, Sameer (Southern Cross University); Quiroga, Arturo Gonzalez (Universidad del Norte); Padilla, Ricardo Vasquez (Southern Cross University); Palmer, Graeme (Southern Cross University); Lake, Maree (Southern Cross University)",7,5,,1.5,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1130358590,40 Engineering; 4008 Electrical Engineering; 4012 Fluid Mechanics and Thermal Engineering; 4017 Mechanical Engineering,7 Affordable and Clean Energy

The spiral has a tridimensional structure that rolls up in at least three directions. A turn of approximately 2π radians along the spiral and toward the center increases the number of peaks in the laser intensity by one, which does not occur when traversing the discontinuities. We show that as we vary the linewidth enhancement factor (α), discontinuities are created (destroyed) through disaggregation (collapses) from (into) the so-called shrimp-like structures.

Contingency and configuration perspectives on their relationships,"While researchers have thoroughly investigated the impact of supply chain quality integration (SCQI) on competitive performance, they have paid less attention to its possible effects on a firm’s capabilities to reconfigure resources to adapt to environmental changes. Using data from 239 Spanish organic agro-food firms, we studied the relationships between SCQI dimensions and organisational ambidexterity from both contingency and configuration perspectives. In the contingency approach, a structural equation model was used to study the effect of individual SCQI dimensions on ambidexterity. In contrast, in the configuration perspective, cluster analysis and analysis of variance were used to investigate the relationship between SCQI patterns and ambidexterity. The contingency approach´s findings suggest that only internal quality integration has a positive direct impact on ambidexterity. The configuration approach complements such outcomes by revealing that only a high and balanced level of all the three SCQI dimensions (i.e. internal-, supplier- and customer-quality integration) guarantees significantly higher levels of ambidexterity. This paper provides a deeper understanding of the impact of SCQI on the firm's ambidexterity capability, and the findings offer managers of the organic agro-food industry some guidelines to develop an ambidexterity capability through SCQI to compete with the traditional agro-food players.",,"This research is part of the Project [ECO2015-71380-R] funded by the Ministry of Economy, Industry and Competitiveness.

TiO2 (Degussa P-25) between 100 and 600 mg.L−1 was used as a catalyst, semi-continuous type reactors for the photocatalysis, a batch for the biological stage, UV light with accumulated energies from 20 to 60 kJ.L−1 were also used, a constant concentration of H2O2 was used as an adjuvant in all tests. The research consisted of four main phases: leachate characterization, biological treatment, optimization of photocatalytic and AOP-biological coupling. For the optimization of the photocatalytic step, an experimental design was carried out through the statistical program Statgraphics Centurion XV of factorial type 3^2 (3 levels 2 variables), modeling the results by means of a response surface, the variables of the pH and the concentration of the catalyst were included, having this as input for the response of interest the percentage (%) of DOC removal. The biological process itself provided a removal of 38 and 24% for COD and DOC, respectively. The AOP-biological coupling provided a removal of 68 and 76% in terms of COD and DOC, respectively. Thus, the coupling significantly improves the overall efficiency of the process by more than 50%, which represents a promising improvement compared to the removal of organic matter for the treatment of the same type of water using only the biological process. The results show a viable alternative for the treatment of leachate because higher removal levels are achieved in residence times, which are considered shorter than the ones in conventional processes.",,,Topics in Catalysis,,,,2020-05-28,2020,2020-05-28,2020-10,63,11-14,1336-1349,Closed,Article,"Becerra, Dorance; Soto, Joseph; Villamizar, Salvador; Machuca-Martínez, Fiderman; Ramírez, Luisa","Becerra, Dorance (Departamento de Ciencias del Medio Ambiente, Facultad de Ciencias Agrarias y del Ambiente, Universidad Francisco de Paula Santander, Norte de Santander, Cúcuta, Colombia; Facultad de Ingeniería, Universidad del Valle, Cali, Colombia); Soto, Joseph (Departamento de Ciencias del Medio Ambiente, Facultad de Ciencias Agrarias y del Ambiente, Universidad Francisco de Paula Santander, Norte de Santander, Cúcuta, Colombia; Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Atlántico, Colombia); Villamizar, Salvador (Departamento de Ciencias del Medio Ambiente, Facultad de Ciencias Agrarias y del Ambiente, Universidad Francisco de Paula Santander, Norte de Santander, Cúcuta, Colombia; Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Atlántico, Colombia); Machuca-Martínez, Fiderman (Facultad de Ingeniería, Universidad del Valle, Cali, Colombia); Ramírez, Luisa (Departamento de Ciencias del Medio Ambiente, Facultad de Ciencias Agrarias y del Ambiente, Universidad Francisco de Paula Santander, Norte de Santander, Cúcuta, Colombia)","Machuca-Martínez, Fiderman (University of Valle)","Becerra, Dorance (Francisco de Paula Santander University; University of Valle); Soto, Joseph (Francisco de Paula Santander University; Universidad del Norte); Villamizar, Salvador (Francisco de Paula Santander University; Universidad del Norte); Machuca-Martínez, Fiderman (University of Valle); Ramírez, Luisa (Francisco de Paula Santander University)",8,3,,0.86,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1127978726,34 Chemical Sciences; 3406 Physical Chemistry; 40 Engineering; 4004 Chemical Engineering,

Specifically, the paper focuses on the effect of stiffness on the building overstrength, displacement ductility, fragility for Life Safety (LS) and collapse limit states, as well as the probability of achieving these two limits states in 50 years. The seismic performance is assessed for a group of four 20-story residential shear wall buildings archetypes located in Santiago. Walls were modeled using the multiple vertical line element model (MVLEM) with inelastic hysteretic materials for the vertical elements, and a linear-elastic shear behavior. Pushover analyses were considered to estimate the buildings overstrength and displacement ductility, while incremental dynamic analyses were performed to estimate fragility curves. A probabilistic seismic hazard analysis, which considered the seismicity of Chile central zone, was performed to estimate the probability of achieving the two limits states in 50 years. The results show that an increase in the stiffness reduces the chance of exceeding the LS and collapse limit states for the same intensity level. Additionally, the probabilistic seismic hazard analysis shows that, when the stiffness increases, the probability of reaching the LS limit state in 50 years also decreases. Counterintuitively, the probability of collapse in 50 years increases as the stiffness increases, due to the considered seismic hazard and the design requirements. Since society is moving towards resilient structural designs that minimize damage, disruption and economic losses, it is concluded that the performance of reinforced concrete shear wall buildings is improved by increasing the stiffness.","First author would like to thank the Secretary of Higher Education, Science, Technology and Innovation of Ecuador (SENESCYT) for the financial support under “Programa de Becas para Doctorado (PhD) para Docentes de Universidades y Escuelas Politécnicas”, grant contract No. 2015-AR2Q8324.

The laboratory work presented in this paper aims to propose a strategy for utilizing the reclaimed paper-based asphalt felt (RPAF) waste in hot-mix asphalt (HMA) pavements as a means to mitigate the RPAF disposal problem. A series of laboratory tests, including viscosity, modulus, rutting, and cracking, were conducted to investigate the effects of RPAF additives on the engineering performance of asphalt-binder and HMA mixes. The corresponding test results showed that the addition of RPAF improves the viscosity and high-temperature performance of asphalt-binders. However, RPAF modified asphalt-binder exhibited inferior storage stability than the virgin asphalt-binder due to the difference in density between the asphalt-binder and RPAF components. Additionally, the effect of RPAF on the rheological characteristics of the asphalt-binder exhibited high sensitivity to temperature. The differences in complex modulus and phase angle of the asphalt-binder with RPAF additives were generally more significant at elevated temperatures. Similarly, RPAF modified HMA mixes outperformed the control HMA mix in terms of resistance to moisture damage, rutting, and cracking, respectively. Overall, the laboratory test results indicated that it is feasible to utilize RPAF waste as an asphalt-binder modifier to enhance the engineering properties/performance of the asphalt-binder and HMA mix whilst simultaneously addressing the environmental issues of RPAF waste disposal.","Declaration of Competing Interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

The first class of these operators, which we will denote as Jα$$J^{\alpha }$$, α>n$$\alpha >n$$, are associated via Fourier transform to the Bessel potentials. These operators are of the form (Jαφ)(x)=Fξ→x-1(max{1,||ξ||p})-αφ^(ξ),φ∈D(Qpn),x∈Qpn.$$\begin{aligned} (J^{\alpha }\varphi )(x)={\mathcal {F}}_{\xi \rightarrow x}^{-1} \left[ (\max \{1,||\xi ||_{p}\})^{-\alpha }\widehat{\varphi }(\xi )\right] , \quad \varphi \in {\mathcal {D}}({\mathbb {Q}}_p^n),\ x\in {\mathbb {Q}}_p^n. \end{aligned}$$The second class of these operators, which we will denote as Aα$${\mathcal {A}}^{\alpha }$$, α>0$$\alpha >0$$, are a linear combination of the operators -Jα$$-J^{\alpha }$$, α>0$$\alpha >0$$, and the operator identity I. These operators are of the form Aαφ(x)=Fξ→x-11-max{1,||ξ||p}-αφ^(ξ),φ∈D(Qpn),x∈Qpn.$$\begin{aligned} \left( {\mathcal {A}}^{\alpha }\varphi \right) (x) ={\mathcal {F}}_{\xi \rightarrow x}^{-1} \left[ \left\{ 1-\left( \max \{1,||\xi ||_{p}\}\right) ^{-\alpha }\right\} \widehat{\varphi }(\xi )\right] ,\quad \varphi \in {\mathcal {D}} ({\mathbb {Q}}_p^n),\ x\in {\mathbb {Q}}_p^n. \end{aligned}$$We study the Cauchy problem naturally associated with these classes of operators. We show that the heat equation associated to the operator Jα$$J^{\alpha }$$, α>n$$\alpha >n$$, describes the cooling (or loss of heat) in a given region over time, since the fundamental solution Z(x, t) (explicitly represented), of real positive time variable and p-adic spatial variables satisfies Z(x,t)≤0$$Z(x,t)\le 0$$. Next, we study the positive maximum principle, the generators of certain families of semigroups and the existence of a mild solution for a certain inhomogeneous initial value problem. With respect to the operator Aα$${\mathcal {A}}^{\alpha }$$, α>0$$\alpha >0$$, we find explicit a representations of the fundamental solutions Z~(x,t)$$\widetilde{Z}(x,t)$$, also of real positive time variable and p-adic spatial variables. Via the theory of distributions we will show that these fundamental solutions are related to a transition functions of strong Markov processes whose paths are right continuous and have no discontinuities other than jumps.",,,Journal of Pseudo-Differential Operators and Applications,,,,2020-03-09,2020,2020-03-09,2020-09,11,3,1111-1137,Closed,Article,"Gutiérrez García, Ismael; Torresblanca-Badillo, Anselmo","Gutiérrez García, Ismael (Departamento de Matemáticas y Estadística, Universidad del Norte, Km. 5 Vía Puerto Colombia, Barranquilla, Colombia); Torresblanca-Badillo, Anselmo (Departamento de Matemáticas y Estadística, Universidad del Norte, Km. 5 Vía Puerto Colombia, Barranquilla, Colombia)","Gutiérrez García, Ismael (Universidad del Norte)","Gutiérrez García, Ismael (Universidad del Norte); Torresblanca-Badillo, Anselmo (Universidad del Norte)",9,4,,6.48,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1125505131,49 Mathematical Sciences; 4901 Applied Mathematics; 4904 Pure Mathematics,

1184,pub.1122587021,10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2019.117552,,,Correlating the HWTT laboratory test data to field rutting performance of in-service highway sections,"Rutting is one of the common distresses occurring in hot-mix asphalt (HMA) pavements that can be mitigated through adequate laboratory testing during the HMA mix-design screening stage. The Hamburg Wheel Tracking Tester (HWTT) is one of the test methods widely used in the routine HMA mix-design screening and quantification of the HMA rutting resistance potential in the laboratory. However, the occurrence of premature field rutting failures have been reported for some surface HMA mixes (even after being satisfactorily screened with the HWTT test in the laboratory), mostly in high-temperature environments, heavy truck-trafficked areas, and high shear-stress zones such as intersections, curves, etc. In an effort to improve the HWTT’s screening and performance predictive capabilities, new models and HMA rutting parameters such as the rutting area, normalized rutting area, shape factor, rut-depth ratio, rutting resistance index, and the equivalent remaining laboratory rutting life were evaluated to supplement the traditional rut depth and number of load passes criteria. The fundamental theory for formulating these new models and HMA rutting parameters is to better account for the currently prevailing traffic loading and climatic conditions. However, one key challenge associated with such enhancements and new model developments prior to industry implementation is correlations and validation with field performance data. Using the Texas flexible pavements and overlays database, namely the Texas Data Storage System (DSS) as the data source, this study was conducted to correlate and validate the HWTT laboratory test data to field rutting performance of in-service highways. As extracted from the DSS, three Texas commonly used HMA mixes (ranging from fine to coarse-graded) and five in-service highways were used for the study. Overall, the laboratory HWTT yielded good correlations with field rutting performance data with a coefficient of determination generally exceeding 60% for most of the HMA rutting parameters evaluated. In particular, the rutting area and normalized rutting area parameters exhibited statistical superiority in terms of correlations with all the field rutting performance data, with coefficient of determination values averaging 69.9%. Nonetheless, more field correlations and validation studies of this nature are strongly recommended, among others, to aid in defining and establishing the pass-fail screening criteria/thresholds for the proposed HMA rutting parameters.","Declaration of Competing Interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

Methodologically, a drying process was carried out of three varieties of industrial cassava (Corpoica Tai, Verónica and Gynes), varying the operating conditions of the process, in terms of temperature (45°C, 55°C and 70°C), drying speed (1 m/s, 3 m/s and 4 m/s) and time (from 0 min-480 min in 15 min intervals). For the analysis of data Manova was performed, where the response variables were a volumetric contraction, length and width of the cassava parallelepipeds. It is concluded that the joint effect of factors, such as the variety and speed of drying, acting together with the temperature on the evaluated response variables, since they were interactions that marked significant differences throughout the experiment, therefore, they directly affect the volumetric reduction of industrial cassava varieties.",,,World Review of Science Technology and Sustainable Development,,,,2020,2020,2021-03-01,2020,16,4,332-342,Closed,Article,"Torregroza, Angélica M.; Rodríguez, Jhonatan A.; Ruíz, Rafael R.; López, Rolando J.","Torregroza, Angélica M.

Nonetheless, to date, no study has assessed the psychometric evidence of its Spanish translation. This study examines the evidence of validity, reliability, and factorial invariance according to the gender of a Spanish version of the SCBCS. Participants included 273 Peruvian university students (50.9% women) with an average age of 21.23 years (SD = 3.24); divided into two groups of men and women to conduct the invariance factor analysis. Other measures of mindfulness, well-being, empathy, and anxiety were applied along with the SCBCS. The Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) indicated that a unifactorial model adjusted significantly to the data (χ2 = 12,127, df = 5, p = .033, χ2 /df = 2.42, CFI = .998, RMSEA = .072 [CI90% .019, .125]; SRMR = .030, WRMR = .551) and presented good reliability (α = .90 [95% .88–.92]; ω = .91). Moreover, correlations between the SCBCS and other measures of mindfulness (r = .53, p < .05, cognitive empathy (r = 55; p < .05), affective empathy (r = .56, p < .05), well-being (r = .55, p < .05), and anxiety (r = −.46; p < .05) supported the convergent and discriminant validity. Likewise, the multiple-group CFA supported the factorial invariance according to the gender of the SCBCS. Results indicate that the SCBCS possesses evidence of validity, reliability, and invariance between men and women for measuring compassion toward others in Peruvian undergraduate students. SCBCS is expected to be used by researchers, healthcare professionals, teachers, and others as a useful measure of compassion in college students.",,This study was funded by Universidad Privada del Norte (grant number: 20194003).,Current Psychology,,,,2020-07-25,2020,2020-07-25,2022-07,41,7,4431-4446,Closed,Article,"Caycho-Rodríguez, Tomás; Vilca, Lindsey W.; Plante, Thomas G.; Carbajal-León, Carlos; Cabrera-Orosco, Isabel; García Cadena, Cirilo H.; Reyes-Bossio, Mario","Caycho-Rodríguez, Tomás (Facultad de Ciencias de la Salud, Universidad Privada del Norte, Av Alfredo Mendiola 6062, Los Olivos, Lima, Peru); Vilca, Lindsey W.

Consequent influences on eating behaviors comprise an individual's actions in feeding themself that are conditioned by biological, social, cultural, and psychological factors. Mental health indicators such as anxiety and stress reflect negative impacts of acculturation on migrants' health, but ethnic identity is potentially protective. However, the relationship between these mental health indicators and immigrant populations' eating behaviors have not been addressed. Our objective was to analyze the mediating effects of acculturation stress and ethnic identity on the relationship between anxiety and three dimensions of eating behaviors in Colombian migrants living in Chile. A total of 959 Colombian immigrants participated. Ethnic identity only partially mediated the effect of emotional eating. The other two dimensions had direct effects but no mediating effects. Conversely, acculturation stress and emotional eating partially mediated restrained eating while external intake had a direct effect but no mediation. Anxiety had significant direct effects with all the dimensions analyzed. Ethnic identity score related to a protective effect between anxiety and emotional eating. Stress of acculturation, conversely, was a risk factor in the relationship between anxiety, emotional eating, and restrained eating.","We thank the immigration department, the Colombian consulate, the self-managed groups of Colombians living in Chile, and all the participants.","This publication is part of the FONDECYT Grant # 1180315, funded by the National Research and Development Agency of the Government of Chile—ANID (Ex-CONICYT)—who did not have any interference in the writing or content of the text.",Appetite,,,Acculturation; Anxiety; Chile; Emigration and Immigration; Ethnicity; Feeding Behavior; Humans,2020-10-15,2020,2020-10-15,2021-02,157,,105006,Closed,Article,"Hun, Nelson; Urzúa, Alfonso; López-Espinoza, Antonio","Hun, Nelson (Escuela de Psicología, Universidad Católica Del Norte, Antofagasta, Chile; Instituto de Investigaciones en Comportamiento Alimentario y Nutrición (IICAN), Universidad de Guadalajara, Mexico; Escuela de Nutrición y Dietética, Facultad de Salud, Universidad Santo Tomás, Antofagasta, Chile.

In this work, we theoretically study the potential of different phases of MoS2 nanogaps to act as all-electronic DNA sequencing devices. We carry out simulations based on density functional theory and the non-equilibrium Green's function formalism to investigate the electronic transport across the device. Our results suggest that the 1T'-MoS2 nanogap structure is energetically more favorable than its 2H counterpart. At zero bias, the changes in the conductance of the 1T'-MoS2 device can be well distinguished, making possible the selectivity of the DNA nucleobases. Although the conductance fluctuates around the resonances, the overall results suggest that it is possible to distinguish the four DNA bases for energies close to the Fermi level.","This research received financial support from Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior – Brasil (CAPES), CNPq (2535/2017-1 and 437182/2018-5), FAPESP grant number (2016/01343-7 and 2017/02317-2) and the ICTP-Simons Foundation Associate Scheme.

In this tale Ramon Vinyes turns into fiction his reflections about literary dynamism and the interconnection between literary systems. Literature facilitates knowledge transfer throughout epochs and cultures. Besides, the literary text is the result of various metamorphoses in which individuality and cultural hegemony play an outstanding role. “El llac d’Atitlán” fictionalises through the imagination of a Guatemalan poet the transfer of Renaissance philosophy in Latin America and its corruption under the influence of North American culture. Intertextuality and self-reference are the mechanisms to reshape knowledge. Literary proteanism becomes apparent through semantic and narratological transformation.

Fruit sorting and grading processes are very laborious and time-consuming task but machine vision-based fruit grading systems have the potential to replace human labour. However, a great challenge in vision-based fruit grading system is the recognition of different features such as shape, size, skin flaw and sometimes even three-dimensional (3D) shape. In this study, a simple and efficient image processing algorithm is proposed for estimating volume and 3D shape of mango fruit. The width and length of mango fruit are obtained from two-dimensional (2D) colour image. Then, fruit thickness is estimated based on light intensity distribution in 2D (top view) of mango fruit and maximum width–thickness correlation. The 3D shape of the mango fruit is then reconstructed. The accuracy of proposed method was compare with two existing volume prediction methods. Estimated volumes were compared with measured measurements using water-displacement method and the reconstructed 3D shapes were compared with measured structures of mango fruits.

Furthermore, suicide attempts exert a financial burden of millions of dollars on society. Objective To establish the factors associated with more than one suicide attempt in the Colombian population that was reported in 2016. Methods A cross-sectional study of 18,763 reports entered in the database of the National Public Health Surveillance of the National Institute of Health of Colombia during 2016 was performed. Results 11,738 (62.6%) of the total number of reports were female, the mean age was 25.0 (95% CI, 24.9–25.2) years, 46% of all cases were individuals between 10- and 20-years-old; 5734 (30.6%) reported 2 or more suicide attempts and the prevalence of a mental disorder and persistent suicidal ideation were 48.5% and 16.4%, respectively. The factor most strongly associated with more than one suicide attempt, after adjusting for logistic regression, was persistent suicide ideation with crude OR=5.5 (95% CI, 5.0–5.9), and ORa=4.0 (95% CI, 3.6–4.3). Conclusions Patients with persistent suicidal ideation were 4 times more likely to have 2 or more suicide attempts. Other factors such as the use of a sharp weapon as a mechanism to perform the attempt and the history of bipolar affective disorder and/or depression were also associated with more than one suicide attempt.",To the Instituto Nacional de Salud for providing the data on attempted suicide reports for 2016 and to the territorial organisations for their diligent case reporting work.,,Revista Colombiana de Psiquiatría (English ed ),,,,2020-04,2020,,2020-04,49,2,95-100,Closed,Article,"Castillo, Yeison Ariel Aparicio; Rodríguez, Ana María Blandón; Torres, Ninfa-Marlen Chaves","Castillo, Yeison Ariel Aparicio (Universidad Minuto de Dios, Bogotá, Colombia); Rodríguez, Ana María Blandón (Grupo de Vigilancia y Control de Eventos de Salud Mental y Lesiones de Causa Externa, Dirección de Vigilancia y Análisis del Riesgo en Salud Pública, Instituto Nacional de Salud, Bogotá, Colombia); Torres, Ninfa-Marlen Chaves (Facultad de Medicina, Universidad Militar, Nueva Granada, Colombia)","Torres, Ninfa-Marlen Chaves (Military University Nueva Granada)","Castillo, Yeison Ariel Aparicio (Universidad Minuto de Dios, Bogotá, Colombia); Rodríguez, Ana María Blandón (Instituto Nacional de Salud); Torres, Ninfa-Marlen Chaves (Military University Nueva Granada)",3,1,,0.99,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1127174555,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3202 Clinical Sciences,3 Good Health and Well Being

METHOD: The Spanish translation of the Cancer Worry Chart was done with the back-translation procedure. The participants were 165 healthy people with a family history of cancer who responded to the Cancer Worry Chart and the Cancer Worry Scale (CWS).
RESULTS: Translation back-translation allows a Spanish version of the Cancer Worry Chart whose content is clear, coherent and relevant (V>.70). Evidence of construct validity is reported based on 3 criteria: (a) an adequate adjustment of the one-dimensional model formed by the Cancer Worry Chart and the items of the CWS performed with the structural equations method (χ2S-B=23.38; df=14; χ2S-B/df=1.67; CFI=.988; RMSEA=.064); (b) a significant correlation between the Cancer Worry Chart and the CWS (r=.76 [IC95%: .68-.90]); (c) ascending averages in the CWS score as the groups formed by each response option of the Cancer Worry Chart express a greater degree of worry (F=55.72; p=.000; ω2=.57). The reliability of the Cancer Worry Chart is above what is recommended (αsingle item=.84).

It is a component of the urea cycle and regulates the intracellular levels of l-arginine, which makes the arginase a target for treatment of vascular diseases and asthma. Mammalian arginases contain an unusual S-shaped motif located at the intermonomeric interface. Until now, the studies were limited to structural role of the motif. Then, our interest was focused on functional aspects and our hypothesis has been that the motif is essential for maintain the oligomeric state, having Arg308 as a central axis. Previously, we have shown that the R308A mutant is monomeric and re-associates to the trimeric-cooperative state in the presence of low concentrations of guanidine chloride. We have now mutated Asp204 that interacts with Arg308 in the neighbor subunit, and also we mutated Glu256, proposed as important for oligomerization. Concretely, the human arginase I mutants D204A, D204E, E256A, E256Q and E256D were generated and examined. No differences were observed in the kinetic parameters at pH 9.5 or in tryptophan fluorescence. However, the D204A and E256Q variants were monomeric. On the other hand, D204E and E256D proved to be trimeric and kinetically cooperative at pH 7.5, whereas hyperbolic kinetics was exhibited by E256A, also trimeric. The results obtained strongly support the importance of the interaction between Arg255 and Glu256 in the cooperative properties of arginase, and Asp204 would be relevant to maintain the oligomeric state through salt bridges with Arg255 and Arg308.","This research was supported by a grant from Fondo Nacional de Desarrollo Científico y Tecnológico (Fondecyt), Chile, 1070467.",,Journal of Structural Biology,,,"Arginase; Arginine; Aspartic Acid; Glutamic Acid; Humans; Kinetics; Macromolecular Substances; Models, Molecular; Mutation; Protein Conformation; Protein Multimerization",2020-05-22,2020,2020-05-22,2020-08,211,2,107533,Closed,Article,"Lobos, Marcela; Figueroa, Maximiliano; Martínez-Oyanedel, José; López, Vasthi; García-Robles, María de Los Ángeles; Tarifeño-Saldivia, Estefanía; Carvajal, Nelson; Uribe, Elena","Lobos, Marcela (Departamento de Bioquímica y Biología Molecular, Facultad de Ciencias Biológicas, Universidad de Concepción, Casilla 160-C, Concepción, Chile.); Figueroa, Maximiliano (Departamento de Bioquímica y Biología Molecular, Facultad de Ciencias Biológicas, Universidad de Concepción, Casilla 160-C, Concepción, Chile.

The Peltetec ophiolitic belt, exposed along the western margin of the Cordillera Real (Ecuador) and previously considered of Cretaceous age, comprises slices of metamorphosed (greenschist facies) and variably deformed peridotites, gabbros (locally cumulate), basaltic lavas and dykes, hydrothermal breccias and sedimentary rocks. The geochemical characteristics of the tholeiitic basaltic rocks indicate a Sr-Nd isotope depleted mantle source with variable imprint of subduction zone-derived or continental crust-assimilated components, as indicated by enrichment in Th, negative anomaly of Nb and relative depletion in high field strength elements (HFSE). Geochemical diversity allows defining different groups of noncumulate igneous rocks with oceanic island arc and NMORB-like back-arc affinities. U-Pb zircon ages from a metabasite yielded 228.1 ± 1.7 Ma, interpreted as the crystallization age of the magma. These data allow proposing the generation of the Peltetec ophiolite in a back-arc setting as a consequence of late Triassic extension of the western continental margin of Gondwana. Granites located at the western margin of the Peltetec Unit with S-type affinity and equal Triassic age (U-Pb age of 228.2 ± 0.8 Ma) document coeval anatexis of the continental crust as a consequence of heating associated with the same extensional event that originated the ophiolite. Geologic correlation allows enlarging such tectonic scenario to include ophiolitic units of similar age in Colombia.",,This work was funded in the frame of the project ‘Proyecto Junior PIJ-16-04 (VIPS-EPN)’ of the Escuela Politécnica Nacional and received support for analyses at CIC from the University of Granada.,International Geology Review,,,,2020-10-28,2020,2020-10-28,2021-12-12,63,18,2232-2256,Closed,Article,"Villares, F.; Garcia-Casco, A.; Blanco-Quintero, I.

When facing the difficulties of prostate cancer diagnosis, the expression of MMPs and TIMP-3 in negative biopsies could be helpful to evaluate a diagnostic suspicion. Our objective is to carry out a comparative study of the expression of MMPs and TIMP-3 in previous negative biopsies and radical prostatectomies (RP). Material and methods Retrospective analysis of a hospital-based cohort including 21 patients with suspicion of prostate carcinoma, whose expressions of MMP-2, 9, 11 and 13 and TIMP-3 were evaluated by immunohistochemistry in the tumor area from previous negative biopsies and RP. Results Immunohistochemical staining values (Score) for MMPs (-11 and -13) and TIMP-3 showed no significant differences when comparing the areas of negative biopsies where tumors subsequently developed with those of the RP. However, we did observe a significant difference in the increased expression of MMP-2 (P =0.002) and MMP-9 (P =0.001) in the tumor area of the RP with respect to the corresponding area of the previous negative biopsy.

However, some methodological concerns arise in the use of particular biomarkers, particularly those displaying low enzymatic rates and/or limited responsiveness to chemicals and biological-related variability. In the present study, the suitability of oxidative stress and detoxification parameters when using mussels as sentinels of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) pollution is addressed. Present results show that the S9 subcellular fraction of the digestive gland in mussels is an adequate and convenient matrix where to measure most pollution-related biomarkers. Furthermore, this work constitutes the first evidence of the potential suitability of using particular carboxylesterase (CE) activities in determining PAHs exposure in mussels. This fact could imply the replacement of more controversial cytochrome P450 components (phase I oxidation), which are only measurable in microsomal fractions, by CEs (measured in S9 fractions) as good alternatives for phase I reactions in PAH-exposed mussels. Some methodological considerations, such as the need of including commercial purified proteins in biomarker determinations for quality assurance, are evaluated.",M. Sole and R.

The clam Leukoma thaca is an economically exploited bivalve found along the south-eastern Pacific coast of Peru and Chile. This bivalve is parasitized by various unidentified larval stages of digeneans in the mantle, gonads and digestive gland. The aims of this study were to determine and describe the different larval stages of the digeneans based on morphological characteristics, to identify them at the species level by performing molecular analyses, and to evaluate pathologies associated with the parasites of this clam. Individuals of L. thaca were collected in San Jorge Bay (23°S), Chile, between November 2018 and February 2019. Morphological description was carried out using in vivo and fixed specimens, and analyses including histological and scanning electron microscopy were performed. Individuals were also isolated for molecular analysis using nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacer 1 (ITS1), including partial subunit 18S rDNA (18S) and small subunit 5.8S gene (5.8S). Morphological characteristics indicated that the metacercaria larval stage belongs to the family Gymnophallidae, genus Parvatrema, which was supported by molecular analysis. Molecular results revealed that metacercaria, sporocysts and cercaria stages found in this clam belong to the same species of Parvatrema (genetic distance 0%), evidencing that this species uses L. thaca as the first and second intermediate host. Pathologies examined in the host were similar in nature to those reported in other gymnophallids in bivalves, but high prevalence of cercariae (20%) in gonads suggested an important castrator effect on the host.","The authors thank to the two anonymous referees their valuable comments to improve the manuscript.

However, identifying freight activity stops from global positioning system (GPS) data is challenging, particularly in urban freight where congested traffic is common. This paper presents a mechanistic—because it is based on the physics of driving patterns—procedure to identify freight activity stops from raw GPS data. The procedure was implemented to identify stops in three distinct case studies that present a wide range of traffic conditions: Barranquilla, Colombia; Dhaka, Bangladesh; and New York City, United States. The results show that the procedure achieves an average accuracy of above 98.6% when identifying freight activity stops. The results of the proposed procedure were compared with results from support vector machines, random forest, and k nearest neighbors. The mechanistic procedure outperformed these methods in correctly classifying freight activity using second-by-second GPS data.",,"Funding The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This research was made possible by partial funding from multiple sources, including: the Volvo Research and Educational Foundations Center of Excellence for Sustainable Urban Freight Systems, the Inter-American Development Bank grant “Methodology to Assess the Impacts of Congestion on Supply Chains,” the World Bank grant “Efficient Multimodal Logistics Study,” and the Commercial Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Technologies’ project “Integrative Freight Demand Management in the New York City Metropolitan Area: Implementation Phase,” which is part of the United States Department of Transportation’s Office of the Assistant Secretary for Research and Technology (U.S. DOT’s OASRT).",Transportation Research Record Journal of the Transportation Research Board,,,,2020-03-13,2020,2020-03-13,2020-04,2674,4,235-246,Closed,Article,"Holguín-Veras, José; Encarnación, Trilce; Pérez-Guzmán, Sofía; Yang, Xia","Holguín-Veras, José (Center for Infrastructure, Transportation, and the Environment, Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Troy, NY); Encarnación, Trilce (Supply Chain & Analytics, University of Missouri-St. Louis, St. Louis, MO); Pérez-Guzmán, Sofía (Center for Infrastructure, Transportation, and the Environment, Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Troy, NY); Yang, Xia (Civil Engineering, SUNY Polytechnic Institute, Utica, NY)","Holguín-Veras, José (Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute)","Holguín-Veras, José (Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute); Encarnación, Trilce (University of Missouri–St. Louis); Pérez-Guzmán, Sofía (Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute); Yang, Xia (SUNY Polytechnic Institute)",15,7,,4.07,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1125653330,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3509 Transportation, Logistics and Supply Chains; 40 Engineering; 4005 Civil Engineering",

This work aims at developing and validating a new optimal energy management (EM) algorithm for an islanded NG. To minimize the generator's operating cost and maximize battery availability at each operating cycle, dynamic programming (DP) framework is employed to solve the underlying optimization problem. The goal of the proposed approach is to ensure the use of maximum available solar power and to achieve optimal battery state of charge. To meet that goal, the management of the ESS is formulated as a stochastic optimal control problem, where nonlinearities in the battery discharging process are considered. A Markov model is constructed for predicting the probability distribution of the solar production used in the stochastic DP formulation. Simulation results are given to illustrate the efficacy of the proposed DP-based approach compared to a rule-based algorithm. Finally, a hardware-in-the-loop system is used to evaluate the real-time operation of the proposed EM algorithm.","This work was partially supported by USDA-NIFA-SCRI Award 2018-51181-28365, project Lighting Approaches to Maximize Profits.

Thus, in the present study, we characterized the vascular bundles (VBs) types and the fibers in relation to the VB type, and the culm (cane) portion of Arundinaria simonii, Bambusa vulgaris cv. vittata and Phyllostachys aurea. Cross-sections in the middle of the culms were made to determine the VBs features and apical, middle and basal portions of the culm were macerated to determine the fibers features. Samples were observed with light microscopy and scanning electron microscopy. Results showed that, in the three species studied, the peripheral and transitional VBs are elliptic, whereas the internal VBs are depressed. The peripheral and transitional VBs exhibited prominent fiber caps associated with the xylem. However, P. aurea also showed a longer and wider phloem-associated cap in comparison to the other two studied species. In A. simonii and P. aurea culms, fiber length decreases from the base to the apex, whereas in B. vulgaris cv. vittata, fibers are longer at the base and the apex of the culm. Bambusa vulgaris cv. vittata exhibited the longest fibers and could thus to be used in the production of cellulose. In contrast, P. aurea exhibited the shortest fibers and the largest lumen diameter, and would be useful for construction, furniture and utensils. Arundinaria simonii showed fibers with intermediate values of the parameters analyzed, although the thickness of the fiber wall was significantly smaller, indicating that it would be suitable for the paper industry.","We thank Universidad Nacional de Luján (UNLu), Buenos Aires, Argentina for granting of the PhD scholarship to Gladys Yormann, and the Departamento de Ciencias Básicas (UNLu) for the funding provided for the research (DCDD-CB N° 552/15; DCDD-CB N° 530/16; DCDD-CB N° 551/17).",,Flora,,,,2020-02,2020,,2020-02,263,,151523,Closed,Article,"Yormann, Gladys Elizabeth; Rúgolo, Zulma Esther; Apóstolo, Nancy Mariel","Yormann, Gladys Elizabeth (Programa Interdisciplinario de Estudios en Plantas Vasculares (PIEPVas), Departamento de Ciencias Básicas, Universidad Nacional de Luján, C.C. 221, Luján 6700, Buenos Aires, Argentina); Rúgolo, Zulma Esther (Instituto de Botánica Darwinion (IBODA-CONICET), Labardén 200, C.C. 22, San Isidro B1642HYD, Buenos Aires, Argentina); Apóstolo, Nancy Mariel (Programa Interdisciplinario de Estudios en Plantas Vasculares (PIEPVas), Departamento de Ciencias Básicas, Universidad Nacional de Luján, C.C. 221, Luján 6700, Buenos Aires, Argentina)","Yormann, Gladys Elizabeth (National University of Luján)","Yormann, Gladys Elizabeth (National University of Luján); Rúgolo, Zulma Esther (Instituto de Botanica Darwinion); Apóstolo, Nancy Mariel (National University of Luján)",4,2,,0.9,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1123011186,31 Biological Sciences; 3103 Ecology,

These devices use chromatic interpolation algorithms during the image formation process, allowing them to perform statistical analyses of inconsistencies generated from this process for authentication purposes. Most of the works focus on analysing the green band of the Bayer filter since it contains more information than blue and red bands. The lack of methods for effectively analysing other bands or different colour filters reduces the detection capability of known tools.

The study relied on a nonprobability sample of 100 social work students at Western Michigan University in the United States (Seventy-nine percent of the sample were female, and 21% were male). The sample's mean age was 26.35 years, SD = 7.70. Sixty-nine percent (69%) of the respondents self-identified as White, and 31% self-identified as African American, Hispanic/Latino, multiethnic, Native American or Asian American. The study used confirmatory factor and multiple regression analyses (CFA and MRA). The findings show that the Life Orientation Test-Revised (LOT-R) and the Personal Optimism Scale (POS) were supported by three indicators of goodness of fit, while the Brief Interactive Optimism Scale-Garcia (BIOS-G) was supported by eight. The LOT-R showed no acceptable internal consistency indicators, but the POS and the BIOS-G showed several good internal consistency indicators. Correlations of all of these scales with the Physical Well-being Scale-Garcia (PWS-G) ranged from r (100) = .303, p = .002 to r (100) = .439, p = .000. The three scales had divergent validity because their scores did not differ by gender (LOT-R: t(100) = -.885, p = .383; POS: t(100) = -.263, p = .794; BIOS-G: t(100) = -.840, p = .407).

The motorcycle are often used in commuting, dense traffic, poor conditioned roads and thus the repetitive loading on the musculoskeletal system of the rider leads to risk factors associated with musculoskeletal disorders. Objective The effective posture is an important factor to overcome the musculoskeletal disorders. This study was aimed to examine the influence of the posture on the human body and to overcome the discomfort, stiffness and pain while riding the motorcycle. Methods Frequently adopted three different postures (A, B and C) were identified from the subjects (motorcyclist). The muscle strain was evaluated using objective and subjective measurements. Rapid Upper Limb Assessment (RULA) analysis was conducted to identify the suitable posture to overcome the muscle strain. The Root Mean Square (RMS) of muscle activity was recorded at the biceps, deltoids, trapezius, and erector spinae of the twelve subjects. Subjective measurements were performed to identify the perception of posture comfort and muscle strain using the Borg's scale. Results The objective and subjective measurement results suggest that posture A of, angle between vertical and the lumbar bone, cervical region and the biceps, arms and forearms are of 16°, 119° and 153° respectively has less muscle strain than posture B and C. The erector spinae muscle has more muscle strain compared to the biceps, deltoid and trapezius muscle in all postures. Conclusion Subjects were aware about the level of muscle strain for different postures. The results recommended by the study will create awareness among the motorcyclist to maintain the posture while riding.",,,Journal of Transport & Health,,,,2020-03,2020,,2020-03,16,,100828,Closed,Article,"Tony, B.Jain.A.R.; Alphin, M.S.; Krishnan, G.

                    Though extant literature has mapped various stages of start-up enterprise growth, there is limited research on the phases that an entrepreneur traverses before the enterprise is started and established as a venture. The paper attempts to understand the lived experiences of young Indians as they negotiate the entrepreneurial path.
                  
                  
                    Design/methodology/approach
                    Qualitative method, where primary data were collected using in-depth interviews of 15 start-up entrepreneurs. These narratives were compared with Bansal's descriptions of entrepreneurs in her book “Connect the dots”. The interview transcripts and the detailed descriptions were analysed for emergent themes.
                  
                  
                    Findings
                    Results indicated that there are five distinct stages in the development of a start-up entrepreneur; namely – pre-entrepreneurial stage, inflexion point, cocoon period, initial stage, crisis stage and, depending upon the success factors and support received during crisis stage, either a success stage or failure stage.
                  
                  
                    Originality/value
                    This is a narrative-based, qualitative approach to understand the lived experiences of young start-up entrepreneurs in India and an attempt to map developmental phases. The fact that India is a fast-growing market for start-ups and the higher rate of failure of start-ups in India makes the study relevant.","This papers forms a part of special section “Management in the Era of Disruption: Insights from India”, guest edited by Vishal Gupta, Naresh Khatri and Karthik Dhandapani.",,South Asian Journal of Business Studies,,,,2020-10-06,2020,2020-10-06,2021-10-19,10,3,342-356,Closed,Article,"Samalopanan, Ameesh Ajantha; Balasubramaniam, Vijayalakshmi","Samalopanan, Ameesh Ajantha (IFMR GSB, KREA University, Sri City, India); Balasubramaniam, Vijayalakshmi (IFMR GSB, KREA University, Sri City, India)","Samalopanan, Ameesh Ajantha (IFMR GSB, KREA University, Sri City, India)","Samalopanan, Ameesh Ajantha (IFMR GSB, KREA University, Sri City, India); Balasubramaniam, Vijayalakshmi (IFMR GSB, KREA University, Sri City, India)",4,1,,1.61,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1131448888,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3507 Strategy, Management and Organisational Behaviour",

An ant’s view makes the abstract construct of the GVC tangible but at the same time reveals its unclear boundaries – where do GVCs begin and end? The article reflects on the role of contracts and contract law in the drawing and subsequent regulation of boundaries. It takes the reader into Colombia’s globalised natural resource sector where complex contractual constructs determine the relationships between firms, the state and local communities. These contractual constructs, together with the law, corporate codes of conduct and international standards that regulate them, create close and intertwined boundaries between the firm and its societal environment. In that closeness, the mining firm assumes and voices far-reaching responsibilities for the economic and social well-being of local communities. In regard to those corporate social responsibilities, contract law could and should play a pivotal role in the societal governance of GVCs.",,,European Review of Contract Law,,,,2020-04-10,2020,2020-04-10,2020-04-20,16,1,118-138,Closed,Article,"Knöpfel, Laura D.","Knöpfel, Laura D.

The main finding is that institutional elements in each country uniquely impacted the process of negotiation, implementation, and the outcomes of these FTAs. Colombia benefited from the initial advantage of better institutional capacity and negotiating expertise, while Peru benefited from stronger political leadership and commitment to a bilateral trade agreement with the United States. Both Peru and Colombia have benefited from structured consultation mechanisms with the private sector and non‐government agents, continuity in trade policies throughout different political administrations, and strong political commitment to develop the institutional capacity needed to take full advantage of these FTAs. Furthermore, the implementation of these FTAs has coincided with an expansion of non‐traditional exports from Peru and Colombia, and an increase in FDI into sectors other than commodities such as oil, natural gas, and minerals.",,,American Journal of Economics and Sociology,,,,2020-01,2020,2020-02-03,2020-01,79,1,199-232,Closed,Article,"Lombana, Monica P.","Lombana, Monica P.

In order to get a strong data sample, we used a bibliometric search that includes all databases that register mainstream, local and regional journals. Our search query included 46 different features that identify properly the area of metric studies in science and technology (bibliometry, scientometry, informetry, webmetrics and altmetrics). We applied this search in both English and Spanish. Since this area of knowledge has been cultivated rather recently in Mexico, our general aim is to characterize the possible effect of local and international collaboration on the research production of Mexican scholars working in this field. Our results indicate that this production is carried out mainly in local collaborations (75.3%) and most of this production involves scholars from the same Mexican institution (30%). A scarce fraction involves collaborations with scholars from Latin American (LA) institutions (7.7%) and with institutions beyond LA (17%). Accordingly, most of this production is published in local or regional journals in Spanish. Our conclusion indicates thus that international collaboration has little influence in the Mexican research in the field of metric studies a fact that it is not shared by other areas of knowledge in Mexico. We will pursue in future work the performance of faculty members associated to local graduate programs in this area of knowledge. We feel that an improvement in the research activity of these scholars may enhance substantially the research production in the area of metric studies.",,,Scientometrics,,,,2020-06-08,2020,2020-06-08,2021-03,126,3,2485-2511,Closed,Article,"Elena, Luna-Morales Maria; Evelia, Luna-Morales; Ángel, Pérez-Angón Miguel","Elena, Luna-Morales Maria (Bibliographic Services, Center for Research and Advanced Studies (Cinvestav), Av.

An empirical study of the quality of life of older people in Colombia,"Life expectancy has increased considerably over the last 50 years; and population pyramids have inverted as the number of older people has grown. This study analyses the quality of life enjoyed by older people in nine of Colombia’s regions or departments, as rated in four categories: “Very good”, “Good”, “Fair” or “Poor”. It estimates an ordered multinomial logistic model using 20,720 observations taken from the 2018 National Quality of Life Survey, which altogether represent 3,914,448 individuals. The results suggest that the average probability of having a quality of life rated good is 80.2%, with variations between geographical areas and differences that are associated positively with being a woman, belonging to medium and high socioeconomic groups, not missing daily meals, having a home of one’s own home, not being affiliated to the subsidized social security regime and not feeling insecure or poor, among other factors.",,,CEPAL Review,,,,2020-05-20,2020,,2020-05-20,2019,129,129-148,Closed,Article,"Bustos, Bilver Adrián Astorquiza; Chingal, Óscar Armando","Bustos, Bilver Adrián Astorquiza (); Chingal, Óscar Armando ()",,"Bustos, Bilver Adrián Astorquiza (); Chingal, Óscar Armando ()",0,0,,0.0,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1128394940,42 Health Sciences; 44 Human Society; 4406 Human Geography,3 Good Health and Well Being

In the study, the paragraphs in the exam papers of 57 preparatory class students, studying at a state university in Turkey in 2017-2018 academic year, were analysed. The study was conducted using qualitative research method. Case study was used in the research. Document analysis was used to collect data. The collected data were analysed in line with Surface Strategy Taxonomy and errors were identified and classified. As a result of the error analysis process, it was observed that the students made a total of 381 errors on 57 exam papers; 192 of them were misformation errors, 113 were omission errors, 65 were addition errors and only 11 were misordering errors. Misformation was the most frequent error among the students with a percentage of 50.39. In addition, the percentage of omission errors was 29.66%, that of addition errors was 17.06% and misordering errors was 2.89%. The professionals teaching English as a foreign language should focus more on prepositions, verb “to be”, spelling, articles, singular/plural forms of nouns, word formation, tenses, word choice and subject-verb agreement, which were the most problematic areas of language listed under the four main categories by developing efficient instructional techniques and materials. They should also respect learners’ errors and set up a positive atmosphere where learners can easily express themselves in the target language without the fear of committing errors. INTRODUCTION There are lots of languages in the world and some of them have come to the fore due to the fact that they are spoken by millions and even billions of people. People generally learn the language spoken where they are born, however; the developments in the fields such as communication, transportation, tourism and trade forced people to learn the languages that they didn’t need to learn in the past. English is the most popular one of those languages and for some it is the lingua franca (Modiano, 2004; Becker and Kluge, 2014) of our age. Millions of people in the world speak English as their mother tongue while others must learn it as a second (ESL) or foreign language (EFL). Learning English as second or foreign language differs with respect to learners’ attitudes towards English and the people who speak it as their native language, exposure to English, their sources of motivation and so on. The main focus of this study is learning English as a foreign language as English is not the primary language in the country where the study was carried out.

For this purpose, three samples were collected, an initial sample of 200 participants, a second sample of 461 participants and a third sample of 107 participants; making a total of 768 Peruvian university students. Other instruments were applied together with the EROS scale in order to measure satisfaction with life, anxiety, stress and depression. Regarding the results, in the initial sample it was found that the original scale containing positive and negative items does adequately fit the data (RMSEA = .19; CFI = .77; TLI = .71) and also evidence was found supporting the existence of a methodological effect associated with the negative items. It was also found that version B of the scale which only has positive items data fits the data (RMSEA = .13; CFI = .96; TLI = .95). In the second sample it was found that version B still had a good fit to the data in a larger sample (RMSEA = .07; CFI = .98; TLI = .98). In addition, it was found that the scale can be considered invariant according to sex and presents validity based on other constructs. In the third sample it was found that the test-retest reliability of the scale was adequate (.70 [CI95% .593-.788]) and also evidence was found in favor of the temporal invariance of the scale.

This study aims to evaluate the evidence of validity, on the basis of the internal structure, convergent and discriminant validity, reliability and factorial invariance across gender, for the five items Mindful Attention Awareness Scale (MAAS-5) within a sample of older adults.Methods: The participants were 323 Peruvian older adults, consisting of 160 women and 163 men, whose average ages were 68.58 (S.D = 7.23) and 68.91 years (S.D = 7.12), respectively. In addition to the MAAS-5, the Satisfaction with Life Scale and the Patient Health Questionnaire-2 were administered.Results: The Confirmatory Factor Analysis indicates that the one-factor structure of the MAAS-5 presents adequate fit for the total sample (χ2 = 11.24, df = 5, χ2/df = 2.25, CFI = .99, RMSEA = .06 [90%CI: .01, .11]; and SRMR = .025), as well as for the sub-samples of men and women. This one-factor solution presents adequate internal consistency (ω = 80 [95%CI: .76 - .82]) and it is invariant across gender. Regarding convergent validity, high scores in the MAAS are associated with a greater satisfaction with life (r = .88, p< .01 [95%CI: .85, .95]) and less depression (r = -.56, p< .01 [95%CI: -.48, -.77]) in older adults.Conclusions: The preliminary results back the use of the MAAS-5 as a self-report measure of mindfulness that has an adequate unifactorial structure that is reliable and invariant across gender for measuring the full attention state in elderly Peruvians.",,"This work was supported by the Universidad Privada del Norte under grant number 20194003, grant UV-INV-AE18-777619 from the grants program for Special Actions of the Vice-Rectorate for Research of the University of Valencia, Spain and grant RTI2018-093321-B- I00 provided by the aid program Challenges of the Ministry of Science, Innovation and Universities, Spain",Aging & Mental Health,,,"Aged; Attention; Factor Analysis, Statistical; Female; Humans; Male; Psychometrics; Reproducibility of Results; Surveys and Questionnaires",2020-01-23,2020,2020-01-23,2021-04-03,25,4,756-765,Closed,Article,"Caycho-Rodríguez, Tomás; Tomás, José M.; León, José Ventura-; Esteban, Renzo Felipe Carranza; Guadalupe, Luís A.

Pregnancies among adolescents are associated with significant social, health, educational and economic outcomes. The aim of this study was to identify the determinants of adolescent pregnancy in Colombia. Methods: The 2015 Demographic Health Survey data were used to compare rates of adolescent pregnancy with female empowerment scores and other sociodemographic characteristics across regions. Results: The analysis included 16,251 females with 27% of them having a pregnancy during adolescence. We found low education, low wealth index, low female empowerment, and older sexual partners to be significant determinants for adolescent pregnancy. Conclusions: The findings highlight the need for a sexual health paradigm that addresses young female adolescent empowerment particularly in rural Colombia.","Datasets provided by ICF, The DHS Program.",,International Journal of Sexual Health,,,,2020-07-02,2020,2020-08-04,2020-07-02,32,3,293-305,Closed,Article,"Drewry, Jonathan; Garcés-Palacio, Isabel C.","Drewry, Jonathan (Pan American Health Organization, Bridgetown, Barbados); Garcés-Palacio, Isabel C.

The present research explores a new configuration named Non-Attached Electrode-Dielectric Triboelectric Sensor (NEDTS) and its application in specialized HMI to support people with disabilities in daily life. In this topology, the conductive electrodes are not bonded to the dielectric materials by any coating or sputtering process. Instead, due to the triboelectric interaction between the two elements in motion, voltage is generated in a separate conductor by non-contact electrostatic induction. This allows a near field remote sensing using triboelectric/electrostatic coupling. By applying the mentioned sensing technique, an Orbicularis Oculi muscle motion sensor has been developed to monitor voluntary and involuntary eye blinks. The new transducer is integrated into a portable HMI for hands-free computer cursor control to assist people with mobility impairment. The conceived device was also tested in other applications as hands-free remote car and drone control, and for monitoring driving behaviour. Additionally, a PDMS-based eyelid motion sensor has been tested to feature other virtues of the NEDTS when sensing unconventional motion dynamics.","This work was primarily supported by the Australian Research Council Future Fellowships Grant (FT130100430) and partly supported by the grant from the National Research Foundation: Competitive Research Project ‘Peripheral Nerve Prostheses: A Paradigm Shift in Restoring Dexterous Limb Function’ (NRF-CRP10-2012-01), and the grant from the HIFES Seed Funding: ‘Hybrid Integration of Flexible Power Source and Pressure Sensors’ (R-263-501-012-133).",,Nano Energy,,,,2020-06,2020,,2020-06,72,,104675,Closed,Article,"Anaya, David Vera; He, Tianyiyi; Lee, Chengkuo; Yuce, Mehmet R.","Anaya, David Vera (Department of Electrical and Computer Systems Engineering, Monash University, 14 Alliance Lane, Monash University, Clayton, Victoria, Australia; Biomedical Integrated Circuits and Sensors Laboratory, 14 Alliance Lane, Monash University, Clayton, Victoria, Australia); He, Tianyiyi (Department of Electrical Computer Engineering, National University of Singapore, 4 Engineering Drive 3, 117576, Singapore; National University of Singapore Suzhou Research Institute (NUSRI), Suzhou, Industrial Park, Suzhou, 215123, China; Hybrid Integrated Flexible Electronic Systems (HIFES), 5 Engineering Drive 1, 117608, Singapore; Center for Intelligent Sensors and MEMS, National University of Singapore, 4, Engineering Drive 3, 117576, Singapore); Lee, Chengkuo (Department of Electrical Computer Engineering, National University of Singapore, 4 Engineering Drive 3, 117576, Singapore; National University of Singapore Suzhou Research Institute (NUSRI), Suzhou, Industrial Park, Suzhou, 215123, China; Hybrid Integrated Flexible Electronic Systems (HIFES), 5 Engineering Drive 1, 117608, Singapore; Center for Intelligent Sensors and MEMS, National University of Singapore, 4, Engineering Drive 3, 117576, Singapore); Yuce, Mehmet R.

Individually, ammonium nitrate was tested as a nitrogen source and chicken bone ash as a phosphate source. For this, laboratory tests were made on soil columns from the area to be remediated. The mobility and availability of metals and nutrients were determined by analyzing their leachates chemically. The results showed that the use of chicken bone ash decreases soluble metal concentrations, particularly in Fe and soluble Mn. On the other hand, experimental conditions proved that the acidification produced by ammonium nitrate nitrification does not significantly increase the lechate metal content. Therefore, its use for fertilization does not involve phytotoxicity risks. Regarding the availability of macronutrients as well as trace elements, the results showed that the concentrations lie within the ranges suitable for plant nutrition. So, the treatments are effective both for fertilization and phytoremediation.Graphic abstract",This study is part of CORFO-INNOVA Project 08CM01-05 “Integrated development of magneto-chemical technologies and phytotechnologies applied to the remediation of heavy metals in mining environmental liability development.” Thanks to Mr. Dangelo Salinas-Valle for his support in the development of the experimental procedures.,,Environmental Geochemistry and Health,,,"Animals; Biodegradation, Environmental; Chile; Copper; Environmental Restoration and Remediation; Fertilizers; Metals; Mining; Nitrates; Nitrogen; Poultry; Soil; Soil Pollutants; Waste Products",2020-10-24,2020,2020-10-24,2021-06,43,6,2213-2230,Closed,Article,"Montofré, Ítalo L.; Lam, Elizabeth J.; Ramírez, Yendery; Gálvez, María E.","Montofré, Ítalo L.

CE 100–1436),"Ancient exchange practices have long been at the centre of comparative studies of social complexity. While finding valuable information, this approach has paid less attention to the multi-layered cultural understandings underpinning past transactions, ultimately diluting the power of archaeology to understand specific historical trajectories. This article examines the circulation and uses of obsidian in two sectors of the Calchaquí Valleys area of northwestern Argentina, considering contextual information from Early to Late Period (ca. CE 100–1436) settlements. Travelling far and widely, obsidian wove people and places in space and time through material interactions, condensing the broader regional world into partible materials for everyday use. While maintaining a generalised access ethos throughout the sequence, obsidian also enabled new forms of communal organisation and leadership. The article contributes to wider interdisciplinary approaches to the ontology of resources and their transformative social power, both in the Andes and beyond.","Declaration of Competing Interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

Analytical, numerical and experimental investigations have been conducted to study this failure mechanism as well as its controlling parameters. Both singly reinforced and doubly reinforced concrete walls have been studied under unidirectional and bidirectional loading. A simplified approach making use of concrete columns representing boundary zones of rectangular walls has also been used to reduce the computational and experimental costs of the research programs. This paper provides a state-of-the-art on the research conducted on this failure mechanism and the corresponding findings, with the main focus on the walls with rectangular cross-sections and under unidirectional loading. The out-of-plane response of walls is classified into five different modes and the likely forms of force-displacement and out-of-plane displacement history plots corresponding to each mode are discussed.","The authors wish to acknowledge the financial support provided by the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment (MBIE) and the Quake Centre at the University of Canterbury to conduct this research.",,Journal of Earthquake Engineering,,,,2020-01-28,2020,2020-01-28,2022-02-17,26,3,1325-1346,Closed,Article,"Dashti, Farhad; Dhakal, Rajesh P.; Pampanin, Stefano","Dashti, Farhad (Quake Centre, University of Canterbury, Christchurch, New Zealand); Dhakal, Rajesh P.

The association between socio-economic factors and depression among 384 older persons was determined through descriptive-correlational design. Path analysis revealed that depression is influenced directly by one’s age (r = .108), education status (r = .514), marital status (r = .011), occupation (r = .003), social status (r = −.116), physical stature (r = .099) and economic status (r = .011). Additionally, the type of community where the older persons dwell and gender have a direct influence on occupation (r = .003) and indirectly affecting depression (r = .103). On the other hand, family component has a direct influence on social status (r = .069) but indirectly influences the occurrence of depression (r = .127). Explicitly, these variables render a predictive path on the occurrence or non-occurrence of depression among the respondents. The study suggests that the diagnosis of depression and its prompt interventions can be traced to the socio-economic dimensions of older persons. Implications to research suggest that determining the antecedents to depression of older persons, this provides a projective analysis which can lead to the development of new knowledge in nursing.

This study brings together all available archaeobotanical evidence gathered in the Atacama Desert from the Late Pleistocene (ca. 13,000 cal bp) until the Inka epoch (ca. 450 cal bp) to help us comprehend when these populations acquired and managed useful plants from the coastal zone, Intermediate Depression, High Andes, as well as tropical and subtropical ecosystems. Widespread introduction of farming crops, water control techniques and cultivation of diverse plants by 3,000 cal bp ended not only a chronic food shortage, but also led to the establishment of a set of staple foods for the Atacama Desert dwellers, a legacy that remains visible today. By contrasting these trends with major sociocultural changes, together with palaeodemographic and climatic fluctuations, we note that humans adapted to, and transformed this hyperarid landscape and oscillating climate, with plants being a key factor in their success. This long-term process, which we term the “Green Revolution”, coincided with an exponential increase in the number of social groups inhabiting the Atacama Desert during the Late Holocene.","The database presented here began as part of a collaborative effort to compare cultural trajectories across the Australia, Namib and Atacama Deserts, which is still a work in progress.

The main residue from its cultivation is the cassava stalk, which is normally used as soil fertilizer or in culture propagation. The main goal of this paper is to evaluate two routes (biochemical and thermochemical) for bioenergy production (ethanol and synthesis gas—electricity) using cassava stalk as raw material. A detailed techno-economic and energy assessment is carried out based on the simulation approach of both conversion routes to determine the production costs of main products and the overall energy efficiency of the processes. The electricity production costs vary from 0.008 to 0.037 USD/MJ, whereas the ethanol production costs range from 1.11 to 2.02 USD/L (including subsidies). The change in the production costs was observed due to the assumptions of the model, e.g., cassava stalk, transportation, and enzyme costs.

Both long-term potentiation (LTP) and spatial memory formation in the hippocampus involve the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase type 2 (NOX2) enzyme. Previous studies have reported that N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) activation increases NOX2-mediated superoxide generation, resulting in inhibition of NMDAR function, but whether NOX2 impacts NMDAR function in PAE animals leading to impaired LTP and memory formation remains unknown. We aim to evaluate whether the NOX2-NMDAR complex is involved in the long-lasting deleterious effects of PAE on hippocampal LTP and memory formation. Results: Here we provide novel evidence that PAE animals display impaired NMDAR-dependent LTP in the cornus ammonis field 1 (CA1) and NMDAR-mediated LTP in the dentate gyrus (DG). Moreover, PAE rats displayed increased NMDAR-mediated transmission in both hippocampal areas. Interestingly, NOX2 pharmacological inhibition restored NMDAR-mediated transmission and LTP in the CA1, but not in the DG. PAE also induced overexpression of NOX2 and CaMKII isoforms, but did not modify the content or the redox state of the N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor subunit-1 (NR1) subunit of NMDAR in both areas of the hippocampus. In addition, adolescent PAE rats orally fed the antioxidant and free radical scavenger apocynin exhibited significantly improved spatial memory acquisition. Innovation and Conclusion: By showing in PAE animals NOX2 overexpression and increased NMDAR-mediated transmission, which might lead to impaired synaptic plasticity and memory formation in a region-specific manner, we provide an important advance to our current understanding of the cellular mechanisms underlying PAE-dependent defective hippocampal function.","We thank Daniela Garcia, Sofia Vargas-Roberts, Luis Montecinos, Iris Rodriguez, and Nicolás Santibañez for technical assistance; and Floria Pancetti for facilitating the Morris water maze equipment.","This work was supported by the Chilean government through FONDECYT Regular Grant # 1140855 (P.A.H.), # 1170053 (C.H.), 1130407 (G.S.), # 1151091 (A.E.C.) and by the Millennium Institute Centro Interdisciplinario de Neurociencia de Valparaiso (CINV, P09-022F) and Nucleus Biology of Neuropsychiatric Diseases (NuMIND, NC 130011 to A.E.C.), Millennium Scientific Initiative of the Ministry of Economy, Development and Tourism, Chile.

Kernel density functions by groups are estimated; counterfactuals are generated by weighting wages of informal sector workers by their probability of working in the formal sector, to estimate how much an informal sector worker could make if treated as formal, according to his characteristics.

The objective of the study was to translate the WTLS into Spanish, assess its internal structure, reliability, and the correlates between WTLS and life satisfaction, resilience, and depression in older Peruvian adults.
METHOD: The participants were 235 Peruvian older adults (M=72.69, SD=6.68), evaluated between March to May 2019, selected through non-probability sampling. The WTLS, the Satisfaction with Life Scale (SWLS), the Brief Resilient Coping Scale (BRCS) and the Patient Health Questionnaire-2 (PHQ-2) were administered. Data analysis included reliability by internal consistency and structural equation models, specifically confirmatory factor analysis (AFC), to test the one-dimensional solution of the WTLS and the convergent validity of the WTLS at the latent level, by specifying a four-factor model (will to live, life satisfaction, resilience and depression).
RESULTS: Cronbach's alpha coefficient and the composite reliability index obtain values of .93 and .94, respectively. The one-dimensional structure of the WTLS was fitted to the data (χ2(5)=10,067, P=.073, CFI=.999, RMSEA=.066, SRMR=.014) and showed positive associations with the SWLS (ρ=.82), and BRCS (ρ=.86), as well as negative associations with the PHQ-2 (ρ=-.66).

The pH is one of the influential parameters on the desired calcium carbonate mineralization due to the resulting textures of this mineral. Moreover, the decrease in microbial growth under the extreme alkaline environment compatible with the sustainability of concrete has been the bottleneck for an effective application of Microbial Induced Carbonate Precipitation (MICP) in the concrete industry. Microbial consortia have shown more robustness in their resistance to environmental fluctuations than pure cultures. In addition, microorganisms obtained from alkaline environments could facilitate their adaptation to extreme alkalinity. The aim of this study was to obtain urease producing bacteria (UPB) able to maintain a high MICP performance under extremely alkaline conditions compatible with concrete by adapting native microorganisms obtained from extreme environments. The growth performance, urease activity, strength of the generated biocement, and CaCO3 mineralogy were compared with the best-performer urease-producing bacteria (UPB), S. pasteurii DSMZ 33. The native bacteria presented a similar performance in growth and urease activity than S. pasteurii under extreme alkaline conditions (pH 12.5). However, the generated biocement of native Sporosarcina sp. achieved 461 % more unconfined compressive strength (UCS) and 120 % more CaCO3 content than the biocement generated by S. pasteurii DSMZ 33. The careful adaptation process performed in this study for native UPB and S. pasteurii DSMZ 33 is an interesting approach with promising and projectable results for future engineering and biotechnological applications. These results have important implications for the design of engineering solutions involving MICP. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: A consolidated and strong biocement was generated by a native species obtained from extreme ecosystems in an effort of bioprospecting to enhance the performance of biotechnological solutions for geotechnical applications in the concrete and soil-improvement industries. Biocement generated by the native species was stronger than the generated by one of the best-described biocementation performers. This native species was able to actively growing and do perform microbial-induced-carbonate-mineralization under extreme alkalinity conditions after a careful laboratory adaptation process. The native species presented unique and differentiating traits that gave it a better adaptability and biocementation performance. The same occurs with a priceless microbial diversity inhabiting little explored and unprotected extreme ecosystems. Extreme environments house a fascinating biodiversity with potential value for ecosystem services.",Declaration of Competing Interest None.

The paper details into performance analysis and optimisation of new strategies for setting-up the process to achieve an optimal configuration of the machine. Three strategies, designed to optimise the packaging process, are analysed and compared in terms of supplying products to the hoppers. A factorial design of the experimental model is exploited to predict the measures of performance as a function of a variety of control settings. Results of the numerical experiments are used to analyse the sources of variability and to identify the optimum operating conditions for the multihead weigher. Therefore, the findings of this paper will benefit both manufacturer and users of the multihead weigher machine.

There is a need to inspect interaction models, as it avoids the propagation of defects to other artefacts. We created two inspection techniques for interaction models, called MoLVERIC Cards (MCards) and MoLVERIC Check (MCheck). MCards employs a gamification mechanism to motivate practitioners during the inspection. MCheck is a simple technique to be used by practitioners in a traditional way. Both techniques have questions, whose answers assist in identifying defects. We performed three studies to verify whether these techniques support the inspection of interaction models. In the first and second studies, we evaluated MCards and MCheck in comparison with an ad‐hoc technique supported by the conventional inspection approach based on defect types. The results of these studies showed that both techniques support the inspection of interaction models. In the third study, we evaluated MCard in comparison with MCheck to understand the participants'; perceptions of both techniques. The study results showed that MCards was considered more suitable for practitioners interested in using dynamic activities, while MCheck was considered more suitable for practitioners who want to use a more traditional technique.","We thank the support provided by CAPES/Procad (grant no. 175956/2013) and CNPq (grant nos. 423149/2016‐4, 311494/2017‐0, and 311316/2018‐2).",,IET Software,,,,2020-08,2020,2020-08,2020-08,14,4,358-368,Closed,Article,"Damian, Adriana Lopes; Marques, Anna Beatriz; Silva, Williamson; Barbosa, Simone Diniz Junqueira; Conte, Tayana","Damian, Adriana Lopes (Federal University of Amazonas (UFAM), Manaus, AM, Brazil); Marques, Anna Beatriz (Federal University of Ceará (UFC), Russas, CE, Brazil); Silva, Williamson (Federal University of Amazonas (UFAM), Manaus, AM, Brazil); Barbosa, Simone Diniz Junqueira (Pontifical Catholic University of Rio de Janeiro (PUC-Rio), Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brazil); Conte, Tayana (Federal University of Amazonas (UFAM), Manaus, AM, Brazil)","Damian, Adriana Lopes (Federal University of Amazonas)","Damian, Adriana Lopes (Federal University of Amazonas); Marques, Anna Beatriz (Universidade Federal do Ceará); Silva, Williamson (Federal University of Amazonas); Barbosa, Simone Diniz Junqueira (Pontifical Catholic University of Rio de Janeiro); Conte, Tayana (Federal University of Amazonas)",1,0,,0.32,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1124319611,46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4608 Human-Centred Computing,

Engineering design methods to estimate the deflection of these structures are required for this purpose. In the present work, a p–y model for large diameter monopiles subjected to lateral loading is proposed. The model considers a pile in cohesionless soil subjected to static and long-term cyclic loading. Its formulation features the consideration of nonlinear relations for the ultimate soil resistance pu and the initial subgrade modulus Epy0 among the soil depth and a cyclic factor that accounts for the effect of the soil density and loading amplitude. A relation is also proposed to account for a base shear force at the tip of the monopile. The proposed relations were employed and solved under the beam on nonlinear Winkler foundation (BNWF) approach and were adjusted to simulate a number of three-dimensional (3D) finite-element (FE) models accurately, accounting for variations on pile geometry, soil properties, and loading conditions. In the end, the performance of the proposed relations was evaluated through the comparison with a field test and a centrifuge test.",The authors appreciate the financial support given by COLCIENCIAS (Colombia) for the project with code 1215748-59323 from the convocation 748-2016.,,Journal of Geotechnical and Geoenvironmental Engineering,,,,2020-11-28,2020,2020-11-28,2021-02,147,2,04020164,Closed,Article,"Fuentes, W.; Gil, M.; Rivillas, G.","Fuentes, W.

638,pub.1125974421,10.1016/j.jhydrol.2020.124899,,,Origin and variability of oxygen and hydrogen isotopic composition of precipitation in the Central Andes: A review,"This review concerns the knowledge of the isotopic composition of current precipitation and its association with climate, geography and orography, in the Central Andes (14–28°S and 75–63°W). This knowledge is required for the evaluation of other hydrological values, especially aquifer recharge and water resources, in environments varying from rainy to hyper-arid. Since the 1960s, oxygen (δ18O) and deuterium (δ2H) isotope composition of natural water have been used as tracers of the global hydrological cycle. In the present article, the goal is to identify the origin and trajectory of air masses that produce rainfall in the Central Andes and the isotopic composition of the precipitation, as a first step to evaluate recharge and groundwater resources. The isotopic composition of rainfall varies spatially and temporarily, depending on the climatic phenomena that originate the movement of air masses, their moisture content and the isotope fractionation processes that occur until precipitation falls. Most of the significant and recent literature on the mechanisms of δ18O and δ2H transport and fractionation in precipitation along the Central Andes has been collected and summarized in this review. Precipitation in the eastern and central Andes comes mainly from the humidity generated in the Atlantic Ocean. Although the processes involved in isotope content variability of precipitation are well known, the processes involved in isotopic variability in the Western Cordillera remain poorly understood. This is mostly due to mixing of different moisture sources: from the Atlantic Ocean in summer and from the Pacific Ocean in winter. In general, winter rainfall is more enriched in δ18O and δ2H than summer rainfall. Looking at existing data, their distribution is far from being homogeneous and well-distributed, so spatial accuracy is poor in some areas, especially in the Altiplano. Hydrological and hydrogeological research and water resources evaluation in the Central Andes would greatly benefit from initiatives to obtain broader spatial coverage of rainfall collection to get isotope data for more accurate and continuous assessment of the local weather patterns. Groundwater isotope composition is a future tool to help in increasing the coverage in data scarce areas.","The authors acknowledge SQM (Chile) for their support and for sharing isotopes data of the Salar de Atacama, as well as Southern Copper (Peru) for providing isotopic information.

The most common species were Boophilus decoloratus Koch and Rhipicephalus evertsi evertsi Neumann. Rhipicephalus follis Donitz, R. gertrudae Feldman-Muhsam and R. punctatus Warburton were also present in fewer numbers. Cattle were ranked according to their degree of resistance to the total tick infestations. Tick numbers varied throughout the year on all individuals but some animals consistently tended to have either higher or lower numbers than the mean of the group. Tick burdens on cattle classified as having a relatively low resistance to tick infestations increased eleven-fold, compared to a four-fold increase on cattle with high resistance from August 1998 to April 1999. Thirty-two percent of the cattle in the total study group (n=10) carried 50% of the total tick burden. Farmers in the region can visually assess B. decoloratus and R. evertsi evertsi burdens, the most abundant tick species, and sell or cull the most susceptible cattle. This should eventually result in the direct improvement of the overall tick resistance of their cattle and will help in management and control of tick populations infesting their animals.",,,The Journal of Protozoology Research,,,,2020-09-26,2020,2020-09-26,,12,3-4,43-48,Closed,Article,"HLATSHWAYO, M.; MBATI, P.A.; DIPEOLU, O.O.","HLATSHWAYO, M.

In South Africa, only shareholders who are entered in the shareholders’ register can make use of the remedy, contrary to the Australian application. The Australian case law explains the locus standi of shareholders who are not entered in the register. Reference is also made to South Africa's previous Companies Act 1973 due to the Smyth v Investec appeal court case, where the court applied the principles, relevant to an oppressive remedy under the 1973 act. In this regard, the appeal court's reasoning is compared to that of the Australian court; possible new perspectives relevant to South Africa's new Companies Act 2008 are also discussed. The Australian perspective is included to facilitate investigation of a South African court's approach to oppressive conduct concerning the narrow interpretation of “shareholder”.

It is crucial to select and develop cultivars that attend to the regional requirements with high productivity, adaptability, and stability, due to the interaction between the genotype and the environment. This research aimed to select strains of cowpea for the simultaneous presence of high genotypic productivity, adaptability, and stability in the North-eastern region of the state of Rio de Janeiro (Brazil) by the GGE-Biplot method. The study assessed 27 genotypes: 23 strains and four cultivars, in six environments of the North-eastern region of the state of Rio de Janeiro, during the years 2016, 2017, and 2018. The experimental design was a randomized block design with four repetitions. The GGE-Biplpot method assessed the genotypic adaptability and stability, by the use of the statistical software R. The interaction between the environment and the genotypes was complex, and the general average for the productivity of the grains was 1231.98 kg/ha. GGE-Biplot method was efficient in identifying the best strains to be suggested for the use in the North-eastern region of the state of Rio de Janeiro. The strains (9), (3), and (6) were classified as ideotypes due to their superior performance compared to the general average, and their stability. Their performance overcame the control cultivars BRS Tumucumaque, BRS Imponente, BRS-Itaim e CB-27.","We are grateful to the Coordination for the Improvement of Higher Education Personnel (CAPES), the Research Support Foundation of the State of Rio de Janeiro (FAPERJ) and the Fluminense State University of the North Darcy Ribeiro for encouraging research.",,Euphytica,,,,2020-09-25,2020,2020-09-25,2020-10,216,10,160,Closed,Article,"da Cruz, Derivaldo Pureza;

The study was based on the interpretive research paradigm, which encompasses a systematic literature review. Data were collected through different documents, such as journal articles, web pages, monographs, strategic plans, annual reports and archival legislation, with the latter providing the ENA with a statutory role to manage and preserve public records in the country. The key findings suggest that the ENA is making a remarkable effort in preserving public records. However, there was also evidence of different records preservation challenges for the ENA, including the absence of legislation and policies relating to the management and preservation of records, an inadequate budgetary allocation to support the archival activities, as well as inadequate archives and records preservation training.

First, to validate the Technology Readiness Index 2.0, which originated in the USA and measures technology adoption, in a less technologically mature country, Chile. Second, to explore the perceptions of Chilean users of new technologies to classify and compare them with users from the USA. Data were collected in two Chilean regions through a face-to-face survey with a final sample size of 788 respondents. Latent class analysis was used as a segmentation tool. We obtained five groups of users: pioneers, hesitators, avoiders, explorers, and skeptics. The clusters found in this current study are to some extent similar to those obtained in the pioneering research conducted in the USA, although there are differences in their order of importance. These findings can help companies to adopt innovations to specific market segments. As a result, the rate of success of these innovations would improve.","We acknowledge Parasuraman and Rockbridge Associates, Inc. for providing the scale of Technology Readiness Index 2.0.

329,pub.1124347687,10.1088/1361-6404/ab7026,,,On the infinities in the electric potential of unbounded charge distributions,"In every beginner electricity and magnetism course, a good teacher usually insists that if one has an infinite charged plate or an infinity charged wire, one must first calculate the electric field to find the potential difference between two space points by making a linear integral of the field. One does it this way because Coulomb’s potential, i.e. the expression which allows for a direct calculation of the potential without first calculating the electric field, should not be used since these charge distributions are not bounded in space. Due to the unbounded nature of these distributions, Coulomb’s potential diverges at all points of space in the two previously mentioned cases. However, in this work, we are going to demonstrate that in fact one can use Coulomb’s potential to find the correct results by properly removing the infinities that appear in the potential of these distributions. This is possible because electric potential, like potential energy, is only defined up to an additive constant, which in the mentioned cases can be chosen as an infinite constant. One can show that the removal of these infinities is a simple example of the renormalization techniques commonly used in quantum field theory.","The author thanks Professor Julio M Yáñez of Universidad Católica del Norte (Antofagasta, Chile) for suggestions and time spent in many discussions.",,European Journal of Physics,,,,2020-04-22,2020,2020-04-22,2020-05-01,41,3,035205,Closed,Article,"Mundarain, Douglas","Mundarain, Douglas (Departamento de Fı́sica, Universidad Católica del Norte, Casilla 1280, Antofagasta, Chile)",,"Mundarain, Douglas (Catholic University of the North)",3,1,,1.44,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1124347687,51 Physical Sciences; 5106 Nuclear and Plasma Physics,

The assessment is based on real data, whereas the composite indicators include waste generation, composting waste, recycling waste, landfilling waste, recycling rate, waste to the energy rate, and greenhouse gas emissions from waste. The comparison is done by recent multiple-attribute decision-making method, i.e. the best-worst method combined with the evaluation based on the distance from the average solution. Experts selected waste generation (0.26), greenhouse gas emissions from waste (0.21), rate and amount of recycling waste (0.142) as the most important indicators in the assessment. The comparative evaluation indicates that Sweden has the best waste management profile (0.9748), whereas the weakest performance was obtained for Iceland (0.2425). Sweden waste management profile presents strength in lower rate of waste generation per capita, greenhouse gas emission and landfilling section as compared to neighboring countries.

                  The spider crab Petramithrax pygmaeus (Bell, 1836), a phyletic dwarf, was used to test predictions regarding reproductive performance in small marine invertebrates. Considering the disproportional increase in brooding costs and the allometry of egg production with increasing body size, it was expected that this minute-size species would produce large broods compared to closely related species that attain much larger body sizes. Fecundity in P. pygmaeus females carrying early and late eggs varied, respectively, between 17 and 172 eggs crab–1 (mean ± SD = 87.97 ± 48.39) and between 13 and 159 eggs crab–1 (55.04 ± 40.29). Females did not experience brood loss during egg development. Egg volume in females carrying early and late eggs varied, respectively, between 0.13 and 0.40 mm3 (0.22 ± 0.07) and between 0.15 and 0.42 mm3 (0.26 ± 0.06 mm3). Reproductive output (RO) varied between 0.91 and 8.73% (3.81 ± 2.17%) of female dry body weight. The RO of P. pygmaeus was lower than that reported for closely related species with larger body sizes. The slope (b = 0.95 ± 0.15) of the line describing the relationship between brood and parental female dry weight was not statistically significant from unity. Overall, our results disagree with the notion that the allometry of gamete production and increased physiological costs with increased brood size explain the association between brooding and small body size in marine invertebrates. Comparative studies on the reproductive investment of brooding species belonging to monophyletic clades with extensive differences in body size are warranted to further our understanding about disparity in egg production in brooding marine invertebrates.","This project was supported by the Clemson University Creative Inquiry program.

The proposed research aims a sustainable method to recover copper from a mixture of oxides and sulfides minerals. The procedure involves three stages: (i) leaching with aqueous ammonia solutions at room temperature and varied pH, ammonia concentration, solid concentration, and particle size; (ii) PLS precipitation in copper sulfides by the addition of sulfur (or other copper sulfates) and SO2 (or additional sulfites or bisulfites); (iii) froth flotation to recover the value sulfide, considering a set of collectors and frothers.

                    The purpose of this study is to assess the appraisal of records at the University of Witwatersrand and the University of Venda. Furthermore, the study intends to recommend appraisal of records to recognize African culture, reviewing records management policy to include an element on the appraisal of records, raise awareness on the appraisal of records, capacity building and develop electronic records management strategy to appraise records.
                  
                  
                    Design/methodology/approach
                    This study is based on the qualitative research technique. The research approach is a multiple case study comparing the previously advantaged and disadvantaged universities in South Africa.
                  
                  
                    Findings
                    The study found that archives and records management legislation, archives and records management policy, re-appraisal of records, capacity building are essential for the appraisal of university records. Lack of appropriate appraisal theory and strategy by the University of Witwatersrand and the University of Venda leads to a loss of institutional memory.

During laboratory tests a spectral resolution of about 70 000 was achieved. The peak efficiency of the entire optical path of the spectrograph (without light losses at the CCD, primary mirror of the 6-m telescope, and in the atmosphere) at 620 nm and with the equivalent slit widths of the 1″.5 and 0″.75 are equal to 8% and 4%, respectively. The resolving power R = 70 000 and 100 000 can be reached with the sky aperture 0″.75 and 0″.4 respectively. In the current version of the spectrograph these regimes of operation are implemented by mechanic aperturing of the slit. A dedicated projecting camera has been developed and is currently manufactured to operate with a collimated 200-mm diameter beam, which will make it possible to increase the spectral resolution up to 100 000. A two-beam image slicer will be used to maintain the luminous efficiency of the instrument at least at the 6% level.",,,Astrophysical Bulletin,,,,2020-04,2020,2020-07-27,2020-04,75,2,191-197,Closed,Article,"Valyavin, G.

All samples were synthesized via solid‐state methods, using NaCl as mineralizer. Through Rietveld refinement was found that the Eu 3+ cations only occupy the Y1 (2c) sites of the host‐matrix. The thermal stability of the undoped sample was investigated using simultaneous TG‐DSC thermal analyses. The SEM analysis revealed that the doped and the undoped samples have tendency to form microcrystals with smooth surfaces and in both cases it is possible to observe some agglomerates of nanoparticles. Periodic Density Functional Theory calculations (DFT) were carried out to investigate the electronic properties of the undoped material; these results show good agreement with the experimental ones. The emission spectra of all doped‐samples are dominated by the electric dipole transition (ED) 5 D 0 → 7 F 2 located at 613 nm, which indicates that the Eu 3+ ions are located in non‐centrosimetric sites in the host‐structure.","The authors gratefully acknowledge the financial support of CONICYT‐Fondecyt (Chile) Grant 1181302, 11171063 and 3170076 and the Unidad de Equipamiento Científico “MAINI” of the Universidad Católica del Norte for the generation of data through the XRD team, and FIC‐Regional Project EQU‐25 Conicyt 2009–2010, and SEM analysis.",,Zeitschrift für anorganische und allgemeine Chemie,,,,2020-04-09,2020,2020-04-09,2020-07-31,646,14,1122-1129,Closed,Article,"Castillo, Rodrigo; Espinoza, Darío; Conejeros, Sergio; Llanos, Jaime","Castillo, Rodrigo (Dpto.

 A new spectrophotometric method has been developed for the determination of iodate through the in situ production of iodine. The oxidation of the N , N -dimethyl- p -phenylenediamine (R) molecule produces a stable oxidation intermediate, semiquinondiimine (S + ), which has a marked absorbance at 550 nm ( ε = 10 000). Iodine can be released from an iodate sample by adding KI. The released iodine begins to react in situ with R, producing twice as many S + molecules as a result of the reaction of quinondiimine (T + ), the final oxidation product, through a rapid syn-proportionation reaction with the excess R present in the solution. The absorbance is stoichiometrically proportional to the concentration of iodine and, consequently, the iodide concentration can be calculated. The pH range is 3–7 and the ratio [R]/[Ox] is 20 : 1. Calibration curves can be constructed with an R = 0.9997. The proposed method was compared with the traditional volumetric method and applied to veterinary supplement capsule and table salt samples. The limits of detection and quantification for iodine by the proposed method were estimated to be 0.020 mM and 0.036 mM, respectively.","This research was supported by an internal project of the Center for Research and Technological Development in Algae (CIDTA) of Universidad Católica del Norte (UCN), Chile.

The drop of the CH + and CH line intensities was demonstrated by Krełowski et al. (2016)—Paper I. More recent data suggest that the CH + interstellar lines reach the minimum of intensity in 2015–2016 being then followed by the evident rise, which continues. The intensities of CH lines show a similar drop to CH + . However, the further (after 2016) rise seems marginal if any. Thus, the CH + features grow since 2016 while those of CH remain almost constant, likely due to the fact that both species are formed in different environments. No variations in the radial velocities of the observed interstellar features were detected during the whole covered time period.","This paper includes data gathered with the VLT and UVES spectrograph, with the 3.5 m Telescopio Nazionale Galileo and HARPS‐N spectrograph, with the BOES spectrograph at the 1.8 m telescope at Bohyunsan Optical Astronomy Observatory (South Korea), with the 2 m telescope at ICAMER and the MAESTRO spectrograph, and with the 6.5 m telescope at Las Campanas and the MIKE spectrograph.

The aim of this study was to employ the CDC Biofilm Reactor to evaluate the capacity of F. psychrophilum to form biofilms on stainless steel, polystyrene, polyurethane, and polycarbonate. Scanning electron microscopy and confocal laser scanning microscopy were used to assess biofilm formation, while epifluorescence and qPCR methods were effectively used to determine cell contents. After a 72 h incubation period, F. psychrophilum had formed mature biofilms composed by dense, multilayered clusters of short bacilli on stainless steel, polystyrene, and polycarbonate. Nevertheless, biofilms formed on stainless steel presented a significantly higher cell density than those formed on polyurethane. Biofilm growth was poor on polyurethane surfaces. These findings will facilitate the design of appropriate guidelines for more efficiently managing F. psychrophilum and controlling the persistence of this pathogen in fish-farming environments.",This study was financed by the Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología (CONICYT) of Chile through the Project N° 1090793 and Fondef IT N° T18I0108.,,Aquaculture,,,,2020-01,2020,,2020-01,514,,734459,Closed,Article,"Vidal, José M.; Miranda, Claudio D.; De la Fuente, Mery; Alarcón, Manuel; Aroca, Germán; Sossa, Katherine; Ruiz, Pamela; Urrutia, Homero","Vidal, José M.

However, the methodologies proposed for flotation circuit design based on optimization, usually, do not consider regrinding. This work analyzes the effect of the uncertainty in flotation and regrinding stages on the design of flotation circuits via mathematical optimization. We postulate that there are few optimal circuit structures when regrinding is included in the design problem under uncertainty. Two methods of proof are used to confirm the postulated hypothesis: proof by construction and proof by exhaustion. Results obtained allow us to confirm the hypothesis, which allows separating the design of the flotation circuits into two steps. First, a set of optimal structures are determined. Second, the equipment design parameters and operating conditions are determined through simulation and laboratory tests.",Financial support from ANID (Fondecyt 1180826) and ANID PIA ACM170005 are gratefully acknowledged.,,Minerals Engineering,,,,2020-09,2020,,2020-09,156,,106524,Closed,Article,"Acosta-Flores, Renato; Lucay, Freddy A.; Gálvez, Edelmira D.; Cisternas, Luis A.","Acosta-Flores, Renato (Unidad de Equipamiento Científico (Maini), Universidad Católica del Norte, Antofagasta, Chile; Departamento de Ingeniería Química y Procesos de Minerales, Universidad de Antofagasta, Antofagasta, Chile); Lucay, Freddy A.

Similarly f is Lefschetz periodic point free if the Lefschetz numbers of all iterates of f are zero. In the present article we consider continuous self-maps on products of any number spheres of different dimensions.

                  New time-resolved photometric observations of three close but detached white dwarf/red dwarf binaries have enabled an in-depth analysis of their properties, combining new data with known information. For HZ 9, time-resolved photometric data have not been published previously. Our data reveal sinusoidal variations, with the orbital period showing unusual phase shifts between expected and observed light maximum epochs when combining our photometry with the precise radial velocity ephemeris. There are also variations of the photometric amplitude between 0.04 and 0.11 mag. Phase shifts and amplitude variations could be the result of a relatively strong magnetic activity of the secondary M star component, which seems to superimpose the usual reflection effect. This effect is dominant in the two remaining targets of our study. We improve the accuracy of the photometric ephemeris of KV Vel, complementing published data with light curves from the All-Sky Automated Survey (ASAS) and ASAS-SN and with our own observations. Finally, we also add new data for the central star of the planetary nebula Abell 65, complementing and confirming its previously published photometric ephemeris.","CR-V would like to thank the authorities of Universidad de Valparaíso for the allocation of a research grant for undergraduate students.

In real applications, it is necessary to analyze and recognize thousands of different foods. For this purpose, we propose a novel prediction scheme based on a class hierarchy that considers local classifiers, in addition to a flat classifier. In order to make a decision about which approach to use, we define different criteria that take into account both the analysis of the Epistemic Uncertainty estimated from the ‘children’ classifiers and the prediction from the ‘parent’ classifier. We evaluate our proposal using three Uncertainty estimation methods, tested on two public food datasets. The results show that the proposed method reduces parent-child error propagation in hierarchical schemes and improves classification results compared to the single flat classifier, meanwhile maintains good performance regardless the Uncertainty estimation method chosen.","This work was partially funded by TIN2018-095232-B-C21, SGR-2017 1742, Nestore project of the European Commission Horizon 2020 programme (Grant no. 769643), Validithi EIT Health program and CERCA Programme/Generalitat de Catalunya.

278,pub.1123508051,10.1002/jctb.6317,,,Fenton and solar photo‐Fenton processes in the depuration of wastewater resulting from production of grape juice. A factorial design,"Abstract  BACKGROUND Grapes used in the production of juice have high total phenolic content due to the undesirable fermentation process, consequence of the high content of sugar ant fatty acids in grapes, which produce a high amount of ethanol. Therefore, the amount of wastewater with a high concentration of organic matter is an environmental concern related to juice production. We evaluated the potential of the use of these Fenton and photo‐Fenton processes in the depuration of organic matter in the juice production wastewater and determined the factors that affect the treatment.   RESULTS  We obtained different levels of organic matter removal, with a higher level for the experimental conditions, that is, a high concentration of H 2 O 2 and Fe +2 and the use of UV irradiation (photo‐Fenton). In this case, COD and polyphenol elimination was 70.2 % and 36.1%, respectively, with juice wastewater under no pretreatment and applying UV irradiation. The most important factor in the removal of COD in juice wastewater was the concentration of Fe +2 , followed by H 2 O 2 and the presence of solar UV. The most important factor in the removal of polyphenols is the pretreatment of the juice wastewater, with better results whenthere is no pretreatment. The highest removal of polyphenols was obtained using the water without being pretreated.    CONCLUSIONS The specific energy consumption and the electrical energy per order under the photo‐Fentonprocess was lower than under the Fenton process, indicating a more efficient energy use. This is because the natural UV irradiation enhances the chemical reaction of the oxidation process, producing a higher difference in the concentration of COD and polyphenols in comparison to the process carried out without UV solar irradiation. © 2019 Society of Chemical Industry",The authors acknowledge the Capel Company and the Central Laboratory for Marine Aquaculture of the Marine Sciences Department of the Universidad Católica del Norte for equipment support.,,Journal of Chemical Technology & Biotechnology,,,,2020-01-13,2020,2020-01-13,2020-05,95,5,1329-1336,Closed,Article,"Poblete, Rodrigo; Cortes, Ernesto; Maldonado, Manuel I","Poblete, Rodrigo (Universidad Católica del Norte, Facultad de Ciencias del Mar, Escuela de Prevención de Riesgos y Medioambiente, 1780000, Coquimbo, Chile); Cortes, Ernesto (Universidad Católica del Norte, Facultad de Ciencias del Mar, Escuela de Prevención de Riesgos y Medioambiente, 1780000, Coquimbo, Chile); Maldonado, Manuel I (Plataforma Solar de Almería (CIEMAT), Almería, Spain; CIESOL, Joint Centre University of Almería‐CIEMAT, Almería, Spain)","Poblete, Rodrigo (Catholic University of the North)","Poblete, Rodrigo (Catholic University of the North); Cortes, Ernesto (Catholic University of the North); Maldonado, Manuel I (Centro de Investigaciones Energéticas, Medioambientales y Tecnológicas; University of Almería)",9,4,,0.94,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1123508051,40 Engineering; 4004 Chemical Engineering; 4011 Environmental Engineering,

Specifically, the equivalence between the Fano resonances obtained in T‐shaped double quantum dot system coupled to a superconducting lead (QD–QD–S) and a topological superconductor ring nanowire (QD–MBSs) is presented. The non‐zero value of the Fano (anti)resonance in the conductance of the QD‐MBSs systems is shown as a consequence of a complex Fano factor , which is equivalent to the complex Fano factor of the QD–QD–S. The complex nature of is understood as a sign of a phase introduced by the superconducting lead in the QD–QD–S. It is because of this phase that the correspondence between the QD–QD–S and the QD–MBSs is possible. It is believed that these results can help to reveal the importance of the Fano interference process toward the understanding of the role of the superconductor lead in the QD–QD–S system as well as giving a clear signature of the presence of MBS's in the topological system.",Acknowledgements A.M.C. gratefully acknowledges I.

This paper challenges the current notion that pushback width should be set at the distance that assures maximum equipment productivity. A hypothetical case study is presented, which shows that the value of a project may increase beyond that determined by traditional planning practices. It was found that it may be better to deploy more aggressive mining strategies, which are likely to result in greater operational complexity and thus reduced equipment productivity. A higher equipment productivity, which often corresponds to wider (and therefore a lower number of) pushbacks, will also often result in later ore extraction and require higher capital costs.

This article, therefore, aims to present a selective review of place identity studies in post-apartheid South Africa. A literature search was conducted using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses. Studies published in English between 1994 and 2020, relating to changing place identities as a result of apartheid in South Africa, were included in our search. The search yielded studies from which four key themes were identified – these being identity and belonging, social identity and discursive practice, cultural symbolism and group identity, and social inclusion and exclusion. These themes attest to the social construction of place identity, with people forming cognitive and affective bonds within groups. In addition, these themes show that mechanisms of inclusion and exclusion are crucial for identity formation in which the self is contrasted with ‘the other’. The studies collectively point to the intricacies surrounding attempts at desegregation and building social cohesion in post-apartheid South Africa.",,"Funding The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This article was made possible with the support from the Human Sciences Research Council (HSRC), the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR), and the University of Johannesburg (UJ), South Africa.",South African Journal of Psychology,,,,2020-09-28,2020,2020-09-28,2021-03,51,1,121-133,Closed,Article,"Dlamini, Simangele; Tesfamichael, Solomon G; Mokhele, Tholang","Dlamini, Simangele (Department of Geography, Environmental Management & Energy Studies, University of Johannesburg, South Africa; Research Knowledge Centre, Human Sciences Research Council, South Africa); Tesfamichael, Solomon G (Department of Geography, Environmental Management & Energy Studies, University of Johannesburg, South Africa); Mokhele, Tholang (Research Knowledge Centre, Human Sciences Research Council, South Africa)","Dlamini, Simangele (University of Johannesburg; Human Sciences Research Council)","Dlamini, Simangele (University of Johannesburg; Human Sciences Research Council); Tesfamichael, Solomon G (University of Johannesburg); Mokhele, Tholang (Human Sciences Research Council)",12,7,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1131273126,52 Psychology,

Northern Sotho, like any other language, has rules governing its spelling and orthography, thanks to T&O. The T&O and other editions of Northern Sotho terminology and orthography tried to dictate and explain the spelling and orthography rules to be followed in the writing of Northern Sotho words (native and adopted words). The spelling rules laid down are sometimes contradictory. This article shows the inconsistencies that prevail in the spelling of some Northern Sotho loanwords, arguing that some of these words are not fully adapted to the Northern Sotho spelling orthography. Writing a ‘sotho-ised’ version of a foreign word is not that simple; rules are sometimes broken (or rather bent) to suit the writer.

The structure, particle morphology, luminescence properties, and cytotoxicity of the hybrid heterostructure are discussed. X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Fourier transform infra-red (FT-IR) as well as Raman and photoluminescence spectra, were used for characterisation and monitoring of the heterostructure formation process. The results reveal the formation of the BT@ZnO:Yb heterostructure, and are consistent with the relative intensities and positions of peaks in the XRD spectra of BT and ZnO:Yb, with the average particle size of ~75 nm. Effective Qo coating was achieved and a narrow, well-defined, and high-intensity luminescence signal was detected at ~610 nm for all the analysed samples. In vitro studies suggested that treatment with 1 µg/ml BT@ZnO:Yb 3 mol% induced very low cytotoxicity on HeLa cells.The morphologie of the [BT@ZnO:Yb]-Qo heterostructures shows that the Nps were uniformly distributed throughout the Qo matrix, with the average particle diameter of ~80 nm with the tennis-ball-like spheres after the incorporation of chitosan. The prepared hybrid heterostructures exhibited a narrow, well-defined, and high-intensity luminescence peak at ~610 nm for all the analysed samples, and low cytotoxicity at 1 μg/ml.","This work has been partially financed by Basal Financing Program CONICYT, AFB180001 (CEDENNA).

This study numerically solves the hydrostatic equilibrium equation and the radial stability equation, both of which are modified from their standard form to introduce the cosmological constant. For the fluid, we consider a pressure p and an energy density ρ$$\rho $$, which are connected through the equation of state p=κδΓ$$p=\kappa \delta ^{\varGamma }$$ with δ=ρ-p/(Γ-1)$$\delta =\rho -p/(\varGamma -1)$$, where κ$$\kappa $$, Γ$$\varGamma $$ and δ$$\delta $$ represent the polytropic constant, adiabatic index and rest mass density of the fluid, respectively. The dependencies of the mass, radius and eigenfrequency of oscillations on both the cosmological constant and the adiabatic index are analyzed. For ranges of both the central rest mass density δc$$\delta _c$$ and the adiabatic index Γ$$\varGamma $$, we show that the stars have a larger (lower) mass and radius and a diminished (enhanced) stability when the cosmological constant Λ>0$$\varLambda >0$$ (Λ<0$$\varLambda <0$$) is increased (decreased). In addition, in a sequence of compact objects with fixed Γ$$\varGamma $$ and Λ$$\varLambda $$, the regions constructed by stable and unstable static equilibrium configurations are recognized by the conditions dM/dδc>0$$\mathrm{d}M/\mathrm{d}\delta _c>0$$ and dM/dδc<0$$\mathrm{d}M/\mathrm{d}\delta _c<0$$, respectively.","The authors thank Fundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de São Paulo (FAPESP), grant 2013/26258-4.

In this study, BaTiO3@ZnO multifunctional heterostructures and BaTiO3@ZnO:Eu were prepared via the combined sol-gel-hydrothermal methods. The structure, nanoparticle morphology, and optical properties of the heterostructure are discussed. X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), XPS, and Raman and photoluminescence spectra were used to characterize and monitor the heterostructure formation process. The results demonstrate that the Eu3+ ions were successfully incorporated into the ZnO matrix to form heterostructure BaTiO3@ZnO:Eu. Moreover, the optical and photoluminescence properties were investigated. The X-ray diffraction pattern shows that the BaTiO3@ZnO:Eu heterostructure is consistent with the relative intensities and positions of the peaks in the XRD, SAED and TEM spectra of BaTiO3 (BT) and ZnO:Eu, which are of rod-like shape. The intrinsic deep defect emission of ZnO and the transition emissions of both 5D0→7F1 at 593 nm and 5D0→7F2 at 616 nm, which are related to Eu3+, have been observed under excitation at 394 nm. The decrease in bandgap in response to increased doping and the addition of ZnO to BT can be attributed to the creation of sub-bands within the ZnO band range, thereby resulting in the continuous band effect and, consequently, band narrowing, which can provide guidance for the potential application for use in optical devices.","This work has been partially financed by P.

We analyzed the Water Dispersible Colloids (WDCs) of two adjacent soil profiles, located either on the active (named: Fan) or passive (named: Crust) sections of an alluvial fan. Colloidal particles (<500 nm) were fractionated using Asymmetric Field-Flow-Field Fractionation (AF4), which was coupled online to an Inductively Coupled Plasma-Mass Spectrometer (ICP-MS) and an Organic Carbon Detector (OCD) to detect the composition of size-fractionated colloids. Three size categories of particles were identified: nanoparticles (0.6–24 nm), fine colloids (24–210 nm), and medium colloids (210–500 nm). The two profiles differed distinctively in vertical WDC distribution and associated phosphorus (P) content. Fractograms of the Crust profile predominantly showed fine colloids, whereas the medium-sized colloids dominated those of the Fan. Furthermore, the highest colloid content in the Crust profile was found at the surface, while in the Fan, colloids accumulated at 10–20 cm depth, thus overall reflecting the different genesis and infiltration capacities of the soils. Despite very low concentration of colloidal P in these hyper-arid soils, a strong correlation between colloidal P and calcium (Ca), Silica (Si), aluminum (Al), iron (Fe), and OC content were found. This also revealed Ca-phosphates as the primary P retention from, with the association of P to phyllosilicates and Fe/Al (hydr-) oxides as the main soil colloidal fractions. Overall, our results did highlight that small local scale differences in topographic-derived distribution of water flow pathways, defined the formation of the crust-like surfaces, and ultimately the overall movement and distribution of nanoparticles and colloids in soil profiles under hyper-arid conditions.","This work was done as part of a Collaborative Research Center project: ‘Earth-Evolution at the Dry Limit,’ funded by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG, German Research Foundation) – Projektnummer 268236062 – SFB 1211.

Then this treated seawater was applied to improve the flocculation of clay-based tailings in a highly alkaline environment (pH 11). Tailings settling assays were conducted by using a PTFE 30 mm turbine type stirrer with an in-situ floc size characterisation utilising the Focused Beam Reflectance Measurement (FBRM) and Particle Vision Measurement (PVM) techniques. After mixing the pulp with the flocculant, the sample was settled, registering the evolution of the mudline and turbidity of the supernatant liquid. When operating with direct seawater at pH 11, magnesium complexes arise that impairs the flocculant performance. The polymer loses selectivity for the particles, causing weak aggregation and low settling rates. However, by diminishing the magnesium content before the seawater is incorporated into the process, the flocculant was able to bridge the particles and achieve a promising flocculation response. Microscopic characterisation of aggregates showed that these were larger and denser, improving the sedimentation rates considerably.

Citrus EOs, a by-product of citrus processing industries, could be a feasible alternative due to their vast production worldwide. Encapsulation techniques, such as microencapsulation, could enable EO application in animal feed, preserving EO bioactivity. This study analyzes the use of foodgrade polymers, chitosan and modified starch, for microencapsulation of a commercial citrus EO, Brazilian orange terpenes (BOT), by spray-drying. Physical properties characterization showed that the microencapsulated BOT (MB-OT) had a moisture content = 5.39 %, aw = 0.40 and bulk density = 0.42 g/mL. Overall, microparticles presented a slight irregular-spherical shape, with a mean diameter of 2.77 μm and high polydispersity. Encapsulation efficiency reached 61.17 %. Furthermore, the antibacterial activity results showed that MBOT exerted a higher activity on enterotoxigenic E. coli U21 (isolated from pig gut) than on Lactobacillus rhamnosus, thus presenting a selective antibacterial activity between the pathogenic and beneficial bacteria. Moreover, MBOT exerted a higher selective antibacterial performance than the raw BOT, meaning the antibacterial performance of the raw BOT was enhanced by encapsulation. This is probably because wall material besides protects the raw BOT against volatilization; it could have interacted in synergism with the raw BOT enhancing the antibacterial effect of the MBOT powder. Finally, limonene was detected as the major compound in BOT by polar/non-polar GC-MS. Therefore, the modified starch-chitosan matrix could result in advantageous to encapsulate BOT and turn feasible its application in animal feed.",,,Journal of Essential Oil Bearing Plants,,,,2020-09-02,2020,2020-12-07,2020-09-02,23,5,985-997,Closed,Article,"Ambrosio, Carmen M.S.; Alvim, Izabela D.; Castillo, Carmen J.

Cross-sectional and longitudinal studies,"Introduction The aim of these studies was to evaluate the effects of regular volleyball training on salivary SIgA and alpha-amylase in female children and adolescents. Material and method In the cross-sectional study, 115 female children (12.6±2.2 years) participating in a Volleyball training program were classified as beginners, intermediate, and competitive level. The children were evaluated regarding caries index, body mass index (BMI), cardiorespiratory fitness, and countermovement jump. In the longitudinal study: 54 girls (intermediate and competitive groups) trained for 8 weeks and were re-evaluated at weeks 4 and 8. Results The SIgA secretion rate and alpha-amylase activity did not present correlations with training category, age, caries index, or training status. A weak positive correlation was detected between IgA secretion rate and BMI (r =0.20, p <0.05). After 8 weeks of training, VO2max (p <0.005) and jump height (p <0.005) improved in the competitive girls. No differences were observed in salivary secretion rate, SIgA concentration and secretion rate, or alpha-amylase activity at weeks 4 and 8. Conclusion We concluded that despite improving physical fitness, 8-weeks of recreational volleyball training are not able to improve salivary SIgA secretion or alter alpha-amylase activity in female children and adolescents.","The authors would like to thank the Coordination for the Improvement of Higher Education Personnel (CAPES) for granting a scholarship to C.P.S.

A qualitative approach was utilised. Individual interviews were conducted with 20 participants utilising a semi-structured interview guide. Data were analysed through thematic analysis. Seven themes with various subthemes were derived from the data analysis. The findings suggest that correctional officers are confronted with various challenges daily. Officers revealed that their work and work environment had a negative impact on their physical and psychological health as well as their family life. Furthermore, officers reported that aspects of their well-being are neglected. Various coping mechanisms were utilised by correctional officers, which seems to act as a buffer against the negative effects of their stressful work and work environment. A variety of barriers that prevent officers from using the Employee Assistance Programme (EAP) service at work were identified. Despite the barriers, correctional officers recognised the overall positive value of the EAP service in the Department of Correctional Services (DCS). They also appear to find meaning in their work. Some correctional officers derive great satisfaction from their job while others experience a sense of reward as a result of the role that they play in the rehabilitation of inmates.",The author thanks the South African Department of Correctional Services (DCS) for providing permission to conduct the research at two of their correctional facilities in Worcester.,"Funding The author(s) received no financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.",South African Journal of Psychology,,,,2020-12-22,2020,2020-12-22,2021-12,51,4,547-559,Closed,Article,"Willemse, Rachel","Willemse, Rachel (UNISA, South Africa)","Willemse, Rachel (University of South Africa)","Willemse, Rachel (University of South Africa)",10,3,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1133887804,52 Psychology,3 Good Health and Well Being

This is, to a great extent, also the case in the South African higher education arena. This article reports on a study that aimed to undertake research that would direct the development of a framework for improving internal communication at South African multi-campus universities. The framework would not only boast of features which are regarded as good practice by companies in the corporate sector, but also features based on the recommendations and suggestions of communication executives from seven multi-campus universities in South Africa. A mixed methods research design was employed. The research indicates that communication should be established as a core business value, and be advocated on all levels. The findings also suggest that management should be evaluated on their communication skills; regular monitoring of the effectiveness of communication at main and distance campuses should take place; whilst communication channels for feedback should be established. The internal communication framework outlined in the article may aid multi-campus universities to attain higher levels of excellence, which will subsequently result in greater business impact and more funding opportunities.",,,Communicatio,,,,2020-07-02,2020,2020-10-29,2020-07-02,46,3,106-126,Closed,Article,"Delport, Mardi","Delport, Mardi (Central University of Technology, South Africa)","Delport, Mardi (Central University of Technology)","Delport, Mardi (Central University of Technology)",1,0,,0.56,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1132154146,"47 Language, Communication and Culture; 4701 Communication and Media Studies",4 Quality Education

This crop is affected by several pests and diseases, which cause considerable economic losses and reduce yield. In recent years, several studies have demonstrated the role of proteins and peptides with activity against a wide range of insects and pathogens. The objective of this work was to identify defense proteins, such as antimicrobial peptides, protease and amylases inhibitors in common bean genotypes and evaluate the relationship of these proteins with Phaseolus vulgaris seed resistance to Callosobruchus maculatus infestation. Nineteen common bean genotypes were subjected to protein extraction, pH 5.4, and precipitation with ammonium sulfate at 70% saturation. The obtained extracts were separated by tricine gel electrophoresis. Experiments were carried out with natural seeds of common beans and artificial seeds (Vigna unguiculata seeds covered with seed coats of common beans) to evaluate the rate of oviposition and development of the insect species Callosobruchus maculatus. Lipid-transfer proteins were identified in nine genotypes whereas defensins were present in all genotypes. The inhibitory activity of α-amylases and trypsin and fungal development were determined in crude extracts (50 μg mL−1). The results also indicated that the extracts from all bean genotypes inhibited the activity of human salivary α-amylase and C. maculatus larval α-amylase. Except for the extracts of four genotypes, all other extracts inhibited trypsin activity. None of the extracts from the evaluated bean genotypes inhibited the growth of tested fungi. Natural seeds from all genotypes did not inhibit insect oviposition, however, the larvae did not survive after feeding on these seeds. Artificial seeds containing seed coat flour of all genotypes inhibited the oviposition of C. maculatus, indicating that the seed coat was also repellent to insect.",This study was financed in part by the Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior - Brasil (CAPES) - Finance Code 001.

Pre-treatments were performed by immersion of pumpkin cylinders. Convective drying was performed at 40 °C and air velocity 1 m/s. Different aspects were evaluated: drying kinetics, structural changes (microstructure and macrostructure), thermal profile and viscoelastic and rehydration behaviours. The microstructure was modified by pre-treatments, being more pronounced with AC and AA. Thinner cell walls, changes on turgor and extraction of components and air were reported, affecting the mass transfer. Moreover, the microstructural changes reinforced anisotropy and also affected the macrostructure, changing the viscoelastic behaviour. All pre-treatments resulted in a super-diffusive behaviour, decreasing the drying time from 9% (ISO) to 22% (AC). Possible relations were discussed among the compounds’ physical properties, sample temperature profile, drying kinetics and equilibrium moisture. Rehydration was improved by ET and ISO, but impaired by AA. Although AC accelerates drying, it did not affect the rehydration. The viscoelasticity reflected the structure and composition, with the pre-treatments with higher structure modifications (AA and AC) losing elastic properties. In conclusion, the pre-treatments with isopropanol and ethanol showed better results, improving drying and rehydration, and are thus recommended.","The authors are grateful to the São Paulo Research Foundation (FAPESP, Brazil) for funding project n° 2019/05043-6, the GR Carvalho post-doctoral fellowship (2018/17844-0) and the I Silveira BSc scholarship (2019/19307-5); to the National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq, Brazil) for the productivity grant of PED Augusto (306557/2017-7); and to the Fondo Nacional de Desarrollo Científico, Tecnológico y de Innovación Tecnológica (FONDECYT, Peru) from the “Consejo Nacional de Ciencia, Tecnología e Innovación Tecnológica” (CONCYTEC, Peru) for funding project n° 409-2019-FONDECYT.",,Food and Bioprocess Technology,,,,2020-10-13,2020,2020-10-13,2020-11,13,11,1984-1996,Closed,Article,"Carvalho, Gisandro Reis; Rojas, Meliza Lindsay; Silveira, Isabela; Augusto, Pedro Esteves Duarte","Carvalho, Gisandro Reis (Department of Agri-food Industry, Food and Nutrition (LAN), Luiz de Queiroz College of Agriculture (ESALQ), University of São Paulo (USP), Av.

239,pub.1132784634,10.1515/soci-2020-0011,,,The role of Language Planning Agencies in higher education in South Africa - comparing two cases,"Abstract The question about the role of Language Planning Agencies (LPAs) in higher education is very relevant within the South African context. A range of policy provisions regarding language in higher education are characterised by the use of language policy and planning (LPP) jargon found in the Framework for Language Planning Goals, pointing to the need for a range of LPAs to be involved in this language domain. Since such involvement has been documented in the case of the institutionalisation of Afrikaans as alternative language of higher education during the period 1910-1961, it provides the basis for a comparison with post-1994 initiatives regarding the elevation of the Sintu languages and the extension of their use in this language domain. Such comparison is undertaken on the basis of a Typology of LPAs that is developed from earlier insights that evolved during the International Research Project on Language Planning Processes at the University of Hawaii in the 1970s, essentially distinguishing between LPAs involved in regulatory, productive and promotional language planning functions. Evidence on the work of LPAs involved during the two periods is collected from secondary sources documenting the cases and analysed in terms of this typology. The results of the study provide insights into the role of LPAs in each case and in their relative effectiveness in aiding the institutionalisation of the designated languages. The article concludes by suggesting the “ideal” LPA mix for the realisation of LPP goals in higher education in South Africa.",,,Sociolinguistica - International Yearbook of European Sociolinguistics / Internationales Jahrbuch für europäische Soziolinguistik,,,,2020-11-01,2020,2020-11-19,2020-11-01,34,1,173-193,Closed,Article,"du Plessis, Theodorus","du Plessis, Theodorus (Department of South African Sign Language and Deaf Studies, University of the Free State, 205 Nelson Mandela Drive, 9300, Bloemfontein, Republic of South Africa)","du Plessis, Theodorus (University of the Free State)","du Plessis, Theodorus (University of the Free State)",1,0,,1.02,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1132784634,"47 Language, Communication and Culture; 4704 Linguistics",4 Quality Education

In this ecological context, positive interactions between plants could increase in relevance since they can increase growth and survival in stressful conditions. In this area, natural populations also suffer herbivore damage, mainly by cattle and other introduced species. The orchid family is represented in Chile by terrestrial species only that grow in natural and disturbed sites where native shrubs are common. These species have been poorly studied in terms of their ecology, and some species are currently severely threatened. In this study, we tested if native shrubs can facilitate Chilean orchids, reducing abiotic stress and herbivory. We evaluated this positive interaction in three sites with different orchid and shrub species. We found that in all sites, there are more orchid individuals growing inside the canopy of shrubs compared to open areas. Additionally, abiotic conditions were milder and herbivory was reduced inside shrubs in all sites. Our results suggest that there is a positive interaction between native shrubs and native orchids that could result in increased survival in orchid individuals growing inside the canopy of such shrubs. This result could be essential for future conservation and restoration initiatives that should take into account the need for shrubs before re-introduction of individuals in the field, especially for endangered orchid species present in Central Chile.","This study was funded by Proyecto DI-Regular 039.333/2016 (VRIEA, Pontificia Universidad Católica de Valparaíso).

238,pub.1130095132,10.1002/aqc.3438,,,Weak connectivity and population cohesiveness in rudderfish Kyphosus sandwicensis (Teleostei: Kyphosidae) inhabiting remote oceanic islands,"Abstract    Population connectivity has a fundamental role in metapopulation dynamics, with important implications in conservation. Easter Island (EI) and Salas y Gómez Island (SG) in the Pacific Ocean are ideal for the study of population connectivity because they are separated by 415 km and isolated from other islands in the Pacific Ocean by >2,000 km.    Considering that dispersal processes could play a critical role in the persistence of its populations, the connectivity pattern of the rudderfish Kyphosus sandwicensis was evaluated between EI and SG using both a population genetics and a biophysical modelling approach.     The variability in the control region of the mitochondrial DNA did not show a significant phylogeographical pattern, and the variability in 16 microsatellite loci suggested that individuals of K. sandwicensis located at EI and SG belong to the same genetic population. However, historical migration showed that 0.2% of the recruits at EI come from SG and that 0.15% at SG come from EI per year.    Using simulated larval release during September and a larval development of 30 days in the plankton, biophysical modelling did not detect migration between the islands. Furthermore, self‐recruitment shows interannual variation ranging from 5 to 10% of the total released larvae.    Whereas the genetic data showed a lack of population genetic structure but low connectivity of K. sandwicensis between EI and SG, the biophysical modelling showed null movement of particles between the islands. Stochastic movement of larvae or adults could explain the pattern observed, with rafting as an example. These low‐frequency and stochastic movements may be important in maintaining the cohesiveness between EI and SG.","ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS We acknowledge the financial support of the Chilean Millennium Initiative grant ESMOI.

The lipophilicity and hydrolysis rate kinetics were assessed and compared to the previously reported [Ru(η6-4-(1-propenyl)anisole)(en)(halogen)]PF6 derivatives (4-(1-propenyl)anisole or anethole), where the halogen is Cl (1) or I (2). Based on the obtained rate constants, the coordination of (1-propenyl)anisole to the Ru(en) moiety yielded organometallic compounds that are as active as compounds that bind p-cymene as the arene ligand. Consistent with previously reported kinetic data, our density functional theory-based computational study revealed that an associative interchange mechanism predominates in the hydrolysis of this type of compound, and only small variations (∼1 kcal mol−1) were observed between the stabilities of the transition states corresponding to different derivatives. In vitro analyses of the anti-proliferative activity revealed that compounds 1 to 3 generally exhibit better cytotoxicity and selectivity (tumor versus non tumor cells) toward the gastric tumor cell lines AGS and SNU-1, compared to the parent [Ru(η6-p-cymene)(en)X]PF6 (X: Cl and I) systems. Compound 3 showed similar cytotoxicity to compound 1 toward the AGS cell line, indicating that the change in the substitution pattern of the coordinated arene from 4-(1-propenyl)anisole to 2-(1-propenyl)anisole did not prominently affect the biological behavior. Compound 2 remained the most promising candidate to treat gastric cancer.",The authors are thankful to the Universidad Técnica Federico Santa María (DGIIP 116.13.1) and CORFO (14IDL2-30087) for providing the financial support.

In order to optimize culture, responses to density and potential environmental rearing conditions must be examined. Stocking density (SD) is an important factor for cultivation-related economic viability, because inappropriate SD is frequently associated with an increase of size heterogeneity, modification of social interactions and reduction of flesh quality. In addition, drastic decreases in dissolved oxygen are one of the major recurrent environmental stress factors in the area of choice for C. gilberti farming in the north of Chile, thus studies on responses to hypoxia and their associations with SD are required. Therefore, in this study, C. gilberti juveniles prior to stocking into grow-out pens were maintained for 120 days at three different stocking densities: 15 kg/m3 (LSD), 25 kg/m3 (MSD) and 35 kg/m3 (HSD), and then exposed to an acute hypoxia event. Biometric parameters, flesh quality, blood and liver biochemical parameters, and molecular markers of growth performance and stress responses were analyzed. Surprisingly, the highest body weight gain occurred in fish held at the highest density. In terms of growth-related genes, levels of growth hormone mRNA were not different between stocking densities, but liver insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) mRNA levels increased with SD and were the highest in the HSD group. There were no differences in flesh proximate composition. Similarly, glucose, lactate and HSP70 levels measured to assess chronic stress were not different among densities. There was a notable increase in lactate levels of fish in the HSD group in response to acute hypoxia, which suggests a greater reliance on anaerobic glycolysis by this group. In conclusion, results suggest that C. gilberti juveniles tolerate high stocking densities (at least 35 kg/m3) without generating chronic stress or decreasing their capacity to respond to acute hypoxia; and high SD would be preferable due to better growth. Although present results are promising, further research is needed to continue with the standardization of the SD that will allow the best productive yield of this new fish species for Chilean aquaculture.",We gratefully acknowledge Dr. Peter Allen for english revision of the manuscript.,"This work was supported by a grant from ANID-Chile, FONDECYT 11180042 to C.A., and Programa Integrado para el Desarrollo Sustentable del Cultivo de Corvina (Cilus Gilberti) (CORFO-INNOVA 09PDAC-6912) to Fundación Chile.

238,pub.1124049171,10.1002/jctb.6349,,,Use of fish scales as an adsorbent of organic matter present in the treatment of landfill leachate,"Abstract  This study focuses on the removal of organic pollutants present in landfill leachate (LL) using an adsorption process with activated carbon (AC) obtained from fish scales, and subsequently evaluates the reduction of toxicity in the wastewater obtained from the process. The AC obtained is a mesoporous material, with a cumulative pore area of 1.57 m 2 g −1 , Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) of 1.8329 m 2 g −1 and adsorption average pore width of 12.79833 nm. The maximum removal of pollutants was achieved at natural pH (6.71) of the LL, with a load of 3 g L −1 , resulting in 60.1% colour and 37.3% chemical oxygen demand (COD). The rate of COD removal per g of AC increase had a maximum value of 5.6 at pH 10 when passing from 0.5 to 1 g AC. The lowest rate of 0.6 occurred for the same pH when it passed from 1 to 2 g AC. At pH 3 the second lowest rate of 3.3 was observed when passing from 2 to 3 g AC. At pH 3 there was always an increase in the rate as more AC was added. Conversely, at natural pH 6.71 the rate tended to decrease. At pH 10 the rate first decreased and then increased. At acidic pH, because it is the one with the lowest COD removal, it would be expected that by adding more AC the rate would continue to increase as there are easily accessible sites still available. Langmuir isotherms fitted adequately with the experimental data, providing an R 2 of 0.9657, which is consistent with a monolayer adsorption pattern. The LL before the adsorption process had an inhibition ratio of 20.4%, due to the fact that leachate can be toxic because of the presence of hazardous organic compounds. After adsorption processes at pH 6.71, the inhibition ratios were 16.9%, 13.8%, 12.2% and 10.9% at AC loads of 0.5, 1, 2 and 3 g L −1 , respectively, due to decreasing COD and colour of the LL over the course of the treatment. It was observed that the reduction of the inhibition ratio was greater at higher loads of adsorbent. © 2020 Society of Chemical Industry",The authors would like to thank to the FONDEQUIP project (grant no. 150109) and the Central Laboratory for Marine Aquaculture of the Marine Sciences Department of the Universidad Católica del Norte for providing invaluable equipment support.,,Journal of Chemical Technology & Biotechnology,,,,2020-02-12,2020,2020-02-12,2020-05,95,5,1550-1558,Closed,Article,"Poblete, Rodrigo; Cortes, Ernesto; Bakit, José; Luna‐Galiano, Yolanda","Poblete, Rodrigo (Universidad Católica del Norte, Facultad de Ciencias del Mar.

Duodenal GISTs are relatively uncommon. The prevalence of duodenal GIST is very low, accounting for 5% to 7% or less of all surgically resected GISTs. Most published reports on duodenal GIST are case reports or small case series. Consequently, the unspecific clinical manifestations, radiologic diagnosis, appropriate surgical treatment, prognostic factors, and survival constitute a subject of current controversy. This review addresses the management of duodenal GISTs trying to establish and define surgical options according to GIST localization within the duodenum. Most articles concerning duodenal GISTs state that unlike tumors involving other sites of the gastrointestinal tract, the optimal procedure for duodenal GISTs has not been well characterized in the surgical literature. However, when carefully reviewing the published literature on the subject, it was possible to identify common surgical approaches to duodenal GISTs which are fairly standard among different authors. All approaches take into account the GIST localization within the duodenal wall and its anatomic relationships to decide whether local resection or the Whipple operation should be performed. Using this knowledge, defined surgical options for duodenal GISTs according to their localization within the duodenum are being proposed. Besides the current controversy regarding the indications for the Whipple procedure, the other most important issue remaining to be addressed is the implementation of laparoscopic surgery for this challenging tumor.",,,Indian Journal of Surgery,,,,2020-05-02,2020,2020-05-02,2020-12,82,6,1193-1205,Closed,Article,"Beltrán, Marcelo A.","Beltrán, Marcelo A.

237,pub.1125498625,10.1016/j.enggeo.2020.105585,,,A probabilistic seismic hazard assessment of southern Peru and Northern Chile,"Southern Peru and northern Chile (17–30°S, 67–74°W) make up a seismically active region due to the convergence of the Nazca Plate and the South American Plate. The region has experienced a number of destructive earthquakes and tsunamis over the past few centuries, which have caused loss of human life and significant damage to infrastructure, highlighting the importance of seismic hazard assessment in the region. In fact, a reliable seismic hazard assessment is critical for developing policies for seismic hazard mitigation and risk reduction. In this study, we performed a probabilistic seismic hazard assessment (PSHA) of the study area based on an earthquake catalog that was very carefully analyzed. In earlier studies, we demonstrated that inappropriate treatment of the earthquake catalog can result in a serious bias in evaluations of seismicity parameters (e.g., a bias of up to 42% in the “b” parameter of the Gutenberg–Richter law). To address this issue, we compiled a homogenous earthquake catalog consisting of 39,977 events during the 1513–2016 period and accounted for site-specific local effects by developing site-specific scaling relationships between different measures of magnitude (e.g., mb, Ms, MD) and moment magnitude (Mw). The study area was subdivided into 15 seismogenic zones, accounting for site-specific seismicity patterns. The parameters “a” and “b” of the Gutenberg–Richter law were estimated for each zone based on independent earthquake events. The PSHA was performed using a standard logic tree approach, which allowed us to systematically take into account the model-based uncertainty and its influence on the estimated ground motion parameters. Uniform hazard spectra for return periods of 475 and 2475 years were estimated for peak ground accelerations and spectral accelerations at 0.2 s and 1.0 s to meet the definitions of seismic hazards provided by the International Building Code (IBC, International Code Council [ICC], 2009).

The development, presentation and upkeep of such school support services by public libraries are practically necessary to fulfill such collaboration. It is thought that web pages for school support services are essential to public library websites, not only in Japan but also in the U.S.A., in order to inform people, who are especially involved in education, about the existence of school support services and how to utilize them for school support. Also, it is essential for public libraries to provide users with web pages for school support services, children’s web pages, YA web pages, and web pages for promotion of reading on their own websites, in order to improve school education and social education in local community. Furthermore, a contents model of web pages for school support services is proposed through the results of our recent investigation into the contents of web pages for school support services. This contents model is composed of five kinds of material: (I) information on school support services, (II) information on resource sharing, (III) information on cooperative library programs, (IV) information resources on teaching support and the study of teaching materials for school teachers and staff of schools, (V) information resources on provisions for reading and improvements in student information literacy.","The author offers special thanks to Dr. Glen E.

Before the experiment, the seaweeds had been acclimated for more than 1 year in outdoor tanks with flowing seawater. At the beginning of the experiment, maximum quantum yield (Fv/Fm) did not vary among different populations. During the recovery period, Fv/Fm increase was higher in thalli from La Pampilla (30°S) in comparison with other populations (33°S and 42°S). The lowest total amount of bacteria (22.2 ± 2.5 × 103 cell mm–2) on thalli was observed at the beginning of the experiment. At the end of the experiment, the density of bacteria was not significantly different among thalli from different populations, as well as among UV-exposed and non-exposed seaweeds. The bacterial community in seawater was different from that on the seaweed thalli as shown by MiSeq Illumina reads of 16S rRNA. UV exposure changed the composition of microbial communities on the thalli and led to a reduction in community diversity and evenness. Relative abundance of Alteromonas sp. increased but abundances of Methylophaga sp. and Colwellia sp. decreased during UV exposure. Microbes associated with G. lingulatum may play an important ecological role in seaweed-microbial interactions. Future studies should explore the ecological function of microbial communities associated with seaweeds.","We are grateful to David Yañez for his collaboration in laboratory activities and access to the facilities of the Botany Lab.

Although there is evidence that the emplacement of such deposits took place during specific Tertiary climatic periods and relief formation, many uncertainties remain regarding the exact timing for their deposition and/or the genetic link between the exotic deposits and the primary porphyry copper deposits. We present a first attempt of U-Pb dating of copper-rich minerals from the Mina Sur exotic deposit from the Chuquicamata mining district. A suite of Mn-rich black chrysocolla clasts surrounded by pseudomalachite bands has been characterized and dated in petrographic context using both nanosecond and femtosecond in situ laser ablation ICP-MS analyses. U-Pb dating on pseudomalachite bands yields a crystallization age of 18.4 ± 1.0 Ma. For the Mn-rich chrysocolla clasts, the 206Pb/238U apparent ages range from 19.7 ± 5.0 Ma to 6.1 ± 0.3 Ma, a spread interpreted as the result of U and/or Pb mobility linked to fluid circulation following crystallization. This study demonstrates that supergene copper mineralization can be directly dated by the U-Th-Pb method on pseudomalachite. Furthermore, the age obtained on pseudomalachite indicates that Mina Sur copper deposition took place at ca. 19 Ma, about 11 m.y. after the unroofing and hydrothermal alteration of the Chuquicamata deposit, a result that is consistent with the supergene ages already known in the Atacama Desert.","We thank CODELCO Chile and all the geologists for providing access to the Mina Sur open-pit and for their assistance during the sampling campaign achieved by Eduardo Campos.

However, little is known about the depositional characteristics, the conditions that allow their preservation, and how to identify recurrences facilitating their discovery. This work presents contextual and stratigraphic data, coupled with radiocarbon dates on bone material from surface findings and excavations conducted in Los Vilos (Coquimbo, Chile), which show that this area was rich in Pleistocene terrestrial mammals and that alluvial sequences and dunes have allowed bone preservation and exposure. These results have implications for the search for new evidence and for the interpretation of their historical trajectories. Radiometric age distribution indicates mainly terminal-Pleistocene specimens with the potential of some taxa persisting into the Holocene. These results are used to discuss coexistence and interaction scenarios between extinct faunas and the early record of human beings in the region.","We owe the design of this research and contributions in several stages to the late Donald Jackson.

This paper involves the study of the case of Ruta N in Medellín to expose the relationship between a consolidated neighbourhood and new innovation facilities. Ruta N was founded after the implementation of a city-level policy for innovation intended to secure the economic growth of a former deprived area of the city. This innovation attracted local and international creative entrepreneurs to Medellín’s downtown but with inconsistent results. The analysis revealed that Ruta N rarely interacts with the nearby neighbourhood, thus restricting its potential to contribute to the community. Instead, it is perceived that Ruta N takes advantage of the neighbourhood to meet the needs of Ruta N users, not the other way around.

Outcrops in the Precordillera of northern Chile record a long and complex history of magmatism and overprinting deformational events. The growth of the Precordillera is predominantly associated with the Late Eocene-Early Oligocene transpressive Domeyko fault system (Incaic Phase), however, a series of compressive late Cretaceous folds and faults have also been recognized. In this study, we combined structural mapping, stereographic fold analysis, and geochronologic data of both deformed rocks and post-tectonic hypabyssal bodies to reveal the distribution and kinematics of the late Cretaceous thrust system exposed in the Precordillera between 24°30′S and 25°30′S. We identified an approximately NS-striking belt of reverse faults and folds along the Precordillera, which was cut and displaced by the Late Eocene-Early Oligocene Domeyko fault system. This deformation corresponds to thick-skinned structures affecting Paleozoic basement and thin-skinned structures which include folding with a general sub-horizontal NNW-SSE shortening direction with westward and eastward vergence. The ages of post-tectonic hypabyssal bodies cutting the deformed rocks indicate that the timing of the contractional structures occurred before 86 Ma taking place in the westernmost margin of Precordillera and continued between 72 Ma and 65 Ma. Our results agree with the timing proposed for regional Peruvian and ‘K-T’ deformations. We also used the distribution of the syn-kinematic late Cretaceous volcanic rocks to identify late Cretaceous contraction that evolved into a back-arc fold-and-thrust belt. Its structures are currently distributed along the northern Precordillera and were obliterated by younger strike-slip Incaic deformation. Moreover, this deformation must have forced the topography upward, creating an early late Cretaceous topographic relief related to the tectonic activity along these structures. These results indicate that late Cretaceous deformation had a role in the early history of the proto-Precordillera of northern Chile, prior to development of the strike-slip Domeyko fault system in the Paleogene.","Part of this study was conducted under the M311 Carta Sierra de Varas, 1:100,000 project, which was developed by the Department of Geological Science of the Universidad Católica del Norte and the Chilean National Survey of Geology and Mining (SERNAGEOMIN).

Advances in molecular phylogenetics have contributed to avoid this bias, clarifying the identity of the species, improving our knowledge of species diversity and distribution. With the aim to identify biogeographic biases, we compiled and compared range distribution data of polyplacophorans along the South-eastern Pacific (SEP) coast (0°–56° S) generated from: (i) literature review (LIT dataset) and (ii) Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs dataset), based on the analysis of 8949 individuals obtained from field sampling and biological collections. Cytochrome oxidase I (COI) and 16S rRNA of 104 specimens were used for genetic identification of conflictive morphospecies. Multivariate analysis (nMDS, PERMANOVA) were applied to test differences between datasets (LIT, OTUs) and also between biogeographic ecoregions. Just like prior studies based on literature reviews, the richness of LIT species showed an increase with latitude. Contrastingly, OTUs’ richness peaked at intermediate latitudes showing a bell-shaped distribution, indicating that the LIT dataset was flawed by inaccuracies in the identification and location of polyplacophoran species on the South-eastern Pacific, causing an overestimation of their geographic ranges. Our results contrast with the previous richness patterns described for the SEP polyplacophorans, where species richness was reported to increase with latitude. Both an overestimation of geographic ranges and inaccuracies in the identification of species cause these differences. Biogeographical studies should be conducted on the basis of a comprehensive review of specimens with verifiable occurrences, and incorporate as far as possible genetic analysis to define the identity of conflicting morphospecies, in order to improve the estimation of species richness and the understanding of marine biodiversity.","We are grateful to C.

The molecular structure was evaluated using two chromatographic analyses: high-performance size-exclusion chromatography (HPSEC) coupled to multiangle laser light scattering (MALLS) and differential refractive index (RI) detectors, and gel permeation chromatography (GPC). Both proved the molecular depolymerization caused by ozonation, as well as illustrated the different behavior of each starch source – in special in relation to their molar mass dispersity. The granular morphology was not affected by ozone processing. On the other hand, the starch properties were affected by ozonation. In general, the apparent viscosity decreased during pasting, as well as the complex modulus (G*) of the immediately formed gels. After cooling and storage, however, the gels' strength increased or decreased due to ozonation, depending on the starch concentration. In general, results for cassava and potato starches were similar, while corn starch presented an opposite behavior. The results illustrated the relationship among ozonation conditions, starch source and analysis conditions, as well as their influence on the samples’ behavior and functional properties.","The authors are grateful to:the São Paulo Research Foundation (FAPESP, Brazil) for funding the projects n° 2016/18052-5 and 2019/05043-6; the National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq, Brazil) for funding the project n° 401004/2014-7 and the productivity grant of P.E.D.

Thin surface crusts, powdery surface material and subsurface concretions from up to 40 cm depth were sampled along several latitudinal transects between 19.5–25°S and 68.5–70.5°W. The samples were characterized by total soil chemical analysis (ICP-OES and spectrophotometric analysis) complemented by XRD and thermogravimetric analysis to determine contents of chloride, nitrate, and major elements along with gypsum and anhydrite abundance in Atacama Desert soils. Our results demonstrate that the spatial distribution of gypsum, anhydrite, halite, and nitrates in Atacama Desert soils is indeed linked to aridity gradients, but also sources, and secondary dissolution processes. Nitrates and chlorides are best preserved between 19 and 22°S, which thus may constitute the long-term hyperarid core of the Atacama Desert. Remobilization within the soil is ubiquitous south of 22°S, but generally also occurs on the debris fans prograding from the Precordillera into the Central Depression. A near-constant concentration ratio of Na/Cl = 0.83 – very similar to the sea water ratio – throughout the desert and concentration maxima within the reaches of coastal fog penetration below the altitude of 1200 m reveals that sea spray is the primary source of halite in Atacama Desert soils. Calcium sulfates dominate Atacama Desert soils. Deposition is primarily as gypsum, but anhydrite is abundant in the northern Central Depression between 19 and 22°S. The apparent association of anhydrite with high concentrations of nitrate and chloride may point to a formation by dissolution and secondary reprecipitation from salt-concentrated fluids. The predominance of anhydrite in the Central Depression suggest geomorphology and water availability as additional factors remaining to be determined.",We thank Harald Euler and Hans Henning Friedrich for the performance of XRD analyses at the University of Bonn and their assistance during evaluation of XRD data.

The material content is driven by an imperfect fluid distribution and the inner geometry is described by the Tolman–Kuchowicz space–time. The validity of the obtained model is checked by studying the main salient features such as energy–density, radial and tangential pressures and anisotropy factor. Since Einstein gravity theory shares the same vacuum solution with Rastall gravity theory, the interior geometry is joining in a smoothly way with the exterior Schwarzschild’s solution. The equilibrium of the model under different gradients is analyzed by using the modified hydrostatic equilibrium equation, containing the so–called Rastall gradient. The compact structure has a positive anisotropy factor which enhances the balance and stability mechanisms. To check the potentially stable behavior, we employ Abreu’s and adiabatic index criterion. It was found that the model is completely stable. The incidence of the Rastall’s parameter γ$$\gamma $$ on all the physical quantities that characterize the model is described by the help of graphical analysis.

213,pub.1132574636,10.1002/aqc.3466,,,Engaging recreational scuba divers in marine citizen science: Differences according to popularity of the diving area,"Abstract    Characterizing the composition of divers visiting different diving areas could help to design marine citizen science (MCS) projects that support biodiversity monitoring and marine conservation.   Recreational scuba divers mostly prefer warm and clear waters with coral reefs, and based on the Duffus and Dearden’s wildlife tourism framework we hypothesized that a more popular diving area is visited mostly by generalist divers, whereas in a less popular diving area a higher proportion of specialist divers would be found.   Recreational scuba divers were surveyed in diving centres at two diving areas, Rapa Nui (more popular, with warm and clear coral‐reef waters) and the Chilean mainland (less popular, with productive and temperate–cold waters), to determine their diving profile, visiting profile, marine species knowledge, and interest and participation in MCS.   Support for our hypothesis (generalist divers on Rapa Nui and specialist divers on the mainland) was weak, but recreational divers on Rapa Nui were mostly foreign visitors who come for single visits, whereas divers from the mainland were predominantly Chileans who return repeatedly to the diving area. In both diving areas the divers expressed a strong interest to be trained and to participate in MCS, but divers from Rapa Nui were interested in brief pre‐dive inductions, whereas divers from the Chilean mainland preferred intensive training courses.   Based on these findings we recommend specific MCS strategies for divers in both types of areas, e.g. simple protocols in more popular diving areas, with short pre‐dive briefings for divers, and medium or long‐term programmes in areas where most divers are local with high return rates. In these latter conditions more extensive training will be useful, which allows divers to gain more experience and assume higher responsibilities within an MCS project.","We wish to thank the diving clubs who helped us to promote the survey and to all divers who participated in this study.

					with low rate for symptoms; (4) Overall high gesture rate with high rate for symptoms. The patients with overall low gesture rate
					tend to perform deictic gestures, pointing to exact locations of the symptoms; those with overall high gesture rate and low
					symptom rate produce metaphorics, and those who gesticulate at high rates – mainly iconics and metaphorics. Although exact factors

Bulk leaching results showed that in the case of Fe leaching, both [Fe3+] and [H2SO4] promoted the extent of Fe extraction whereas the extent of Zn and Pb extraction was dependent only on [H2SO4]. Based on the bulk extraction of Al and Mg, it appears that [H2SO4] drives the expansion of inner particle pores by promoting the dissolution of gangue minerals. The findings indicated that the generation of cracks and/or pores to enhance solution contact with the value minerals remains the critical factor in improving value metal recovery from this type of material during heap leaching. Comparative laboratory and synchrotron X-CT studies were also undertaken on single ore particles using a novel in–situ leach cup technique. Similar to the solution results, the acid concentration was shown to be critical in creating effective porosity and pore networks through the centre of the particles for the transport of solution to value minerals and subsequent leaching and transport to the bulk solution. This occurred primarily through the dissolution of auxiliary aluminosilicate gangue minerals, which in turn created networks of porosity for effective bulk solution transport into large particles during heap leaching. This, in turn, enables local solution micro-environments where leaching occurs at the solid-liquid interface. Following the accessibility of bulk solution into the particle, the reaction is then governed by surface-mineral reactions between the sulfidic minerals.","The authors wish to acknowledge support for this work by the National Research Foundation (NRF) of South Africa through the SARChI Chair in Minerals Beneficiation, as well as assistance from the Centre for Imaging and Analysis at UCT.

According to the International Union for Conservation of Nature, the porbeagle is assessed globally as Vulnerable and regionally as Critically Endangered in the North Atlantic and the Mediterranean Sea. This study explored, for the first time, the population genetics of  L. nasus  at a regional (south‐east Pacific Ocean) and global scale.     In this study, the null hypotheses of no genetic discontinuities among populations (i) within the SH, and (ii) between the SH and Northern Hemisphere (NH) were tested. Also, the demographic history of  L. nasus  in different ocean basins was assessed. Two mitochondrial markers (Control Region [CR] and cox1 ) well suited for population genetics inferences in sharks were used.     Spatial–genetic analyses suggested two genetic clusters co‐occurring in the south‐eastern Pacific Ocean. A two‐way ANOVA using the cox1 but not the CR mtDNA fragment detected an effect of genetic identity on shark body size. Phylogeographic analyses, haplotype networks, and analyses of molecular variance demonstrated genetic differences between populations from the NH and SH but not among populations in the SH.    Migration estimates indicated limited current maternal gene flow between the two hemispheres but high gene flow within hemispheres. Two well‐defined haplotype groups with star‐like shapes inhabited all ocean basins in the SH. These results could reflect a historical scenario of reproductive isolation and more recent mixture among previously isolated populations in the SH. A Bayesian skyline plot analysis indicated sudden population expansion in the SH occurring ~100–125 kya.    This study highlights the need for additional studies focusing on the population genomics (using nuclear markers, i.e. single nucleotide polymorphisms) and the general biology of  L. nasus  to explore the existence of genetically dissimilar populations in the SH. Such studies will help implementing efficient genetic monitoring programmes.","ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS MTG thanks project ANT 1856 from University of Antofagasta, Chile for funding a short visit to the laboratory of Dr. J.

However, some of these input variables may present uncertainty, which may drive the designed process to unwanted responses and, consequently, generating large economic damages. This manuscript proposes a methodology for avoiding the scenario earlier described. The methodology considers three steps: (1) deterministic process design, (2) elimination of non-influential input variables using global sensitivity analysis, and (3) classification of the influential input variables using least squares support vector machines (LS-SVM) classifier, whose parameters are tuned through particle swarm optimization (PSO). The proposed methodology was applied in the design of mineral concentration circuits. The results show that the elimination of non-influential input variables from training data helps to improve the accuracy and to prevent the overfitting of LS-SVM classifier. The methodology allows classifying input variables and knowing what combinations will drive the designed process to unwanted conditions.

Pre-treatments were performed by immersion of apple slices in ethanol (0–30 min). Pre-treated samples were convectively dried (50 °C, 1 m s−1), without/with ultrasound (21.77 kHz, 20.5 kW/m3). As results, if both technologies were considered, conventional drying time reduction reached 70 ± 2%. From drying kinetics modelling, it was identified that ethanol pre-treatments mainly reduced the external resistance to mass transfer, while ultrasound had a greater influence on the internal one. In dried samples, as the ethanol pre-treatment time increased, the shrinkage decreased, and their rehydration capacity was greater. After rehydration, samples showed a decrease of >85% in viscoelastic characteristics. The antioxidant capacity and total phenolic content were better retained with ultrasound application. The obtained results corroborate that the proposed technologies are complementary significantly accelerating the drying without negative effects on physical properties.","This work was supported by the São Paulo Research Foundation (FAPESP, Brazil) [project number 2016/18052-5]; the National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq, Brazil) [P.E.D.

Bibliometric analysis is used to unveil the authors, journals, institutions, and the most influential countries on the subject from 2001 to date. The most pertinent studies are presented that show the main characteristics of the five generations that can currently be found in the workplace, namely the Silent Generation, Baby Boomers, Generation X, Generation Y and Generation Z. The results highlight that the studies focus on countries and regions with more developed economies. Studies are scarcer from countries and regions with emerging economies such as Latin America and the Caribbean, Africa, Eastern Europe and the Middle East. Likewise, there is evidence of the lack of qualitative studies on Generation Z, which will be of greater importance in the labour force or employment market and with higher purchasing power. The results add knowledge to academics to define their research strategies.

This paper uses the case of Chile, since in the last two decades the LDC has increased its importance as a strategy of labor mobility for workers in this country. We demonstrate, both theoretically and empirically, that LDC generates wage differences in the labor markets that receive commuters, as a function of the market equilibrium of these workers’ place of origin. These differences are not only related to labor productivity and/or employment, but also to the wage expectations of commuters in their place of origin.",The authors acknowledge the financial support from Chilean Fondecyt grant 1191162 ‘Do mining tax windfalls crowd-out other local revenues?

The eastern Domeyko Cordillera and the Salar de Atacama Basin on the inner Andean forearc, have been widely investigated, and several alternative tectonic models including extensional and/or contractional deformation are proposed to explain its evolution. Nevertheless, when trying to determine the role of Paleozoic and Mesozoic inherited-basement extensional structures during the Andean orogeny an evolutionary model is still not clear. Therefore, the aim of this research is to improve the understanding of these aspects. Based on the interpretation of a regional 2-D seismic grid and new structural data from outcrops, we propose that the main mechanisms of contractional deformation and uplift are related to: (1) the propagation of east-vergent basement-involved thrust faults, (2) the tectonic inversion of pre-existing normal faults and (3) the activation of shallow thin-skinned thrusts. Additionally, the resultant geometry of the structural styles is frequently controlled by three factors: (i) the initial geometry of inherited major faults, (ii) the rheology of the deformed rocks, and (iii) the rate of accumulation of the Upper Cretaceous-Cenozoic syn-tectonic deposits. Finally, we interpreted that the tectonic transition between the Domeyko Cordillera and the Salar de Atacama Basin is marked by the interaction between east-vergent thick-skinned thrusts and west-vergent inverted normal faults.","The authors thank Enap-Sipetrol for providing the seismic data used in the present study.

We used a structured questionnaire to collect data from a sample of 500 accounting students from both a distance and a contact learning institution in South Africa, out of which 379 returned a completed questionnaire, representing 76%. Findings show an apathy among South African university accounting students towards library services patronage, which is exacerbated by lecturers' practice of giving assignments that do not require students to search for information beyond what is in their recommended textbooks. The most significant factor that influences universities' accounting students' patronage of library resources is the expertise and interaction with library staff. This confirms the Expectation-Confirmation Theory that accounting students from both institutions examined based their level of satisfaction on their perception of the library services they received.

For this purpose, a qualitative study was carried out which consisted of eight focus groups in high schools, three of them in the metropolitan area of Lima (Lima region) and five in the province of Rodríguez de Mendoza (the Amazonas region). The focus groups were constituted by 73 students enrolled in the last three years of high school, named 3rd, 4th and 5th grade of secondary education, whose ages ranged from 14 to 18 years. The collected data were analyzed employing elements of Grounded Theory and Axiomatic Set Theory. The main findings reveal that most participants have a general understanding of traffic rules and the proper use of the components of traffic safety. Thus, they understand the traffic rules as road signs that regulate the behavior of drivers and pedestrians. In addition, participants know the proper procedure to follow at traffic lights, pedestrian walkways and how to use seat belts. They also identify the driver’s tiredness/drowsiness, and the consumption of alcohol and drugs as potential factors that cause traffic accidents. No causes that are linked to pedestrian behavior were identified, and only participants from the Amazonas region mentioned speeding as a contributing factor. On the other hand, participants report that in practical situations they engage in risky behavior and fail to comply with transit rules. They justify this behavior by citing poor infrastructure, vehicle malfunctions, and the need get around quickly in order to get things done. Finally, the implications of the results are discussed and compared to the content and implementation of the Peruvian Road Safety Educational Program (PENSV, for its acronym in Spanish), providing recommendations that can aid evidence‐based policy making in Peru.","This study was financed by the National Bureau of Investigation and Development of Universidad Privada del Norte (Lima, Perú), grant number 174003.",,Transportation Research Part F Traffic Psychology and Behaviour,,,,2020-01,2020,,2020-01,68,,33-51,Closed,Article,"Barboza-Palomino, Miguel; Salas, Gonzalo; Rojas-Portocarrero, Wendy K.; Caycho-Rodríguez, Tomás; Ventura-León, José; Reyes-Calle, Sebastián; Torres-Guffanti, Aylin; Rivas-Romero, Wendy","Barboza-Palomino, Miguel (Universidad Privada del Norte, Av.

We hypothesized that traces of life in the Atacama Desert follow distinct micro- and macro-scale gradients such as soil depth and elevation, respectively. Different depth intervals of surface soils (0–1, 1–5, and 5–10 cm) were sampled at five sites along an elevational transect near the Quebrada Aroma, spanning from the hyperarid core of the desert towards the arid Western Andean Precordillera (1300 to 2700 m a.s.l.), and from one additional site in the hyperarid core near Yungay. We determined the contents of major elements, pedogenic minerals and oxides, organic carbon (OC), and its δ13C and δ15N isotopic composition. The presence of living microorganisms was assessed by cultivation, and bacterial community composition was analyzed based on 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Additional information about past and present plant and microbial life was obtained from lipid biomarker analysis. We did not detect consistent micro-scale distributions for most of these proxies within the soils. However, concentrations of OC and of long-chain, plant wax-derived n-alkanes increased in soils along the aridity gradient towards the wetter sites, indicating the presence of past life at places presently not covered by vegetation. Likewise, bacterial abundance and diversity decreased as hyperaridity increased and the microbial community composition changed along the transect, becoming enriched in Actinobacteria. The distributional patterns of phospholipid fatty acids (PLFAs) confirmed the larger bacterial diversity at the higher, more humid sites compared to the drier ones. Archaeal isoprenoid glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraethers (isoGDGTs) and bacterial branched (br)GDGTs, which can also indicate past life, did not follow a clear elevational trend and were absent at the driest site. Taken together, plant-derived and microbiological markers follow primarily the macro-scaled elevation and aridity gradient. Viable bacteria are present even at the driest sites, while detected biomolecules also indicate past life. The detection of past plant life in nowadays apparently lifeless regions suggests that conditions for life were less hostile in former times.","We thank Alexandra Stoll (Centro de Estudios Avanzados en Zonas Aridas – CEAZA, La Serena, Chile) for plant identification and Nina Hoffmann for technical assistance.

Settled solids were sampled from the bottom of the rearing tanks, and suspended solids were sampled before filtration within the drum filter and analyzed to characterize their settling velocity and particle size properties. These particle properties are considered bioengineering parameters since they will provide biological information to improve engineering solutions for RAS solids removal processes. The average settling velocity for the settleable solids in the rearing tanks was 2.89 ± 0.02 cm s−1, and the average particle size ranged between 7.32 ± 3.41 and 19.44 ± 8.58 mm. Suspended solids within the drum filters before filtration had an average settling velocity of 0.35 ± 0.11 cm s−1 and it was found that 69.93 % of the particles size was greater than 200 μm, 15.40 % were within the range of 120 μm and 90 μm sizes, and 6.53 % were between 70 μm and 40 μm sizes. The particle physical properties, settling curves, and particle sizes curves obtained from this experience represent valuable information to be used to improve engineering design of solids handling mechanisms, especially in marine land-based systems, and in this case, applied for rearing wild-caught punctuated snake-eels. The present investigation constitutes an advance in the knowledge of applied engineering to the design of a marine aquaculture fattening operation targeted to feed up wild-caught premature punctuated snake-eels to the point of sale or trade.","This research was developed by Mr. Carlos Cortes throughout an Aquacultural Engineering Thesis named “Settling velocities and sizes of particle settled within punctuated snake-eel (Ophichthus remiger) rearing tanks”.

In this work, a methodology for obtaining response surfaces when a small data set is available and its behavior is complex is presented. The methodology consists of four steps. First, the classic experimental design is used for obtaining a data set. Second, using the experimental results from a design of experiment, the classical kriging is employed for estimating properties at unsampled locations. Third, a response surface is obtained by training an artificial neural network using the kriging-estimated data set, and a hybrid algorithm based on differential evolution and backpropagation algorithms. The verification of the model is accomplished with the experimental data set. Fourth, the uncertainty quantification is utilized for studying the behavior of the response against uncertainties, which guarantee the robustness of the model developed. The methodology was applied to three cases, considering verification, validation, and uncertainty quantification. The results indicate that the proposed methodology is robust, and it provides more stable response surfaces than the approaches commonly used for polynomials and artificial neural networks.

Thus, and due to sewage discharges, phosphorus is also present in aquatic ecosystems, causing eutrophication. Phosphorus can be found in inorganic and organic forms. One solution to phosphorus-related conflicts is the application of technologies for the recovery of phosphorus from wastewater and its possible reuse. However, existing technologies are focused on the elimination/recovery of inorganic phosphorus, while technologies based on combined mechanisms have demonstrated greater efficiency in the treatment of different forms of phosphorus and its recovery. This article reviews the operational factors of the different technologies based on the physical, chemical and biological mechanisms of phosphorus recovery. Emerging combined technologies that have been able to maximize the recovery of organic and inorganic phosphorus from different wastewater streams are also reviewed. Thus, the forms of phosphorus must be understood for the appropriate technology for the recovery different forms of P in wastewater discharges to be chosen, providing environmental protection to aquatic ecosystems.",This study was funded by the following Grants ANID/FONDAP/15130015.

151,pub.1123815435,10.1111/raq.12408,,,Biofloc technology: principles focused on potential species and the case study of Chilean river shrimp Cryphiops caementarius,"Abstract  The accelerated growth of aquaculture has caused environmental impacts in many countries. Examples include the use of large volumes of water, discharge of effluents with high nutrient content, the occupation of large areas, natural habitat alternation and the escape of exotic species. Biofloc technology (BFT) is an aquaculture tool that requires minimal water exchange, promotes the nutrient recycling optimizing resources and produces natural food in situ by forming suspended microbial aggregates in the water (bioflocs). These microorganisms provide multiple benefits such as water quality control, pathogen resistance and nutritional supplementation. Species such as Litopenaeus vannamei and tilapia have been successfully applied in BFT. In addition, there are also an increasing number of studies focused on alternative species with promising results. This paper describes essential aspects of biofloc technology, its application in aquaculture and the potential to extend its benefits to new aquaculture species such as Chilean river shrimp Cryphiops caementarius . This paper describes the future challenges of this technology as well as opportunities for its application.",,,Reviews in Aquaculture,,,,2020-01-04,2020,2020-01-04,2020-08,12,3,1759-1782,Closed,Article,"Walker, David Antonio Ulloa; Suazo, María Cristina Morales; Emerenciano, Maurício Gustavo Coelho","Walker, David Antonio Ulloa (Programa Cooperativo Doctorado en Acuicultura, Universidad de Chile, Universidad Católica del Norte, Pontificia Universidad Católica de Valparaíso, Chile, Grupo de Marcadores Inmunológicos.

We conduct an in-depth analysis of the historical evolution of research over the period 1970–2017 in six eight-year stages, shedding light on the main issues in each stage and the links among them using a sample of 1,253 articles. Attention is also paid to the three disciplines in this research stream: Strategic Management, Economics, and Finance. Our analysis reveals how the research on corporate diversification has extended the range of topics addressed and added new theoretical approaches and methodological tools, thereby ensuring greater maturity in its development. Emergent and prevailing research streams are identified, as they are expected to play a key role in the near future. We conclude by recognizing the need for an integrated theory on corporate diversification.",Declaration of Competing Interest The authors declared that there is no conflict of interest.,"This paper has been supported by Project RTI2018-097447-B-I00 of the Ministry of Science, Innovation and Universities (Spain).

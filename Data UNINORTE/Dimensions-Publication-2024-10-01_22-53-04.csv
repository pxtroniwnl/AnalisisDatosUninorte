In the highly conductive regime, ferromagnetic metals have been the focus of past research. Here, we report a giant extrinsic AHE in KV3Sb5, an exfoliable, highly conductive semimetal with Dirac quasiparticles and a vanadium Kagome net. Even without report of long range magnetic order, the anomalous Hall conductivity reaches 15,507 Ω-1 cm-1 with an anomalous Hall ratio of ≈ 1.8%; an order of magnitude larger than Fe. Defying theoretical expectations, KV3Sb5 shows enhanced skew scattering that scales quadratically, not linearly, with the longitudinal conductivity, possibly arising from the combination of highly conductive Dirac quasiparticles with a frustrated magnetic sublattice. This allows the possibility of reaching an anomalous Hall angle of 90° in metals. This observation raises fundamental questions about AHEs and opens new frontiers for AHE and spin Hall effect exploration, particularly in metallic frustrated magnets.","We acknowledge C. Cacho, T.

We present an archeological discovery and meta-analysis that challenge the man-the-hunter hypothesis. Excavations at the Andean highland site of Wilamaya Patjxa reveal a 9000-year-old human burial (WMP6) associated with a hunting toolkit of stone projectile points and animal processing tools. Osteological, proteomic, and isotopic analyses indicate that this early hunter was a young adult female who subsisted on terrestrial plants and animals. Analysis of Late Pleistocene and Early Holocene burial practices throughout the Americas situate WMP6 as the earliest and most secure hunter burial in a sample that includes 10 other females in statistical parity with early male hunter burials. The findings are consistent with nongendered labor practices in which early hunter-gatherer females were big-game hunters.","M. Aldenderfer (UC Merced), C. Darwent (UC Davis), L.

This spontaneous Hall effect, found more than a century ago, has been understood in terms of the time-reversal symmetry breaking by the internal spin structure of a ferromagnetic, noncolinear antiferromagnetic, or skyrmionic form. Here, we identify previously overlooked robust Hall effect mechanism arising from collinear antiferromagnetism combined with nonmagnetic atoms at noncentrosymmetric positions. We predict a large magnitude of this crystal Hall effect in a room temperature collinear antiferromagnet RuO2 and catalog, based on symmetry rules, extensive families of material candidates. We show that the crystal Hall effect is accompanied by the possibility to control its sign by the crystal chirality. We illustrate that accounting for the full magnetization density distribution instead of the simplified spin structure sheds new light on symmetry breaking phenomena in magnets and opens an alternative avenue toward low-dissipation nanoelectronics.","We acknowledge discussions with M.

1231,pub.1130126897,10.1155/2020/8867316,,,COVID-19 Outbreak in Colombia: An Analysis of Its Impacts on Transport Systems,"The global COVID-19 outbreak has demanded drastic actions and policies from the governments and local authorities to stem the spread of the virus. Most of the measures involve behavioural changes from citizens to reduce their social contact to a minimum. Thus, these actions influence individual activity patterns and transport systems in different ways. This paper studies the short-term impacts on the transport system caused by the different policies adopted by the Colombian government and local authorities to contain the COVID-19 spread. Using official and secondary data concerning the seven most populated cities in Colombia, we analyse the impacts on three components of the transport system: air transport, freight transport, and urban transport. Results show that national policies and local decisions have decreased the demand for motorised trips across the cities, diminishing congestion levels, reducing transit ridership, and creating a reduction in transport externalities. The country banned air transport for passengers and only allowed air cargo for medical and necessary supplies, which will have negative consequences for the economics of the airline industry. During the first three months of the COVID-19, freight was the most resilient transport component. However, freight trips diminished around 38%, affecting mainly the supply chain of nonessential products. During the pandemic, governments need to provide subsidies to maintain the system supply to avoid crowdedness and promote active transport by allocating less-used street space to cyclists and pedestrians. In the short term, transportation service providers will face a financial crisis, deepened by the pandemic, which will require government assistance for their recovery.","The authors want to express their gratitude to the Colombian Ministry of Transport and to public transport operators who provided the data for the analysis.

Adults answered a version of the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-10) modified for COVID-19 (PSS-10-C), with Cronbach alpha equal to 0.86. In total, 406 individuals aged between 19 and 88 years (M = 43.9; SD = 12.4) agreed to participate in the survey: 61.8% were females, 90.6% had a university degree, 44.1% were health professionals, and 45.7% considered public health policies for preventing the spread of the disease inconsistent with scientific recommendations. PSS-10-C scores ranged from 0 to 36 (M = 16.5; SD = 7.3); 58 individuals (14.3%) scored for high perceived stress (cut-off point = 25). The inconsistency between policies and scientific evidence was significantly related to high perception of stress associated with COVID-19 (OR = 2.36; 95%CI: 1.32-4.20), after adjusting for gender. We concluded that the study group presented the prevalence of perceived stress associated with COVID-19 at high levels, arising from the inconsistent strategies developed by health authorities in view of scientific recommendations. Further researches must address the psychosocial aspects of epidemics.","The authors thank the University of Magdalena, Santa Marta, Colombia, for supporting the project.",,Cadernos de Saúde Pública,,,"Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; COVID-19; Colombia; Coronavirus Infections; Cross-Sectional Studies; Evidence-Based Medicine; Faculty; Female; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Health Personnel; Health Policy; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Prevalence; Psychological Distress; Stress, Psychological; Students; Surveys and Questionnaires; Young Adult",2020,2020,2020,2020,36,5,e00090520,All OA; Gold,Article,"Pedrozo-Pupo, John Carlos; Pedrozo-Cortés, María José; Campo-Arias, Adalberto","Pedrozo-Pupo, John Carlos (Universidad del Magdalena, Colombia); Pedrozo-Cortés, María José (Pontificia Universidad Javeriana, Colombia); Campo-Arias, Adalberto (Universidad del Magdalena, Colombia)",,"Pedrozo-Pupo, John Carlos (University of Magdalena); Pedrozo-Cortés, María José (Pontificia Universidad Javeriana); Campo-Arias, Adalberto (University of Magdalena)",142,32,8.98,46.06,https://www.scielo.br/j/csp/a/g37L7PydxnYQdQkFmLT5xGt/?lang=en&format=pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1128150515,42 Health Sciences; 4203 Health Services and Systems,3 Good Health and Well Being

We conducted a brief review that synthesizes the available evidence and provides a judgment on the consistency of the association between risk factors and a composite end-point of severe-fatal covid-19. Additionally, we also conducted a comparability analysis of risk factors across 17 studies. We found evidence supporting a total of 60 predictors for disease severity, of which seven were deemed of high consistency, 40 of medium and 13 of low. Among the factors with high consistency of association, we found age, C-reactive protein, D-dimer, albumin, body temperature, SOFA score and diabetes. The results suggest that diabetes might be the most consistent comorbidity predicting disease severity and that future research should carefully consider the comparability of reporting cases, factors, and outcomes along the different stages of the natural history of covid-19.","To the contribution of a team of medical professionals that conducted part of the data extraction: Laura Acosta Camargo, Moises Molina Fuentes, John David Rodriguez and Juan Carlos Pantoja.",Funding.

A poor location selection process can lead to many issues for the health workforce and patients, and it can result in many unnecessary costs for the healthcare systems. The COVID-19 outbreak had a noticeable effect on people’s lives and the service quality of hospitals during recent months. The hospital location selection problem for infected patients with COVID-19 turned out to be one of the most significant and complicated decisions with many uncertain involved parameters for healthcare sectors in countries with high cases. In this study, a gray-based decision support framework using criteria importance through inter-criteria correlation (CRITIC) and combined compromise solution (CoCoSo) methods is proposed for location selection of a temporary hospital for COVID-19 patients. A case study is performed for Istanbul using the proposed decision-making framework.",,This research received no external funding.,Symmetry,,,,2020-05-30,2020,2020-05-30,,12,6,886,All OA; Gold,Article,"Zolfani, Sarfaraz Hashemkhani; Yazdani, Morteza; Torkayesh, Ali Ebadi; Derakhti, Arman","Zolfani, Sarfaraz Hashemkhani (School of Engineering, Catholic University of the North, Larrondo 1281, Coquimbo 1780000, Chile;, arman.derakhti@alumnos.ucn.cl); Yazdani, Morteza (Department of Management, Universidad Loyola Andalucia, 41704 Seville, Spain;, myazdani@uloyola.es); Torkayesh, Ali Ebadi (Faculty of Engineering and Natural Sciences, Sabanci University, 34956 Tuzla, Turkey;, ebaditorkayesh@sabanciuniv.edu); Derakhti, Arman (School of Engineering, Catholic University of the North, Larrondo 1281, Coquimbo 1780000, Chile;, arman.derakhti@alumnos.ucn.cl)","Zolfani, Sarfaraz Hashemkhani (Catholic University of the North)","Zolfani, Sarfaraz Hashemkhani (Catholic University of the North); Yazdani, Morteza (Universidad Loyola Andalucía); Torkayesh, Ali Ebadi (Sabancı University); Derakhti, Arman (Catholic University of the North)",86,32,,25.3,https://www.mdpi.com/2073-8994/12/6/886/pdf?version=1590833923,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1128183346,42 Health Sciences; 4203 Health Services and Systems; 46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4605 Data Management and Data Science,3 Good Health and Well Being

There is a gap in addressing the computational expense caused by increased decision units due to increasing the performance evaluation indices to more accuracy in the evaluation. We successfully addressed these two gaps through (1) using principal component analysis (PCA) to cut the number of evaluation indices, and (2) since PCA itself has the problem of merely using the data distribution without considering the domain-related knowledge, we utilized Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) to rank the indices through the expert’s domain-related knowledge. We propose an integrated approach for sustainability performance assessment in qualitative and quantitative perspectives. Fourteen insurance companies were evaluated using eight economic, three environmental, and four social indices. The indices were ranked by expert judgment though an analytical hierarchy process as subjective weighting, and then principal component analysis as objective weighting was used to reduce the number of indices. The obtained principal components were then used as variables in the data envelopment analysis model. So, subjective and objective evaluations were integrated. Finally, for validating the results, Spearman and Kendall’s Tau correlation tests were used.

To build this particular model, we have imposed metric potential e2λ(r)$$e^{2\lambda (r)}$$ and an equation of state. Specifically, the so-called modified generalized Chaplygin equation of state with ω=1$$\omega =1$$ and depending on two parameters, namely, A and B. These ingredients close the problem, at least mathematically. However, to check the feasibility of the model, a complete physical analysis has been performed. Thus, we analyze the obtained geometry and the main physical observables, such as the density ρ$$\rho $$, the radial pr$$p_{r}$$, and tangential pt$$p_{t}$$ pressures as well as the anisotropy factor Δ$$\Delta $$. Besides, the stability of the system has been checked by means of the velocities of the pressure waves and the relativistic adiabatic index. It is found that the configuration is stable in considering the adiabatic index criteria and is under hydrostatic balance. Finally, to mimic a realistic compact object, we have imposed the radius to be R=9.5[km]$$R=9.5\ [km]$$. With this information and taking different values of the parameter A the total mass of the object has been determined. The resulting numerical values for the principal variables of the model established that the structure could represent a quark (strange) star mixed with dark energy.","F.

Moreover, conurbation areas will be more common in so many countries like Chile when there are two or more cities developing one next to another, leaning on each other. In this atmosphere, typical residents live in a region or a neighborhood based on certain criteria, so they know how and where they are going to live. From another point of view, a newcomer is usually faced with a city full of contrasts which make things completely and surprisingly complicated. In order to illustrate this, a real case was selected based on the research field, qualitative and quantitative (real) data. The Coquimbo-La Serena conurbation and it’s regions as “Comuna (in Chile)” is a really suitable case to show the complexity of the study. In order to face the challenge, a new hybrid Multiple-Attribute Decision-Making (MADM) method is introduced based on the Best-Worst Method (BWM) and Multi-Attributive Ideal-Real Comparative Analysis (MAIRCA). The five best different neighborhoods as Comunas of the conurbation were analyzed based on the two main scenarios: having a private car or using only public transportation. To obtain more reliable results, a sensitivity analysis was made so as to determine the behavior of the proposed model against weight changes. Besides, the final results were compared with the other MADM methods, for example: Multi-Attributive Border Approximation Area Comparison (MABAC), VIsekriterijumsko KOmpromisno Rangiranje (VIKOR) and COmbinative Distance-based ASsessment (CODAS).",,,International Journal of Strategic Property Management,,,,2020-01-02,2020,2020-01-02,2020-01-10,24,2,102-118,All OA; Gold,Article,"Zolfani, Sarfaraz Hashemkhani; Ecer, Fatih; Pamučar, Dragan; Raslanas, Saulius","Zolfani, Sarfaraz Hashemkhani (School of Engineering, Catholic University of the North, Larrondo 1281, Coquimbo, Chile); Ecer, Fatih (Department of Business Administrative, Faculty of Economics and Administrative Sciences, Afyon Kocatepe University, ANS Campus, 03030 Afyonkarahisar, Turkey); Pamučar, Dragan (Department of Logistics, University of Defence in Belgrade, Pavla Jurisica Sturma 33, 11000 Belgrade, Serbia); Raslanas, Saulius (Department of Construction Management and Real Estate, Vilnius Gediminas Technical University, LT-10223 Vilnius, Lithuania)",,"Zolfani, Sarfaraz Hashemkhani (Catholic University of the North); Ecer, Fatih (Afyon Kocatepe University); Pamučar, Dragan (University of Defence); Raslanas, Saulius (Vilnius Gediminas Technical University)",47,9,,18.54,https://journals.vgtu.lt/index.php/IJSPM/article/download/11543/9590,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1124026996,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3504 Commercial Services",

There is a similar interest in violent behavior in university classrooms, which has also been seen to have increased in recent years. Given that, and the fact that research has shown personal variables to be more influential in dropout from higher education, the aim of this study is to explore whether those students who are the victims of bullying (both traditional and cyberbullying) are closer to dropping out from their degree courses. To that end, 1,653 first-year students doing various degree courses in the north of Spain were asked to complete a questionnaire. The results of a Bayesian analysis showed that students who were victims of bullying were more likely to consider dropping out than students who were not victims of bullying. In addition, variables related to social integration (support from friends and teachers) exhibited a moderating effect. These findings raise the urgent need to include intervention strategies in relation to bullying in university plans to prevent dropout. El aumento del abandono en los estudios superiores es un fenómeno que suscita un gran interés por la necesidad de paliar los efectos económicos, personales y sociales que genera; y por su nivel de prevalencia, que informes recientes cifran en España en torno a un 30%. Algo semejante ocurre con los comportamientos violentos en las aulas universitarias, cuyo incremento se ha constatado en los últimos tiempos. Teniendo esto en cuenta, y dado que tal y como pone de manifiesto la investigación científica son las variables personales las que parecen ejercer un mayor peso en el abandono de los estudios superiores, el objetivo que este trabajo persigue es investigar si aquellos universitarios que están siendo víctimas de acoso (acoso tradicional y ciberacoso) pueden tener un mayor planteamiento de abandono de la titulación. Para ello, se implementó un cuestionario a 1.653 estudiantes de primer curso de varias titulaciones de una universidad del norte de España. Los resultados del análisis bayesiano realizado muestran que aquellos estudiantes que son víctimas de acoso, en comparación con aquellos que no lo son, se plantean abandonar sus estudios en mayor medida, teniendo además las variables relacionadas con la integración social (apoyo de amigos y profesores) un efecto moderador. Estos hallazgos plantean la urgente necesidad de incluir estrategias de intervención sobre el acoso en los planes de prevención del abandono universitario.",,,Comunicar,,,,2020-07-01,2020,2020-07-01,2020-07-01,28,64,63-72,All OA; Gold,Article,"Bernardo, Ana B.; Tuero, Ellián; Cervero, Antonio; Dobarro, Alejandra; Galve-González, Celia","Bernardo, Ana B.

The scientific community has responded with a sizable level of research and publications, many of which are beginning to be identified and analyzed in systematic reviews of the literature and bibliometric studies. No readily identifiable, comparable study focused on Latin American scientific literature has been undertaken thus far. Therefore, this article analyzes such literature, focused on COVID-19, and one that has been published in the scientific journals of the region. A search with the keyword “COVID-19” in the Scientific Electronic Library Online (SciELO) database resulted in the identification of 261 documents. Following PRISMA guidelines, the total number was reduced to 117 for the purpose of the bibliometric analysis (i.e., elimination of preprint duplicates). Such analysis resulted in the following findings: 69 publications were editorial or individual commentaries, and 48 were original articles. The male authors totaled 280, contrasted with 169 female authors. Two Brazilian journals led in the number of publications: Cadernos de Saúde Pública and Clinics. Even though the Latin American scientific productivity regarding COVID-19 is not well represented in the different databases of the region, it is expected that these scientific publications will achieve increased visibility in the coming months.

With this expansion, the development of bilingual education approaches is under constant scrutiny. One recent approach is content and language integrated learning (CLIL). European in origin, CLIL can be viewed as an educational or language teaching approach and it refers to the teaching of curricular content and L2 in an integrated manner. This approach has received international attention, yet, how CLIL unfolds in settings outside Europe appears underrepresented in international publications. The aim of this article is to provide a critical review of CLIL in Latin America between 2008 and 2018. We surveyed 64 items (articles, book chapters, and dissertations) published in regional and international outlets: 41 empirical studies, 19 practice-oriented publications, and four reviews. It begins by summarizing the CLIL continuum with a focus on content- and language-driven CLIL and CLIL frameworks. It then provides a synthesis of empirical studies and practice-oriented publications about CLIL in different Latin American settings. The corpus is analyzed following these unifying themes: pedagogy, perceptions and beliefs, teacher education, global citizenship, and language development. From this review, it transpires that Latin American CLIL is mostly implemented and examined from a language-driven perspective in private primary, secondary and higher education. Suggestions and implications for further research and practice are included.",,,Studies in Second Language Learning and Teaching,,,,2020-06-29,2020,2020-06-29,,10,2,283-305,All OA; Gold,Article,"Banegas, Dario Luis; Poole, Paige Michael; Corrales, Kathleen A.","Banegas, Dario Luis (University of Strathclyde, UK; Ministry of Education in Chubut, Argentina); Poole, Paige Michael (Universidad del Norte, Colombia); Corrales, Kathleen A.

Based on current models of climate change, reduction in precipitations and in turn, increase in the soil salinity will be a sharp constraint for crops productivity worldwide. In this context, root fungi appear as a new strategy to improve plant ecophysiological performance and crop yield under abiotic stress. In this study, we evaluated the impact of the two fungal endophytes Penicillium brevicompactum and P. chrysogenum isolated from Antarctic plants on nutrients and Na+ contents, net photosynthesis, water use efficiency, yield and survival in tomato and lettuce, facing salinity stress conditions. Inoculation of plant roots with fungal endophytes resulted in greater fresh and dry biomass production, and an enhanced survival rate under salt conditions. Inoculation of plants with the fungal endophytes was related with a higher up/down-regulation of ion homeostasis by enhanced expression of the NHX1 gene. The two endophytes diminished the effects of salt stress in tomato and lettuce, provoked a higher efficiency in photosynthetic energy production and an improved sequestration of Na+ in vacuoles is suggested by the upregulating of the expression of vacuolar NHX1 Na+/H+ antiporters. Promoting plant-beneficial interactions with root symbionts appears to be an environmentally friendly strategy to mitigate the impact of climate change variables on crop production.",We acknowledge the logistic support of the Chilean Antarctic Institute (INACH).

The United Nations (UN) declared 2021–2030 as the UN Decade of Ocean Science for Sustainable Development. The Roadmap for the Ocean Decade aims to achieve six critical societal outcomes (SOs) by 2030, through the pursuit of four objectives (Os). It specifically recognizes the scarcity of biological data for deep-sea biomes, and challenges the global scientific community to conduct research to advance understanding of deep-sea ecosystems to inform sustainable management. In this paper, we map four key scientific questions identified by the academic community to the Ocean Decade SOs: (i) What is the diversity of life in the deep ocean? (ii) How are populations and habitats connected? (iii) What is the role of living organisms in ecosystem function and service provision? and (iv) How do species, communities, and ecosystems respond to disturbance? We then consider the design of a global-scale program to address these questions by reviewing key drivers of ecological pattern and process. We recommend using the following criteria to stratify a global survey design: biogeographic region, depth, horizontal distance, substrate type, high and low climate hazard, fished/unfished, near/far from sources of pollution, licensed/protected from industry activities. We consider both spatial and temporal surveys, and emphasize new biological data collection that prioritizes southern and polar latitudes, deeper (> 2000 m) depths, and midwater environments. We provide guidance on observational, experimental, and monitoring needs for different benthic and pelagic ecosystems. We then review recent efforts to standardize biological data and specimen collection and archiving, making “sampling design to knowledge application” recommendations in the context of a new global program. We also review and comment on needs, and recommend actions, to develop capacity in deep-sea research; and the role of inclusivity - from accessing indigenous and local knowledge to the sharing of technologies - as part of such a global program. We discuss the concept of a new global deep-sea biological research program ‘Challenger 150,’ highlighting what it could deliver for the Ocean Decade and UN Sustainable Development Goal 14.",,"Funding.

A multiple case study,"In this article, we report on four case studies of how higher education institutions have grappled with the demands of decolonisation of their curricula. In some respects, the cases differ in form and content, and the unique responses to decolonisation of each institution are described and analysed. An important similarity among the institutions was the use of extensive public lectures, seminars, and workshops as a common strategy to deal with the calls for the decolonising of curricula. The inquiry is motivated by our concern that some institutions, in an effort to comply, might resort to instrumentalist and quick-fix solutions to decolonise curricula, which result in decolonial-washing rather than substantive change. We discuss the following themes based on the data and literature: decolonial-washing; decolonising of curricula as a national project; political symbolism; and the need for complicated conversations.

Fatty acids were quantified using gas-chromatography coupled with flame ionization detection (GC-FID), and the distribution of different fatty acids within lipid classes (neutral and polar lipids) was achieved after oil extraction using the Folch method and separation of lipid classes via solid-phase extraction for further GC-FID analysis. Red cusk-eel was the fish species with the lowest content of both EPA and DHA (40.8 and 74.4 mg/100 g, respectively) whereas mackerel contained the highest amount (414.7 and 956.0 mg/100 g for EPA and DHA, respectively). Sea squirt was the shellfish species with the highest content of EPA and DHA (375.0 and 165.7 mg/100 g, respectively) whereas the lowest amount of EPA + DHA was found in Chilean abalone (63.6 mg/100 g). PUFA were mostly found in neutral or polar lipids depending on the studied species. Indexes used to discuss the nutritional quality of lipids (PUFA/SFA, n-6/n-3 ratio and the hypocholesterolemic/hypercholesterolemic fatty acid index) were calculated and reported in the manuscript.

However, little is known about the use of this methodology in the field and the ways in which mixed methods studies have been reported. The purpose of this methodological review was to examine the characteristics, methodological features and reporting quality of mixed methods articles published in palliative care research. The authors screened all articles published in eight journals specialized in palliative care between January 2014 and April 2019. Those that reported a mixed methods study (n = 159) were included. The Good Reporting of a Mixed Methods Study (GRAMMS) criteria were used to assess reporting quality. Findings showed that 57.9% of the identified studies used a convergent design and 82.4% mentioned complementarity as their main purpose for using a mixed methods approach. The reporting quality of the articles generally showed a need for improvement as authors usually did not describe the type of mixed methods design used and provided little detail on the integration of quantitative and qualitative methods. Based on the findings, recommendations are made to improve the quality of reporting of mixed methods articles in palliative care.",The authors would like to acknowledge the help of Dick Edelstein in editing the final manuscript.,"This review was carried out with the support of a José Castillejo Grant (JC2018-00273) from the Spanish Ministry of Education awarded to Sergi Fàbregues to visit the Mixed Methods Program (Department of Family Medicine, University of Michigan).

386,pub.1123603598,10.1016/j.jmrt.2019.11.056,,,Comparative mechanical properties between biocomposites of Epoxy and polyester matrices reinforced by hemp fiber,"Natural fibers have, in past decades, been increasingly used as reinforcement of polymer matrix composites in substitution for synthetic fibers. This work presents a comparative study on the mechanical properties of both epoxy and polyester composites reinforced with promising hemp fiber. The comparison would allow which of these thermoset matrices is more adequate for novel biocomposites to be used in technological applications. Amounts of 10, 20 and 30vol% of continuous and aligned hemp fibers were mixed with either epoxy or polyester inside steel molds kept under pressure and cured for 24h at room temperature. Plain epoxy and polyester plates were also fabricated for control samples. Basic characterization by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy was preliminarly performed. Mechanical properties were obtained in flexural and tensile tests according to ASTM standards. Results were statistically compared by ANOVA and Tukey tests. Fracture was analyzed by scanning electron microscopy. For higher amount, 30vol% of reinforcing hemp fiber, the epoxy composites disclosed superior strength than those of polyester composites. Indeed, for epoxy composites the flexural and tensile strength, 76.7 and 50.5MPa, respectively, are higher than corresponding 49.1 and 25.4MPa, respectively, for polyester composites. As for the elastic modulus, the flexural of 30vol% hemp fiber/epoxy composites, 3.8GPa, was superior to 30vol% hemp fiber/polyester, with 1.2GPa. These results indicate a potential application of hemp fiber/epoxy composites as part of multilayered armor systems for personal ballistic protection.","The authors thank the support to this investigation by the Brazilian agencies: CNPq, CAPES and FAPERJ.",,Journal of Materials Research and Technology,,,,2020-03,2020,,2020-03,9,2,1296-1304,All OA; Gold,Article,"Neves, Anna Carolina C.; Rohen, Lázaro A.; Mantovani, Dhyemila P.; Carvalho, Juliana P.R.G.; Vieira, Carlos Maurício F.; Lopes, Felipe P.D.; Simonassi, Noan Tonini; da Luz, Fernanda S.; Monteiro, Sergio N.","Neves, Anna Carolina C.

This present work is especially relevant to young people because understanding the interaction between health and education can facilitate the design of preventive policies. The research examines the way in which the educational level of young people from an urban district in the city of Zaragoza (Casablanca) has an influence on their health-related quality of life (HRQOL).MethodsA cross sectional survey was undertaken in the Casablanca district of Zaragoza (Spain). Participants were not randomly selected; their numbers reflected the areas where they lived with respect to age and sex distribution. It comprised 122 boys and 122 girls, aged between16 and 29, living in the neighbourhood are: Viñedo Viejo, Las Nieves and Fuentes Claras. These three residence zones are markedly different in terms of socioeconomic composition. The questionnaire included the following information: socioeconomic characteristics (sex, age, educational level, employment status, residence zone), an assessment of health (health problems, diagnosis and medication in the last 2 weeks) and HRQOL (WHOQOL-BREF dimensions: mental health; physical health; social relations; and environment). ANOVA and four regression models were used to assess the role, direction and intensity of educational level on HRQOL.ResultsThe results show that the higher the level of education, the better the level of HRQOL. The biggest impact of education was on the mental health dimension, but this influence was modulated by sex and residence zone. The value of the interaction of education and residence zone was more significant than educational level alone. HRQOL of girls is more sensitive to education, being a student and residence zone than the HRQOL of boys.ConclusionsThe dimensions of HRQOL are influenced by educational level. The influence is greatest among girls and the youngest members of the poorest area of the district. Public authorities should contemplate the development of an equitable education system from the beginning of the life cycle as a public health strategy.",Not applicable.,"FundingMinisterio de Economía y Competitividad (CSO2017–82110-R)Gobierno de Aragón-Universidad de Zaragoza (Grupo de Referencia en Investigación, BYCS S16_17R) Ministerio de Economía y Competitividad (CSO2017–82110-R) Gobierno de Aragón-Universidad de Zaragoza (Grupo de Referencia en Investigación, BYCS S16_17R)",Health and Quality of Life Outcomes,,,"Adolescent; Adult; Cross-Sectional Studies; Economic Status; Female; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Health Status; Humans; Male; Quality of Life; Sex Distribution; Spain; Surveys and Questionnaires; Young Adult",2020-06-16,2020,2020-06-16,2020-12,18,1,187,All OA; Gold,Article,"Gil-Lacruz, Marta; Gil-Lacruz, Ana Isabel; Gracia-Pérez, María Luisa","Gil-Lacruz, Marta (Department of Psychology and Sociology, Health Science Faculty, Domingo Miral s/n, 50009, Zaragoza, Spain); Gil-Lacruz, Ana Isabel (Department of Management, School of Engineering and Architecture, C.

Many thermo-electric plants are required to fill the gap and ensure energy supply. This paper thus proposes a hybrid renewable energy generation plant that could supply a percentage of the total energy demand and reduce the environmental impact of conventional energy generation. The hybrid plant works with a photovoltaic (PV) system and wind turbine systems, connected in parallel with the grid to supply a renewable fraction of the total energy demand. The investigation was conducted in three steps: the first stage determined locations where the energy system was able to take advantage of renewable sources, the second identified a location that could work more efficiently from an economic perspective, and finally, the third step estimated the number of PV solar panels and wind turbines required to guarantee optimal functioning for this location using, as a main method of calculation, the software HOMER pro® for hybrid optimization with multiple energy resources. The proposed system is expected to not only limit environmental impacts but also decrease total costs of electric grid consumption from thermoelectric plants. The simulations helped identify Puerto Bolivar, Colombia, as the location where the hybrid plant made the best use of non-conventional resources of energy. However, Rancho Grande was found to offer the system more efficiency, while generating a considerable amount of energy at the lowest possible cost. An optimal combination was also obtained—441 PV arrays and 3 wind turbines, resulting in a net present cost (NPC) of $11.8 million and low CO2 production of 244.1 tons per year.",This research was supported by the Mechanical Engineering Program of Universidad del Atlántico.

One of the most conspicuous type of symbiosis is the endophyticism. This interaction has been noted to play a role in the adaptation of the native vascular plant Colobanthus quitensis to the stressful environments of Antarctica, characterized by low temperatures and extreme aridity. Projections of climate change for this ecosystem indicate that abiotic conditions will be less limiting due to an increase in temperature and water availability in the soil. Due to this decrease in stress induced by the climate change, it has been suggested that the positive role of fungal endophytes on performance of C. quitensis plants would decrease. In this study, we evaluated the role of endophytic fungi on osmoprotective molecules (sugar production, proline, oxidative stress) and gene expression (CqNCED1, CqABCG25, and CqRD22) as well as physiological traits (stomatal opening, net photosynthesis, and stomatal conductance) in individuals of C. quitensis. Individual plants of C. quitensis with (E+) and without (E-) endophytic fungi were exposed to simulated conditions of increased water availability (W+), having the current limiting water condition (W-) in Antarctica as control. The results reveal an endophyte-mediated lower oxidative stress, higher production of sugars and proline in plants. In addition, E+ plants showed differential expressions in genes related with drought stress response, which was more evident in W- than in W+. These parameters corresponded with increased physiological mechanisms such as higher net photosynthesis, stomatal opening and conductance under presence of endophytes (E+) as well as the projected water condition (W+) for Antarctica. These results suggest that the presence of fungal endophytes plays a positive role in favoring tolerance to drought in C. quitensis. However, this positive role would be diminished if the stress factor is relaxed, suggesting that the role of endophytes could be less important under a future scenario of climate change in Antarctica with higher soil water availability.",We thank Instituto Antártico Chileno (INACH) and the Chilean Navy for logistics and field support.

To develop novel natural composites with satisfactory properties, less common NLFs should also be investigated. Among these, the Cyperus malaccensis (CM), a type of sedge fiber, is already used in simple items like ropes, furniture, and paper, but has not yet been investigated as composite reinforcement for possible engineering applications. Therefore, the present work evaluated for the first time the properties of novel epoxy composites incorporated with 10, 20, and 30 vol.% of CM sedge fibers. Tensile, Izod-impact, and ballistic impact tests were performed, as well as Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy and thermal analysis of the composites. Results disclosed a decrease (-55%) in tensile strengths as compared to the neat epoxy. However, the elastic modulus of the 30 vol.% sedge fiber composite increased (+127%). The total strain and absorbed ballistic energy did not show significant variation. The Izod impact energy of the 30 vol.% composite was found to be 181% higher than the values obtained for the neat epoxy as a control sample. An increase in both stiffness and toughness characterized a reinforcement effect of the sedge fiber. The thermal analysis revealed a slight decrease (-15%) in the degradation temperature of the CM sedge fiber composites compared to the neat epoxy. The glass-transition temperatures were determined to be in the range of 67 to 81 °C.","The authors wish to thank the support to this investigation by the Brazilian agencies: CNPq, CAPES, FAPERJ, the Navy Research Institute (IPQM) for the thermal analyses conduction, the laboratory of applied mechanics at EEIMVR/UFF for conducting the composites tensile tests, and the Natural Fibers Laboratory at the State University of the North Fluminense Darcy Ribeiro (UENF) for conducting the impact tests.",This research received no external funding.,Polymers,,,,2020-08-08,2020,2020-08-08,,12,8,1776,All OA;

AIM: To describe positive and negative mental health indicators in a sample of transgender people living in Chile.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: An intentional sample of 377 transgender individuals older than 18 years, living in the country's northern, center and southern zones were studied. Sociodemographic and well-being features, negative emotional symptoms, suicidal behavior, and substance consumption were assessed.
RESULTS: A precarious mental health was confirmed among participants. A high frequency of depression, ideation and suicide attempts, and high levels of depression, anxiety, and stress symptoms were identified. Also, a high frequency of substance abuse was found. These mental health indicators varied according to the sex assigned at birth and gender self-identification.

The creation and implementation of collaborative networks is observed through the lens of the holistic approach to the entrepreneurial ecosystem, whose purpose is to build “bridges” between different actors through the creation of communities of best practices or entrepreneurial networks. The creation of a specific ecosystem is suggested to ease the new digital entrepreneurship generation toward acquiring an appropriate level of knowledge, skills, financial facilitations, and entrepreneurial culture. Following a multiple case study analysis based on nine successful Italian digital firms, the empirical evidence seems to confirm that firms collaborate with different actors in different stages, as knowledge and resource networks play a critical role in sustaining the evolution and success of new firms.",,This research received no external funding.,Sustainability,,,,2020-11-13,2020,2020-11-13,,12,22,9437,All OA; Gold,Article,"Passaro, Renato; Quinto, Ivana; Rippa, Pierluigi; Thomas, Antonio","Passaro, Renato (Department of Engineering, University of Naples Parthenope, 80143 Naples, Italy;, renato.passaro@uniparthenope.it, (R.P.);, antonio.thomas@uniparthenope.it, (A.T.)); Quinto, Ivana (Department of Industrial Engineering, University of Naples Federico II, 80125 Naples, Italy;, pierluigi.rippa@unina.it); Rippa, Pierluigi (Department of Industrial Engineering, University of Naples Federico II, 80125 Naples, Italy;, pierluigi.rippa@unina.it); Thomas, Antonio (Department of Engineering, University of Naples Parthenope, 80143 Naples, Italy;, renato.passaro@uniparthenope.it, (R.P.);, antonio.thomas@uniparthenope.it, (A.T.))","Quinto, Ivana (University of Naples Federico II)","Passaro, Renato (Parthenope University of Naples; Department of Engineering, University of Naples Parthenope, 80143 Naples, Italy;, renato.passaro@uniparthenope.it, (R.P.);, antonio.thomas@uniparthenope.it, (A.T.)); Quinto, Ivana (University of Naples Federico II); Rippa, Pierluigi (University of Naples Federico II); Thomas, Antonio (Parthenope University of Naples; Department of Engineering, University of Naples Parthenope, 80143 Naples, Italy;, renato.passaro@uniparthenope.it, (R.P.);, antonio.thomas@uniparthenope.it, (A.T.))",29,14,,11.65,https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/12/22/9437/pdf?version=1605244725,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1132643399,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3507 Strategy, Management and Organisational Behaviour",

Several rivers in the Manila metropolitan area are assumed to be main pathways of land-based plastic waste into the ocean. However, these model estimates remain uncertain due to a lack of field data. The main goal of this study was therefore to collect field data on floating macroplastic flux and polymer category in three of Manila's main rivers: the Meycauayan, Tullahan and Pasig. We measured plastic flux, item polymer category, and flow velocity at two locations per river during an 11-day period. Each river was measured close to the river mouth, and several kilometer upstream. The results showed no significant difference between the plastic flux in upstream and downstream flow direction at the three river mouths. The Meycauayan and Pasig rivers did have significantly higher plastic flux at the river mouth compared to the upstream location. The observations suggest accumulation of macroplastics in the river mouths during periods of low freshwater discharge. In this case, instantaneous plastic flux is mainly determined by the tidal dynamics. It is hypothesized that plastics are temporarily retained in estuaries, and may be flushed out during neap tide or increased river discharge. Due to the retention capacity of the estuaries, net plastic export into the ocean could not be estimated. Future research is needed to further investigate the role of tidal dynamics on the transport and net export of riverine macroplastics.",We would like to thank the donors of The Ocean Cleanup who helped fund this research.

The master stage corresponds to the selection of suitable points for the locations of the DGs, whereas the slave stage is the optimal dimensioning problem. The Chu-Beasley genetic algorithm (CBGA) is employed to solve the master stage, and the optimal power flow (OPF) method via the vortex search algorithm (VSA) is employed to solve the slave stage. The OPF solution from the VSA technique uses a successive approximation power flow to determine the voltage profiles and power losses by guaranteeing the energy balance in all the nodes of the network. The conventional and widely used 33- and 69-node test feeders are used to validate the hybrid CBGA-VSA for analyzing the optimal location and sizing of the DGs in the distribution networks using MATLAB software. The numerical results demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed optimization method in terms of power loss reduction as compared with the results available in the literature. An additional 24-h dimensioning analysis is included for demonstrating the efficiency and applicability of the proposed methodology for daily operations with renewable generation.",Declaration of Competing Interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.,,Engineering Science and Technology an International Journal,,,,2020-12,2020,,2020-12,23,6,1351-1363,All OA; Gold,Article,"Montoya, Oscar Danilo; Gil-González, Walter; Orozco-Henao, César","Montoya, Oscar Danilo (Facultad de Ingeniería, Universidad Distrital Francisco José de Caldas, Carrera 7 No. 40B – 53, Bogotá D.C 11021, Colombia; Laboratorio Inteligente de Energía, Universidad Tecnológica de Bolívar, km 1 vía Turbaco, Cartagena 131001, Colombia); Gil-González, Walter (Grupo GIIEN, Facultad de Ingeniería, Institución Universitaria Pascual Bravo, Campus Robledo, Medellín 050036, Colombia); Orozco-Henao, César (Electrical and Electronic Engineering Department, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla 080001, Colombia)","Montoya, Oscar Danilo (District University of Bogotá; Universidad Tecnológica de Bolívar)","Montoya, Oscar Danilo (District University of Bogotá; Universidad Tecnológica de Bolívar); Gil-González, Walter (Pascual Bravo Institution University); Orozco-Henao, César (Universidad del Norte)",40,14,,11.03,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jestch.2020.08.002,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1130390168,40 Engineering; 4008 Electrical Engineering,13 Climate Action; 7 Affordable and Clean Energy

Many bacterial pathogens have been identified but the L. vannamei microbiota is still poorly known. Using a next-generation sequencing (NGS) approach, this work evaluated the impact of the inclusion in the diet of mannan oligosaccharide, (MOS, 0.5% w/w), over the L. vannamei microbiota and production behavior of L. vannamei under intensive cultivation in Ecuador. The MOS supplementation lasted for 60 days, after which the shrimp in the ponds were harvested, and the production data were collected. MOS improved productivity outcomes by increasing shrimp survival by 30%. NGS revealed quantitative differences in the shrimp microbiota between MOS and control conditions. In the treatment with inclusion of dietary MOS, the predominant phylum was Actinobacteria (28%); while the control group was dominated by the phylum Proteobacteria (30%). MOS has also been linked to an increased prevalence of Lactococcus- and Verrucomicrobiaceae-like bacteria. Furthermore, under the treatment of MOS, the prevalence of potential opportunistic pathogens, like Vibrio, Aeromonas, Bergeyella and Shewanella, was negligible. This may be attributable to MOS blocking the adhesion of pathogens to the surfaces of the host tissues. Together, these findings point to the fact that the performance (survival) improvements of the dietary MOS may be linked to the impact on the microbiota, since bacterial lines with pathogenic potential towards shrimps were excluded in the gut.",The authors wish to thank SENESCYT Ecuador for their contribution (O.G. fellowship) and also to Avila owners of the shrimp farm.

This study answers three research questions. The first question is how the number of published papers about Big Data modeling and management has evolved over time. The second question is whether the research is focused on semi-structured and/or unstructured data and what techniques are applied. Finally, the third question determines what trends and gaps exist according to three key concepts: the data source, the modeling and the database. As result, 36 studies, collected from the most important scientific digital libraries and covering the period between 2010 and 2019, were deemed relevant. Moreover, we present a complete bibliometric analysis in order to provide detailed information about the authors and the publication data in a single document. This SLR reveal very interesting facts.

Methods: A descriptive comparative study of the documents issued by the national-level government of the most recent past administrations in each country (2012-2018 for Mexico, 2013-2018 for Colombia) was conducted. We identified the documents' objectives, strategies, and evaluation of results, and the representation of international migrants and migrant health in the policy.
Results: Both countries situate health care policies for international migrants in a human rights framework. In both, migrants are entitled to health care, but access is limited by migration status. The main contrasts are the focus on different migrant populations (Mexican migrants in the Mexico-US migration circuit in Mexico; Venezuelan immigrants and Colombians returning from Venezuela in Colombia), and the discursive framing of policies as a response to the crisis in Colombia. As a result, while concrete actions are detailed in the Colombian policies, most documents in Mexico are limited to general strategies. These differences can be explained by the context in which each set of policies was issued: a relatively stable Mexico-US migration flow in Mexico, and the reception of hundreds of thousands of migrants from Venezuela in a very short time in Colombia.
Conclusions: Tradition in matters of migration, and the current migration context, influence health policies for migrant populations.","As part of the project “Mexico-Guatemala trans-border region”, ACV received financial support from FORDECYT (no.

1650,pub.1129653858,10.28945/4601,,,Trends in Using ICT Resources by Professors in HEIs (Higher Education Institutions),"Aim/Purpose: This study aimed at recognizing and analyzing the trends of ICT use (hardware, software, and digital educational resources) by higher education professors in the Antioquia region (Colombia), and characterizing this population according to their context. 

Background: The inexorable growth of ICT and the convergence of networks have produced great changes in human culture, and particularly in the educational environment. As a result, the development of appropriate technological competencies and the study of the trends of ICT use to meet this requirement become necessary. 

Methodology: The study follows a quantitative approach, with a non-experimental and correlational design. The sample consisted of 97 professors from different universities of the Antioquia region (Colombia), age between 21 and 60 years old, selected in a non-aleatory way, to fill in an online survey. 

Contribution: A contribution is the identification and characterizing of an active population in higher education and the trends in use of digital resources in the classroom from the professors’ perception that allows recognizing the pedagogical potential of these resources to enrich the process of social and educational appropriation of ICT in higher education institutions (HEI).  

Findings: Findings show the level of use (low and high) of ICT (hardware, software, and digital educational resources) by university professors, identifying those that still maintain a predominant use (e.g., desktop PC); those that are innovative (e.g., laptop, smartphone), and those that appear with low frequency (e.g., apps, digital blackboard, clickers). These results show some factors that may influence the development of these trends, such as technological infrastructure, HEI support, teachers’ training, the accessibility and availability of resources, and preference for digital open resources.  

Recommendations for Practitioners: According to the results, universities should provide technological resources and suitable connectivity necessary for educational innovation to professors. Besides, it is suggested to strengthen the pedagogical use of ICT by training according to the trends of use and professors’ competency levels.   

Recommendation for Researchers: This study made evident professors’ great preference of using storage, display, and sound devices, among them the desktop PC and the laptop continue being the key tools to boost the educational process, in contrast to the low use of tools to detect plagiarism, social networks, and apps to boost activities with emergent technologies. Considering the potential and richness these tools may offer in the educational processes, it should be interesting to carry out studies on factors or motivations that influence the little inclination to use them.

Impact on Society: The analysis of the trends of ICT use from the perspective of university professors about hardware, software, and digital educational resources may suggest greater attention to the permanent training to take advantage of the pedagogical and technological potential of these tools. 

Future Research: This study allows thinking of other ways and lines of research that are the base to develop future proposals exploring the reality of new generations of professors. It also could be the base to carry out comparative studies in other regional contexts, which permit to compare, contrast and enrich professors’ diversity. On the other hand, this research also shows the importance of carrying out mixed studies that offer a greater level of comprehension, analysis, and reflection about the target population and the trends of use of ICT.",,,Journal of Information Technology Education Research,,,,2020,2020,2020,,19,,395-425,All OA; Gold,Article,"Tulia Ricardo-Barreto, Carmen; Jabba Molinares, Daladier; Llinás, Humberto; M Peña Santodomíngo, Judith; Milena Astorga Acevedo, Cinthia; D Acevedo Rodríguez, Pedro; P Baloco Navarro, Claudia; M Villarreal Villa, Sandra","Tulia Ricardo-Barreto, Carmen (Universidad del Norte); Jabba Molinares, Daladier (Universidad del Norte); Llinás, Humberto (Universidad del Norte); M Peña Santodomíngo, Judith (Universidad de San Buenaventura); Milena Astorga Acevedo, Cinthia (Universidad del Norte); D Acevedo Rodríguez, Pedro (Universidad del Norte); P Baloco Navarro, Claudia (Universidad del Norte); M Villarreal Villa, Sandra (Universidad del Norte)",,"Tulia Ricardo-Barreto, Carmen (Universidad del Norte); Jabba Molinares, Daladier (Universidad del Norte); Llinás, Humberto (Universidad del Norte); M Peña Santodomíngo, Judith (Universidad de San Buenaventura); Milena Astorga Acevedo, Cinthia (Universidad del Norte); D Acevedo Rodríguez, Pedro (Universidad del Norte); P Baloco Navarro, Claudia (Universidad del Norte); M Villarreal Villa, Sandra (Universidad del Norte)",15,6,,9.99,http://www.jite.org/documents/Vol19/JITE-Rv19p395-425Ricardo6320.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1129653858,"39 Education; 3902 Education Policy, Sociology and Philosophy; 3903 Education Systems",4 Quality Education

Dicha situación incita a determinar los sentidos asignados a su implementación pedagógica en la formación del profesorado. En esa intención, se ha entrevistado a siete docentes de la Facultad de Ciencias de la Educación de la Universidad Nacional de San Agustín de Arequipa (Perú), a fin de reconocer los sentidos establecidos en su concepción, su distinción de la investigación científica, las características requeridas y las expectativas suscitadas. Los resultados evidencian que los docentes expresan una diversidad de sentidos formativos, más próximos a la formación de investigadores que como dispositivo o estrategia de enseñanza; asimismo, distinguen sutilmente la investigación formativa de la investigación científica en sentido estricto, que induce a confusiones entre ellas; de otro lado, enfatizan en el desarrollo de capacidades cognitivas ligadas a la investigación, y, finalmente, sitúan en el proceso formativo de la investigación, diversas expectativas de actuación no siempre concretadas en la enseñanza. La aproximación a los sentidos asignados a la investigación formativa evidenció diferenciaciones, confusiones, pero también coincidencias sobre el carácter formativo de la investigación, que conlleva a pensar en estrategias para un mejor afrontamiento de los desafíos docentes y socioprofesionales.
Abstract Within the framework of formative research, a series of subjective constructs about its understanding and transcendence arises. This prompts the need to determine the meanings assigned to its pedagogical implementation in teacher training. To this end, seven professors from the Department of Educational Sciences at the National University of San Agustín in Arequipa (Peru) were interviewed for the purpose of identifying their conceptualization, the distinctions they make from scientific research, the required characteristics and their expectations on the subject. The results show that teachers express diverse educational perspectives regarding formative research, related more closely to the training of researchers than to teaching. Likewise, they subtly distinguish formative research from scientific research in the strict sense, which leads to confusion between them; on the other hand, they emphasize the development of cognitive abilities linked to research, and finally, they situate various performance expectations in the formative research process that are not always specified in teaching. The meanings assigned to formative research differ and reveal misunderstandings, but also unveil coincidences in terms of the training aspects of research, which leads to the need to devise strategies to better face challenges related to teaching and socio-professional issues.",,,Educação e Pesquisa,,,,2020,2020,2020,,46,,e215876,All OA; Gold,Article,"Turpo-Gebera, Osbaldo; Quispe, Pedro Mango; Paz, Luis Cuadros; Gonzales-Miñán, Milagros","Turpo-Gebera, Osbaldo (Universidad Nacional de San Agustín de Arequipa, Arequipa, Perú, oturpo@unsa.edu.pe, pmangoq@unsa.edu.pe, lcuadrosp@unsa.edu.pe., - Universidad Nacional de San Agustín de Arequipa, Arequipa, Perú.

Study protocol, recruitment and selected baseline data","OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects of early management of hyperglycaemia with antidiabetic drugs plus lifestyle intervention compared with lifestyle alone, on microvascular function in adults with pre-diabetes.
METHODS: Trial design: International, multicenter, randomised, partially double-blind, placebo-controlled, clinical trial.
PARTICIPANTS: Males and females aged 45-74 years with IFG, IGT or IFG+IGT, recruited from primary care centres in Australia, Austria, Bulgaria, Greece, Kuwait, Poland, Serbia, Spain and Turkey.
INTERVENTION: Participants were randomized to placebo; metformin 1.700 mg/day; linagliptin 5 mg/day or fixed-dose combination of linagliptin/metformin. All patients were enrolled in a lifestyle intervention program (diet and physical activity). Drug intervention will last 2 years. Primary Outcome: composite end-point of diabetic retinopathy estimated by the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study Score, urinary albumin to creatinine ratio, and skin conductance in feet estimated by the sudomotor index. Secondary outcomes in a subsample include insulin sensitivity, beta-cell function, biomarkers of inflammation and fatty liver disease, quality of life, cognitive function, depressive symptoms and endothelial function.
RESULTS: One thousand three hundred ninety one individuals with hyperglycaemia were assessed for eligibility, 424 excluded after screening, 967 allocated to placebo, metformin, linagliptin or to fixed-dose combination of metformin + linagliptin. A total of 809 people (91.1%) accepted and initiated the assigned treatment. Study sample after randomization was well balanced among the four groups. No statistical differences for the main risk factors analysed were observed between those accepting or rejecting treatment initiation. At baseline prevalence of diabetic retinopathy was 4.2%, severe neuropathy 5.3% and nephropathy 5.7%.
CONCLUSIONS: ePREDICE is the first -randomized clinical trial with the aim to assess effects of different interventions (lifestyle and pharmacological) on microvascular function in people with pre-diabetes. The trial will provide novel data on lifestyle modification combined with glucose lowering drugs for the prevention of early microvascular complications and diabetes.

This topic is currently more critical than ever, given that the COVID-19 pandemic is making resources scarcer within the health industry. The objective of this study is to determine which model, the Theory of Planned Behavior or the Technology Acceptance Model, provides greater explanatory power for the adoption of telemedicine addressing outlier-associated bias. We carried out an online survey of patients. The data obtained through the survey were analyzed using both consistent partial least squares path modeling (PLSc) and robust PLSc. The latter used a robust estimator designed for elliptically symmetric unimodal distribution. Both estimation techniques led to similar results, without inconsistencies in interpretation. In short, the results indicate that the Theory of Planned Behavior Model provides a significant explanatory power. Furthermore, the findings show that attitude has the most substantial direct effect on behavioral intention to use telemedicine systems.",,The APC was partially funded by UCN.,Symmetry,,,,2020-09-25,2020,2020-09-25,,12,10,1593,All OA; Gold,Article,"Ramírez-Correa, Patricio; Ramírez-Rivas, Catalina; Alfaro-Pérez, Jorge; Melo-Mariano, Ari","Ramírez-Correa, Patricio (School of Engineering, Universidad Católica del Norte, Coquimbo 1781421, Chile;, catalina.ramirez@alumnos.ucn.cl, (C.R.-R.);, jalfaro@ucn.cl, (J.A.-P.)); Ramírez-Rivas, Catalina (School of Engineering, Universidad Católica del Norte, Coquimbo 1781421, Chile;, catalina.ramirez@alumnos.ucn.cl, (C.R.-R.);, jalfaro@ucn.cl, (J.A.-P.)); Alfaro-Pérez, Jorge (School of Engineering, Universidad Católica del Norte, Coquimbo 1781421, Chile;, catalina.ramirez@alumnos.ucn.cl, (C.R.-R.);, jalfaro@ucn.cl, (J.A.-P.)); Melo-Mariano, Ari (Department of Production Engineering, Universidade de Brasília, Campus Darcy Ribeiro Asa Norte, Brasília 04457, Brazil;, arimariano@unb.br)","Ramírez-Correa, Patricio (Catholic University of the North)","Ramírez-Correa, Patricio (Catholic University of the North); Ramírez-Rivas, Catalina (Catholic University of the North); Alfaro-Pérez, Jorge (Catholic University of the North); Melo-Mariano, Ari (University of Brasília)",33,17,,9.8,https://www.mdpi.com/2073-8994/12/10/1593/pdf?version=1601001769,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1131215997,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3503 Business Systems In Context",

Treatment is largely comprised of platinum-based chemotherapy; however, patients progressing after initial chemotherapy have a median overall survival (OS) of less than 6 months. Based on a high percentage of PD-L1 expression in patients with PSCC, and its biological similarities to other squamous cell carcinomas, we present two patient cases treated with pembrolizumab with extraordinary durable treatment response far beyond treatment with standard therapy.
MAIN BODY: The first patient is a 64 year old male with PSCC who was treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy, partial penectomy, and adjuvant radiation prior to developing metastatic disease. He had a high TMB (14 mutations/Mb) and was started on pembrolizumab with a complete response, which has been maintained for 38 months. The second patient is an 85 year old male with PSCC who was treated with partial penectomy and adjuvant chemotherapy and radiation prior to developing metastatic disease. He had positive PD-L1 expression CPS 130) and was started on pembrolizumab with a partial response, which has been maintained for 18 months after starting treatment.
CONCLUSIONS: These two cases of extreme durable response with pembrolizumab (with molecular data including TMB and PD-L1 status) represent a significant clinical benefit in this patient population. With limited treatment options that result in a median OS of less than 6 months, along with the toxicity profile of chemotherapy which may not be tolerated in elderly patients with comorbidities, this survival benefit with pembrolizumab, along with advances in tumor sequencing and clinical trials shows that there is a potentially significant benefit with novel therapies in this patient population.",,,Frontiers in Oncology,,,,2020-12-23,2020,2020-12-23,,10,,615298,All OA; Gold,Article,"Chahoud, Jad; Skelton, William Paul; Spiess, Philippe E.; Walko, Christine; Dhillon, Jasreman; Gage, Kenneth L.; Johnstone, Peter A.

This is the case of Flipped Classroom, which is based on a mixed approach between e-learning and face-to-face teaching, as well as gamification, which bases its didactic principles on the recreational components of the games. Within this context, the aim of this research is to observe what effect the application of Flipped Classroom and gamification has in the development of motivation, autonomy and self-regulation towards learning through a didactic unit on healthy habits and diet in 202 students of 6th grade of Primary School from four different schools (public and state-subsidized) in the city of Granada (Spain). For this purpose, a methodological design was used with pre-test and post-test to check the effects of the experience on the students. The findings obtained showed that the application of these methods promoted an increase in students' motivation, as well as in their autonomy and self-regulation when facing the contents of the subject. For this reason, it is advocated that there is a need to continue promoting a quality and innovative educational practice according to the figure of the student today.",To the researchers of the research group AREA (HUM-672) of the University of Granada.,This paper has been funded by the I+D+I Project Research of Results Transfer Office (OTRI) of the University of Granada (Reference: CNT4315).,Nutrients,,,"Child; Curriculum; Diet, Healthy; Emotional Regulation; Female; Healthy Lifestyle; Humans; Male; Motivation; Personal Autonomy; School Health Services; Spain; Students; Teaching; Video Games",2020-07-24,2020,2020-07-24,,12,8,2210,All OA; Gold,Article,"Gómez-García, Gerardo; Marín-Marín, José Antonio; Romero-Rodríguez, José-María; Ramos Navas-Parejo, Magdalena; Rodríguez Jiménez, Carmen","Gómez-García, Gerardo (Department of Didactics and Scholar Organization, University of Granada, 18071 Granada, Spain); Marín-Marín, José Antonio (Department of Didactics and Scholar Organization, University of Granada, 18071 Granada, Spain); Romero-Rodríguez, José-María (Department of Didactics and Scholar Organization, University of Granada, 18071 Granada, Spain); Ramos Navas-Parejo, Magdalena (Department of Didactics and Scholar Organization, University of Granada, 18071 Granada, Spain); Rodríguez Jiménez, Carmen (Department of Didactics and Scholar Organization, University of Granada, 18071 Granada, Spain)","Romero-Rodríguez, José-María (University of Granada)","Gómez-García, Gerardo (University of Granada); Marín-Marín, José Antonio (University of Granada); Romero-Rodríguez, José-María (University of Granada); Ramos Navas-Parejo, Magdalena (University of Granada); Rodríguez Jiménez, Carmen (University of Granada)",33,21,1.18,9.21,https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/12/8/2210/pdf?version=1595593962,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1129655805,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3202 Clinical Sciences; 3210 Nutrition and Dietetics; 42 Health Sciences; 4206 Public Health,4 Quality Education
1105,pub.1125527568,10.3390/en13051223,,,Intelligent Fault Detection System for Microgrids,"The dynamic features of microgrid operation, such as on-grid/off-grid operation mode, the intermittency of distributed generators, and its dynamic topology due to its ability to reconfigure itself, cause misfiring of conventional protection schemes. To solve this issue, adaptive protection schemes that use robust communication systems have been proposed for the protection of microgrids. However, the cost of this solution is significantly high. This paper presented an intelligent fault detection (FD) system for microgrids on the basis of local measurements and machine learning (ML) techniques. This proposed FD system provided a smart level to intelligent electronic devices (IED) installed on the microgrid through the integration of ML models. This allowed each IED to autonomously determine if a fault occurred on the microgrid, eliminating the requirement of robust communication infrastructure between IEDs for microgrid protection. Additionally, the proposed system presented a methodology composed of four stages, which allowed its implementation in any microgrid. In addition, each stage provided important recommendations for the proper use of ML techniques on the protection problem. The proposed FD system was validated on the modified IEEE 13-nodes test feeder. This took into consideration typical features of microgrids such as the load imbalance, reconfiguration, and off-grid/on-grid operation modes. The results demonstrated the flexibility and simplicity of the FD system in determining the best accuracy performance among several ML models. The ease of design’s implementation, formulation of parameters, and promising test results indicated the potential for real-life applications.",,"This work was partially supported by the project ""Desarrollo de una plataforma hardware/software para el modelado de la integración de pequeñas plantas de generación distribuida renovable en redes eléctricas de baja tensión de la Región Caribe para evaluación de su impacto sobre la estabilidad del sistema y el flujo energético de la red"" of the Administrative Department of Science, Technology and Innovation of Colombia (COLCIENCIAS), code 57598, and contract number 037-2018.",Energies,,,,2020-03-06,2020,2020-03-06,,13,5,1223,All OA; Gold,Article,"Cepeda, Cristian; Orozco-Henao, Cesar; Percybrooks, Winston; Pulgarín-Rivera, Juan Diego; Montoya, Oscar Danilo; Gil-González, Walter; Vélez, Juan Carlos","Cepeda, Cristian (Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla 080001, Colombia;, cgcepeda@uninorte.edu.co, (C.C.);, wpercyb@uninorte.edu.co, (W.P.);, jdpulgarin@uninorte.edu.co, (J.D.P.-R.);, jcvelez@uninorte.edu.co, (J.C.V.)); Orozco-Henao, Cesar (Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla 080001, Colombia;, cgcepeda@uninorte.edu.co, (C.C.);, wpercyb@uninorte.edu.co, (W.P.);, jdpulgarin@uninorte.edu.co, (J.D.P.-R.);, jcvelez@uninorte.edu.co, (J.C.V.)); Percybrooks, Winston (Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla 080001, Colombia;, cgcepeda@uninorte.edu.co, (C.C.);, wpercyb@uninorte.edu.co, (W.P.);, jdpulgarin@uninorte.edu.co, (J.D.P.-R.);, jcvelez@uninorte.edu.co, (J.C.V.)); Pulgarín-Rivera, Juan Diego (Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla 080001, Colombia;, cgcepeda@uninorte.edu.co, (C.C.);, wpercyb@uninorte.edu.co, (W.P.);, jdpulgarin@uninorte.edu.co, (J.D.P.-R.);, jcvelez@uninorte.edu.co, (J.C.V.)); Montoya, Oscar Danilo (Faculty of Engineering, Universidad Distrital Francisco José de Caldas, Bogotá D.C. 11021, Colombia;, o.d.montoyagiraldo@ieee.org; Smart Energy Laboratory, Universidad Tecnológica de Bolívar, Cartagena 131001, Colombia;, wjgil@utp.edu.co); Gil-González, Walter (Smart Energy Laboratory, Universidad Tecnológica de Bolívar, Cartagena 131001, Colombia;, wjgil@utp.edu.co); Vélez, Juan Carlos (Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla 080001, Colombia;, cgcepeda@uninorte.edu.co, (C.C.);, wpercyb@uninorte.edu.co, (W.P.);, jdpulgarin@uninorte.edu.co, (J.D.P.-R.);, jcvelez@uninorte.edu.co, (J.C.V.))","Orozco-Henao, Cesar (Universidad del Norte)","Cepeda, Cristian (Universidad del Norte); Orozco-Henao, Cesar (Universidad del Norte); Percybrooks, Winston (Universidad del Norte); Pulgarín-Rivera, Juan Diego (Universidad del Norte); Montoya, Oscar Danilo (District University of Bogotá; Universidad Tecnológica de Bolívar); Gil-González, Walter (Universidad Tecnológica de Bolívar); Vélez, Juan Carlos (Universidad del Norte)",35,12,,9.12,https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/13/5/1223/pdf?version=1583582242,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1125527568,"40 Engineering; 4008 Electrical Engineering; 4009 Electronics, Sensors and Digital Hardware",
941,pub.1133140112,10.3390/en13236189,,,Reliability Evaluation in Distribution Networks with Microgrids: Review and Classification of the Literature,"Modern power systems must provide efficient, reliable, and environmentally responsible energy. Recently, the inclusion of Microgrids (MGs) has allowed us to overcome some difficulties and face important challenges in this direction, especially related to the use of alternative energy sources. Increased and probabilistic demand, as well as limited energy supply, pose the need to evaluate the reliability of any distribution system (DS) when MGs are introduced. Here we reviewed and classified the state-of-the-art of reliability assessment (RA) in MGs. Initially, we contextualize RA in distribution systems. Next, each of the MGs subsystems components are introduced and the questions (1) why is it important to evaluate the reliability in Microgrids? (2) how do Microgrids influence the reliability of distribution systems? and (3) how does each of its subsystems influence the reliability of the Microgrids? are addressed. A total of 1395 research studies were published between 2002 and 2020. Using the PRISMA model, 147 met the inclusion criteria (71% correspond to research papers and 29% to reviews; 62% were published in journals, 34% were conference papers and 4% were books). The first study dates from 1971. Despite immense advances in MGs, we identified that (1) real test systems constitute an emerging trend; (2) although new MG configurations sound promising, the development and application of new RA techniques are a necessary step towards the identification of potential pitfalls of such architectures; (3) new RA methods or variations of the existing ones, whether analytical or simulation-based, are constantly being proposed, but their comparison for a particular DS, including MGs, are yet to be performed; and (4) more research studies are needed to assess how new control strategies and information and communications technology impact MGs reliability. Future lines of research could build upon these gaps to enhance reliability, especially when alternative energy resources are available.","We appreciate the support of the program Ecosistema Científico, Project # 58667 “Estrategia de Transformación del Sector Energético Colombiano en el Horizonte 2030” conferred to J.L.L.-P.",This research received no external funding.,Energies,,,,2020-11-25,2020,2020-11-25,,13,23,6189,All OA; Gold,Article,"López-Prado, Jose L.; Vélez, Jorge I.; Garcia-Llinás, Guisselle A.","López-Prado, Jose L.

Higher education is undergoing a great transformation due to the technological development in which we are immersed, and these continuous changes have shown the need to keep us updated permanently, thus adopting the idea of ​​life-long learning. Each person and each professional has a wide and diverse range of possibilities to be trained and to learn, which requires individuals to take more and more control over their own learning process. The concept of learning ecologies provides a framework of analysis to know how we learn, and what contexts and/or elements we use to train ourselves, in order to provide us with new learning opportunities. Being aware of the elements and / or contexts that make up our learning ecologies can be a very useful strategy to help us update ourselves in a self-directed and effective way.

Specifically in the academic context, it is relevant to analyze its levels due to its impact on performance and learning. There are factors that affect the said stress including, among others, self-efficacy, and emotional intelligence. The purpose of this study is to analyze how emotional intelligence and perceived self-efficacy affect student stress. In order to show this influence, two complementary methodologies are implemented: the structural equation models (SEMs) and the comparative qualitative analysis (QCA). A total of 477 students (85% of women) from a private University of Valencia participated in the study, with ages ranging from 18 to 53 years old (M = 21.57, SD = 3.68). The assessment instruments used were as follows: Emotional Intelligence Scale (TMMS-24) to measure emotional intelligence; General Self-Efficacy Scale (GSS) to measure self-efficacy; and Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) to measure stress. The results in the SEM endorse the hypotheses that emotional clarity and self-efficacy are negatively related to stress and positively related to emotional attention (EA), explaining 25% of the variance. The QCA results show that none of the variables is a necessary condition for inducing stress. Nevertheless, different combinations of these variables are sufficient conditions to explain 35% of the high stress levels. The most important combination over high stress levels seems to be the interaction between high levels of EA and low levels of self-efficacy. Regarding the low levels of perceived stress, there are sufficient conditions to explain 50% of them. Mainly, the most important interaction is between low levels of self-efficacy and low levels of EA. The comparison of both methodologies enables the broadening of new horizons at the methodological level applicable to different contexts.",,,Frontiers in Psychology,,,,2020-03-13,2020,2020-03-13,,11,,295,All OA; Gold,Article,"Navarro-Mateu, Diego; Alonso-Larza, Lucía; Gómez-Domínguez, María Teresa; Prado-Gascó, Vicente; Valero-Moreno, Selene","Navarro-Mateu, Diego (Department of Educational Psychology and Special Educational Needs, Faculty of Psychology, Teaching and Educational Sciences, Catholic University of Valencia, Valencia, Spain); Alonso-Larza, Lucía (Department of Educational Psychology and Special Educational Needs, Faculty of Psychology, Teaching and Educational Sciences, Catholic University of Valencia, Valencia, Spain); Gómez-Domínguez, María Teresa (Department of Educational Psychology and Special Educational Needs, Faculty of Psychology, Teaching and Educational Sciences, Catholic University of Valencia, Valencia, Spain); Prado-Gascó, Vicente (Department of Social Psychology, Faculty of Psychology, University of Valencia, Valencia, Spain); Valero-Moreno, Selene (Department of Personality, Assessment and Psychological Treatments, Faculty of Psychology, University of Valencia, Valencia, Spain)","Gómez-Domínguez, María Teresa (Valencia Catholic University Saint Vincent Martyr)","Navarro-Mateu, Diego (Valencia Catholic University Saint Vincent Martyr); Alonso-Larza, Lucía (Valencia Catholic University Saint Vincent Martyr); Gómez-Domínguez, María Teresa (Valencia Catholic University Saint Vincent Martyr); Prado-Gascó, Vicente (University of Valencia); Valero-Moreno, Selene (University of Valencia)",37,18,2.65,8.93,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2020.00295/pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1125610911,52 Psychology; 5205 Social and Personality Psychology,

However, no evaluation has assessed cable cars' impact from a health perspective. TransMiCable in Bogotá, Colombia, provides a unique opportunity to (1) assess the effects of its implementation on the environmental and social determinants of health (microenvironment pollution, transport accessibility, physical environment, employment, social capital, and leisure time), physical activity, and health outcomes (health-related quality of life, respiratory diseases, and homicides); and (2) use citizen science methods to identify, prioritize, and communicate the most salient negative and positive features impacting health and quality of life in TransMiCable's area, as well as facilitate a consensus and advocacy-building change process among community members, policymakers, and academic researchers. Methods: TrUST (In Spanish: Transformaciones Urbanas y Salud: el caso de TransMiCable en Bogotá) is a quasi-experimental study using a mixed-methods approach. The intervention group includes adults from Ciudad Bolívar, the area of influence of TransMiCable. The control group includes adults from San Cristóbal, an area of future expansion for TransMiCable. A conceptual framework was developed through group-model building. Outcomes related to environmental and social determinants of health as well as health outcomes are assessed using questionnaires (health outcomes, physical activity, and perceptions), secondary data (crime and respiratory outcomes) use of portable devices (air pollution exposure and accelerometry), mobility tracking apps (for transport trajectories), and direct observation (parks). The Stanford Healthy Neighborhood Discovery Tool is being used to capture residents' perceptions of their physical and social environments as part of the citizen science component of the investigation. Discussion: TrUST is innovative in its use of a mixed-methods, and interdisciplinary research approach, and in its systematic engagement of citizens and policymakers throughout the design and evaluation process. This study will help to understand better how to maximize health benefits and minimize unintended negative consequences of TransMiCable.","We are grateful to Paola Martinez, Natalia Merchán, and Karen Fajardo for their work on data entry and data cleaning.

The ultrasound in water treatment resulted in cellular swelling and small impact on texture. Differently, the ultrasound in ethanol and ethanol treatments modified both carrot microstructure (cell wall modifications of parenchymatic tissue) and macrostructure (shrinkage and resistance to perforation). Pre-treatments with ultrasound in ethanol and ethanol improved the drying kinetics, reducing the processing time (~50%) and the energy consumption (42-62%). These pre-treatments also enhanced rehydration, whose initial rate and water retention were higher than the control. In addition, the carotenoid content was preserved after drying, for all the treatments. Any impact on shrinkage was observed. A mechanistic discussion, based on structural modification (microstructure and macrostructure) and physical properties of water and ethanol, was provided. As conclusion, this work not only described positive aspects of combining the technologies of ultrasound and ethanol as pre-treatments to convective drying, but also proposed mechanisms to explain the phenomena.","The authors are grateful to the São Paulo Research Foundation (FAPESP, Brazil) for funding the project n° 2019/05043-6 and the GR Carvalho post-doctoral fellowship (2018/17844-0); this study was financed in part by the “Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior – Brazil (CAPES)” – Finance Code 001, through the KC Santos M.Sc. scholarship; to the National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq, Brazil) for the JS Guedes M.Sc. scholarship (131235/2020-6) and the productivity grant of PED Augusto (306557/2017-7); and to the Fondo Nacional de Desarrollo Científico, Tecnológico y de Innovación Tecnológica (FONDECYT, Peru) from the ‘‘Consejo Nacional de Ciencia, Tecnología e Innovación Tecnológica” (CONCYTEC, Peru) for funding the project n° 409-2019-FONDECYT.",,Ultrasonics Sonochemistry,,,Daucus carota; Kinetics; Physical Phenomena; Sonication; Water,2020-08-05,2020,2020-08-05,2021-01,70,,105304,All OA; Gold,Article,"Santos, Karoline Costa; Guedes, Jaqueline Souza; Rojas, Meliza Lindsay; Carvalho, Gisandro Reis; Augusto, Pedro Esteves Duarte","Santos, Karoline Costa (Department of Agri-food Industry, Food and Nutrition (LAN), Luiz de Queiroz College of Agriculture (ESALQ), University of São Paulo (USP), Piracicaba, SP, Brazil); Guedes, Jaqueline Souza (Department of Agri-food Industry, Food and Nutrition (LAN), Luiz de Queiroz College of Agriculture (ESALQ), University of São Paulo (USP), Piracicaba, SP, Brazil); Rojas, Meliza Lindsay (Dirección de Investigación y Desarrollo, Universidad Privada del Norte (UPN), Trujillo, Peru); Carvalho, Gisandro Reis (Department of Agri-food Industry, Food and Nutrition (LAN), Luiz de Queiroz College of Agriculture (ESALQ), University of São Paulo (USP), Piracicaba, SP, Brazil); Augusto, Pedro Esteves Duarte (Department of Agri-food Industry, Food and Nutrition (LAN), Luiz de Queiroz College of Agriculture (ESALQ), University of São Paulo (USP), Piracicaba, SP, Brazil; Food and Nutrition Research Center (NAPAN), University of São Paulo (USP), São Paulo, SP, Brazil)","Augusto, Pedro Esteves Duarte (Universidade de São Paulo; Universidade de São Paulo)","Santos, Karoline Costa (Universidade de São Paulo); Guedes, Jaqueline Souza (Universidade de São Paulo); Rojas, Meliza Lindsay (Private University of the North); Carvalho, Gisandro Reis (Universidade de São Paulo); Augusto, Pedro Esteves Duarte (Universidade de São Paulo; Universidade de São Paulo)",83,52,4.42,8.62,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ultsonch.2020.105304,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1129879932,40 Engineering; 4004 Chemical Engineering,

In the Chilean mining industry, there is a depletion of high-grade mineral ores, and there is hence a need to increase production levels in the copper industry and diversify its market by extracting other elements. One of the strategies is to foster the production of lithium batteries, but the manufacture requires reserves of cobalt (Co) and manganese (Mn). Currently, Co reserves are not being exploited in Chile, and Mn production is almost negligible. This is due to the apparent shortage of high-grade ores on the land surface of the country. Given this scenario, the seabed manganese nodules are presented as a good alternative due to their high average grades of Co and Mn, which in turn would allow the growth of strategic value-added industries including lithium battery production. Chile’s current environmental regulations prevent the exploitation of marine resources. However, given technological advances worldwide, both in collection mechanisms and extractive processes, in addition to the needs generated from the future strategic plans, leads us to think about a project to exploit manganese nodules locally.",The authors are grateful for the contribution of the Scientific Equipment Unit—MAINI of the Universidad Católica del Norte for facilitating the chemical analysis of the Chilean manganese nodules.

METHODS: Data of Colombian confirmed deaths of COVID-19 until June 11, 2020, were included in this analysis (n=1488 deaths). Relationships between COVID-19, combinations of health conditions and age were explored using locally weighted polynomial regressions.
RESULTS: The most frequent health conditions were high blood pressure, respiratory disease, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and kidney disease. Dyads more frequents were high blood pressure with diabetes, cardiovascular disease or respiratory disease. Some multimorbidity patterns increase probability of death among older individuals, whereas other patterns are not age-related, or decrease the probability of death among older people. Not all multimorbidity increases with age, as is commonly thought. Obesity, alone or with other diseases, was associated with a higher risk of severity among young people, while the risk of the high blood pressure/diabetes dyad tends to have an inverted U distribution in relation with age.
CONCLUSIONS: Classification of individuals according to multimorbidity in the medical management of COVID-19 patients is important to determine the possible etiological models and to define patient triage for hospitalization. Moreover, identification of non-infected individuals with high-risk ages and multimorbidity patterns serves to define possible interventions of selective confinement or special management.",,None declared.,BULL PAN AM HEALTH ORGAN,,,,2020-12-30,2020,2020-12-30,2020-12-30,44,,1,All OA; Gold,Article,"Fernández-Niño, Julián A.; Guerra-Gómez, John A.; Idrovo, Alvaro J.","Fernández-Niño, Julián A.

A number of studies have indicated that, in Latin American countries, male CSA is phenomenon of great concern. However, research on this topic is seriously lacking, and more specifically, on male-on-male CSA. We carried out a qualitative and quantitative secondary analysis of 680 cases of alleged male-on-male CSA that occurred between the years 2017 and 2018 in the Caribbean Region of Colombia. We analyzed the contents of forensic interviews with the alleged victims, conducted by professionals working at the Colombian Institute of Legal Medicine and Forensic Sciences. Our findings indicated a high prevalence of cases of alleged male-on-male CSA among young minors. Most of these cases were allegedly perpetrated by offenders known to the victim and involved high levels of violence. Evidence-based and culturally grounded preventative actions, such as training-based programs for teachers and parents among other public health initiatives are needed to address this type of CSA. Further research is also required to gain a more fine-grained understanding of the cultural and social context of CSA in the Caribbean Latin American countries.","The authors would like to acknowledge the help of Dick Edelstein in editing the final manuscript, and the support of Lissette Milhoua, Laura Villarreal, Julitsa Mendoza, and Marilyn Anturi for their help in the data management.",This study was carried out with the support of a 2019–0003 grant from the Instituto Nacional De Medicina Legal y Ciencias Forenses (Colombia) and Universidad del Norte awarded to Elsa Escalante-Barrios and Sandra Patricia Ferreira Pérez to carry out the research project entitled “Characterization of child sexual abuse in the Departments of the North Region of Colombia: Foundations for Prevention”.,International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health,,,"Adolescent; Caribbean Region; Child; Child Abuse, Sexual; Child, Preschool; Colombia; Criminals; Humans; Male; Prevalence; Social Problems",2020-11-01,2020,2020-11-08,2020-11-01,17,21,8248,All OA; Gold,Article,"Escalante-Barrios, Elsa Lucia; Fàbregues, Sergi; Meneses, Julio; del Mar García-Vita, María; Jabba, Daladier; Ricardo-Barreto, Carmen; Pérez, Sandra Patricia Ferreira","Escalante-Barrios, Elsa Lucia (Department of Education, Universidad del Norte, Km.5 Vía Puerto Colombia, 080001 Barranquilla, Colombia;, cricardo@uninorte.edu.co); Fàbregues, Sergi (Department of Psychology and Education, Universitat Oberta de Catalunya, Rambla del Poblenou, 156, 08018 Barcelona, Spain;, sfabreguesf@uoc.edu, (S.F.);, jmenesesn@uoc.edu, (J.M.)); Meneses, Julio (Department of Psychology and Education, Universitat Oberta de Catalunya, Rambla del Poblenou, 156, 08018 Barcelona, Spain;, sfabreguesf@uoc.edu, (S.F.);, jmenesesn@uoc.edu, (J.M.)); del Mar García-Vita, María (Department of Education, Universidad de Almería, Carretera Sacramento, Calle San Urbano, s/n, 04120 Almería, Spain;, margvita@ual.es); Jabba, Daladier (Department of Computer Science, Universidad del Norte, Km.5 Vía Puerto Colombia, 080001 Barranquilla, Colombia;, djabba@uninorte.edu.co); Ricardo-Barreto, Carmen (Department of Education, Universidad del Norte, Km.5 Vía Puerto Colombia, 080001 Barranquilla, Colombia;, cricardo@uninorte.edu.co); Pérez, Sandra Patricia Ferreira (Instituto Nacional De Medicina Legal y Ciencias Forenses (Regional Norte), Cra. 23 #5356, 080012 Barranquilla, Colombia;, sferreira@medicinalegal.gov.co)","Escalante-Barrios, Elsa Lucia (Universidad del Norte)","Escalante-Barrios, Elsa Lucia (Universidad del Norte); Fàbregues, Sergi (Open University of Catalonia; Department of Psychology and Education, Universitat Oberta de Catalunya, Rambla del Poblenou, 156, 08018 Barcelona, Spain;, sfabreguesf@uoc.edu, (S.F.);, jmenesesn@uoc.edu, (J.M.)); Meneses, Julio (Open University of Catalonia; Department of Psychology and Education, Universitat Oberta de Catalunya, Rambla del Poblenou, 156, 08018 Barcelona, Spain;, sfabreguesf@uoc.edu, (S.F.);, jmenesesn@uoc.edu, (J.M.)); del Mar García-Vita, María (University of Almería); Jabba, Daladier (Universidad del Norte); Ricardo-Barreto, Carmen (Universidad del Norte); Pérez, Sandra Patricia Ferreira (Instituto Nacional De Medicina Legal y Ciencias Forenses (Regional Norte), Cra. 23 #5356, 080012 Barranquilla, Colombia;, sferreira@medicinalegal.gov.co)",6,4,0.23,8.42,https://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/17/21/8248/pdf?version=1604995956,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1132450833,48 Law and Legal Studies; 4804 Law In Context,"16 Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions"

The input of the ERT comprised 39 propositions from 20 experts representing 11 different perspectives. The two-day ERT discussed the main drivers and challenges as well as vulnerabilities or unseens and provided suggestions for: (i) the mechanisms underlying major unseens; (ii) understanding possible ways in which rebound effects of digital transformation may become the subject of overarching research in three main categories of impact: development factors, society, and individuals; and (iii) a set of potential action domains for transdisciplinary follow-up processes, including a case study in Brazil. A content analysis of the propositions and related mechanisms provided insights in the genesis of unseens by identifying 15 interrelated causal mechanisms related to critical issues/concerns. Additionally, a cluster analysis (CLA) was applied to structure the challenges and critical developments in South America. The discussion elaborated the genesis, dynamics, and impacts of (groups of) unseens such as the digital divide (that affects most countries that are not included in the development of digital business, management, production, etc. tools) or the challenge of restructuring small- and medium-sized enterprises (whose service is digitally substituted by digital devices). We identify specific issues and effects (for most South American countries) such as lack of governmental structure, challenging geographical structures (e.g., inclusion in high-performance transmission power), or the digital readiness of (wide parts) of society. One scientific contribution of the paper is related to the presented methodology that provides insights into the phenomena, the causal chains underlying “wanted/positive” and “unwanted/negative” effects, and the processes and mechanisms of societal changes caused by digitalization.","We thank Peter Parycek, Head of the Department for E-Governance, Danube University Krems, for providing the funding for the SA ERT, Elaine Ambrose for the thoughtful English language editing and Maria Carmen Martinez, Rodolfo Andrade de Gouveia Vilela, Luis Fabiano de Assis, Maria Regina Alves Cardoso for the contribution to Propositions on Big Data in Occupational Health.","The South American Expert Roundtable received funding from the Department for E-Governance, Danube University Krems, Austria.",Sustainability,,,,2020-01-19,2020,2020-01-19,,12,2,718,All OA; Gold,Article,"Pereira, Gabriela Viale; Estevez, Elsa; Cardona, Diego; Chesñevar, Carlos; Collazzo-Yelpo, Pablo; Cunha, Maria Alexandra; Diniz, Eduardo Henrique; Ferraresi, Alex Antonio; Fischer, Frida Marina; Garcia, Flúvio Cardinelle Oliveira; Joia, Luiz Antonio; Luciano, Edimara M.; de Albuquerque, João Porto; Quandt, Carlos O.; Rios, Rodrigo Sánchez; Sánchez, Aurora; da Silva, Eduardo Damião; Silva-Junior, João Silvestre; Scholz, Roland W.","Pereira, Gabriela Viale (Department for E-Governance and Administration, Danube University Krems, 3500 Krems an der Donau, Austria; Escola de Administração de Empresas de São Paulo, Fundação Getulio Vargas, 01313-902 São Paulo, Brazil;, alexandra.cunha@fgv.br, (M.A.C.);, eduardo.diniz@fgv.br, (E.H.D.)); Estevez, Elsa (Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Universidad Nacional del Sur, B8000 Bahía Blanca, Argentina;, ecestevez@gmail.com; Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Científicas y Técnicas, B8000 Bahía Blanca, Argentina); Cardona, Diego (Facultad de Administración, Finanzas y Ciencias Económicas, Universidad EAN, 110221 Bogotá, Colombia;, diego.cardona.68@gmail.com); Chesñevar, Carlos (Instituto en Ciencias e Ingeniería de la Computación, Universidad Nacional del Sur, B8000 Bahía Blanca, Argentina;, cic@cs.uns.edu.ar); Collazzo-Yelpo, Pablo (Department of Management, Vienna University of Applied Sciences, 1180 Wien, Austria;, pablo.collazzo@edu.fh-wien.ac.at); Cunha, Maria Alexandra (Escola de Administração de Empresas de São Paulo, Fundação Getulio Vargas, 01313-902 São Paulo, Brazil;, alexandra.cunha@fgv.br, (M.A.C.);, eduardo.diniz@fgv.br, (E.H.D.)); Diniz, Eduardo Henrique (Escola de Administração de Empresas de São Paulo, Fundação Getulio Vargas, 01313-902 São Paulo, Brazil;, alexandra.cunha@fgv.br, (M.A.C.);, eduardo.diniz@fgv.br, (E.H.D.)); Ferraresi, Alex Antonio (Program in Cooperative Management, Pontifical Catholic University of Parana, 80215-901 Curitiba, Brazil;, alex.ferraresi@pucpr.br); Fischer, Frida Marina (Department of Environmental Health, School of Public Health, University of São Paulo, 01246-904 São Paulo, Brazil;, fmfische@usp.br); Garcia, Flúvio Cardinelle Oliveira (Corregedoria Regional da Polícia Federal no Estado do Paraná, 82640-040 Curitiba, Brazil;, fluvio.garcia@pucpr.br); Joia, Luiz Antonio (Brazilian School of Public and Business Administration, Getulio Vargas Foundation, 22231-010 Rio de Janeiro, Brazil;, Luiz.Joia@fgv.br); Luciano, Edimara M.

1193,pub.1129371478,10.3390/app10144791,,,Automatic Segmentation and Classification of Heart Sounds Using Modified Empirical Wavelet Transform and Power Features,"A system for the automatic classification of cardiac sounds can be of great help for doctors in the diagnosis of cardiac diseases. Generally speaking, the main stages of such systems are (i) the pre-processing of the heart sound signal, (ii) the segmentation of the cardiac cycles, (iii) feature extraction and (iv) classification. In this paper, we propose methods for each of these stages. The modified empirical wavelet transform (EWT) and the normalized Shannon average energy are used in pre-processing and automatic segmentation to identify the systolic and diastolic intervals in a heart sound recording; then, six power characteristics are extracted (three for the systole and three for the diastole)—the motivation behind using power features is to achieve a low computational cost to facilitate eventual real-time implementations. Finally, different models of machine learning (support vector machine (SVM), k-nearest neighbor (KNN), random forest and multilayer perceptron) are used to determine the classifier with the best performance. The automatic segmentation method was tested with the heart sounds from the Pascal Challenge database. The results indicated an error (computed as the sum of the differences between manual segmentation labels from the database and the segmentation labels obtained by the proposed algorithm) of 843,440.8 for dataset A and 17,074.1 for dataset B, which are better values than those reported with the state-of-the-art methods. For automatic classification, 805 sample recordings from different databases were used. The best accuracy result was 99.26% using the KNN classifier, with a specificity of 100% and a sensitivity of 98.57%. These results compare favorably with similar works using the state-of-the-art methods.",,This research received no external funding.,Applied Sciences,,,,2020-07-13,2020,2020-07-13,,10,14,4791,All OA; Gold,Article,"Narváez, Pedro; Gutierrez, Steven; Percybrooks, Winston S.","Narváez, Pedro (Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla 081001, Colombia); Gutierrez, Steven (Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla 081001, Colombia); Percybrooks, Winston S.

The operating parameters of a cutter type dredger: swing speed, dredging depth, and inclination, impeller rpm, as well as slurry characterizations such as density and velocity, are introduced, to determine how they influence the operation of the dredge pump. The geometric characterization of the hydraulic transport system of the dredger was performed. With the dredge operationaĺs parameters, along with the geometric characterization, the pump is modeled in CFD turbomachinery software. To validate the operational points, the CFD model considers the RNG k-ε model and the cavitating-multiphase flow. Through the central composite experiment design, the operating conditions range of the dredger is determined, in which the pump can operate and cavitate. This allows validating the model for different operational points. Finally, multiple regression shows the influence of each of the variables in the response obtained. Furthermore, the regression allows an understanding that operating conditions of the dredger must be adjusted to mitigate the phenomenon of cavitation in the dredging process.","Declaration of Competing Interest The authors declared that there is no conflict of interest.

Specifically, we assume one of the scalar fields to be minimally coupled to gravity, while the second field which is the Brans-Dicke scalar field is nonminimally coupled to gravity and also coupled to the other scalar field. In the Einstein frame this theory reduces to a two-scalar field theory where the two fields can interact only in the potential term, which means that the quintom theory is recovered. The cosmological evolution is studied by analyzing the equilibrium points of the field equations in the Jordan frame. We find that the theory can describe the cosmological evolution in large scales, while inflationary solutions are also provided.","A.P. thanks Dr. Alex Giacomini and the Universidad Austral de Chile for the hospitality provided while this work was performed.

In this context and based on a sample of Colombian customers, this investigation aims to analyze both the direct and indirect effects of xenocentrism on the consumer purchase intentions of imported products through product attitudes and perceived product quality. Xenocentrism was measured using the XSCALE, and the research model was analyzed with partial least squares structural equation modeling. The result indicates that xenocentrism has a positive direct effect on purchase intentions, perceived product quality, and product attitudes. The analysis also shows that product attitudes will partially mediate the effect between xenocentrism and purchase intentions. In light of these findings, xenocentrism in Latin America arises as a solid construction to explain consumer behavior, mainly when individuals’ beliefs generate a positive appreciation of the purchase of imported products that compete in local markets.

More research is needed to examine the effectiveness of TBL within the field of radiologic technology as well as to study teachers' reflective practices for instructional development in TBL.Objectives: This study examines the effectiveness of TBL on students' learning and course instructors' instructional development during quality control activities in diagnostic imaging.Design: This study employed an action research approach with mixed-methods. The study was categorized using four TBL modules as the topics: film/screen receptors and processors, radiography, mammography, and computed tomography. Quantitative data included pre-test scores on individual readiness assurance tests (IRAT-pre), group readiness assurance tests (GRAT), and post-test scores on individual readiness assurance tests (IRAT-post). Qualitative data included students' responses to open-ended questions about their experience with TBL and transcripts of instructors' interviews.Results: Forty junior college students participated in the study. A non-parametric test was conducted to compare the scores. The results showed that the GRAT score was significantly higher than the IRAT-pre-score, and the IRAT-post score was significantly higher than the IRAT-pre-score. The IRAT-post score was significantly higher than the GRAT score for the first and fourth modules, but IRAT-post score was significantly lower than the GRAT score on the second and third modules. Using direct content analysis, five themes were coded around instructional development, while 15 themes were coded to understand students' experiences with TBL.Conclusions: TBL can be an effective instructional approach to improve students' understanding of radiologic technology content. The results of this research can help instructors decide what action plan to implement to increase the effectiveness of TBL when further employing it for radiologic technology courses.",,,Medical Education Online,,,Diagnostic Imaging; Educational Measurement; Health Services Research; Humans; Learning; Peer Group; Problem-Based Learning; Program Evaluation; Quality Control; Students; Teaching; Universities,2020-01-01,2020,2020-02-23,2020-01-01,25,1,1732159,All OA; Gold,Article,"Tsai, Meng-Fang; Jao, Jo-Chi","Tsai, Meng-Fang (General Research Service Center, National Pingtung University of Science and Technology, Neipu, Pingtung, Taiwan); Jao, Jo-Chi (Department of Medical Imaging and Radiological Sciences, Kaohsiung Medical University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan)","Jao, Jo-Chi (Kaohsiung Medical University)","Tsai, Meng-Fang (National Pingtung University of Science and Technology); Jao, Jo-Chi (Kaohsiung Medical University)",12,7,0.89,7.62,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/10872981.2020.1732159?needAccess=true&,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1125092402,39 Education; 3901 Curriculum and Pedagogy; 3903 Education Systems,

Defining spatial units that consider transmission heterogeneity, human movement and migration will help to set up achievable malaria elimination milestones and guide the creation of efficient operational administrative control units. Using a combination of genetic and epidemiological data we defined a malaria transmission unit as the area contributing 95% of malaria cases diagnosed at the catchment facility located in the town of Guapi in the South Pacific Coast of Colombia. We provide data showing that P. falciparum malaria transmission is heterogeneous in time and space and analysed, using topological data analysis, the spatial connectivity, at the micro epidemiological level, between parasite populations circulating within the unit. To illustrate the necessity to evaluate the efficacy of malaria control measures within the transmission unit in order to increase the efficiency of the malaria control effort, we provide information on the size of the asymptomatic reservoir, the nature of parasite genotypes associated with drug resistance as well as the frequency of the Pfhrp2/3 deletion associated with false negatives when using Rapid Diagnostic Tests.","This work received financial support from Newton-Caldas Fund Institutional Links G1854 Award to JCR and VC.

When trying to explain the biological diversity of early groups across North, Central and South America, studies have defended a wide range of dispersion models that tend to oversimplify the diversity observed across the continent. In this study, we aim to contribute to this debate by exploring the cranial morphological affinities of four late Pleistocene/early Holocene specimens recovered from the caves of Quintana Roo, Mexico. The four specimens are among the earliest human remains known in the continent and permit the contextualization of biological diversity present during the initial millennia of human presence in the Americas. The specimens were compared to worldwide reference series through geometric morphometric analyses of 3D anatomical landmarks. Morphological data were analyzed through exploratory visual multivariate analyses and multivariate classification based on Mahalanobis distances. The results show very different patterns of morphological association for each Quintana Roo specimen, suggesting that the early populations of the region already shared a high degree of morphological diversity. This contrasts with previous studies of South American remains and opens the possibility that the initial populations of North America already had a high level of morphological diversity, which was reduced as populations dispersed into the southern continent. As such, the study of these rare remains illustrates that we are probably still underestimating the biological diversity of early Americans.",The authors received no specific funding for this work.,The authors received no specific funding for this work.,PLOS ONE,,Michael D.

IoT networks have evolved around the wireless sensor network (WSN), and the following research looks at relevant IoT concepts and the different security issues that occur specifically at the network layer. This analysis is performed using a structured literature review (SLR). This form of bibliographic review has been a trend in recent years. Its strength is the performance of a bibliometric analysis that allows studying both trends in the line of research that you want to address and the relevant authors. This SLR reviews 53 proposals between 2011 and 2020, whose contribution is to mitigate attacks in the RPL (Routing Protocol for Low-Power and Lossy Networks) protocol. The revised proposals emerged after selecting keywords and databases in which to apply the search. Initially, approximately 380 research works appeared, for which it was necessary to continue using filters to refine the proposals to be included. After reading titles and abstracts, 53 papers were finally selected. In addition to analyzing the attacks mitigated in the RPL protocol, it is intended to identify the trend by which these attacks are reduced, as a result of the review, nine attacks have been found: rank, blackhole, selective forwarding, wormhole, DODAG (Destination-Oriented Directed Acyclic Graph) version number, DAO (Destination Advertisement Object) inconsistency, DIO (DODAG Information Object) suppression, Sybil, and sinkhole. Each of the 53 proposals analyzed in this review has an associated mitigation strategy, these strategies have been categorized into four groups, based on authentication or cryptography, based on network monitoring, based on secure parent node selection and other. According to the results, the authors’ primary mitigation strategy is based on network monitoring, with 30%.

The aim of this study is to analyze the relationship between burnout, engagement, and goal orientation in a sample of teachers from different educational stages. The sample comprised 576 teachers from different schools, both male (N = 244; 42.36%) and female (N = 332; 57.63%) aged between 21 and 65 years (M = 38.55; DT = 12.15). The instruments used were the Maslach Burnout Inventory–General Survey (MBI-GS), the Work Engagement Scale (UWES) and the Perception of Success Questionnaire (POSQ). The results revealed that task orientation presents a significant correlation with engagement and self-efficacy, and negative correlation with burnout, in line with adaptive behaviors, and that ego orientation is correlated with engagement and commitment. It is concluded that both forms of goal orientation have a positive effect on teacher commitment and that they help to prevent burnout syndrome and also that self-efficacy plays a role in determining goal orientation in teachers in their work assignments.",,"This study was performed by Research Group OPIICS (S46_20R), University of Zaragoza (Zaragoza, Spain) and was supported by research funds provided by the Department of Science and Technology of the Government of Aragón (Spain) and the European Social Fund.",Sustainability,,,,2020-08-24,2020,2020-08-24,,12,17,6882,All OA; Gold,Article,"Supervía, Pablo Usán; Bordás, Carlos Salavera","Supervía, Pablo Usán (Departament of Psychology, Faculty of Education, University of Zaragoza, 50009 Zaragoza, Spain;, pusan@unizar.es; OPIICS Research Group, University of Zaragoza, 50009 Zaragoza, Spain); Bordás, Carlos Salavera (Departament of Psychology, Faculty of Education, University of Zaragoza, 50009 Zaragoza, Spain;, pusan@unizar.es; OPIICS Research Group, University of Zaragoza, 50009 Zaragoza, Spain)","Bordás, Carlos Salavera (University of Zaragoza; University of Zaragoza)","Supervía, Pablo Usán (University of Zaragoza; University of Zaragoza); Bordás, Carlos Salavera (University of Zaragoza; University of Zaragoza)",11,8,,7.36,https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/12/17/6882/pdf?version=1598344857,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1130354231,39 Education; 3901 Curriculum and Pedagogy,

With this work it is intended to establish the background of the instrumentation and control methods of automatic wheelchairs and prototypes, as well as a classification in each category. To this end a search of specialised databases was carried out for articles published between 2012 and 2019. Out of these, 97 documents were selected based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria. The following categories were proposed for these articles: (a) wheelchair instrumentation and control methods, among which there are systems that implement micro-electromechanical sensors (MEMS), surface electromyography (sEMG), electrooculography (EOG), electroencephalography (EEG), and voice recognition systems; (b) wheelchair instrumentation, among which are found obstacle detection systems, artificial vision (image and video), as well as navigation systems (GPS and GSM). The results found in this review tend towards the use of EEG signals, head movements, voice commands, and algorithms to avoid obstacles. The most used techniques involve the use of a classic control and thresholding to move the wheelchair. In addition, the discussion was mainly based on the characteristics of the user and the types of control.

Mental health problems in youth often continue into adulthood if not diagnosed or treated in time.MethodsThe Sistema de Evaluación de Niños y Adolescentes (SENA) [Child and Adolescent Evaluation System] was used to evaluate mental health indicators in a sample of students in Northern Chile. Two age-appropriate versions of the assessment were applied to a total sample of 5043 students, which included an elementary education sample of 1953 schoolchildren from fourth grade through sixth grade (ages 8 to 13 years), and a Secondary School sample of 3090 schoolchildren from seventh grade (the last year of elementary school) through the last year of Secondary school (senior high school) (ages 12 to 19 years). For each group, the version of the assessment used was determined by the students’ grade level. Both samples included municipal, government-subsidized, and private schools.ResultsIn this student population, depression, anxiety, and behavioral disorders were the main mental health problems identified, and indicators revealed a progressive increase in cases over the years, coinciding with the global epidemiological scenario. Males showed a greater presence of externalizing behaviors related to mental health problems associated with aggression and defiant behavior. However, females showed the highest number of mental health issues overall, especially regarding problems related to internalization. There are significant differences between school types.ConclusionsOur sample population analysis indicates that early intervention is necessary for the diagnosis and treatment of youth, with the goal of reducing the probability that psychiatric disorders will be prolonged, evolving, and worsening in adulthood.","We kindly acknowledge all the children and adolescents, parents, teachers and schools that participated in this study.",This research was funded by ANID PIA CIE160007.

In addition, a snowball strategy was used. Literature reviews (LRs) of experimental and quasi-experimental studies were included. The identified interventions and outcomes were categorized based on the recommendation by the Cochrane group in “Effective Practice and Organization of Care”. The quality of the included LRs was evaluated using the AMSTAR 2 tool.ResultsFour thousand ninety-five articles were identified, of which 97 were included in the synthesis of evidence. Most of the studies included focused on the general population, vulnerable populations and minority populations. The subjects of general health and healthy lifestyles were the most commonly addressed. According to the classification of the type of intervention, the domain covered most was the delivery arrangements, followed by the domain of implementation strategies. The most frequent group of outcomes was the reported outcome in (clinical) patients, followed by social outcomes.ConclusionThe strategies that facilitate the reduction of health inequalities must be intersectoral and multidisciplinary in nature, including all sectors of the health system. It is essential to continue generating interventions focused on strengthening health systems in order to achieve adequate universal health coverage, with a process of comprehensive and quality care.",Not applicable.,FundingPan American Health Organization.

225,pub.1126577383,10.3390/w12041071,,,Characterizing the Water Storage Capacity and Hydrological Role of Mountain Peatlands in the Arid Andes of North-Central Chile,"High-altitude peatlands in the Andes, i.e., bofedales, play an essential role in alpine ecosystems, regulating the local water balance and supporting biodiversity. This is particularly true in semiarid Chile, where bofedales develop near the altitudinal and hydrological limits of plant life. The subterranean geometry and stratigraphy of one peatland was characterized in north-central Chile using Electrical Resistivity Tomography (ERT), Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) and core extraction. Two sounding locations, two transversal and one longitudinal profile allowed a 3D interpretation of the bofedal’s internal structure. A conceptual model of the current bofedal system is proposed. Geophysical results combined with porosity measurements were used to estimate the bofedal water storage capacity. Using hydrological data at the watershed scale, implications regarding the hydrological role of bofedales in the semiarid Andes were then briefly assessed. At the catchment scale, bofedal water storage capacity, evapotranspiration losses and annual streamflow are on the same order of magnitude. High-altitude peatlands are therefore storing a significant amount of water and their impact on basin hydrology should be investigated further.","The authors would like to thank the CEAZAMET and the Dirección General Del Agua for the data availability as well as Franco Cuevas, Paola Araya and Mauricio Gomez who helped with the field data collection.

Methods: We compared the cognitive performance of 187 elderly subjects who were illiterate (controls n = 60; MCI n = 64; dementia n = 63). Neuropsychological measures included the RUDAS-PE, Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), INECO Frontal Screening (IFS), and Pfeffer Functional Activities Questionnaire (PFAQ). The results were compared to a neuropsychological evaluation (gold standard), including use of Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) scores. Results: We found a Cronbach's alpha was 0.65; Spearman's correlation coefficient was 0.79 (p < 0.01). The area under the receiver operating characteristics curve for the RUDAS to discriminate dementia from MCI was 98.0% with an optimal cut-off <19 (sensitivity 95%, specificity 97%); whereas, to differentiate MCI and controls was 98.0% with an optimal cut-off <23 (sensitivity 89%, specificity 93%).

These changes, produced by technological context and more controls (e.g., environmental controls), are also becoming visible in Chilean mining. New regulations from the Chilean government and changes in the copper mining industry (such as a trend to underground mining) are fostering the search for better results in typical processes such as leaching. This paper describes an experience using artificial intelligence techniques, particularly random forest, to develop predictive models for copper recovery by leaching, using data from an enterprise present in northern Chile for more than 20 years. Two models, one of them with actual operational data and another one with data generated in a controlled environment (piling) are presented. Well-classified values of 98.90% for operational data and 98.72% for pile/piling data were obtained. The methodology devised for the study can be transferred to piling columns or piles with other characteristics, though the operation must focus on copper leaching. It can even be transferred to other leaching processes using another type of mineral, with proper adjustments.","The authors thank the SCM Franke company for the material support provided and their collaboration to this study, particularly their support for obtaining and storing data from the copper production process using the leaching method, as well as data from the pilot plant (column simulation) and their experience to select the parameters and criteria used for generating predictive models, and are thankful for the financial support provided by Universidad Católica del Norte.",,Journal of Sensors,,,,2020-02-07,2020,,2020-02-07,2020,,1-12,All OA; Gold,Article,"Flores, Victor; Keith, Brian; Leiva, Claudio","Flores, Victor (Department of Computing & Systems Engineering, Universidad Católica del Norte, 1270709 Antofagasta, Chile); Keith, Brian (Department of Computing & Systems Engineering, Universidad Católica del Norte, 1270709 Antofagasta, Chile); Leiva, Claudio (Department of Chemical Engineering, Universidad Católica del Norte, 1270709 Antofagasta, Chile)","Flores, Victor (Catholic University of the North)","Flores, Victor (Catholic University of the North); Keith, Brian (Catholic University of the North); Leiva, Claudio (Catholic University of the North)",33,15,,6.71,https://downloads.hindawi.com/journals/js/2020/2454875.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1124665775,40 Engineering; 4019 Resources Engineering and Extractive Metallurgy,

The forensic analysis of digital videos becomes very relevant to determine the origin and authenticity of a video in order to link an individual with a device, place or event. The field of forensic analysis of digital videos is constantly facing new and direct challenges. Even though the basic principles of this discipline remain unchanged, numerous issues appear every year that require new procedures and tools. Therefore, it is necessary to provide forensic analysts with techniques to identify the origin of multimedia content. In this paper, the topic of source identification in open scenarios will be discussed, since analysts do not know in advance the set of cameras to which a video belongs so they find it difficult to identify its source. This approach is similar to real-life situations since in most cases, analysts are unaware of the set of video cameras.

The contribution of an individual extreme storm event to long-term erosion rates has been estimated for the first time in the Atacama Desert. A mean erosion of 1.3 mm has been calculated for the March 2015 event that impacted the southernmost part of the Atacama Desert. The estimated erosion is consistent with millennial erosion rates and the previously reported return times of high-sediment-discharge events in the study area. This is significant because erosion rates, related to events of high sediment discharge in arid fluvial systems, are difficult to measure with sediment loading due to destruction of gauges by devastating flash floods and therefore have not been directly measured yet. During the March 2015 storm, debris flows were reported as the main sediment transport process, while gullies and channels erosion were the main source of sediments that generated debris flows reaching the tributary junctions and the trunk valleys. Sediment yield at tributary outlets is highly dependent on the ability of catchments to store sediments in stream networks between storms. The largest tributary catchments, the high hydrological hierarchy, the low topographic gradient and the gentle slopes are the most determining factors in generating debris flows capable of reaching alluvial fans in any storm event from large sediment volumes stored in the stream networks. Our findings better assess the susceptibility to debris flow of arid catchments, which is significant for the southernmost valleys of the Atacama Desert because human settlements and industries are mostly established in alluvial fans.","This work is based on the undergraduate thesis of Víctor Fredes and is part of the PhD thesis of Albert Cabré.

203,pub.1128586436,10.3389/fmars.2020.00461,,,The Origin and Correlated Evolution of Symbiosis and Coloniality in Scleractinian Corals,"Symbiosis and coloniality are ecologically important traits for corals of the order Scleractinia. Symbiotic (zooxanthellate) species are highly successful in shallow waters of tropical and subtropical seas and most of them are colonial. On the other hand, azooxanthellate species present wide distribution ranges and expand to the deep-sea at more than 6,000 m depth. These are mostly solitary, with only few species colonial that form extensive deep reefs. Each ecologically distinctive group encompasses half of the biodiversity of the order and they are not grouped into differentiated monophyletic clades. Paleontologists and evolutionary biologists have debated for decades whether modern scleractinian corals have evolved from symbiotic or colonial ancestors and how these traits have evolved and being involved in the diversification process in corals. Previous comparative analyses throw evidence in favor of coevolution of these characters and toward repetitive loss of symbiosis and coloniality. Nevertheless, the discovery of the origin of the group deep in the Paleozoic, with a deep divergent clade composed of only azooxanthellate corals has questioned these findings. With this work, we disentangle the patterns in the evolution of symbiosis and coloniality, testing if they are correlated and if they follow a gradual or episodic mode of evolution. To this end, we first produce the most complete time-calibrated phylogenetic tree for the order Scleractinia, including new sequences of never-before sampled species and genera. These novel sequences contribute to alleviate the current molecular under sampling of azooxanthellate species. Incorporating phylogenetic uncertainty, we obtained strong evidence in favor of a correlated and episodic model of evolution. This model led to the inference of an azooxanthellate and solitary most recent ancestor of scleractinians. Transition rates between the four different combinations of the two traits showed that while coloniality is gained and lost multiple times, symbiosis first appears around 282 Ma and is never lost. Also, coloniality seems to have appeared before symbiosis in azooxanthellate lineages. Thus, azooxanthellate corals, and especially colonial lineages, have been acting as a source of biodiversity for shallow zooxanthellate coral communities, highlighting the uniqueness of shallow and deep species and the need to preserve them.","We thank D.

A vibrating piezoelectric device (PD) generates alternating current (AC), which needs to be converted into direct current (DC) for powering electronic devices or for storage. A traditional full-wave bridge rectifier (FBR) interface circuit serves this purpose, but it suffers from high power loss due to the presence of high forward voltage across the diodes. In this article, an improved H-Bridge rectifier circuit is proposed as the AC-DC rectifier circuit to reduce power loss for high frequency and low amplitude application. The performance of the proposed rectifier circuit was experimentally studied, analysed and discussed. Two different testing scenarios for high frequency, namely, varying input power with fixed excitation frequency and varying excitation frequency with fixed input voltage were considered. Applicability of the circuit at low frequency range was also investigated. The outcome shows that the proposed circuit notably increases the voltage and the power produced from the PD when compared to traditional FBR circuits.",The work of Mahesh Edla was supported by Southern Cross University.,,IEEE Journal of the Electron Devices Society,,,,2020-01-01,2020,2020-09-21,2020-01-01,8,,1050-1062,All OA; Gold,Article,"Edla, Mahesh; Lim, Yee Yan; Deguchi, Mikio; Padilla, Ricardo Vasquez; Izadgoshasb, Iman","Edla, Mahesh (School of Environmental Science and Engineering, Southern Cross University, Lismore, NSW, 2480, Australia); Lim, Yee Yan (School of Environmental Science and Engineering, Southern Cross University, Lismore, NSW, 2480, Australia); Deguchi, Mikio (Department of Environmental Materials Engineering, National Institute of Technology, Niihama College, Ehime, 792-8580, Japan); Padilla, Ricardo Vasquez (School of Environmental Science and Engineering, Southern Cross University, Lismore, NSW, 2480, Australia); Izadgoshasb, Iman (School of Environmental Science and Engineering, Southern Cross University, Lismore, NSW, 2480, Australia)","Edla, Mahesh (Southern Cross University)","Edla, Mahesh (Southern Cross University); Lim, Yee Yan (Southern Cross University); Deguchi, Mikio (National Institute of Technology); Padilla, Ricardo Vasquez (Southern Cross University); Izadgoshasb, Iman (Southern Cross University)",25,9,,6.51,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/ielx7/6245494/8949832/09201538.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1131079910,"40 Engineering; 4008 Electrical Engineering; 4009 Electronics, Sensors and Digital Hardware",7 Affordable and Clean Energy

This tendency promotes sustainability, but its use depends mainly on the final product's properties, such as chemical stability. This study evaluates the physical and chemical properties of RCAs from two different sources in comparison with the performance of NA. One RCA was obtained from the demolition of a building (recycled concrete aggregate of a building-RCAB) and another RCA from the rehabilitation of a Portland cement concrete pavement (recycled concrete aggregate from a pavement-RCAP). Characterization techniques such as X-ray fluorescence (XRF), X-ray diffraction (XRD), UV spectroscopy, and atomic absorption spectrometry were used to evaluate the RCAs' coarse fractions for chemical potential effects on asphalt mixtures. NA was replaced with RCA at 15%, 30%, and 45% for each size of the coarse fractions (retained 19.0, 12.5, 9.5, and 4.75 sieves in mm). The mineralogical characterization results indicated the presence of quartz (SiO2) and calcite (CaCO3) as the most significant constituents of the aggregates. XFR showed that RCAs have lower levels of CaO and Al2O3 concerning NA. Potential reactions in asphalt mixtures by nitration, sulfonation, amination of organic compounds, and reactions by alkaline activation in the aggregates were discarded due to the minimum concentration of components such as NO2, (-SO3H), (-SO2Cl), and (Na) in the aggregates. Finally, this research concludes that studied RCAs might be used as replacements of coarse aggregate in asphalt mixtures since chemical properties do not affect the overall chemical stability of the asphalt mixture.","The authors thank the Universidad del Norte for sponsoring this research, and the Universidad Distrital Francisco José de Caldas.

This study aims to evaluate the mechanical properties resulting from the making of Portland cement mixtures with tailings as aggregates so that they can be eventually used in paving stones for building inactive tailings dams. Tailings coming from two dams at a concentration plant located in Taltal (Chile) were used. Currently, Dam 1 is inactive, while Dam 2 is active. The tailings samples obtained from both dams were granulometrically characterized by sieving. In addition, pH, humidity, Eh, and mineralogical assays (sulfides, oxides, sulfates, carbonates, phosphates, and silicates) were measured. The fines content of the tailings from Dams 1 and 2 with a sieve size of N°200 ASTM were 76.2% and 29.6%, respectively. Therefore, owing to their high percentage of fines, they cannot be as used as concrete aggregates. Aggregates must contain a maximum percentage of fines so that mortars and concrete can meet Chilean standards. In this paper, to comply with a 7% and 15% fines content lower than 0.075 mm, tailings materials were mixed with conventional aggregates containing very little fines. In addition, a reference mixture was made with only tailings aggregates with and without a superplasticizer additive. To measure the mixtures of cement, aggregates, and tailings, bending and compression strength assays were made of the specimens after a 28-day curing, according to the Chilean standard. The results of the study show that the addition of only part of the tailings to the mixture increases bending strength by 26% and compression strength by 180% compared with the reference mortar, with a fines content lower than 0.075 mm in the 7% mixture, thus allowing paving stone manufacture with tailings materials. In addition, it was possible to increase the workability of the reference mixture by using superplasticizers as additives.","The authors are thankful to “Rapid Implementation Projects-Pilot Scaling”, Universidad Católica del Norte, Engineering Project 2030, 16ENl2-71940, for the financial support of this project.","This research was funded by “Rapid Implementation Projects-Pilot Scaling”, Universidad Católica del Norte, Engineering Project 2030, 16ENl2-71940.",International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health,,,Chile; Construction Materials; Copper; Mining; Sulfides,2020-04-01,2020,2020-04-03,2020-04-01,17,7,2448,All OA; Gold,Article,"Lam, Elizabeth J.; Zetola, Vicente; Ramírez, Yendery; Montofré, Ítalo L.; Pereira, Franco","Lam, Elizabeth J.

New, improved therapies are needed. Herein, we create a next generation anti-apicomplexan lead compound, JAG21, a tetrahydroquinolone, with increased sp3-character to improve parasite selectivity. Relative to other cytochrome b inhibitors, JAG21 has improved solubility and ADMET properties, without need for pro-drug. JAG21 significantly reduces Toxoplasma gondii tachyzoites and encysted bradyzoites in vitro, and in primary and established chronic murine infections. Moreover, JAG21 treatment leads to 100% survival. Further, JAG21 is efficacious against drug-resistant Plasmodium falciparum in vitro. Causal prophylaxis and radical cure are achieved after P. berghei sporozoite infection with oral administration of a single dose (2.5 mg/kg) or 3 days treatment at reduced dose (0.625 mg/kg/day), eliminating parasitemia, and leading to 100% survival. Enzymatic, binding, and co-crystallography/pharmacophore studies demonstrate selectivity for apicomplexan relative to mammalian enzymes. JAG21 has significant promise as a pre-clinical candidate for prevention, treatment, and cure of toxoplasmosis and malaria.","We thank and gratefully also acknowledge the support of the Cornwell Mann family, the Rodriguez, Musillami, Quinn, Rosenthal, Greenberg, Morel, Rooney and Engel families, Taking out Toxo, and The Toxoplasmosis Research Institute.

The datasets have been developed to simultaneously solve a staffing and tour scheduling problem that incorporates flexible contracts and multiskilled staff. This Data in Brief article is related to the published article ""Hybrid flexibility strategy on personnel scheduling: Retail case study"" [1]. The datasets contain real, processed, and simulated data. Regarding the real and processed datasets, they are presented for three different store sizes (4, 5 or 6 departments). Real datasets include information about the employment-contract characteristics, cost parameters, and a forecast of the number of employees required in each department for each day of the week and each time period into which the operating day is divided. As regards the data processed for the case study, they include the set of skill sets considering that the employees can be trained in a maximum of two store departments. Regarding the simulated datasets, they include information about the random parameter of staff demand in each store department. The simulated data are presented in 90 text files classified by: (i) Store size (4, 5 or 6 departments). (ii) Coefficient of variation (10, 20, 30%). (iii) Instance identification number (10 instances per scenario that resulted from combining the store sizes and coefficients of variation). Researchers can use the datasets for benchmarking the performance of different approaches with the one presented by Porto et al. [1], and in consequence, they can find solutions to the same (or similar) type of personnel scheduling problem. The dataset includes an Excel workbook that can be used to randomly generate staff demand instances according to a chosen coefficient of variation.","This research was supported by “Fundación para la Promoción de la Investigación y la Tecnología (FPIT)” under Grants 4.254 and 4.523 and Universidad del Norte under Grant 2017–13.

The differences of groups were contrasted through the Student's t-test. Moreover, the relation between variables was determined from the Spearman correlation coefficient, ρ [rho]. As instruments for the collection of information, both the Halpern HCTAES test and the need for cognition test were used, with measurement in two moments: one before the experimental treatment—pre-test—and the other one once the training program in naturalist intelligence finished—post-test. The intervention adopted as a pedagogical approach was the problematic teaching proposed by Majmutov. The results show changes in both the experimental and the control groups.

Aim: To explore the value addition and role of business incubators to assist entrepreneurs to grow their businesses to enable them to become entrepreneurial leaders. Setting: State of SMEs; Business incubators; the development of entrepreneurs in South Africa. Method: A literature survey regarding the nature of business incubators was conducted, making use of a convenience sample comprising a pre-published list of 58 business incubators. Results: Business incubators see themselves in a position of strength and are not in a true partnership with the incubatee. Most business incubators only support Broad Based Black Economic Empowerment candidates, ignoring the needs and value-add of a diverse SME population. Findings highlighted the conflicting information about the state of SMEs in South Africa, thereby calling for policies to clearly and uniformly report reliable statistics on the status of SMEs to enable more focussed support for SMEs. Conclusions: Business incubators must clearly conceptualise their own business operating model and articulate their value-add to prospective emerging entrepreneurs. Post COVID-19 it is essential to fast tract the sustainability of SMEs and role clarification and differentiating are two important factors that need to be taken into consideration by both business incubators and entrepreneurs to ensure focussed support and allocation of public and private funding.",,,The Southern African Journal of Entrepreneurship and Small Business Management,,,,2020-08-25,2020,2020-08-25,,12,1,9,All OA; Gold,Article,"Hewitt, Lia M.M.; van Rensburg, Lodewikus J.

Naturalistic driving studies (NDS) emerged as one of the most sophisticated methodologies to investigate driver behavior; however, NDS have not been implemented in low- or middle-income countries. The aim of this research is to investigate MPU while driving and compare the results to those reported in international studies. An analysis of 61.32 h and 1350 km driven in Curitiba (Brazil) showed that MPU lasted for an average of 28.51 s (n = 627) and occurred in 58.71% of trips (n = 201) with an average frequency of 8.37 interactions per hour (n = 201). The proportion of the trip time using a mobile phone was 7.03% (n = 201), and the average instantaneous speed was 12.77 km/h (n = 627) while using the phone. Generally, drivers spent less time on more complex interactions and selected a lower speed when using the phone. MPU was observed more during short duration than longer trips. Drivers in this study engaged in a larger number of MPU compared to drivers from Netherlands and the United States; and the percentage of trip time with MPU was between North American and European values.","The authors would like to thank the video monitoring team for the detailed information provided, Magaly Natália Pazzian Vasconcellos Romão for leading the focus group session and Anabela dos Santos Aleixo Simões for the participation during the research project conception.","This research was funded by the National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq, Brazil)/MCTIC/CNPq N°. 28/2018, Universal/Faixa A, by the Coordination for the Improvement of Higher Education Personnel (CAPES)/Finance Code 001 and by the National Observatory for Road Safety (ONSV) under the Technical Cooperation Agreement with the Federal University of Parana.

It is usually determined in the laboratory through a few statistically representative numbers of specimens, with a recommended minimum of five. The UCS can also be estimated from rock index properties, such as the effective porosity, density, and P-wave velocity. In the case of a porous rock such as travertine, the random distribution of voids inside the test specimen (not detectable in the density-porosity test, but in the compressive strength test) causes large variations on the UCS value, which were found in the range of 62 MPa for this rock. This fact complicates a sufficiently accurate determination of experimental results, also affecting the estimations based on regression analyses. Aiming to solve this problem, statistical analysis, and machine learning models (artificial neural network) was developed to generate a reliable predictive model, through which the best results for a multiple regression model between uniaxial compressive strength (UCS), P-wave velocity and porosity were obtained.","The authors want to acknowledge Izabott Erazo, Carlos Ampuero and Omar González for their contribution in helping to perform the laboratory tests.

The method to be used is bibliographic, exploratory, analytical, and experimental, considering the indicators of the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI). The results show a lack of commitment from the analyzed higher education institutions when preparing accountability reports in terms of sustainability criteria. Additionally, the category in which each university is placed does not guarantee effective disclosure of information to the point that some category B universities have a higher percentage of revealed data than their A category peers. Similarly, the results also suggest proposing plans of action for policymakers to create standards for socially responsible annual reports to respond to the “triple bottom line” criteria approach, as well as establishing guidelines for the correct dissemination and disclosure of information.

impact on sea ice at the western Antarctic Peninsula (WAP), an area rapidly
transforming under global warming. To study the development of spring sea
ice and environmental conditions in the pre-satellite era we investigated
three short marine sediment cores for their biomarker inventory with a
particular focus on the sea ice proxy IPSO25 and micropaleontological
proxies. The core sites are located in the Bransfield Strait in shelf to
deep basin areas characterized by a complex oceanographic frontal system,
coastal influence and sensitivity to large-scale atmospheric circulation
patterns. We analyzed geochemical bulk parameters, biomarkers (highly
branched isoprenoids, glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraethers, sterols), and diatom abundances and diversity over the past 240 years and
compared them to observational data, sedimentary and ice core climate
archives, and results from numerical models. Based on biomarker
results we identified four different environmental units characterized by
(A) low sea ice cover and high ocean temperatures, (B) moderate sea ice
cover with decreasing ocean temperatures, (C) high but variable sea ice
cover during intervals of lower ocean temperatures, and (D) extended sea ice
cover coincident with a rapid ocean warming. While IPSO25
concentrations correspond quite well to satellite sea ice observations for
the past 40 years, we note discrepancies between the biomarker-based sea ice
estimates, the long-term model output for the past 240 years, ice core
records, and reconstructed atmospheric circulation patterns such as the El
Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and Southern Annular Mode (SAM). We
propose that the sea ice biomarker proxies IPSO25 and PIPSO25 are
not linearly related to sea ice cover, and, additionally, each core site
reflects specific local environmental conditions. High IPSO25 and
PIPSO25 values may not be directly interpreted as referring to high
spring sea ice cover because variable sea ice conditions and enhanced
nutrient supply may affect the production of both the sea-ice-associated and
phytoplankton-derived (open marine, pelagic) biomarker lipids. For future
interpretations we recommend carefully considering individual biomarker
records to distinguish between cold sea-ice-favoring and warm sea-ice-diminishing environmental conditions.","We thank the captain, crew and chief scientist, Frank Lamy, of RV Polarstern cruise PS97.

The main route of treatment is through pyrometallurgical processes, but these emit significant quantities of SO2 into the atmosphere (e.g. 182,000 t/year among all Chilean smelters), producing mighty concern in the community. In this context, hydrometallurgy is presented as an alternative that may be more environmentally friendly; however, the difficulties of processing sulphide minerals prevent achieving sustainable efficiencies for the industry. In this research, a pure chalcopyrite mineral is leached at 25°C with the addition of manganese nodules as an oxidizing agent, and wastewater with a high concentration of chloride that both enhances the dissolution and avoid the passivation of the chalcopyrite. The high concentrations of MnO2 (4/1 and 5/1) allows that the potential values can be between 580 and 650 mV, which favors the dissolution of CuFeS2. The XRD showed the formation of non-polluting species and, besides, they do not cause obstacles to the copper dissolution. High concentrations of chloride enable increasing copper solutions from CuFeS2, attaining favorable outcomes when working with wastewater instead of seawater.","The authors are grateful for the contribution of the Scientific Equipment Unit- MAINI of the Universidad Católica del Norte for aiding in generating data by automated electronic microscopy QEMSCAN® and for facilitating the chemical analysis of the solutions.

An ancient DNA study,"The southern boundary of prehispanic farming in South America occurs in central Mendoza Province, Argentina at approximately 34 degrees south latitude. Archaeological evidence of farming includes the recovery of macrobotanical remains of cultigens and isotopic chemistry of human bone. Since the 1990s, archaeologists have also hypothesized that the llama (Lama glama), a domesticated South American camelid, was also herded near the southern boundary of prehispanic farming. The remains of a wild congeneric camelid, the guanaco (Lama guanicoe), however, are common in archaeological sites throughout Mendoza Province. It is difficult to distinguish bones of the domestic llama from wild guanaco in terms of osteological morphology, and therefore, claims that llama were in geographic areas where guanaco were also present based on osteometric analysis alone remain equivocal. A recent study, for example, claimed that twenty-five percent of the camelid remains from the high elevation Andes site of Laguna del Diamante S4 were identified based on osteometric evidence as domestic llama, but guanaco are also a likely candidate since the two species overlap in size. We test the hypothesis that domesticated camelids occurred in prehispanic, southern Mendoza through analysis of ancient DNA. We generated whole mitochondrial genome datasets from 41 samples from southern Mendoza late Holocene archaeological sites, located between 450 and 3400 meters above sea level (masl). All camelid samples from those sites were identified as guanaco; thus, we have no evidence to support the hypothesis that the domestic llama occurred in prehispanic southern Mendoza.","This work was supported by United States National Science Foundation Grant number 1630051 (Principal Investigator – SW; Co-Principal Investigator – JJ; Co-Principal Investigator – LN) and Agencia Nacional de Promotion Cientifica PICT 2013-0881.

These studies, coming from different lines of research, have proposed diverse explanatory mechanisms to explain the positive social and psychological effects of collective gatherings. In the present article, we focus on one of these mechanisms, known as collective effervescence, emotional communion, emotional entrainment, or perceived emotional synchrony (PES). First, we briefly discuss current conceptions of the emotional states and experience during collective gatherings and what they bring to the definition of PES. We close this point by proposing an integrative definition of PES. Second, structural validity of the original PES scale is examined.

Today, the majority of the population owns state-of-the-art cameras integrated into their mobile devices. Technological development not only facilitates the generation of multimedia content, but also the intentional manipulation of it, and this is where forensic techniques of detecting manipulation on images and videos take on great importance. Although historically there has been confidence in the integrity of images, the advance of technology has begun to erode this confidence. This work proposes a digital image authentication method based on the quadratic mean error of the Color Filter Array interpolation pattern estimated from the analysed image. For the evaluation of the proposed method, experiments were carried out with public databases of forged images that are widely developed for research purposes. The results of the experiments demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed method.",This was supported in part by the European Union’s Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Programme under Grant 700326.,,IEEE Access,,,,2020-01-01,2020,2020-01-06,2020-01-01,8,,11815-11823,All OA; Gold,Article,"Vega, Esteban Alejandro Armas; Fernández, Edgar González; Orozco, Ana Lucila Sandoval; Villalba, Luis Javier García","Vega, Esteban Alejandro Armas (Group of Analysis, Security and Systems (GASS), Department of Software Engineering and Artificial Intelligence (DISIA), Faculty of Computer Science and Engineering, Office 431, Universidad Complutense de Madrid (UCM), 28040, Madrid, Spain); Fernández, Edgar González (Group of Analysis, Security and Systems (GASS), Department of Software Engineering and Artificial Intelligence (DISIA), Faculty of Computer Science and Engineering, Office 431, Universidad Complutense de Madrid (UCM), 28040, Madrid, Spain); Orozco, Ana Lucila Sandoval (Group of Analysis, Security and Systems (GASS), Department of Software Engineering and Artificial Intelligence (DISIA), Faculty of Computer Science and Engineering, Office 431, Universidad Complutense de Madrid (UCM), 28040, Madrid, Spain); Villalba, Luis Javier García (Group of Analysis, Security and Systems (GASS), Department of Software Engineering and Artificial Intelligence (DISIA), Faculty of Computer Science and Engineering, Office 431, Universidad Complutense de Madrid (UCM), 28040, Madrid, Spain)","Orozco, Ana Lucila Sandoval (Complutense University of Madrid)","Vega, Esteban Alejandro Armas (Complutense University of Madrid); Fernández, Edgar González (Complutense University of Madrid); Orozco, Ana Lucila Sandoval (Complutense University of Madrid); Villalba, Luis Javier García (Complutense University of Madrid)",18,11,,5.69,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/ielx7/6287639/8948470/08950395.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1123835461,40 Engineering; 4006 Communications Engineering; 46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4603 Computer Vision and Multimedia Computation,

Even though the terms sex and gender are often used in a binary way, there is considerable diversity in the way individuals and groups understand, experiment and express them. This narrative review describes some relevant aspects of the subjective difference that exists and favors men over women in the fields of sciences and research, starting from a historical perspective in the light of feminist movements. In particular, women are described as researchers - crea-tors of scientific knowledge, as well as the subjects of analysis. Some conflicts arising from sex bias, applied to biomedical research, are also analyzed, and cases are delivered that exemplify the disarray that has historically accompanied the female gender in this area, its ignorance and little cultural recognition.

This situation does not favor effective treatment and prevention of diseases for the population, due to potential information loss, misinformation, or data leaks related to a patient, which in turn may imply a direct risk for the individual and high public health costs for governments. One of the proposed solutions to this problem has been the creation of electronic medical record (EMR) systems using blockchain networks; however, most of them do not take into account the occurrence of connectivity failures, such as those found in various developing countries, which can lead to failures in the integrity of the system data. To address these problems, HealthyBlock is presented in this paper as an architecture based on blockchain networks, which proposes a unified electronic medical record system that considers different clinical providers, with resilience in data integrity during connectivity failure and with usability, security, and privacy characteristics. On the basis of the HealthyBlock architecture, a prototype was implemented for the care of patients in a network of hospitals. The results of the evaluation showed high efficiency in keeping the EMRs of patients unified, updated, and secure, regardless of the network clinical provider they consult.",The authors thank the Research Group for Computer Networks and Software Engineering-GReCIS from Universidad del Norte for its support.,"This research was funded by the National Program for Doctoral Formation, COLCIENCIAS, Grant number 463–2014.",International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health,,,Blockchain; Computer Security; Confidentiality; Electronic Health Records; Health Information Interoperability; Humans; Information Dissemination; Privacy,2020-09-29,2020,2020-09-29,2020-10-01,17,19,7132,All OA; Gold,Article,"Gutiérrez, Omar; Romero, Giordy; Pérez, Luis; Salazar, Augusto; Charris, Marina; Wightman, Pedro","Gutiérrez, Omar (Department of Systems Engineering, University of the North, Barranquilla 081007, Colombia;, giordyr@uninorte.edu.co, (G.R.);, lalinares@uninorte.edu.co, (L.P.);, augustosalazar@uninorte.edu.co, (A.S.); CNCA Research Group, The National Training Service (Servicio Nacional de Aprendizaje—SENA), Barranquilla 080005, Colombia); Romero, Giordy (Department of Systems Engineering, University of the North, Barranquilla 081007, Colombia;, giordyr@uninorte.edu.co, (G.R.);, lalinares@uninorte.edu.co, (L.P.);, augustosalazar@uninorte.edu.co, (A.S.)); Pérez, Luis (Department of Systems Engineering, University of the North, Barranquilla 081007, Colombia;, giordyr@uninorte.edu.co, (G.R.);, lalinares@uninorte.edu.co, (L.P.);, augustosalazar@uninorte.edu.co, (A.S.)); Salazar, Augusto (Department of Systems Engineering, University of the North, Barranquilla 081007, Colombia;, giordyr@uninorte.edu.co, (G.R.);, lalinares@uninorte.edu.co, (L.P.);, augustosalazar@uninorte.edu.co, (A.S.)); Charris, Marina (Department of Research in Telematics and Telecommunications, LS Information Technology Consulting (LS Asesorías TI), Barranquilla 080020, Colombia;, marinacharris@lsasesoriasti.com); Wightman, Pedro (Department of Systems Engineering, University of the North, Barranquilla 081007, Colombia;, giordyr@uninorte.edu.co, (G.R.);, lalinares@uninorte.edu.co, (L.P.);, augustosalazar@uninorte.edu.co, (A.S.))","Gutiérrez, Omar (Universidad del Norte; Department of Systems Engineering, University of the North, Barranquilla 081007, Colombia;, giordyr@uninorte.edu.co, (G.R.);, lalinares@uninorte.edu.co, (L.P.);, augustosalazar@uninorte.edu.co, (A.S.); National Training Service); Wightman, Pedro (Universidad del Norte; Department of Systems Engineering, University of the North, Barranquilla 081007, Colombia;, giordyr@uninorte.edu.co, (G.R.);, lalinares@uninorte.edu.co, (L.P.);, augustosalazar@uninorte.edu.co, (A.S.))","Gutiérrez, Omar (Universidad del Norte; Department of Systems Engineering, University of the North, Barranquilla 081007, Colombia;, giordyr@uninorte.edu.co, (G.R.);, lalinares@uninorte.edu.co, (L.P.);, augustosalazar@uninorte.edu.co, (A.S.); National Training Service); Romero, Giordy (Universidad del Norte; Department of Systems Engineering, University of the North, Barranquilla 081007, Colombia;, giordyr@uninorte.edu.co, (G.R.);, lalinares@uninorte.edu.co, (L.P.);, augustosalazar@uninorte.edu.co, (A.S.)); Pérez, Luis (Universidad del Norte; Department of Systems Engineering, University of the North, Barranquilla 081007, Colombia;, giordyr@uninorte.edu.co, (G.R.);, lalinares@uninorte.edu.co, (L.P.);, augustosalazar@uninorte.edu.co, (A.S.)); Salazar, Augusto (Universidad del Norte; Department of Systems Engineering, University of the North, Barranquilla 081007, Colombia;, giordyr@uninorte.edu.co, (G.R.);, lalinares@uninorte.edu.co, (L.P.);, augustosalazar@uninorte.edu.co, (A.S.)); Charris, Marina (Department of Research in Telematics and Telecommunications, LS Information Technology Consulting (LS Asesorías TI), Barranquilla 080020, Colombia;, marinacharris@lsasesoriasti.com); Wightman, Pedro (Universidad del Norte; Department of Systems Engineering, University of the North, Barranquilla 081007, Colombia;, giordyr@uninorte.edu.co, (G.R.);, lalinares@uninorte.edu.co, (L.P.);, augustosalazar@uninorte.edu.co, (A.S.))",17,8,0.34,5.62,https://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/17/19/7132/pdf?version=1601377015,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1131310134,42 Health Sciences; 4203 Health Services and Systems; 46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4604 Cybersecurity and Privacy; 4609 Information Systems,3 Good Health and Well Being

This form of agriculture has also lacked efficient regulations and surveillance, so it is difficult to estimate the real magnitude of the exposed population and its effects on health in the short or long term. This systematic review compiles the epidemiological evidence generated from studies conducted in several regions of Chile regarding pesticide exposure and health effects. Of the total number of articles, 50% included agricultural workers, 25% children, and 25% women of childbearing age, with the greatest effects being the neurotoxic (54%), genotoxic (31%) and reproductive (15%). The evidence collected shows that in Chile the levels of exposure to pesticides in the general and occupational population are higher than international studies levels. It is urgent to protect the health of both the occupational and general population and especially children through a stricter control of the sale and use of pesticides, with comprehensive surveillance systems in environmental health and educational actions in the social and cultural context of rural communities. It is a priority to strengthen research with national relevance on health effects, and strictly restrict the use of pesticides already prohibited in developed countries due to their high level of risk to human and environmental health.",,,Gaceta Sanitaria,,,Child; Chile; Decision Making; Environmental Exposure; Farmers; Female; Humans; Male; Occupational Exposure; Pesticides; Population Health,2020-07-16,2020,2020-07-16,2021-09,35,5,480-487,All OA; Gold,Article,"Zúñiga-Venegas, Liliana; Saracini, Chiara; Pancetti, Floria; Muñoz-Quezada, María Teresa; Lucero, Boris; Foerster, Claudia; Cortés, Sandra","Zúñiga-Venegas, Liliana (Centro de Investigación en Estudios Avanzados del Maule (CIEAM), Universidad Católica del Maule, Talca, Chile; Centro de Investigaciones en Neuropsicología y Neurociencias Cognitivas (CINPSI-Neurocog), Facultad de Ciencias de la Salud, Universidad Católica del Maule, Talca, Chile.); Saracini, Chiara (Centro de Investigación en Estudios Avanzados del Maule (CIEAM), Universidad Católica del Maule, Talca, Chile; Centro de Investigaciones en Neuropsicología y Neurociencias Cognitivas (CINPSI-Neurocog), Facultad de Ciencias de la Salud, Universidad Católica del Maule, Talca, Chile.); Pancetti, Floria (Laboratorio de Neurotoxicología Ambiental, Facultad de Medicina, Universidad Católica del Norte, Coquimbo, Chile.); Muñoz-Quezada, María Teresa (Centro de Investigaciones en Neuropsicología y Neurociencias Cognitivas (CINPSI-Neurocog), Facultad de Ciencias de la Salud, Universidad Católica del Maule, Talca, Chile.); Lucero, Boris (Centro de Investigaciones en Neuropsicología y Neurociencias Cognitivas (CINPSI-Neurocog), Facultad de Ciencias de la Salud, Universidad Católica del Maule, Talca, Chile.); Foerster, Claudia (Instituto de Ciencias Agronómicas y Veterinarias, Universidad de O'Higgins, San Fernando, Chile.); Cortés, Sandra (Advanced Center for Chronic Diseases (ACCDiS), Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile, Santiago, Chile; Centro de Desarrollo Urbano Sustentable (CEDEUS), Santiago, Chile; Departamento de Salud Pública, Escuela de Medicina, Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile, Santiago, Chile.

Some of these viruses are highly neuroinvasive and neurovirulent, while others are weakly neuroinvasive and neurovirulent. Moreover, some of them, like herpes simplex viruses, are highly neuroinvasive but weakly neurovirulent for the peripheral nervous system and highly neurovirulent but weakly neuroinvasive for the central nervous system. All these disparities are a result of differences in their genomic constitution, associated vectors, geographical region, and environmental factors. Therefore, a successful intervention will be almost impossible without a clear understanding of the molecular biology and epidemiology of these viruses.

The parasite infects macrophages where they can replicate intracellularly. Furthermore, they modulate host immune responses by using virulence factors (lipophosphoglycan, glycoprotein-63, and others) that promote survival inside the cells. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) released by parasites are important for cell-cell communication in the proinflammatory milieu modulating the establishment of infection. However, information on the ability of EVs from different Leishmania species to modulate inflammatory responses is scarce, especially from those species causing different clinical manifestations (visceral vs. cutaneous). The purpose of this study was to compare macrophage activation using EVs from three Leishmania species from New World including L. infantum, L. braziliensis, and L. amazonensis. EVs were released from promastigote forms, purified by ultracentrifugation and quantitated by Nanoparticle Tracking Analysis (NTA) prior to murine macrophage exposure. NTA analysis did not show any differences in the EV sizes among the strains. EVs from L. braziliensis and L. infantum failed to induce a pro-inflammatory response. EVs from both L. infantum WT and LPG-deficient mutant (LPG-KO) did not show any differences in their interaction with macrophages, suggesting that LPG solely was not determinant for activation. On the other hand, EVs from L. amazonensis were immunomodulatory inducing NO, TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-10 via TLR4 and TLR2. To determine whether such activation was related to NF-κB p65 translocation, THP-1 macrophage cells were exposed to EVs. In the same way, only EVs from L. amazonensis exhibited a highly percentage of cells positive for NF-κB. Our results suggest an important role of EVs in determining the pattern of immune response depending on the parasite species. For L. infantum, LPG was not determinant for the activation.",,"Funding.

Artisanal and Small-scale Gold Mining (ASGM) has been identified as the most important anthropogenic source of Hg at a global scale and an important route of human exposure to Hg. In this context, this study assessed total Hg (THg) in blood, urine and hair, and methylmercury (MeHg) in human hair samples from 238 participants with occupational exposure to Hg in the most relevant ASGM communities of Colombia. Mercury concentrations in different biological matrices were related to several variables of interest such as age, gender, body mass index, fish consumption, exposure time, and specific occupational activities, such as amalgamation and amalgam burning. The median values of THg in blood (3.70 µg/L), urine (4.00 µg/L) and hair (1.37 mg/kg), and hair MeHg (1.47 mg/kg) for all participants were below permissible concentrations set by WHO. However, about 40% of the miners showed Hg concentrations in blood, urine and/or hair above the WHO thresholds. In all the biological matrices studied, miners burning amalgams showed significantly higher concentrations than miners who did not burn amalgams, with values 7-, 7-, and 8-fold higher in blood, urine and hair, respectively. A multiple linear regression model revealed that burning amalgam and fish consumption were significant predictors of Hg exposure in miners. Miners from Guainía had the highest concentrations in urine and hair, most likely due to the high manipulation and burning of amalgam, and a high fish consumption. In contrast, miners from Caldas showed the lowest Hg concentrations in all the biomarkers because they do not manipulate or burn amalgam, as well as reporting the lowest fish consumption. Our study also highlighted that gold miners exposure to Hg depends on their work practices. Therefore, the implementation of a health education programme on gold mining strategies is required, especially in Guaina, Vaupés, Córdoba, and Antioquia departments.","This study was performed in the framework of several projects: the (MME) GGC N° 223 - 2015 (UPME) CI-002-2015, funded by the Ministry of Mines and Energy, the Mining and Energy Planning Unit (UPME), and the University of Córdoba, and the Inter-administrative Agreement N° 407 - 2016, financed by the Ministry of Health and Social Protection, the National Health Institute and the University of Córdoba.",,Environment International,,,Animals; Colombia; Environmental Monitoring; Gold; Humans; Mercury; Mining; Occupational Exposure,2020-11-09,2020,2020-11-09,2021-01,146,,106216,All OA; Gold,Article,"Calao-Ramos, Clelia; Bravo, Andrea G; Paternina-Uribe, Roberth; Marrugo-Negrete, José; Díez, Sergi","Calao-Ramos, Clelia (Universidad de Córdoba, Carrera 6 No. 76-103, Montería, Córdoba, Colombia.); Bravo, Andrea G (Environmental Chemistry Department, Institute of Environmental Assessment and Water Research, IDAEA-CSIC, E-08034 Barcelona, Spain.); Paternina-Uribe, Roberth (Universidad de Córdoba, Carrera 6 No. 76-103, Montería, Córdoba, Colombia.); Marrugo-Negrete, José (Universidad de Córdoba, Carrera 6 No. 76-103, Montería, Córdoba, Colombia.

Through explicit instruction on the argumentative genre and reflection on the linguistic correlates of neoliberal ideology, we guided students in developing enhanced awareness of neoliberalism and its influence on environmental policy. In the independent writing stage, students’ argumentation revealed critical stances towards neoliberalism and adequate command of the target genre. The paper closes with general reflections and recommendations for the adoption of an explicitly critical approach in university literacy education.
RESUMO Este artigo discute um projeto de pesquisa colaborativa que integra o foco na consciência ideológica com a pedagogia de gêneros no letramento universitário. Através de instruções explícitas sobre o gênero argumentativo e reflexão sobre os correlatos lingüísticos da ideologia neoliberal, orientamos os estudantes no desenvolvimento de uma maior conscientização do neoliberalismo e sua influência na política ambiental. No estágio de escrita independente, a argumentação dos estudantes revelou posições mais críticas em relação ao neoliberalismo e comando adequado do gênero alvo. O artigo termina com reflexões gerais e recomendações para a adoção de uma abordagem crítica explícita no letramento universitário.",,,DELTA Documentação de Estudos em Lingüística Teórica e Aplicada,,,,2020,2020,2020,,36,4,2020360412,All OA; Gold,Article,"Guerra-Lyons, Jesús David; Mendinueta, Nayibe Rosado","Guerra-Lyons, Jesús David (Department of Spanish, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla - Atlántico, Colombia.

Early diagnosis and prompt treatment will lead to better outcomes, but any delay may results in high fatality with serious neurologic sequelae among survivors. We conducted a systematic review of published literature on the clinical presentation, diagnosis, treatment and complications of viral infections of the central nervous system from 1980 to 2019 on four databases comprising of PubMed, PubMed Central, Google Scholar and Medline to give the current understanding for better patient management. This systematic review demonstrates the management approach of viral infections of the central nervous system in children from the point of clinical presentation, diagnosis, treatment and complications.

The literature advises studies that include objective markers along with clinical assessment in order to improve the sensitivity and specificity of current diagnostic criteria. The decrease of muscle quality precedes the loss of quantity, so we studied the role magnetic resonance imaging biomarkers as indicators of the quantity and quality of muscle in sarcopenia patients.
METHODS: a cross-sectional analysis was performed to analyze what MR-derived imaging parameters correlate better with sarcopenia diagnostic criteria in women of 70 years of age and over (independent walking and community-dwelling women who were sarcopenic in accordance with EWGSOP criteria with muscle mass adjusted to Spanish population were chosen).
RESULTS: The study included 26 women; 81 ± 8 years old. A strong correlation was obtained between cineanthropometric variables (BMI; thigh perimeter and fat mass) and imaging biomarkers (muscle/fat ratio, fatty infiltration, muscle T2*, water diffusion coefficient, and proton density fat fraction) with coefficients around 0.7 (absolute value).
CONCLUSIONS: Knowing the correlation of clinical parameters and imaging-derived muscle quality indicators can help to identify older women at risk of developing sarcopenia at an early stage. This may allow taking preventive actions to decrease disability, morbidity, and mortality in sarcopenia patients.",The authors would like to thank all of the participants in this research and the Universidad Católica de Valencia “San Vicente Mártir” for its support.,This work was supported by a grant from Universidad Católica de Valencia San Vicente Mártir (grant number 2018-158-002) to APM.

Accordingly, changes in the composition of the marine avifauna often correspond to large-scale (macro-mega) shifts in water mass properties. Yet, few studies have addressed biogeographical patterns across multiple current systems, spanning from highly productive to oligotrophic waters. In this study, we characterize the at-sea assemblages of nesting seabirds across the Eastern South Pacific Ocean (ESPO), a vast region spanning from the Humboldt Current to the South Pacific Gyre. Employing multivariate techniques, we first identify four distinct species assemblages and then relate their distributions to the underlying environmental conditions. Our results show that Julian day, depth, sea surface temperature (SST), sea surface salinity (SSS), and chlorophyll-α concentration are the most important factors explaining the distribution patterns of these assemblages. Moreover, environmental conditions also explain overall seabird abundance and species richness, two community-level characteristics indicative of ocean productivity. Seabird abundance was best explained by four variables, associated with onshore–offshore gradients (distance to the coast, ocean depth), and the influence of coastal upwelling (mean mixed layer depth, SSS). Richness was best explained by seasonality (Julian day) and by the presence of water mass boundaries (SST coefficient of variation). Our findings underscore the importance of environmental factors structuring the distribution and biogeography of seabirds across gradients of ocean productivity and water mass properties. Understanding the environmental drivers of seabird abundance and richness in the ESPO will inform the prioritization and design of effective marine conservation measures in this poorly studied region.","We want to thank the Armada de Chile for their help and support during data collection on the board of their cruises.

203,pub.1129638345,10.5334/ijc.1011,,,Sustainability Analysis of the Benthic Fisheries Managed in the TURF System in Chile,"Territorial use rights in fisheries (TURF) are considered to aid to the sustainability of small-scale fisheries, because they remove the perverse incentives, which sustain the tragedy of the commons. Nevertheless, a comprehensive evaluation of the implementation of TURFs is lacking. Chile offers a unique opportunity, because an extensive system for benthic fisheries has been implemented, with at present hundreds of TURFs along the coast. This study analyzes the sustainability of all the TURFs (109) along a stretch of 800 Km of coast, using population, productive, economic, social and institutional indicators. The information was obtained from the technical reports and monitoring each TURF has to prepare for the authority each year, databases the authority has and interviews with artisanal fishermen. Three states of TURFs were identified: unsustainable, poorly sustainable and sustainable. The resources exploited in the analyzed TURFs are the chilean abalon or “loco” (Concholepas concholepas), the key hole limpets “lapa negra” (Fissurella latimarginata), and “lapa rosada” (Fissurella cumingi), the kelps “huiro negro” (Lessonia berteroana), and “huiro palo” (Lessonia trabeculata), the surf clam “Macha” (Mesodesma donacium), the scallop “ostión del norte” (Argopecten purpuratus) and the seaurchin “erizo rojo” (Loxechinus albus). Results show general low performance for population, production and economic indicators, but good performance for social and institutional indicators. Overall the system shows a poor sustainability, which principally means unstable populations, landings and income in most of the TURFs. This result, which differs from most published analyses of the system, is explained mainly by the impossibility to reach a stable fishery through management of so small areas, given the natural variability of the species and the general environment. The good performance of some TURFs cannot be explained by a single factor, which is consistent with the complexity of the system, which makes it little amenable for proper management.",,,International Journal of the Commons,,,,2020,2020,,2020,14,1,344-365,All OA; Gold,Article,"Arias, Natalia; Stotz, Wolfgang","Arias, Natalia (Universidad Católica del Norte); Stotz, Wolfgang (Universidad Católica del Norte)",,"Arias, Natalia (Catholic University of the North); Stotz, Wolfgang (Catholic University of the North)",13,7,,5.2,http://www.thecommonsjournal.org/articles/10.5334/ijc.1011/galley/1053/download/,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1129638345,41 Environmental Sciences; 4104 Environmental Management; 48 Law and Legal Studies; 4803 International and Comparative Law,14 Life Below Water

The simplest realisation is achieved within the scotogenic model where neutrino masses are generated at the 1-loop level. Hence, we consider the case where the dark matter particle is the lightest Z 2 -odd Majorana fermion running in the neutrino mass loop. We assume that lepton number is broken dynamically due to a lepton number carrier scalar singlet which acquires a non-zero vacuum expectation value. In the present scenario the Dark Matter particles can annihilate via t- and s-channels. The latter arises from the mixing between the new scalar singlet and the Higgs doublet. We identify three different Dark Matter mass regions below 1 TeV that can account for the right amount of dark matter abundance in agreement with current experimental constraints. We compute the Dark Matter-nucleon spin-independent scattering cross-section and find that the model predicts spin-independent cross-sections ‘naturally’ dwelling below the current limit on direct detection searches of Dark Matter particles reported by XENON1T.","We would like to thank A Vicente and one of the referees for pointing out a missing factor 1/2 in equation (13).

However, filtering the noise while keeping fine details is a difficult task. This paper presents a method, based on sparse representations and singular value decomposition (SVD), for non-locally denoising MR images. The proposed method prevents blurring, artifacts, and residual noise. Our method is composed of three stages. The first stage divides the image into sub-volumes, to obtain its sparse representation, by using the KSVD algorithm. Then, the global influence of the dictionary atoms is computed to upgrade the dictionary and obtain a better reconstruction of the sub-volumes. In the second stage, based on the sparse representation, the noise-free sub-volume is estimated using a non-local approach and SVD. The noise-free voxel is reconstructed by aggregating the overlapped voxels according to the rarity of the sub-volumes it belongs, which is computed from the global influence of the atoms. The third stage repeats the process using a different sub-volume size for producing a new filtered image, which is averaged with the previously filtered images. The results provided show that our method outperforms several state-of-the-art methods in both simulated and real data.",We gratefully thank Mariana Pino for supplying the real clinical MR images used in this research.,This research was partially supported by the Administrative Department of Science and Technology of Colombia—COLCIENCIAS under the program of doctoral scholarship COLCIENCIAS-UNINORTE 2015-006.,Sensors,,,"Algorithms; Artifacts; Brain; Computer Simulation; Humans; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Models, Statistical; Phantoms, Imaging; Signal-To-Noise Ratio; Support Vector Machine",2020-03-10,2020,2020-03-10,,20,5,1536,All OA; Gold,Article,"Leal, Nallig; Zurek, Eduardo; Leal, Esmeide","Leal, Nallig (Department of Systems Engineering, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla 080001, Colombia;, ezurek@uninorte.edu.co); Zurek, Eduardo (Department of Systems Engineering, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla 080001, Colombia;, ezurek@uninorte.edu.co); Leal, Esmeide (Independent Consultant, Barranquilla 080001, Colombia;, esmeide0226@yahoo.com)","Leal, Nallig (Universidad del Norte)","Leal, Nallig (Universidad del Norte); Zurek, Eduardo (Universidad del Norte); Leal, Esmeide (Independent Consultant, Barranquilla 080001, Colombia;, esmeide0226@yahoo.com)",16,3,0.72,5.06,https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/20/5/1536/pdf?version=1583939132,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1125604698,40 Engineering; 4006 Communications Engineering; 46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4603 Computer Vision and Multimedia Computation,

METHODS: A cross-sectional study on adolescents aged 10 to 19 years. The instrument used to collect data contains demographic and socioeconomic information and 27 questions that assess the knowledge and acceptability of the HPV vaccine. To compare the prevalence of vaccinated adolescents with the correct answers to questions about HPV and acceptability and vaccination, the robust variance Poisson regression model was used in the Stata 13.0 software.
FINDINGS: A total of 190 adolescents participated in the study, 60.5% in the age group of vaccination recommended by the Brazilian government, among them, 53.9% reported not having been vaccinated (p <0.001). A total of 150 (78.9%) adolescents correctly recognized HPV as a virus; 121 (63.7%) recognized HPV as a cause of cervical cancer. Participants who know HPV is a causative factor for cervical cancer are 1.94 times more likely to have been vaccinated than those who do not. Among the interviewees, the main sources of knowledge about the vaccine were schools (51.6%) and health professionals (22.6%).

The acetylation levels of these proteins are determined by the balance of expression of histone acetyltransferase (HATs) and histone deacetylases (HDACs). We recently reported that class I HDACs (HDAC1 and HDAC3) play important roles in juvenile hormone (JH) suppression of metamorphosis in the red flour beetle, Tribolium castaneum. Here, we report on the function of a single class IV HDAC member, HDAC11. Injection of dsRNA targeting T. castaneum HDAC11 gene into newly molted last instar larvae induced knockdown of the target gene and arrested larval development and prevented metamorphosis into the pupal stage. Dark melanized areas were detected in larvae that showed developmental arrest and mortality. Developmental expression studies showed an increase in HDAC11 mRNA levels beginning at the end of the penultimate larval stage. These higher levels were maintained during the final instar larval and pupal stages. A JH analog, hydroprene, suppressed HDAC11 expression in the larvae. Sequencing of RNA isolated from control and dsHDAC11 injected larvae identified several differentially expressed genes, including those involved in JH action, ecdysone response, and melanization. The acetylation levels of core histones showed an increase in TcA cells exposed to dsHDAC11. Also, an increase in histone H3 acetylation, specifically H3K9, H3K18 and H3K27, were detected in HDAC11 knockdown larvae. These studies report the function of HDAC11 in insects other than Drosophila for the first time and show that HDAC11 influences the acetylation levels of histones and expression of multiple genes involved in T. castaneum larval development.",We thank Najla Albishi for help with microscopic techniques and Hunt lab for RNA-seq analysis.,"Funding.

To this aim, it utilizes innovative criteria and some computer-aided procedures and tools based on GIS, Excel and Python. This approach sheds light on the character and the behavior of rivers, which is key to informing planning, management and restoration. The application to the Magdalena River (Colombia) illustrates the characterization and classification process and the type of results, which ultimately highlight the great geomorphic diversity of that river.

While plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) are known to induce plant defenses, endosymbiotic bacteria hosted by herbivorous insects are often beneficial to the host. Here, we aimed to assess whether PGPR-induced defenses in broad bean plants impact the pea aphid, depending on its genotype and the presence of endosymbionts. We estimated aphid reproduction, quantified defense- and growth-related phytohormones by GC-MS, and measured different plant growth and physiology parameters, after PGPR treatment. In addition, we recorded the feeding behavior of aphids by electropenetrography. We found that the PGPR treatment of broad bean plants reduced the reproduction of one of the pea aphid clones. We highlighted a phenomenon of PGPR-induced plant defense priming, but no noticeable plant growth promotion. The main changes in aphid probing behavior were related to salivation events into phloem sieve elements. We suggest that the endosymbiont Hamiltonella defensa played a key role in plant-insect interactions, possibly helping aphids to counteract plant-induced resistance and allowing them to develop normally on PGPR-treated plants. Our results imply that plant- and aphid-associated microorganisms add greater complexity to the outcomes of aphid-plant interactions.","The authors thank the R.

This leads to the need to innovate in the control and management information systems of the systems responsible to treat these residual waters in search of improvement. This paper proposes the development of an intelligent system that uses the data from the process and makes a prediction of its behavior to provide support in decision making related to the operation of the wastewater treatment plant (WWTP). To carry out the development of this system, a multilayer perceptron neural network with 2 hidden layers and 22 neurons each is implemented, together with process variable analysis, time-series decomposition, correlation and autocorrelation techniques; it is possible to predict the chemical oxygen demand (COD) at the input of the bioreactor with a one-day window and a mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of 10.8%, which places this work between the adequate ranges proposed in the literature.","This work was supported by the Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia.","This research was supported by the Colombian Ministry of Science and Technology, MINCIENCIAS, Investment Tax Benefits, Call No. 786.",Sustainability,,,,2020-08-07,2020,2020-08-07,,12,16,6348,All OA; Gold,Article,"Arismendy, Luis; Cárdenas, Carlos; Gómez, Diego; Maturana, Aymer; Mejía, Ricardo; M., Christian G.

170,pub.1132724041,10.3390/pr8111478,,,Quantitative Methods to Support Data Acquisition Modernization within Copper Smelters,"Sensors and process control systems are essential for process automation and optimization. Many sectors have adapted to the Industry 4.0 paradigm, but copper smelters remain hesitant to implement these technologies without appropriate justification, as many critical functions remain subject to ground operator experience. Recent experiments and industrial trials using radiometric optoelectronic data acquisition, coupled with advanced quantitative methods and expert systems, have successfully distinguished between mineral species in reactive vessels with high classification rates. These experiments demonstrate the increasing potential for the online monitoring of the state of a charge in pyrometallurgical furnaces, allowing data-driven adjustments to critical operational parameters. However, the justification to implement an innovative control system requires a quantitative framework that is conducive to multiphase engineering projects. This paper presents a unified quantitative framework for copper and nickel-copper smelters, which integrates thermochemical modeling into discrete event simulation and is, indeed, able to simulate smelters, with and without a proposed set of sensors, thus quantifying the benefit of these sensors.

In the present work, the performance of a 0.5 vol % GO-incorporated epoxy matrix composite reinforced with 30 vol % fabric made of ramie fibers was investigated by stand-alone ballistic tests against the threat of a 0.22 lead projectile. Composite characterization was also performed by Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, thermal analysis and X-ray diffraction. Ballistic tests disclosed an absorbed energy of 130 J, which is higher than those reported for other natural fabrics epoxy composite, 74-97 J, as well as plain Kevlar (synthetic aramid fabric), 100 J, with the same thickness. This is attributed to the improved adhesion between the ramie fabric and the composite matrix due to the GO-incorporated epoxy. The onset of thermal degradation above 300 °C indicates a relatively higher working temperature as compared to common natural fiber polymer composites. DSC peaks show a low amount of heat absorbed or release due to glass transition endothermic (113-121 °C) and volatile release exothermic (~132 °C) events. The 1030 cm-1 prominent FTIR band, associated with GO bands between epoxy chains and graphene oxide groups, suggested an effective distribution of GO throughout the composite matrix. As expected, XRD of the 30 vol % ramie fabric-reinforced GO-incorporated epoxy matrix composite confirmed the displacement of the (0 0 1) peak of GO by 8° due to intercalation of epoxy chains into the spacing between GO layers. By improving the adhesion to the ramie fabric and enhancing the thermal stability of the epoxy matrix, as well as by superior absorption energy from projectile penetration, the GO may contribute to the composite effective ballistic performance.","The authors wish to thank the support to this investigation by the Brazilian agencies: CNPq, CAPES, FAPERJ, the Navy Research Institute (IPQM) and Institute of Macromolecules (IMA) for the thermal analyses conduction and the Natural Fibers Laboratory at the State University of the North Fluminense Darcy Ribeiro (UENF) for conducting the impact tests.","This research was funded by the Brazilian Council of Scientific Research, Technology and Innovation Development, CNPq (403140/2019-6), as well as State of Rio de Janeiro Research Support Foundation, FAPERJ (257531).",Polymers,,,,2020-11-16,2020,2020-11-16,,12,11,2711,All OA;

203,pub.1128861973,10.3390/min10070585,,,Stochastic Open-Pit Mine Production Scheduling: A Case Study of an Iron Deposit,"Production planning decisions in the mining industry are affected by geological, geometallurgical, economic and operational information. However, the traditional approach to address this problem often relies on simplified models that ignore the variability and uncertainty of these parameters. In this paper, two main sources of uncertainty are combined to obtain multiple simulated block models in an iron ore deposit that include the rock type and seven quantitative variables (grades of Fe, SiO2, S, P and K, magnetic ratio and specific gravity). To assess the effect of integrating these two sources of uncertainty in mine planning decision, stochastic and deterministic production scheduling models are applied based on the simulated block models. The results show the capacity of the stochastic mine planning model to identify and minimize risks, obtaining valuable information in ore content or quality at early stages of the project, and improving decision-making with respect to the deterministic production scheduling. Numerically speaking, the stochastic mine planning model improves 6% expected cumulative discounted cash flow and generates 16% more iron ore than deterministic model.",,"the authors are grateful to two reviewers for their positive comments and acknowledge funding from the National Agency for Research and Development of Chile through grants CONICYT/FONDECYT/POSTDOCTORADO/N° 3180655 (M.M.), CONICYT/FONDECYT/REGULAR/N° 1170101 (X.E.) and CONICYT/PIA AFB180004 (E.J., X.E. and N.M.).",Minerals,,,,2020-06-29,2020,2020-06-29,,10,7,585,All OA; Gold,Article,"Maleki, Mohammad; Jélvez, Enrique; Emery, Xavier; Morales, Nelson","Maleki, Mohammad (Department of Metallurgical and Mining Engineering, Universidad Católica del Norte, Antofagasta 1270709, Chile); Jélvez, Enrique (Advanced Mining Technology Center, University of Chile, Santiago 8370448, Chile;, enrique.jelvez@amtc.cl, (E.J.);, xemery@ing.uchile.cl, (X.E.);, nelson.morales@amtc.cl, (N.M.); Department of Mining Engineering, University of Chile, Santiago 8370448, Chile; Delphos Mine Planning Laboratory, Department of Mining Engineering, Universidad de Chile, Santiago 8370448, Chile); Emery, Xavier (Advanced Mining Technology Center, University of Chile, Santiago 8370448, Chile;, enrique.jelvez@amtc.cl, (E.J.);, xemery@ing.uchile.cl, (X.E.);, nelson.morales@amtc.cl, (N.M.); Department of Mining Engineering, University of Chile, Santiago 8370448, Chile); Morales, Nelson (Advanced Mining Technology Center, University of Chile, Santiago 8370448, Chile;, enrique.jelvez@amtc.cl, (E.J.);, xemery@ing.uchile.cl, (X.E.);, nelson.morales@amtc.cl, (N.M.); Department of Mining Engineering, University of Chile, Santiago 8370448, Chile; Delphos Mine Planning Laboratory, Department of Mining Engineering, Universidad de Chile, Santiago 8370448, Chile)","Maleki, Mohammad (Catholic University of the North)","Maleki, Mohammad (Catholic University of the North); Jélvez, Enrique (University of Chile; Advanced Mining Technology Center, University of Chile, Santiago 8370448, Chile;, enrique.jelvez@amtc.cl, (E.J.);, xemery@ing.uchile.cl, (X.E.);, nelson.morales@amtc.cl, (N.M.); University of Chile; University of Chile); Emery, Xavier (University of Chile; Advanced Mining Technology Center, University of Chile, Santiago 8370448, Chile;, enrique.jelvez@amtc.cl, (E.J.);, xemery@ing.uchile.cl, (X.E.);, nelson.morales@amtc.cl, (N.M.); University of Chile); Morales, Nelson (University of Chile; Advanced Mining Technology Center, University of Chile, Santiago 8370448, Chile;, enrique.jelvez@amtc.cl, (E.J.);, xemery@ing.uchile.cl, (X.E.);, nelson.morales@amtc.cl, (N.M.); University of Chile; University of Chile)",22,7,,4.82,https://www.mdpi.com/2075-163X/10/7/585/pdf?version=1594043139,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1128861973,40 Engineering; 4005 Civil Engineering; 4019 Resources Engineering and Extractive Metallurgy,

Confronting the view that has tended to encapsulate the Tumbe Carnaval as an aid to the ethno-political movement, the article suggests that this performance with its ‘movements’ imprints a sensitive ability to the body that calls upon senses and memories ope ning the way to key cognitive processes for afro-descendant self-recognition, and where the action of think-feel, rooted in the experience of Tumbe Carnaval, is reflective and generative of the afro-Chilean cultural revival and the expansion of the ethno-political afro-descendant movement in Arica.",,,Boletín del Museo Chileno de Arte Precolombino,,,,2020,2020,2020,,25,2,67-82,All OA; Gold,Article,"Villagra, Mariana Len","Villagra, Mariana Len ()",,"Villagra, Mariana Len ()",8,5,,4.8,https://scielo.conicyt.cl/pdf/bmchap/v25n2/0718-6894-bmchap-25-02-67.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1133930241,36 Creative Arts and Writing; 44 Human Society; 4404 Development Studies,

Despite the advantages of the ECR, the length of this measure may discourage its use in clinical and research contexts. Consequently, the goal of this study was to develop a brief Spanish version of the ECR questionnaire and to examine its psychometric properties when administered to six different Spanish-speaking samples from Chile. Confirmatory factor analyses replicated the two-dimensional structure of the ECR and its invariance across gender. Results also supported the reliability and concurrent validity of our brief Spanish version of the ECR (i.e., Spanish ECR-12), by its association with measures of emotion regulation, dyadic empathy, psychological distress and well-being, and relationship satisfaction.

Exposed to UV-B Radiation,"Antarctic plants have developed mechanisms to deal with one or more adverse factors which allow them to successfully survive such extreme environment. Certain effective mechanisms to face adverse stress factors can arise from the establishment of functional symbiosis with endophytic fungi. In this work, we explored the role of fungal endophytes on host plant performance under high level of UV-B radiation, a harmful factor known to damage structure and function of cell components. In order to unveil the underlying mechanisms, we characterized the expression of genes associated to UV-B photoreception, accumulation of key flavonoids, and physiological responses of Colobanthus quitensis plants with (E+) and without (E−) fungal endophytes, under contrasting levels of UV-B radiation. The deduced proteins of CqUVR8, CqHY5, and CqFLS share the characteristic domains and display high degrees of similarity with other corresponding proteins in plants. Endophyte symbiotic plants showed lower lipid peroxidation and higher photosynthesis efficiency under high UV-B radiation. In comparison with E−, E+ plants showed lower CqUVR8, CqHY5, and CqFLS transcript levels. The content of quercetin, a ROS-scavenger flavonoid, in leaves of E- plants exposed to high UV-B was almost 8-fold higher than that in E+ plants 48 h after treatment. Our results suggest that endophyte fungi minimize cell damage and boost physiological performance in the Antarctic plants increasing the tolerance to UV-B radiation. Fungal endophytes appear as fundamental biological partners for plants to cope with the highly damaging UV-B radiation of Antarctica.",We thank Daniel Zunino for support with plant maintenance and design of experimental devices.,"Funding.

Lack of appropriately trained personnel is a major contributor to the gap in access to wheelchairs. Assistive technology provision is one of the core competencies of occupational therapists. The goal of this study was to assess the current wheelchair provision knowledge of final year occupational therapy students in Colombia as measured by the International Society of Wheelchair Professionals Basic Wheelchair Service Knowledge Test. A total of 83 students from 7 universities took the test. None of the students met the 70% passing threshold. The highest scores were in the assessment domain while the lowest in the fitting and user training domains. These results suggest that the current wheelchair provision education received in these programs do not meet the World Health Organization guidelines on appropriate wheelchair provision. The implementation of strategies to improve current wheelchair provision education in Colombian occupational therapy programs is granted.","The International Society of Wheelchair Professionals provided the test at no cost to students or universities, which was possible thanks to a partnership between the University of Pittsburgh and the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) through a multi-year, $2.3 million sub-award.

Resource Dependence and Professionalization of Non-governmental Social Services Organizations in Southern Spain","This study analyzes the strategies displayed by non-governmental organizations in the social services sector to face the resource dependence on public administration in Southern Spain. We focus on the reorganization of the public subsidies system in Spain and its specific impact on the entities registered in Andalusia. In 2017, the Autonomous Communities assumed the management of a proportion of the subsidies with a charge to the Personal Income Tax for “social purposes,” which was previously managed by the General State Administration in its entirety. The case study combines the description of (a) the process of transferring the management of a line of subsidies from the state to the regional level, (b) the strategies of non-governmental organizations to face the context of instability and financial uncertainty, and (c) the impact of the regulatory bases of grant calls on programs implementation. First, the database with all the applications submitted in the calls of 2017 and 2018 is analyzed (n = 11,610 applications). Second, we describe the perception of the change in the management system, from the point of view of the third-sector social services entities. The combination of both strategies allows us to examine in detail the response of social service organizations to ensure the continuity of the budget and the continuity of services. The results show that the change in the management system gave rise to a wide debate among non-governmental social services organizations about the calls for grants managed by the regional government. However, the qualitative case study showed that the reaction of the entities has more to do with the needs of adaptation to an unstable, uncertain, and highly competitive financial environment, than with specific characteristics of grant calls.","This research was funded by the Directorate of Social Services of the Ministry of Equality, Social Policies and Conciliation of the Regional Government of Andalusia. The fieldwork and data analysis were carried out within the framework of the project “Typology of subsidies of social services of the Regional Government of Andalusia: Descriptive-comparative analysis of the general call and the 0.7% of the Personal Income Tax call” (FIUS, 3676/0227). Elena González Tinoco participated as a beneficiary of a contract of Research Personnel in Training of the University of Seville. The transcripts were made by Judith Campos Carrau, the beneficiary of a Collaboration Grant from the Ministry of Education and Vocational Training, during the 2019–2020 academic year.","The funding context can also influence the contents and implementation of the programs. Specifically, it seems to have a direct impact on the duration and continuity of the intervention. First, public entities and funding agencies often structure the financing of social programs around short budget cycles, usually with a finalist nature, through the subsidy of closed activities and projects with a limited execution period. This has resulted in implementation and impact with time restrictions between calls, usually yearly (Rhoades et al. 2012). Second, impact and long-term viability have been a latent, though seldom explicit, concern (Shediac-Rizkallah and Bone 1998). Short-term subsidies seem to be among the factors that introduce difficulties for the institutionalization of a program in the organization. Despite these difficulties, results-based management is one of the strategies with significant potential to improve services and meet the community needs (Julian 2001). However, results-based accountability requires a context of continued technical assistance to entities. For example, the lack of resources to perform a needs assessment or outcome evaluation can negatively affect the quality of the service and the accountability process itself (Swerissen and Crisp 2004). In addition, certain prevention or promotion actions are more difficult to operationalize in terms of results. On the other hand, administrative issues such as lack of staff with training and expertise in assessment or lack of financial resources to carry it out may be relevant, especially when we compare large organizations with small ones (Dorius 2011).",VOLUNTAS: International Journal of Voluntary and Nonprofit Organizations,,,,2020-08-03,2020,2020-08-03,2020-12,31,6,1212-1225,All OA; Gold,Article,"Maya-Jariego, Isidro; Holgado-Ramos, Daniel; González-Tinoco, Elena; Muñoz-Alvis, Andrés; Ortega, Manuela","Maya-Jariego, Isidro (Facultad de Psicología, Universidad de Sevilla, Calle Camilo José Cela s/n, 41.018, Seville, Spain); Holgado-Ramos, Daniel (Facultad de Psicología, Universidad de Sevilla, Calle Camilo José Cela s/n, 41.018, Seville, Spain); González-Tinoco, Elena (Facultad de Psicología, Universidad de Sevilla, Calle Camilo José Cela s/n, 41.018, Seville, Spain); Muñoz-Alvis, Andrés (Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); Ortega, Manuela (Universidad de Cádiz, Cádiz, Spain)","Maya-Jariego, Isidro (University of Seville)","Maya-Jariego, Isidro (University of Seville); Holgado-Ramos, Daniel (University of Seville); González-Tinoco, Elena (University of Seville); Muñoz-Alvis, Andrés (Universidad del Norte); Ortega, Manuela (University of Cádiz)",9,5,,4.68,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11266-020-00256-z,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1129847292,44 Human Society; 4407 Policy and Administration,

Here we investigated the effects of cells of L. ferriphilum on biofilm formation and leaching performance by S. thermosulfidooxidans. The effects were caused by the presence of L. ferriphilum or an addition of pyrite leach liquor from L. ferriphilum. Data show that the number of attached S. thermosulfidooxidans on pyrite increases, if the pyrite had been pre-colonized by living biofilms of L. ferriphilum, while it decreases if the pre-colonized biofilms had been inactivated. Coaggregation between S. thermosulfidooxidans and L. ferriphilum occurs during the dual-species biofilm formation, but different effects on bioleaching were noted, if the preculture of L. ferriphilum had been different. If L. ferriphilum had been pre-colonized on a pyrite, significantly negative effect was shown. However, if the two species were simultaneously inoculated into a sterile leaching system, the bioleaching efficiency was better than that of a pure culture of S. thermosulfidooxidans. The effect might be related to a metabolic preference of S. thermosulfidooxidans. If S. thermosulfidooxidans performed leaching in a filtered pyrite leachate from L. ferriphilum, the cells preferred to oxidize RISCs instead of ferrous ion and the number of attached cells decreased compared with the control. This study gives an indication that in a short-term multi-species leaching system the role of S. thermosufidooxidans may be related to the time of its introduction.",,"Funding.

This article considers that demand and sales phenomena do not always go hand-in-hand. The demand process relates to the willingness to acquire products in good condition, giving the customer the power to evaluate the quality of the product before an effective purchase takes place. We also considered the cost of disposing of unsold units, besides the conventional costs for storage and procurement. We then proposed a mathematical model to derive the Economic Order Quantity (EOQ) under specific conditions, in order to minimize the expected management cost of perishables, assuming constant demand and linearly decreasing purchase probability during the product life cycle. We proposed several random instances and validate the mathematical model using simulation. We then found the optimal parameters for the inventory policy using a third-order numerical approximation. Last, we developed a sensitivity analysis over the product life cycle to prove that the proposed model approximates to a traditional EOQ model for perishables when life cycle is sufficiently large.","This research was sponsored by the Atlantic Department Government; and the Colombian General Royalties System through Project LOGPORT, BPIN 20120001001911050672, agreement no. 0103–2013–000016.",,Operations Research Perspectives,,,,2020,2020,,2020,7,,100146,All OA; Gold,Article,"Díaz, Ronald David Suárez; Paternina-Arboleda, Carlos D.; Martínez-Flores, José Luis; Jimenez-Barros, Miguel A.","Díaz, Ronald David Suárez (Industrial Engineering Department, Universidad Simón Bolívar, Barranquilla, Colombia); Paternina-Arboleda, Carlos D.

We present the Volcanic Anomalies Monitoring System (VOLCANOMS), a new, online, low-cost and semiautomatic system based on Landsat imagery. This system can detect permanent and/or temporal thermal anomalies in near-infrared (NIR), short-wave infrared (SWIR), and thermal infrared (TIR) bands. VOLCANOMS allows researchers to calculate several thermal parameters, such as thermal radiance, effective temperature, anomaly area, radiative, gas, convective, and total heat, and mass fluxes. We study the eruptive activity of five volcanoes including Krakatau, Stromboli, Fuego, Villarrica and Lascar volcanoes, comparing field and eruptive data with thermal radiance. In the case of Villarrica and Lascar volcanoes, we also compare the thermal radiance and eruptive activity with seismic data. The thermal radiance shows a concordance with the eruptive activity in all cases, whereas a correlation is observed between thermal and seismic data both, in Villarrica and Lascar volcanoes, especially in the case of long-period seismicity. VOLCANOMS is a new and powerful tool that, combined with other techniques, generates robust information for volcanic monitoring.","The authors acknowledge Estefanía Flores and Angelo Araya (Departamento de Ingeniería de sistemas y computación, Universidad Católica del Norte, Chile) for their contribution to the VOLCANOMS System.

The standard critical N concentration (standard Nc) dilution curves, an expression of the dynamics of N uptake and dry matter accumulation in plants, are widely used to diagnose the N status of crops. Several standard Nc dilution curves were proposed and validated for several crops, based on experiments involving different N fertilizer treatments. However, standard Nc dilution curves are affected by crop water status, e.g., resulting from differences in irrigation management. This paper aimed at developing a N diagnostic model under the coupling effect of irrigation and fertilizer managements. For this purpose, Nc dilution curves were developed under different irrigation rates. Additionally, plant water content (PWC), leaf water content (LWC), leaf area index (LAI), equivalent water thickness (EWT), and leaf area duration (LAD) were introduced into the model, to construct a modified Nc (mNc) dilution curve. The mNc dilution curves were designed using the principle of hierarchical linear model (HLM), introducing aboveground dry biomass (AGB) as the first layer of information, whereas the second layer of information included the different agronomic variables (PWC, LWC, LAI, EWT, and LAD). The results showed that parameters ""a"" and ""b"" of the standard Nc dilution curves ranged from 5.17 to 6.52 and -0.69 to -0.38 respectively. Parameter ""a"" was easily affected by different management conditions. The performance of standard Nc dilution models obtained by the cross-validation method was worse than that of mNc dilution models. The Nc dilution curve based on 4 years of data was described by the negative power equation Nc = 5.05 × AGB-0.47, with R 2 and nRMSE of 0.63 and 0.21, respectively. The mNc dilution curve considers different treatments and was represented by the equation mNc = a×AGB-b , where a = 2.09 × PWC + 3.24, b = -0.02 × LAI + 0.51, with R 2 and nRMSE of 0.79 and 0.13, respectively. For winter wheat, C3 crop, there would be a few problems in using standard Nc dilution methods to guide field management, however, this study provides a reliable method for constructing mNc dilution curves under different water and N fertilizer management. Due to the significant differences in hereditary, CO2 fixation efficiency and N metabolism pathways for C3 and C4 crops, the construction of mNc dilution curve suitable for different N response mechanisms will be conducive to the sustainable N management in crop plants.",,"Funding.

However, mining has significant environmental impacts, such as generating large amounts of solid waste. Due to the high moisture content of solid waste, physical stabilization problems can arise at disposal sites as a result of aqueous solutions trapped in solids not draining by gravity. Electroosmotic drainage has been proposed as a technique to reduce moisture and thus increase the stability of disposal sites. However, the question arises whether the volume of drained solution depends on the percentage of fine matter in the solid matrix. The experimental work reported here, based on an experimental factorial design, was carried out to address this question. The first part consists of an experimental design with synthetic solid matrices. The percentage of fine particles and the initial moisture level were defined as factors with three levels. The volume of drained liquid was defined as the response variable. The results showed that electroosmotic drainage was more efficient than gravitational drainage when the moisture content and the percentage of fine material were at their highest levels. The effect of the factors and their interaction was corroborated by an ANOVA. An equation was developed to describe the relationship between the response variables and the factors. Finally, considering the application of the technique in mining, tests were conducted on tailing samples and solid leaching residues. The tests showed that the technique is effective with tailings due to the high content of fine material and the initial moisture level. However, it was not effective with leaching residues due to the low initial moisture level and the low fine particle content.",,,Journal of Materials Research and Technology,,,,2020-05,2020,,2020-05,9,3,2960-2968,All OA; Gold,Article,"Cánovas, Manuel; Valenzuela, Julio; Romero, Leonardo; González, Paul","Cánovas, Manuel (Metallurgical and Mining Department, Universidad Católica del Norte, Antofagasta, Chile); Valenzuela, Julio (Chemical Engineering Department, Universidad Católica del Norte, Antofagasta, Chile); Romero, Leonardo (Chemical Engineering Department, Universidad Católica del Norte, Antofagasta, Chile); González, Paul (Metallurgical and Mining Department, Universidad Católica del Norte, Antofagasta, Chile)","Cánovas, Manuel (Catholic University of the North)","Cánovas, Manuel (Catholic University of the North); Valenzuela, Julio (Catholic University of the North); Romero, Leonardo (Catholic University of the North); González, Paul (Catholic University of the North)",21,8,,4.27,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmrt.2020.01.046,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1124226574,40 Engineering; 4019 Resources Engineering and Extractive Metallurgy,

Pulse oximetry screening (POS) is useful for early diagnosis and improved outcomes of critical CHD. Here, we describe POS implementation efforts in Latin American countries guided and/or coordinated by the Ibero American Society of Neonatology (SIBEN), as well as the unique challenges that are faced for universal implementation. SIBEN collaborates to improve the neonatal quality of care and outcomes. A few years ago, a Clinical Consensus on POS was finalized. Since then, we have participated in 12 Latin American countries to educate neonatal nurses and neonatologists on POS and to help with its implementation. The findings reveal that despite wide disparities in care that exist between and within countries, and the difficulties and challenges in implementing POS, significant progress has been made. We conclude that universal POS is not easy to implement in Latin America but, when executed, has not only been of significant value for babies with CHD, but also for many with other hypoxemic conditions. The successful and universal implementation of POS in the future is essential for reducing the mortality associated with CHD and other hypoxemic conditions and will ultimately lead to the survival of many more Latin American babies. POS saves newborns' lives in Latin America.","We would like to acknowledge all individuals that contributed without secondary interests so that all babies and families will not have to struggle through unnecessary suffering due to not receiving a simple method that can definitely aid in their well-being. To our mentors, who showed us the way of the noble practice of neonatal medicine, following humane principles and helping others before anything else. To Masimo (Irvine, CA, USA), who generously donated monitors to SIBEN to distribute in different areas to improve neonatal care. Finally, we thank Lara Maksimovic. Without her, SIBEN would not have been able to collaborate with so many babies and families the way it has done so, or maybe it would not even exist today.",This research received no external funding.,International Journal of Neonatal Screening,,,,2020-03-14,2020,2020-03-14,,6,1,21,All OA;

METHODS: Two hundred fifty-three patients were included from three public mental health services from Bolivia, Peru, and Chile. Data were collected using the Drug Attitude Inventory (DAI-10) and the Schizophrenia Quality of Life short-version questionnaire (SQoL-18), which considers 8 dimensions.
RESULTS: Significant associations were found between adherence to antipsychotic medication treatment and QoL (S-QoL-18 index: β = 0.26, p = 0.004; self-esteem: β = 0.37, p = 0.000; and sentimental life: β = 0.20, p = 0.033). Associations of clinical and socio-demographic variables with QoL were identified: severity of psychotic symptoms, awareness of the disease, gender, age, and ethnicity were found to be associated with a lower level of QoL (β from 0.14 -0.56).
CONCLUSION: This study provides evidence of the association between adherence to treatment and quality of life in patients diagnosed with schizophrenia. Therefore, as in developed countries, improving adherence to antipsychotic medication would appear to be an important issue to address to improve patients' QoL in Latin American countries.",This research was funded in part by the Universidad de Tarapacá through Proyecto Mayor de Investigación Cientíﬁca y Tecnológica UTA no. 3732-16.,,Patient Preference and Adherence,,,,2020-09,2020,2020-09,,14,,1595-1604,All OA; Gold,Article,"Caqueo-Urízar, Alejandra; Urzúa, Alfonso; Mena-Chamorro, Patricio; Fond, Guillaume; Boyer, Laurent","Caqueo-Urízar, Alejandra (Instituto de Alta Investigación, Universidad de Tarapacá, Arica, Chile); Urzúa, Alfonso (Escuela de Psicología, Universidad Católica del Norte, Antofagasta, Chile); Mena-Chamorro, Patricio (Escuela de Psicología y Filosofía, Universidad de Tarapacá, Arica, Chile); Fond, Guillaume (Aix-Marseille Univ, EA 3279 – Public Health, Chronic Diseases and Quality of Life - Research Unit, Marseille, 13005, France); Boyer, Laurent (Aix-Marseille Univ, EA 3279 – Public Health, Chronic Diseases and Quality of Life - Research Unit, Marseille, 13005, France)","Caqueo-Urízar, Alejandra (University of Tarapacá)","Caqueo-Urízar, Alejandra (University of Tarapacá); Urzúa, Alfonso (Catholic University of the North); Mena-Chamorro, Patricio (University of Tarapacá); Fond, Guillaume (Aix-Marseille University); Boyer, Laurent (Aix-Marseille University)",13,7,0.83,4.22,https://www.dovepress.com/getfile.php?fileID=61135,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1130554733,42 Health Sciences; 4203 Health Services and Systems,3 Good Health and Well Being

The rise of such an archetypal system progressed through integrative phases, which were essential to draw conclusions based on solid standards. Here, we review the steps adopted in Paspalum to establish the current body of knowledge on apomixis and provide model breeding programs for other agronomically important apomictic crops. In particular, we discuss the need for previous detailed cytoembryological and cytogenetic germplasm characterization; the establishment of sexual and apomictic materials of identical ploidy level; the development of segregating populations useful for inheritance analysis, positional mapping, and epigenetic control studies; the development of omics data resources; the identification of key molecular pathways via comparative gene expression studies; the accurate molecular characterization of genomic loci governing apomixis; the in-depth functional analysis of selected candidate genes in apomictic and model species; the successful building of a sexual/apomictic combined breeding scheme.","We thank Maricel Podio and Lorena Siena (both from IICAR CONICET-UNR, Rosario, Argentina) as well as Giulio Galla (DAFNAE, University of Padua, Italy) for providing some of the images used to illustrate the text.","Agencia Nacional de Promoción Científica y Tecnológica (ANPCyT), Argentina (Project PICT-2017-1956); Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Científicas y Técnicas, Argentina (CONICET) (Projects: PIP 11220150100702CO; PUE 22920160100043CO); Universidad Nacional de Rosario (UNR), Argentina, Project: AGR271; Ufficio Relazioni Internazionali del Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche, Italy (Laboratori Congiunti Bilaterali Internazionali CNR, Prot. 0005651); Ministero degli Affari Esteri, e della Cooperazione Internazionale, Direzione Generale per la Promozione del Sistema Paese (Italy).",Genes,,,"Apomixis; Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental; Gene Expression Regulation, Plant; Models, Biological; Paspalum; Plant Breeding; Plant Proteins; Seeds",2020-08-21,2020,2020-08-21,,11,9,974,All OA; Gold,Article,"Ortiz, Juan Pablo A.; Pupilli, Fulvio; Acuña, Carlos A.; Leblanc, Olivier; Pessino, Silvina C.","Ortiz, Juan Pablo A.

The mopane worm contributes substantially to incomes and food security in households across the region, but little research has addressed its use within South Africa. Using semi-structured interviews with harvesters and resource managers, this paper compares the management of mopane worm resources under public, private, and communal governance systems to explore the ability of each to provide users with sustainable access to the resource. Results show that governance is weaker in the communal property regime compared to the public and private property regimes. Weak control over access and high demand for mopane worms in urban and rural centres may be leading to a concentration of harvesting pressures in communally managed areas, increasing competition for a resource already scarce after years of drought and land-use change.",,,International Journal of the Commons,,,,2020,2020,,2020,14,1,139-153,All OA; Gold,Article,"Sekonya, James George; McClure, Nick J.; Wynberg, Rachel P.","Sekonya, James George (Department of Environmental and Geographical Sciences, University of Cape Town); McClure, Nick J.

Recent studies have suggested that ADHD patients might present with atypical central myelination that can persist into adulthood. Given the essential role of sphingolipids in myelin formation and maintenance, we explored genetic variation in sphingolipid metabolism genes for association with ADHD risk. Whole-exome genotyping was performed in three independent cohorts from disparate regions of the world, for a total of 1520 genotyped subjects. Cohort 1 (MTA (Multimodal Treatment study of children with ADHD) sample, 371 subjects) was analyzed as the discovery cohort, while cohorts 2 (Paisa sample, 298 subjects) and 3 (US sample, 851 subjects) were used for replication. A set of 58 genes was manually curated based on their roles in sphingolipid metabolism. A targeted exploration for association between ADHD and 137 markers encoding for common and rare potentially functional allelic variants in this set of genes was performed in the screening cohort. Single- and multi-locus additive, dominant and recessive linear mixed-effect models were used. During discovery, we found statistically significant associations between ADHD and variants in eight genes (GALC, CERS6, SMPD1, SMPDL3B, CERS2, FADS3, ELOVL5, and CERK). Successful local replication for associations with variants in GALC, SMPD1, and CERS6 was demonstrated in both replication cohorts. Variants rs35785620, rs143078230, rs398607, and rs1805078, associated with ADHD in the discovery or replication cohorts, correspond to missense mutations with predicted deleterious effects. Expression quantitative trait loci analysis revealed an association between rs398607 and increased GALC expression in the cerebellum.","We are grateful to the individuals with ADHD and their families for their participation.

The use of immortalized cell lines simplifies procedures but only allows partial development through one round of parasite invasion and intracellular replication. We have assessed the suitability of Madin-Darby Bovine Kidney (MDBK) cells to support qualitative and quantitative studies on sporozoite invasion and intracellular development of Eimeria tenella. Analysis of parasite ultrastructure by transmission electron microscopy and serial block face-scanning electron microscopy proved the suitability of the system to generate good quality schizonts and first-generation merozoites. Parasite protein expression profiles elucidated by mass spectrometry corroborated previous findings occurring during the development of the parasite such as the presence of alternative types of surface antigen at different stages and increased abundance of proteins from secretory organelles during invasion and endogenous development. Quantitative PCR (qPCR) allowed the tracking of development by detecting DNA division, whereas reverse transcription qPCR of sporozoite- and merozoite-specific genes could detect early changes before cell division and after merozoite formation, respectively. These results correlated with the analysis of development using ImageJ semi-automated image analysis of fluorescent parasites, demonstrating the suitability and reproducibility of the MDBK culture system. This systems also allowed the evaluation of the effects on invasion and development when sporozoites were pre-incubated with anticoccidial drugs, showing similar effects to those reported before. We have described through this study a series of methods and assays for the further application of this in vitro culture model to more complex studies of Eimeria including basic research on parasite cell biology and host-parasite interactions and for screening anticoccidial drugs.",The authors wish to thank Dr. Louise Hughes (Oxford Brookes University) for operation of the SBF-SEM system.

Research supports these conclusions in both U.S. and cross-cultural contexts, even though assumptions about parenting and the parent-child relationship may differ across cultures. However, for true understanding of cultural differences, it is important to have comparable measures across cultures. The purpose of the study is to assess measurement invariance of the two constructs of the Child-parent Relationship Scale using data gathered in programs serving low-income preschool children in the U.S.(n = 4,450) and Turkey (n = 592) from 2014 to 2015. Using Single-group Confirmatory Factor Analysis, the original factor structures of the Turkish and the English versions were tested. Besides, Multigroup Confirmatory Factor Analysis provided evidence for configural, metric, scalar invariance, strict factorial invariance or error variance invariance and construct level invariance across the two versions. Only configural invariance was established, which showed an agreement for the existence of an underlying theoretical construct for each subscale (Conflict and Closeness) of the Turkish and the English versions. However, item CPRS 4 was a non-significant item for Conflict in the Turkish version that affected the possibility to conduct further analyses. Findings encourage researchers to propose and assess cultural and linguistic adaptations for the Child-parent Relationship Scale before cross-cultural comparisons related to family relationships.","MG:Hacettepe University Scientific Research Unit (SDS-2015-5455).

A non-random sample of 1429 employees was used who had been working at least one year in the current company. The sample, composed of workers from different industries, was collected in postgraduate programs of business schools from seven Latin American countries. A multi-group structural equation model was built with the involved variables, which adopted two different conditions: i.e., unconstrained and constrained questionnaire measurement weights. According to the results, leadership by itself is insufficient to promote employees innovative work behaviour. Transformational and transactional leadership exert effect on this behaviour only through absorptive capacity and work engagement respectively. Likewise, absorptive capacity and employee work engagement show direct effects on innovative work behaviour. Additionally, organizational climate for innovation shows a significant moderating effect on the all relationships included in the model. Despite the cultural differences, the two-condition model yielded the same effect in each country, which indicates the validity of a general model of innovative work behaviour for the whole region supporting the common identity of this region. As a conclusion, leadership practices are needed to encourage innovative work behaviour within the Latin American organizational context, however some individual (engagement) and organizational (absorptive capacity) conditions are also needed to ensure this effect.

Protocols for sequencing and assembling mitogenomes include ‘primer walking’ or ‘long PCR’ followed by Sanger sequencing or Illumina short-read low-coverage whole genome (LC-WGS) sequencing with or without prior enrichment of mitochondrial DNA. The aforementioned strategies assemble complete and accurate mitochondrial genomes but are time consuming and/or expensive. In this study, I first tested whether mitogenomes can be sequenced from long-read nanopore sequencing data exclusively. Second, I explored the accuracy of the long-read assembled genomes by comparing them to a ‘gold’ standard reference mitogenome retrieved from the same individual using Illumina sequencing. Third and lastly, I tested if the long-read assemblies are useful for mitophylogenomics and barcoding research. To accomplish these goals, I used the Caribbean spiny lobster Panulirus argus, an ecologically relevant species in shallow water coral reefs and target of the most lucrative fishery in the greater Caribbean region. ResultsLC-WGS using a MinION ONT device and various de-novo and reference-based assembly pipelines retrieved a complete and highly accurate mitogenome for the Caribbean spiny lobster Panulirus argus. Discordance between each of the long-read assemblies and the reference mitogenome was mostly due to indels at the flanks of homopolymer regions. Although not ‘perfect’, phylogenetic analyses using entire mitogenomes or a fragment of the cox1 gene demonstrated that mitogenomes assembled using long reads reliably identify the sequenced specimen as belonging to P. argus and distinguish it from other related species in the same genus, family, and superorder.ConclusionsThis study serves as a proof-of-concept for the future implementation of in-situ surveillance protocols using the MinION to detect mislabeling in P. argus across its supply chain. Mislabeling detection will improve fishery management in this overexploited lobster. This study will additionally aid in decreasing costs for exploring meta-population connectivity in the Caribbean spiny lobster and will aid with the transfer of genomics technology to low-income countries.","The author would like to thank Tom Matthews (FFWCC) and his team at the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission for their help in collecting specimens.

The analysis of the institutional collaboration is carried out by constructing joint work networks, using the UCINET software. The first institution registered in the “top of collaboration”, published in the ResearchGate profile of each Higher Education Institution, is taken in account. The results shows that accredited institutions have a well-connected and integrated collaboration network. On the other hand, the non-accredited institutions have a weak and poorly integrated collaboration network. In addition, non-accredited universities seek to collaborate mostly with accredited institutions and not between them.

Here we describe a new elasmobranch assemblage from the rich fossil site of Montañita-Olón (Dos Bocas Formation, Santa Elena, Ecuador), where other vertebrates have already been described: for example, sea turtles and cetaceans. We report a total of 27 elasmobranch taxa, 19 of which are new fossil records for Ecuador, 10 new records for the Central Eastern Pacific and four new records for South America. Additionally, in order to reconstruct the environment where these marine remains were deposited, we performed abundance, paleobathymetric and habitat preference analyses, concluding that they were likely deposited in an outer neritic (open shelf) environment. The study of Oligocene and early Miocene marine elasmobranchs faunas in Tropical America is key to addressing the issues in the evolutionary history of this group.","This study was supported by the project from the Universidad Estatal Península de Santa Elena, (Instituto de investigación Científica y Desarrollo Tecnológico) code 91870000.0000.381019.

There is little knowledge regarding the clinical events leading to the death of patients with CHIK-F. This study aimed to systematically review the literature regarding CHIK-F and identify clinical features preceding death. We searched PubMed, Scopus, Embase, Lilacs, and IsiWeb for case-reports, case-series, or cohorts of CHIK-F reporting at least one death, up to December 2019. Fifty-seven reports were analyzed, including 2140 deaths. Data about specific clinical events that precede death are scarce. The central tendency of time between disease onset and death ranged from 2 days to 150 days. The most common clinical findings among decedents were fever (22.0%), arthralgia (15.7%), myalgia (10.7%), and headache (8.2%). Excluding pediatric populations, the reported central tendency of age among the decedents was 53 or older, with a non-weighted median of 67, ranging up to 80 years old. Authors mentioned organic dysfunction in 91.2% reports. Among all the 2140 decedents, the most common dysfunctions were cardiovascular (7.2%), respiratory (6.4%), neurological (5.4%), renal (4.2%), liver (3.0%), and hematological (1.3%) dysfunction. Exacerbation of previous diabetes (5.6%) or hypertension (6.9%) was mentioned as conditions preceding death.

This effect is particularly true for the least developed countries. Nevertheless, there is a lack of studies that analyze this phenomenon in these nations. In this context, this study aims to examine the impact of perceived barriers to innovation to predict companies′ innovative intentions in an emerging economy. This study is a preliminary effort to use data mining and symmetry-based learning concepts, especially classification, to assist the identification of strategies to incentivize intention to innovate in companies. Using the decision tree classification technique, we analyzed a sample of Chilean companies (N = 5876). The sample was divided into large enterprises (LEs) and small and medium enterprises (SMEs). In the group of large companies, the barriers that most impact the intention to innovate are innovation cost, lack of demand innovations, and lack of qualified personnel. Alternatively, in the group of small-medium companies, the barriers that most impact the intention to innovate are lack of own funds, lack of demand innovations, and lack of information about technology. These results show how the perceptions of barriers are significant to predict the intentions of innovation in Chilean companies. Furthermore, the perceptions of these barriers are contingent on the organizational sizes. These findings contribute to understanding the effect of contingencies on innovative intention in an emerging economy.",,The APC was partially funded by UCN.,Symmetry,,,,2020-08-19,2020,2020-08-19,,12,9,1381,All OA; Gold,Article,"Rojas-Córdova, Carolina; Heredia-Rojas, Boris; Ramírez-Correa, Patricio","Rojas-Córdova, Carolina (Department of Industrial Engineering, Universidad Católica del Norte, Antofagasta 1240000, Chile); Heredia-Rojas, Boris (Department of Construction Management, Universidad Católica del Norte, Antofagasta 1240000, Chile;, bheredia@ucn.cl); Ramírez-Correa, Patricio (School of Engineering, Universidad Católica del Norte, Coquimbo 1781421, Chile;, patricio.ramirez@ucn.cl)","Rojas-Córdova, Carolina (Catholic University of the North)","Rojas-Córdova, Carolina (Catholic University of the North); Heredia-Rojas, Boris (Catholic University of the North); Ramírez-Correa, Patricio (Catholic University of the North)",11,7,,3.93,https://www.mdpi.com/2073-8994/12/9/1381/pdf?version=1597802024,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1130226202,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3503 Business Systems In Context; 3507 Strategy, Management and Organisational Behaviour; 46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4609 Information Systems","9 Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure"

Soil physical quality was assessed through a set of physical variables, such as bulk density, porosity, soil macro-aggregation state, Visual Evaluation of Soil Structure (VESS) and penetration resistance, which were summarized in an overall synthetic indicator of physical quality. Besides, transects of 20 × 2 m were established in each land use; each transect was divided into four sections of 5 m to search and collect termites during 1 hour in each section; likewise, termites were collected from blocks of soil 25 × 25 × 10 cm (length, width, and depth, respectively) adapted from the Tropical Soil Biology and Fertility (TSBF) method. In total, 60 transects were evaluated, 20 in each land use. A total of 41 species were collected across the three land uses evaluated: natural regeneration presented 60% of the collected species (25 species), silvopastoral systems 53% (22 species), and rubber plantations 39% (16 species). Additionally, composition species from the silvopastoral, agroforestry systems, and natural regeneration were different, and a close association between these last land uses was observed. Soil physical characteristics showed significant variations between land uses. The rubber plantations presented lowest values of soil physical quality, while the natural regeneration showed high soil physical quality. These changes affected termite community and lead to changes in its composition with disproportionate loss of some species; however, there are some that can acclimate well to the decline in the soil physical quality.","We were grateful to the Universidad de la Amazonia for funding this work as part of the project Provision of Soil Ecosystem Services by Termite Species in the Colombian Amazon Region.

Late Quaternary volcanic basins are active landscapes from which detailed archives of past climate and seismic and volcanic activity can be obtained. A multidisciplinary study performed on a transect of sediment cores was used to reconstruct the depositional evolution of the high-elevation Laguna del Maule (LdM) (36∘ S, 2180 m a.s.l., Chilean Andes). The recovered 5 m composite sediment sequence includes two thick turbidite units (LT1 and LT2) and numerous tephra layers (23 ash and 6 lapilli). We produced an age model based on nine new 14C AMS dates, existing 210Pb and 137Cs data, and the Quizapú ash horizon (1932 CE). According to this age model, the relatively drier Early Holocene was followed by a phase of increased productivity during the mid-Holocene and higher lake levels after 4.0 ka cal BP. Major hydroclimate transitions occurred at ca. 11, 8.0, 4.0 and 0.5 ka cal BP. Decreased summer insolation and winter precipitation due to a southward shift in the southern westerly winds and a strengthened Pacific Subtropical High could explain Early Holocene lower lake levels. Increased biological productivity during the mid-Holocene (∼8.0 to 6.0 ka cal BP) is coeval with a warm–dry phase described for much of southern South America. Periods of higher lake productivity are synchronous to a higher frequency of volcanic events. During the Late Holocene, the tephra layers show compositional changes suggesting a transition from silica-rich to silica-poor magmas at around 4.0 ka cal BP. This transition was synchronous with increased variability of sedimentary facies and geochemical proxies, indicating higher lake levels and increased moisture at LdM after 4.0 ka cal BP, most likely caused by the inception of current El Niño–Southern Oscillation and Pacific Decadal Oscillation (ENSO–PDO) dynamics in central Chile.","We thank Raquel Lopez, Elena Royo, Claudia Alcaino, Carlota Escutia, Ariadna Salabarnada, Hector Orellana, Feña, Pol Tarrats, and Ana L.

The 87Sr/86Sr in human bioapatite reflects the geological signature of food and water consumed during tissue development. Modeling relationships between 87Sr/86Sr in human environments, food webs, and archeological human tissues is critical for moving from identifying non-locals to determining their likely provenience. In the Andes, obstacles to sample geolocation include overlapping 87Sr/86Sr of distant geographies and a poor understanding of mixed strontium sources in food and drink. Here, water is investigated as a proxy for bioavailable strontium in archeological human skeletal and dental tissues. This study develops a water 87Sr/86Sr isoscape from 262 samples (220 new and 42 published samples), testing the model with published archeological human skeletal 87Sr/86Sr trimmed of probable non-locals. Water 87Sr/86Sr and prediction error between the predicted and measured 87Sr/86Sr for the archeological test set are compared by elevation, underlying geology, and watershed size. Across the Peruvian Andes, water 87Sr/86Sr ranges from 0.7049 to 0.7227 (M = 0.7081, SD = 0.0027). Water 87Sr/86Sr is higher in the highlands, in areas overlying older bedrock, and in larger watersheds, characteristics which are geographically correlated. Spatial outliers identified are from canals, wells, and one stream, suggesting those sources could show non-representative 87Sr/86Sr. The best-fit water 87Sr/86Sr isoscape achieves prediction errors for archeological samples ranging from 0.0017 – 0.0031 (M = 0.0012, n = 493). The water isoscape explains only 7.0% of the variation in archeological skeletal 87Sr/86Sr (R2 = 0.07), but 90.0% of archeological skeleton 87Sr/86Sr fall within the site isoscape prediction ± site prediction standard error. Due to lower sampling density and higher geological variability in the highlands, the water 87Sr/86Sr isoscape is more useful for ruling out geographic origins for lowland dwellers than for highlanders. Baseline studies are especially needed in the highlands and poorly sampled regions. Because the results demonstrate that a geostatistical water model is insufficient for fully predicting human 87Sr/86Sr variation, future work will incorporate additional substrates like plants, fauna, soils, and dust, aiming to eventually generate a regression and process-based mixing model for the probabilistic geolocation of Andean samples.","Water sample collection and analysis was supported primarily by: a National Science Foundation SBE Postdoctoral Fellowship to BS (award number 1809470), a Collaborative Research Grant from the Center for Bioarchaeological Research at Arizona State University to BS, TT, and KK, and a Vanderbilt University Research Scholar Grant to TT.

Thus, the relationships among agricultural food production diversity (FPD), dietary diversity (DD), and household food insecurity (HFI) of the rural small holder farmers need further study. Therefore, we examined these associations in small holder farmers residing in this Province in the Andes Highlands (elevation > 2500 m). Non-pregnant maternal home managers (n = 558, x age = 44.1, SD = 16.5 y) were interviewed regarding the number of different agricultural food crops cultivated and domestic animals raised in their family farm plots. DD was determined using the Minimum Dietary Diversity for Women Score (MDD-W) based on the number of 10 different food groups consumed, and household food insecurity (HFI) was determined using the 8-item Household Food Insecurity Experience Scale. The women reported consuming an average of 53% of their total food from what they cultivated or raised. Women with higher DD [MMD-W score ≥ 5 food groups (79% of total sample)] were on farms that cultivated a greater variety of crops (x = 8.7 vs. 6.7), raised more animals (x = 17.9 vs. 12.7, p < 0.05), and reported lower HFI and significantly higher intakes of energy, protein, iron, zinc, and vitamin A (all p < 0.05). Multiple regression analyses demonstrated that FPD was only modestly related to DD, which together with years of education, per capita family income, and HFI accounted for 26% of DD variance. In rural areas of the Imbabura Province, small holder farmers still rely heavily on consumption of self-cultivated foods, but greater diversity of crops grown in family farm plots is only weakly associated with greater DD and lower HFI among the female caretakers.","We want to thank the study participants for their generous donation of time to provide information for this study.

Given their harmful effects, this study had two aims; first, to evaluate the effect of cumulative or chronic exposure to OP/CB pesticides on the neurobehavioral performance of agricultural workers and rural inhabitants; second, to determine if changes in the neurobehavioral performance are associated to changes in blood biomarkers of OP/CB pesticides during the spray season, when exposure is higher.MethodsFor the first aim, a cross sectional study of neurobehavioral performance in adult volunteers (men and women, 18–50 years-old, right-handed) was carried out in the pre-spray season. Sampling was done by convenience and a questionnaire was used to categorize participants depending on their level of chronic exposure, as either: occupationally exposed (OE, n = 87), environmentally exposed (EE, n = 81), or non-exposed controls or reference group (RG, n = 100). A neurobehavioral test battery consisting of 21 tests to measure cognitive, motor and emotional state was applied. For the second aim, neurobehavioral measures were taken a second time from EE and OE groups during the spray season, and their exposure corroborated by blood-based biomarker inhibition.ResultsLower neurobehavioral performance was observed in the pre-spray evaluation of EE and OE groups compared to the non-exposed, OE being the worst performing group. Seasonal exposure impaired performance in both exposure groups on all tests except those on attention and mood. Data modeling of the basal (pre-spray) measurements showed that the level of exposure was the best predictor of performance. During spraying, inhibition of BChE activity in the EE group was the best predictor of low performance in tests measuring logical, auditory and visual memory, inhibitory control of cognitive interference, constructional and planning abilities, executive functions, and motor speed and coordination.ConclusionLong-term occupational or environmental exposure to pesticides caused impairment in neurobehavioral functioning, which worsened during the spraying season, mainly in EE. BChE inhibition was the best predictor for seasonal neurobehavioral changes in EE.","The authors thank the Department of Occupational Health of the Institute of Public Health of Chile (ISP) for supporting this research.

This study aimed to develop the autotrophic and heterotrophic culture of Tetraselmis suecica (Kylin) Butcher in order to increase EPS production and to characterize its antioxidant activity and cytotoxic effects on tumor cells. The adaptation of autotrophic to heterotrophic culture was carried out by progressively reducing the photoperiod and adding glucose. EPS extraction and purification were performed. EPS were characterized by Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The antioxidant capacity of EPS was analyzed by the 2,2'-azino-bis (3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulphonic acid) (ABTS) method, and the antitumor capacity was measured by the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay, showing high activity on human leukemia, breast and lung cancer cell lines. Although total EPS showed no cytotoxicity, acidic EPS showed cytotoxicity over the gingival fibroblasts cell line. Heterotrophic culture has advantages over autotrophic, such as increasing EPS yield, higher antioxidant capacity of the EPS and, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first probe that T. suecica EPS have cytotoxic effects on tumor cells; therefore, they could offer greater advantages as possible natural nutraceuticals for the pharmaceutical industry.",We want to express our gratitude to the Photobiology and Biotechnology of Aquatic Organisms (FYBOA) research group (RNM-295) for their technical support.

These situations affect the enjoyment of the rights of minors, so the state is obliged to implement actions to minimize such risk factors. The purpose of this study was to analyze Colombian school coexistence policies in the context of Latin America in order to reveal the approaches and important aspects in the improvement of interpersonal relationships. The methodology was to review and analyze documents from sources such as laws, decrees, court rulings, ministerial guides, theses and articles that lead to the understanding of three aspects: the legal basis, the alternatives implemented and the dimensions not considered. According to the approaches of understanding around and within Latin America, it is found that Colombia is guided by the democratic vision which means to form for the exercise of the human rights from the values of the republic such as freedom, justice and dignity; according to this process the interaction between the student and the teacher goes further the actual classroom, the process enables a relationship with external administrative entities and the health organizations.

The research was conducted in four stages: 1- literature review; 2- insertion in the research field; 3- collection and analysis of information; 4- feedback of the research to the participants and the community. The participants were 03 women: 01 young (20 years), 01 adult (47 years) and 01 elderly (71 years). Semi-structured interviews were conducted with two themes: daily life experiences as black quilombola women; and the meanings produced by interviewees about the quilombola identity. After transcription, the interviews were analyzed by content analysis methods and produced two thematic categories: a) experiences of oppression of black quilombola women; b) diversity of meaning about quilombola identity. Women understand the quilombo as a place of affirmation of their ways of life as black women, as well as a place of reproduction of logics of oppression against the intersectionality of ethnic-racial and gender markers. There was also a generational difference as to the way of understanding the quilombola identity in the life of the young woman and the elderly participant. It is necessary to understand the specificities with which each community and its members interpret the quilombola identity in their lives and activities, in the understanding that it can work as an enhancer in the affirmation of these black territories.",,,Psicologia em Estudo,,,,2020-06-23,2020,2020-06-23,,25,,,All OA; Gold,Article,"Fernandes, Saulo Luders; Galindo, Dolores Cristina Gomes; Valencia, Liliana Parra","Fernandes, Saulo Luders (Universidade Federal de Alagoas (UFAL)); Galindo, Dolores Cristina Gomes (Universidade Federal do Mato Grosso (UFMT)); Valencia, Liliana Parra (Universidad Cooperativa de Colombia)",,"Fernandes, Saulo Luders (Federal University of Alagoas); Galindo, Dolores Cristina Gomes (Universidade Federal do Mato Grosso (UFMT)); Valencia, Liliana Parra (Cooperative University of Colombia)",6,4,,3.77,https://www.periodicos.uem.br/ojs/index.php/PsicolEstud/article/download/45031/751375150219,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1133761400,44 Human Society; 4405 Gender Studies,

As an effort to characterize those organisms, traditionally named as Rickettsia or Chlamydia-like organisms, 1950 specimens comprising 22 mollusk species were collected over 10 countries and after histology examination, a selection of 99 samples involving 20 species were subjected to 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing. Phylogenetic analysis showed Endozoicomonadaceae sequences in all the mollusk species analyzed. Geographical differences in the distribution of Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs) and a particular OTU associated with pathology in king scallop (OTU_2) were observed. The presence of Endozoicomonadaceae sequences in the IMC was visually confirmed by in situ hybridization (ISH) in eight selected samples. Sequencing data also indicated other symbiotic bacteria. Subsequent phylogenetic analysis of those OTUs revealed a novel microbial diversity associated with molluskan IMC infection distributed among different taxa, including the phylum Spirochetes, the families Anaplasmataceae and Simkaniaceae, the genera Mycoplasma and Francisella, and sulfur-oxidizing endosymbionts. Sequences like Francisella halioticida/philomiragia and Candidatus Brownia rhizoecola were also obtained, however, in the absence of ISH studies, the association between those organisms and the IMCs were not confirmed. The sequences identified in this study will allow for further molecular characterization of the microbial community associated with IMC infection in marine mollusks and their correlation with severity of the lesions to clarify their role as endosymbionts, commensals or true pathogens.","We want to thank Cefas Seedcorn for their support in drafting this study.

Although hair is used for reflecting the systemic level of this hormone, its use as a ""long-term"" measure appears clinically problematic. Local and systemic stress and non-stress related factors may release cortisol that is accumulated in hair. Non-stressful earwax sampling methods may provide a more accurate specimen to measure chronic cortisol concentration.
METHODS: Earwax from both ears of 37 controls were extracted using a clinical procedure commonly associated with local pain. One month later, earwax from the left ear side was extracted using the same procedure, and earwax from the right ear side was more comfortably obtained, using a novel earwax self-sampling device. Participants also provided one centimetre of hair that represented the retrospective month of cortisol output, and one serum sample that reflected the effect of systemic stressors on cortisol levels. Earwax (ECC), Hair (HCC) and Serum (SCC) Cortisol Concentration were correlated and compared. Confounders' effect on cortisol levels were studied.
RESULTS: The highest levels of cortisol concentration were found in serum, and the lowest in hair (p < 0.01). Left-ECC was larger than Right-ECC (p = 0.03). Right-ECC was the only sample unaffected by confounders (all p > 0.05). A Pearson correlation showed that Right-ECC and HCC samples were moderately correlated between them (r = 0.39; p = 0.03).
CONCLUSIONS: The self-sampling device did not increase cortisol locally. It provided the cortisol level that was least likely to be affected by confounding factors over the previous month. ECC using the novel device might constitute another accurate, but more suitable and affordable specimen for measuring chronic cortisol concentration.",The authors would like to thank Tomas Valdenegro and Bruno Aguilo for their support analysing the data and Dr Mark Coulson and Mr Joel Cols for his support in preparing and editing the manuscript.

In this sense, a sample of 246 students of business administration and public accounting was taken from the North Headquarters of Cauca of the Universidad del Valle in Colombia, a geographical area that hashistorically presented economic and social problems. The descriptive results show that around 70% of the students were interested in being entrepreneurs, being their main motivation to undertake family and personal security and what most discourages the lack of capital for it; meanwhile, the differences in means and linear regressions applied as statistical techniques confirm that the greater the global motivation, the greater the entrepreneurial intention in people.

Here we present new phylogeographic analyses in the pulmonate Siphonaria lessonii across its distribution, from northern Chile in the Pacific to Uruguay in the Atlantic. Contrary to our expectations, populations from the southwestern Atlantic, an area that was less impacted by ice during glacial maxima, showed low genetic diversity and evidence of recent expansion, similar to the patterns recorded in this study across heavily ice-impacted areas in the Pacific Magellan margin. We propose that Atlantic and Pacific shallow marine hard-substrate benthic species were both affected during the Quaternary in South America, but by different processes. At higher latitudes of the southeast Pacific, ice-scouring drastically affected S. lessonii populations compared to non-glaciated areas along the Chile-Peru province where the species was resilient. In the southwest Atlantic, S. lessonii populations would have been dramatically impacted by the reduction of near-shore rocky habitat availability as a consequence of glacio-eustatic movements. The increase of gravelly and rocky shore substrates in the southwest Atlantic supports a hypothesis of glacial refugia from where the species recolonized lower latitudes across the Atlantic and Pacific margins. Our results suggest that current patterns of genetic diversity and structure in near-shore marine benthic species do not solely depend on the impact of Quaternary glacial ice expansions but also on the availability of suitable habitats and life-history traits, including developmental mode, bathymetry and the likelihood of dispersal by rafting.","Several projects and institutions are greatly appreciated, including a Fondecyt Initiation Project 11140087, the program FONDAP IDEAL, Project 15150003 and the INACH project RG_18–17 to C.

We aimed to estimate the frequency of self-medication and associated factors in users of drugstores and pharmacies in Peru. Methods: We performed a secondary data analysis of the 2015 National Survey on User Satisfaction of Health Services (ENSUSALUD), a two-stage probabilistic sample of all regions of Peru. Non self-medication (NSM), responsible self-medication (RSM) and irresponsible self-medication (ISM) were defined as the outcome categories. Demographic, social, cultural and health system variables were included as covariates. We calculated relative prevalence ratios (RPR) with their 95% confidence intervals (95%CI) using crude and adjusted multinomial logistic regression models for complex samples with NSM as the referent category. Results: 2582 participants were included. The average age was 41.4 years and the frequencies of NSM, RSM and ISM were 25.2%, 23.8% and 51.0%; respectively. The factors associated with RSM were male gender (RPR: 1.35; 95%CI: 1.06-1.72), being between 40 and 59 years old (RPR: 0.53; 95%IC: 0.39-0.72), being 60 or older (RPR: 0.39; 95%IC: 0.25-0.59), not having health insurance (RPR: 1.89; 95%CI: 1.31-2.71) and living in the Highlands region (RPR: 2.27; 95%CI: 1.23-4.21). The factors associated with ISM were male gender (RPR: 1.41; 95%CI: 1.16-1.72), being between 40 and 59 years old (RPR: 0.68; 95%IC: 0.53-0.88), being 60 or older (RPR: 0.65; 95%IC: 0.48-0.88) and not having health insurance (RPR: 2.03; 95%CI: 1.46-2.83).

In order to robustly model magma evolution and assimilation at subduction zones such as the Andes, the compositions of parental magmas feeding crustal magma reservoirs need to be defined. Here we present new olivine and clinopyroxene oxygen isotope data from rare mafic volcanic rocks erupted at the margins of the giant Altiplano-Puna Magma Body (APMB) of the Altiplano-Puna Volcanic Complex, Central Andes. Existing olivine and pyroxene δ18O values for the Central Andes are highly variable and potentially not representative of sub-arc parental compositions. However, new olivine (n = 6) and clinopyroxene (n = 12) δ18O values of six Central Andean volcanoes presented here display a narrow range, with averages at 6.0‰ ± 0.2 (2σ S.D.) and 6.7‰ ± 0.3 (2σ S.D.), consistent with a common history for the investigated minerals. These data allow us to estimate the δ18O values of sub-arc, parental melts to ca. 7.0‰ ± 0.2 (2σ S.D.). Parental melts feeding the APMB and associated volcanic centres are postulated to form in the felsic continental crust following assimilation of up to 28% high-δ18O basement rocks by mantle-derived magmas.","We thank the two anonymous reviewers for their constructive suggestions and comments that helped to significantly improve this manuscript, and Christoph Beier for editorial handling.

One of the main challenges the country faces today is the presence of a great number of mine tailings containing heavy metals, such as Cu, Cr, Ni, Zn, Pb, As, Cd, and Fe, which make up a potential risk for the population. This study is intended to develop a methodology for determining tailings requiring urgent treatment in Chile, based on risks associated with heavy metals. Geochemical data from 530 Chilean tailings were compared to the Dutch norm and the Canadian and Australian soil quality guidelines for residential use. Additionally, criteria about residents and water bodies were used, considering a 2-km area of influence around tailings. To do this, QGIS (Böschacherstrasse 10a CH-8624 Grüt (Gossau ZH),Zurich, Switzerland), a geospatial tool, was used to geolocate each deposit, considering regions, communes, rivers, lakes, and populated areas. To evaluate potential ecological contamination risks, Hakanson's methodology was used. Results revealed the presence of 12 critical tailings in Chile that require urgent treatment. From the 530 tailings evaluated, 195 are located at less than 2 km from a populated area and 154 at less than 2 km from a water body. In addition, 347 deposits require intervention: 30 on Cu, 30 on Cr, 13 on Zn, 69 on Pb, 138 on As, 1 on Cd, and 5 on Hg.","The authors are thankful to “Rapid Implementation Projects—Pilot Scaling”, Universidad Católica del Norte, Engineering Project 2030, 16ENl2-71940, for the financial support of this project.","This research was funded by “Rapid Implementation Projects—Pilot Scaling”, Universidad Católica del Norte, Engineering Project 2030, 16ENl2-71940.",International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health,,,"Australia; Canada; Chile; Environmental Monitoring; Metals, Heavy; Soil Pollutants; Switzerland",2020-06-01,2020,2020-06-02,2020-06-01,17,11,3948,All OA; Gold,Article,"Lam, Elizabeth J.; Montofré, Italo L.; Álvarez, Fernando A.; Gaete, Natalia F.; Poblete, Diego A.; Rojas, Rodrigo J.","Lam, Elizabeth J.

In this sense, this paper aims at developing an intelligent system that allows interactive teaching in basic education using videogames. In particular, high school students’ skills in basic mathematical operations with fractions were used for testing experimentally the approach. An intelligent system was developed using computational techniques such as fuzzy logic and case-based reasoning to evaluate user performance and recommend additional study material according to the specific challenges from the given educational game. The use of the games was supported by ICT (information and communication technologies) tools on a web platform. Such a developed platform was tested by 206 high school students, who played 5400 games in total. The students showed an improvement of around 14% in the topics covered. The results indicate that the implementation jointly of videogames and intelligent systems allows users to improve their performance in the given topics.","This work was supported by Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla - Colombia.

CHIKV causes a severe and debilitating disease with high morbidity. The first Colombian autochthonous case was reported in the Colombian Caribbean region in September 2014. Within the next two to three months, the CHIKV outbreak reached its peak. Although the CHIKV pattern of clinical symptomatology has been documented in different epidemiological studies, understanding of the relationship between clinical symptomatology and variation in phenotypic response to CHIKV infection in humans remains limited. We performed a cross sectional study following 1160 individuals clinically diagnosed with CHIKV at the peak of the Chikungunya outbreak in the Colombian Caribbean region. We examined the relationship between symptomatology and diverse phenotypic responses. Latent Class Cluster Analysis (LCCA) models were used to characterize patients' symptomatology and further identify subgroups of individuals with differential phenotypic response. We found that most individuals presented fever (94.4%), headache (73.28%) and general discomfort (59.4%), which are distinct clinical symptoms of a viral infection. Furthermore, 11/26 (43.2%) of the categorized symptoms were more frequent in women than in men. LCCA disclosed seven distinctive phenotypic response profiles in this population of CHIKV infected individuals. Interestingly, 282 (24.3%) individuals exhibited a lower symptomatic ""extreme"" phenotype and 74 (6.4%) patients were within the severe complex ""extreme"" phenotype. Although clinical symptomatology may be diverse, there are distinct symptoms or group of symptoms that can be correlated with differential phenotypic response and perhaps susceptibility to CHIKV infection, especially in the female population. This suggests that, comparatively to men, women are a CHIKV at-risk population. Further study is needed to validate these results and determine whether the distinct LCCA profiles are a result of the immune response or a mixture of genetic, lifestyle and environmental factors. Our findings could contribute to the development of machine learning approaches to characterizing CHIKV infection in other populations. Preliminary results have shown prediction models achieving up to 92% accuracy overall, with substantial sensitivity, specificity and accuracy values per LCCA-derived cluster.",The author(s) received no specific funding for this work.

The sample consisted of 511 workers from public hospitals in the Community of Madrid. Psychological health was evaluated using the GHQ-28 Questionnaire; and sleep habits with the CHAS Questionnaire. In addition, sociodemographic data were collected, such as age, sex, job position, professional category. The results showed statistically significant differences in somatic symptoms, psychological health and stability in sleep habits. Regression analysis indicated that sleep quality and daytime sleepiness are the variables most related to health dimensions, especially with anxiety/insomnia and somatic symptoms. These results reveal the differences between sleep habits and perceived health in nursing staff and physicians. Finally, the health workers present a higher prevalence of psychological distress, and poor sleep quality and instability in sleep hours.

One of the affected resources is the scallop Argopecten purpuratus. Even though this species has a high commercial importance in Northern Chile and Peru, the characteristics of its DA depuration are not known. In this work, the DA depuration was studied by means of two experiments: one in controlled (laboratory) and another in natural conditions. All organs of A. purpuratus depurated the toxin very quickly in both experiments. In some organs, an increase or a very small decrease of toxin was detected in the early depuration steps. Several models were used to describe this kinetics. The one that included toxin transfer between organs and independent depuration from each organ was the model that best fit the data. It seems, therefore, that the DA in this species is quickly transferred from the digestive gland to all other organs, which release it into the environment. Physiological differences in the two experiments have been shown to have some effect on the depuration from each organ but the actual reasons are still unknown.",We have to acknowledge to Christian Tapia and Pamela Tapia (Invertec Ostimar Company) for their support.,"This research was funded by the “ANID + FONDEF/PRIMER CONCURSO INVESTIGACIÓN TECNOLÓGICA TEMATICO EN SISTEMAS PESQUERO ACUICOLAS FRENTE A FLORECIMIENTOS ALGALES NOCIVOS FANS IDeA DEL FONDO DE FOMENTO AL DESARROLLO CIENTÍFICO Y TECNOLÓGICO, FONDEF/ANID 2017, IT17F10002 developed within the framework of a cooperation agreement between the Consellería do Mar, Xunta de Galicia, Spain and the Universidad Católica del Norte, Chile.

176,pub.1127977998,10.1111/ddi.13072,,,Cryptic speciation in gentoo penguins is driven by geographic isolation and regional marine conditions: Unforeseen vulnerabilities to global change,"Abstract  Aim  The conservation of biodiversity is hampered by data deficiencies, with many new species and subspecies awaiting description or reclassification. Population genomics and ecological niche modelling offer complementary new tools for uncovering functional units of phylogenetic diversity. We hypothesize that phylogenetically delineated lineages of gentoo penguins ( Pygoscelis papua ) distributed across Antarctica and sub‐Antarctic Islands are subject to spatially explicit ecological conditions that have limited gene flow, facilitating genetic differentiation, and thereby speciation processes.    Location Antarctica and sub‐Antarctic area.   Methods  We identify divergent lineages for gentoo penguins using ddRAD‐seq and mtDNA, and generated species distribution models (SDMs) based on terrestrial and marine parameters .    Results Analyses of our genomic data supports the existence of four major lineages of gentoo penguin: (i) spanning the sub‐Antarctic archipelagos north of the Antarctic Polar Front (APF); (ii) Kerguelen Island; (iii) South America; and (iv) across maritime Antarctic and the Scotia Arc archipelagos. The APF, a major current system around Antarctica, acts as the most important barrier separating regional sister lineages. Our ecological analyses spanning both the terrestrial (breeding sites) and marine (feeding sites) realms recover limited niche overlap among the major lineages of gentoo penguin. We observe this pattern to correspond more closely with regional differentiation of marine conditions than to terrestrial macroenvironmental features.   Main conclusions Recognition of regional genetic lineages as discrete evolutionary entities that occupy distinct ecological niches and also differ morphologically should be considered a priority for conservation. Gentoo penguins provide a good example of how conservation policy can be directly impacted by new insights obtained through the integration of larger genomic datasets with novel approaches to ecological modelling. This is particularly pertinent to polar environments that are among the most rapidly changing environments on earth.","Financial support was provided by INACH RT_12–14, Fondecyt Project 1150517, GAB (PIA CONICYT ACT172065), the CNPq (482501/2013‐8 and 431463/2016‐6) and the PROANTAR, IPEV prog 354 ETHOTAAF and by the Spanish Research Agency (CGL2004‐01348, CGL2007‐60369, POL2006‐06635 and CTM2015‐64720‐R).

2726,pub.1125774209,10.5867/medwave.2020.02.7839,32191682,,The social determinants of child malnutrition in Colombia from a family medicine perspective,"CONTEXT: Child malnutrition is a public health problem not only in Colombia but throughout the world, as it increases mortality associated with preventable causes. In Colombia, poverty is one of those causes present mainly in rural areas where one in 10 children suffers from malnutrition.
METHODOLOGY: We searched ScienceDirect, PubMed, ClinicalKey, and SciELO for references on child malnutrition, its social determinants, and elements for its intervention in Colombia.
RESULTS: The review allowed us to identify that many factors influence this problem determined not only by the lack of food but also by other factors such as poverty, lack of resources, restricted access to health care, rising prices of essential foods, political conflicts leading forced displacement, drought, the absence of an equity-based policy approach, poor environmental sanitation, among others.
CONCLUSIONS: Child malnutrition should not be conceived as mainly a food-related problem. Other factors that influence this problem should also be taken into account in order to prevent it. Trained personnel should be deployed to intervene in the social determinants that underpin child malnutrition.

Follicular growth is determined by granulosa cells (GCs), theca cells (TCs), and oocyte at the transcription, translation, and secretion levels. With the development of bioinformatic and experimental techniques, non-coding RNAs have been shown to participate in many life events. In this study, we investigated the transcriptomes of GCs and TCs in three different physiological stages: small yellow follicle (SYF), smallest hierarchical follicle (F6), and largest hierarchical follicle (F1) stages. A differential expression (DE) analysis, weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA), and bioinformatic analyses were performed. A total of 18,016 novel circular RNAs (circRNAs) were detected in GCs and TCs, 8127 of which were abundantly expressed in both cell types. and more circRNAs were differentially expressed between GCs and TCs than mRNAs. Enrichment analysis showed that the DE transcripts were mainly involved in cell growth, proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. In the WGCNA analysis, we identified six specific modules that were related to the different cell types in different stages of development. A series of central hub genes, including MAPK1, CITED4, SOD2, STC1, MOS, GDF9, MDH1, CAPN2, and novel_circ0004730, were incorporated into a Cytoscape network. Notably, using both DE analysis and WGCNA, ESR1 was identified as a key gene during follicular development. Our results provide valuable information on the circRNAs involved in follicle development and identify potential genes for further research to determine their roles in the regulation of different biological processes during follicle growth.",We would like to thank the help of data analysis from colleague of Jiangsu Institute of Poultry Science.,"Funding.

The total solar eclipse passed through Coquimbo region from ~ 16:38 CLT (~ 20:38 UTC) to ~ 16:40 CLT (~ 20:40 UTC) and maximum eclipse was observed ~ 16:39 CLT (~ 20:39 UTC). The total electron content (TEC) derived from GPS signals shows peculiar features. At the totality stations TEC variations are small (~ 0.39 TECu), but it shows significant decrease (maximum ~ 2.24 TECu) for stations located south and increase (maximum ~ 3.89 TECu) for the stations located north of totality of the surface. The wavelet analysis of VTEC timeseries shows the presence of strong atmospheric gravity waves (AGWs) of duration ~ 30 to 60 min at the stations located north of totality. Thus, the results suggest an interplay between eclipse effect on the ionosphere plasma density and eclipse generated AGWs induced plasma density perturbation provided the peculiar features.","The author A.K.M. thanks the Science and Education Research Board (SERB) for financial support under Ramanujan Fellowship (File No. SB/S2/RJN-052/2016) and the Faculty Recharge Program (FRP) of the University Grants Commission (UGC) (ID FRP62343), New Delhi.

We investigated the associations between excess adiposity, body shape evolution across life, and risk of premenopausal breast cancer among 406 cases (women aged 20–45) and 406 matched population-based controls from Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, and Mexico. Negative associations between adult adiposity and breast cancer risk were observed in adjusted models (body mass index (BMI): Odds ratio (OR) per 1 kg/m2 = 0.93; 95% confidence interval = 0.89–0.96; waist circumference (WC): OR per 10 cm = 0.81 (0.69–0.96); hip circumference (HC): OR per 10 cm = 0.80 (0.67–0.95)). Height and leg length were not associated with risk. In normal weight women (18.5 ≤ BMI < 25), women with central obesity (WC > 88 cm) had an increased risk compared to women with normal WC (OR = 3.60(1.47–8.79)). Residuals of WC over BMI showed positive associations when adjusted for BMI (OR per 10 cm = 1.38 (0.98–1.94)). Body shape at younger ages and body shape evolution were not associated with risk. No heterogeneity was observed by receptor status. In this population of Latin American premenopausal women, different fat distributions in adulthood were differentially associated with risk of breast cancer.","The author wish to thank the substantial support provided by the research nurses and health workers as well as Tracy Lignini, Dacia Cristin, Cecile Le Duc, Jordi de Battle, and Talita Duarte-Salles, Ana Cristina Ocampo for the logistic and data basis development, and Vivian Viallon, who provided statistical support.

Deciphering the genomic underpinnings of eusociality in these marine shrimps has been limited by the sparse genomic resources in this genus. Here, we report, for a eusocial shrimp Synalpheus microneptunus, a complete mitochondrial genome (22X coverage) assembled from short Illumina 150 bp paired-end reads. The 15,603 bp long mitochondrial genome of S. microneptunus is AT-rich and includes 13 protein-coding genes (PCGs), 2 ribosomal RNA genes, 22 transfer RNA genes and an 834 bp intergenic region assumed to be the D-loop. The gene order is identical to that reported for most caridean shrimps and corresponds to the presumed Pancrustacean ground pattern. All PCGs showed signs of purifying selection, with KA/KS <<1 across the whole PCGs and most sliding windows within PCGs. Maximum-likelihood and Bayesian inference phylogenetic analyses of 13 PCGs and 68 terminals supports the monophyly of the Caridea and the family Alpheidae. The complete mitochondrial genome of the eusocial shrimp Synalpheus microneptunus will contribute to a better understanding of the selective pressures and rates of molecular evolution in marine eusocial animals.",J.A.B. thanks Dr. Vincent P.

Materials and Methods: Descriptive, cross-sectional and correlational study. The sample was made by 427 public middle school students, between the ages of 10 to 15, selected through a systematic sample by school grade. The Fantastic Instrument (Chilean version) was applied and adapted to Colombia by Betancourth, Velez and Jurado (2015) for the characterization of preadolescent and adolescent life styles, with optimal levels of content validity and reliability (Cronbach Alpha by criteria): pertinence (0,932), relevance (0,904), utility (0,948), composition (0,846) and clarity (0,800). Results: The average age was 13,1 years, with percentage similarity by gender (50%), the students came from Sincelejo (69,1%), and Santiago de Tolu (30,9%), where the predominant life style was adequate for the age range between 13 and 15 years (32,9% and 25,8%). The life style related to gender, age and educational institutions by subregion, reported significant differences in the dimensions of physical and social activity, sleep and stress, nutrition, family, and friends (p< 0,01); type of personality and school satisfaction, inner image and order (p< 0,05).

However, the available heart sound databases are not yet large enough to train generalized machine learning models. Therefore, there is interest in the development of algorithms capable of generating heart sounds that could augment current databases. In this article, we propose a model based on generative adversary networks (GANs) to generate normal synthetic heart sounds. Additionally, a denoising algorithm is implemented using the empirical wavelet transform (EWT), allowing a decrease in the number of epochs and the computational cost that the GAN model requires. A distortion metric (mel–cepstral distortion) was used to objectively assess the quality of synthetic heart sounds. The proposed method was favorably compared with a mathematical model that is based on the morphology of the phonocardiography (PCG) signal published as the state of the art. Additionally, different heart sound classification models proposed as state-of-the-art were also used to test the performance of such models when the GAN-generated synthetic signals were used as test dataset. In this experiment, good accuracy results were obtained with most of the implemented models, suggesting that the GAN-generated sounds correctly capture the characteristics of natural heart sounds.",,This research received no external funding.,Applied Sciences,,,,2020-10-08,2020,2020-10-08,,10,19,7003,All OA; Gold,Article,"Narváez, Pedro; Percybrooks, Winston S.","Narváez, Pedro (Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla 081001, Colombia); Percybrooks, Winston S.

211,pub.1131598360,10.1111/ecog.05100,,,Revealing hidden plant diversity in arid environments,"Estimating total plant diversity in extreme or hyperarid environments can be challenging, as adaptations to pronounced climate variability include evading prolonged stress periods through seeds or specialized underground organs. Short‐term surveys of these ecosystems are thus likely poor estimators of actual diversity. Here we develop a multimethod strategy to obtain a more complete understanding of plant diversity from a community in the Atacama Desert. We explicitly test environmental DNA‐based techniques (eDNA) to see if they can reveal the observed and ‘hidden' (dormant or locally rare) species. To estimate total plant diversity, we performed long‐term traditional surveys during eight consecutive years, including El Niño and La Niña events, we then analyzed eDNA from soil samples using high‐throughput sequencing. We further used soil pollen analysis and soil seed bank germination assays to identify ‘hidden' species. Each approach offers different subsets of current biodiversity at different taxonomic, spatial and temporal resolution, with a total of 92 taxa identified along the transect. Traditional field surveys identified 77 plant species over eight consecutive years. Observed community composition greatly varies interannually, with only 22 species seen every year. eDNA analysis revealed 37 taxa, eight of which were ‘hidden' in our field surveys. Soil samples contain a viable seed bank of 21 taxa. Soil pollen (27 taxa) and eDNA analysis show affinities with vegetation at the landscape scale but a weak relationship to local plot diversity. Multimethod approaches (including eDNA) in deserts are valuable tools that add to a comprehensive assessment of biodiversity in such extreme environments, where using a single method or observations over a few years is insufficient. Our results can also explain the resilience of Atacama plant communities as ‘hidden' taxa may have been active in the recent past or could even emerge in the future as accelerated global environmental change continues unabated.",,,Ecography,,,,2020-10-11,2020,2020-10-11,2021-01,44,1,98-111,All OA; Gold,Article,"Carrasco‐Puga, Gabriela; Díaz, Francisca P.; Soto, Daniela C.; Hernández‐Castro, Catalina; Contreras‐López, Orlando; Maldonado, Antonio; Latorre, Claudio; Gutiérrez, Rodrigo A.","Carrasco‐Puga, Gabriela (Depto de Genética Molecular y Microbiología, Pontificia Univ.

Objective: Identify the perception of the quality of nursing care from the perspective of people hospitalized in a public institution. Methodology: This was a cross-sectional descriptive study, using a sample comprised by 90 patients aged 18 and above who were identified through convenience sampling; the SERVQHOS-E instrument was applied with Cronbach´s Alpha of .87.

METHODS: 113 EP-patients aged 18-35 were recruited from the Treatment and Early Intervention in Psychosis Program [TIPP-Lausanne]. Body Mass Index [BMI], Weight Gain [WG] and Waist Circumference [WC] were measured prospectively at baseline and after 1, 2, 3, 6 and 12 months of weight gain inducing psychotropic treatment. Patients were classified as Early-Trauma and Late-Trauma if the exposure had occurred before age 12 or between ages 12 and 16 respectively. Generalized Linear Mixed-Models were adjusted for age, sex, socioeconomic status, baseline BMI, medication and for diagnosis of depression.
RESULTS: Late-Trauma patients, when compared to Non-Trauma patients showed greater WCs during the follow-up [p = 0.013]. No differences were found in any of the other follow-up measures.
CONCLUSIONS: Exposition to CT during adolescence in EP-patients treated with psychotropic medication is associated with greater WC during the early phase of the disease. Further investigation exploring mechanisms underlying the interactions between peripubertal stress, corticoids responsiveness and a subsequent increase of abdominal adiposity is warranted.","This work represents an independent research part supported by the The Swiss National Science Foundation (no. 320030_135736/1 to P.C. and K.Q.D., no 320030-120686, 324730-144064 and 320030-173211 to C.B.E and PC and no 171804 to LA), the National Center of Competence in Research (NCCR) “SYNAPSY - The Synaptic Bases of Mental Diseases” from the Swiss National Science Foundation (n° 51NF40-158776) The Damm-Etienne and Alamaya Foundation were supporting the recruitment as well as the phenotyping (including psychopathology, neurocognition and neurobiological biomarkers) of our early psychosis patients cohort).

T. gondii can infect any warm-blooded animal in its asexual cycle; however, its sexual cycle is restricted to felines. Eimeria spp. are usually restricted to one host species, and their whole life cycle is completed within this same host. The literature reviewed in this article comprises the recent findings regarding the unique biology of the sexual development of T. gondii and Eimeria spp. The molecular basis of sex in these pathogens has been significantly unraveled by new findings in parasite differentiation along with transcriptional analysis of T. gondii and Eimeria spp. pre-sexual and sexual stages. Focusing on the metabolic networks, analysis of these transcriptome datasets shows enrichment for several different metabolic pathways. Transcripts for glycolysis enzymes are consistently more abundant in T. gondii cat infection stages than the asexual tachyzoite stage and Eimeria spp. merozoite and gamete stages compared to sporozoites. Recent breakthroughs in host-pathogen interaction and host restriction have significantly expanded the understating of the unique biology of these pathogens. This review aims to critically explore advances in the sexual cycle of Coccidia parasites with the ultimate goal of comparing and analyzing the sexual cycle of Eimeria spp. and T. gondii.",,,Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology,,,Animals; Cats; Eimeria; Life Cycle Stages; Merozoites; Parasites; Toxoplasma,2020-12-14,2020,2020-12-14,,10,,604897,All OA; Gold,Article,"Martorelli Di Genova, Bruno; Knoll, Laura J","Martorelli Di Genova, Bruno (Department of Medical Microbiology and Immunology, University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, WI, United States.); Knoll, Laura J (Department of Medical Microbiology and Immunology, University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, WI, United States.)","Knoll, Laura J (University of Wisconsin–Madison)","Martorelli Di Genova, Bruno (University of Wisconsin–Madison); Knoll, Laura J (University of Wisconsin–Madison)",19,11,1.22,3.27,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fcimb.2020.604897/pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1133487399,31 Biological Sciences; 3107 Microbiology; 32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3207 Medical Microbiology,
254,pub.1124022695,10.3390/met10010107,,,Leaching Chalcopyrite with High MnO2 and Chloride Concentrations,"Most copper minerals are found as sulfides, with chalcopyrite being the most abundant. However; this ore is refractory to conventional hydrometallurgical methods, so it has been historically exploited through froth flotation, followed by smelting operations. This implies that the processing involves polluting activities, either by the formation of tailings dams and the emission of large amounts of SO2 into the atmosphere. Given the increasing environmental restrictions, it is necessary to consider new processing strategies, which are compatible with the environment, and, if feasible, combine the reuse of industrial waste. In the present research, the dissolution of pure chalcopyrite was studied considering the use of MnO2 and wastewater with a high chloride content. Fine particles (−20 µm) generated an increase in extraction of copper from the mineral. Besides, it was discovered that working at high temperatures (80 °C); the large concentrations of MnO2 become irrelevant. The biggest copper extractions of this work (71%) were achieved when operating at 80 °C; particle size of −47 + 38 µm, MnO2/CuFeS2 ratio of 5/1, and 1 mol/L of H2SO4.","The authors are grateful for the contribution of the Scientific Equipment Unit-MAINI of the Universidad Católica del Norte for facilitating the chemical analysis of the solutions.

201,pub.1124826025,10.3390/met10020239,,,Depression of Pyrite in Seawater Flotation by Guar Gum,"The application of guar gum for pyrite depression in seawater flotation was assessed through microflotation tests, Focused Beam Reflectance Measurements (FBRM), and Particle Vision Measurements (PVM). Potassium amyl xanthate (PAX) and methyl isobutyl carbinol (MIBC) were used as collector and frother, respectively. Chemical species on the pyrite surface were characterized by Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) spectroscopy. The microflotation tests were performed at pH 8, which is the pH at the copper sulfide processing plants that operate with seawater. Pyrite flotation recovery was correlated with FBRM and PVM characterization to delineate the pyrite depression mechanisms by the guar gum. The high flotation recovery of pyrite with PAX was significantly lowered by guar gum, indicating that this polysaccharide could be used as an effective depressant in flotation with sea water. FTIR analysis showed that PAX and guar gum co-adsorbed on the pyrite surface, but the highly hydrophilic nature of the guar gum embedded the hydrophobicity due to the PAX. FBRM and PVM revealed that the guar gum promoted the formation of flocs whose size depended on the addition of guar gum and PAX. It is proposed that the highest pyrite depression occurred not only because of the hydrophilicity induced by the guar gum, but also due to the formation of large flocs, which could not be transported by the bubbles to the froth phase. Furthermore, it is shown that an overdose of guar gum hindered the depression effect due to redispersion of the flocs.",R.I.J. thanks CONICYT Fondecyt 11171036 and Centro de Recursos Hídricos para la Agricultura y la Minería (CRHIAM) through Project ANID/FONDAP/15130015.

Academic developments in social innovation have mainly occurred in and been documented for English-speaking countries, although relevant experiences have been implemented in Latin America. In this article, we describe and analyze how social innovation in health is being approached and understood in this region.Main textTo identify the theoretical and methodological developments of social innovation in health between 2013 and 2018, a scoping review with a mixed approach was carried out. Eighty texts in English, Spanish and Portuguese were selected for a process of reflexive analysis of intra and intertextual reading. The approaches identified in the studied initiatives were complementary. The most applied approaches were innovation in health, technological innovation in health and social innovation, each with twelve publications, and social innovation in health and ecohealth with ten and seven publications respectively. The approaches showed a general interest in reaching the goals of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), the Alma Ata Declaration and the Ottawa Letter.ConclusionsThe social innovation in health approach in Latin America adopts educational strategies, identifies risk factors, optimizes resources, promotes interculturality, participation, community empowerment, and enhances intersectorality and interdisciplinarity. As an approach, process, program or solution, social innovation in health is a conceptual category under construction. This research provides a baseline for other systematic reviews on the subject.","This article is based on work developed within the Latin America and the Caribbean Hub for Social Innovation in Health at CIDEIM.

The site is located in Pampa Iluga, south to Cerro Unitas and west to the Tarapacá ravine, where we can observe the geoglyph Giant of Tarapacá. The site covers thousands of hectares with field crops and irrigation systems (chacras) associated with a notorious complex of tumuli, public and domestic architecture. In between the field crops, 122 tumuli are reported, forming specific types of groups. We also observed activity areas with and without architecture. Mud architecture structures stand out among the constructions, showing different shapes such as circular, rectangular and square ones that probably had multiple public functions. This particular palimpsest distribution of monuments and portable and non-portable evidence extends from the Formative Period's beginnings until the Incas arrival and Colonial times.

To achieve this purpose, a comprehensive and interdisciplinary work is required to identify and strengthen resources and strengths, autonomy and self-responsibility, unlike the traditional emphasis on health, focused on dysfunctionality and pathology. It is a positive and optimistic view of human development, which involves emotional, cognitive, interactional and social aspects. Perspective that has the support of WHO and PAHO. Resilience strengthens an active and leading position of all agents for the resolution of situations that affect the well-being and development of individuals and collectivities. It is not a static but dynamic quality, nor is it innate since it can be encouraged and strengthened, with the purpose of contributing to a coping with existence from an active, optimistic and enthusiastic perspective, which generates empowerment and agency capacity. In conclusion, its complexity and multifactorial condition is established, which implies conditions on a personal, family and social level.

Studies indicate that female affective bonds change into a potentiator of crime behavior and/or withdrawal of it. The objective of this study was to find out if the couple’s bonds (previous or during the prison) were codependent, and to analyze the possible relation between the latter and female crime. This qualitative study used mixed tools in a sample of 27 women in the Bucaramanga prison (Colombia). The I-CO instrument was applied analyzing the four codependency factors: (1) denial mechanisms; (2) incomplete identity development; (3) emotional repression and (4) rescue orientation. The qualitative data obtained through the in-depth interview and focus groups were also analyzed, showing mainly three emerging categories: (1) I did it for him; (2) Although he doesn’t love me; and (3) I preferred to remain silent. The results suggested the difficulty of leaving violent relationships and the possible interaction between codependency, violent partner relationships and female crime. This research raises the need to strengthen the empowerment of women inside and outside the prison.",To the women who voluntarily decided to participate in this study sharing their life stories and participating all research activities.

By performing a dynamical system analysis we examine the nature of the critical points and their stability for two potentials, one is the exponential potential and the other is a general potential. In the case of an exponential potential, we find some new critical points for this modified quintessence scenario that describe the de Sitter universes, and these critical points do not appear in the standard quintessence model with an exponential potential. This is one of the main results of this work. Now for the general potential our analysis shows that the physical properties of the critical points remain exactly the same as for the exponential potential which means that within this modified quintessence scenario all kind of potentials have same behaviour. This kind of result is completely new in cosmology because with the change of the potential, differences are usually expected in all respect.","The authors thank the referees for their valuable comments which improved the quality of discussion of the article.

This study describes, for the first time, the complete mitochondrial genome of H. columbus from South Carolina, USA.MethodsThe mitogenome of H. columbus was assembled from Illumina 300 bp pair-end reads. It was annotated and compared to other published mitogenomes of plant-parasitic nematodes in the superfamily Tylenchoidea. The phylogenetic relationships between H. columbus and other 6 genera of plant-parasitic nematodes were examined using protein-coding genes (PCGs).ResultsThe mitogenome of H. columbus is a circular AT-rich DNA molecule 25,228 bp in length. The annotation result comprises 12 PCGs, 2 ribosomal RNA genes, and 19 transfer RNA genes. No atp8 gene was found in the mitogenome of H. columbus but long non-coding regions were observed in agreement to that reported for other plant-parasitic nematodes. The mitogenomic phylogeny of plant-parasitic nematodes in the superfamily Tylenchoidea agreed with previous molecular phylogenies. Mitochondrial gene synteny in H. columbus was unique but similar to that reported for other closely related species.ConclusionsThe mitogenome of H. columbus is unique within the superfamily Tylenchoidea but exhibits similarities in both gene content and synteny to other closely related nematodes.

However, changes in the presence of this disease across years hampers the effective identification of resistant genotypes to this disease. To avoid the limitations of phenotypic selection under natural pressure, this research aimed to devise an effective strategy to screen disease-resistant genotypes in the absence of high and constant natural pressures. To do so, we investigated the presence of antixenosis and antibiosis as components of resistance to the vector Dalbulus maidis as well as resistance to the pathogen Spiroplasma kunkelii under artificial inoculation conditions in four maize hybrids. The hybrids shown differences in their levels of resistance and target organisms, either the insect vector or the pathogen. Antixenosis and antibiosis to D. maidis were observed in DK72-10. Resistance to S. kunkelii by DK79-10 was seen as a delayed onset of symptoms, and DKB390 showed antixenosis to D. maidis and resistance to S. kunkelii. An association between symptom severity and yield reduction was found, but not between accumulation of pathogen S. kunkelii and symptom severity nor yield. In conclusion, the proposed methodology was efficacious and can aid in the screening of resistant genotypes in breeding programs to reduce the impact of Corn Stunt disease, ensuring that hybrids with good resistance level will be planted by farmers whenever disease occurs.","Bayer CropScience Argentina provided support for this study in the form of salaries fro JO and PC and the expenses related directly to implement the experiments (supplies, mobility, meals, etc.).

However, diesel engines are a significant source of pollutant emissions that contribute to poor air quality, negative human health impacts, and climate change. This experimental case study develops emission maps based on statistical models for a single-cylinder, four-stroke, air-cooled diesel engine as a function of torque and engine speed. The tested fuels were 100% diesel (B0), and blends with 5% (B5) and 10% (B10) biodiesel originating from African oil palm (Elaeis guineensis). The study explores the individual contributions of NO and NO2 to NOx and discusses the correlation between CO and O2 emission maps. The statistical models of CO, CO2, and O2 feature R2 adjusted values greater than 0.8, while the models of NO and NO2 show R2 adjusted values of around 0.6. The apparent discrepancies in CO emission trends among previous studies are explained. The emission maps developed here are a practical alternative to predictive models and can assist in engine calibration and aftertreatment optimization while saving time and costs.","The authors thank the UNIVERSIDAD DEL ATLÁNTICO, UNIVERSIDAD DEL NORTE, and SPHERE ENERGY company for their support on the development of this research by allowing the use of its facilities and the required instrumentation.

Gibberellin (GA) is a key modulator of internode elongation in sugarcane. Understanding the gene expression features of GA-mediated internode elongation has both scientific and practical significance. This study aimed to examine the transcriptomic changes in the internode elongation of sugarcane following GA treatment. Eighteen cDNA libraries from the internode tissues on days of 0, 3, and 6 in control and GA treatment groups were sequenced and their gene expression were studied. RNA-seq analysis revealed 1,338,723,248 reads and 70,821 unigenes from elongating internodes of sugarcane. Comparative studies discovered a large number of transcripts that were differentially expressed in GA-treated samples compared to the control. Further analysis revealed that the differentially expressed genes were enriched in the metabolic process, one-carbon compound transport, and single-organism process. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway annotation showed significant enrichment in photosynthesis and plant hormone signal transduction, indicating its involvement in internode elongation. The function analysis suggested that metabolic pathways and biosynthesis of secondary metabolites, plant hormones, and cell wall components were enriched in the internodes of the GA-treated plants. The hub genes were identified, with the function of cellulose synthesis. The results of this study provide a global view of mRNA changes during sugarcane internode elongation and extend our knowledge of the GA-mediated cellular processes involved in sugarcane stem growth.",,"Funding.

This use overlaps with cigarette smoking and other illicit and licit drugs and s associated with depressive symptoms and suicide risk. In our national context, little is known about the relationship between Cannabis use and suicide risk.
Objective: To evaluate the association between Cannabis use and elevated suicide risk in high school adolescents in Santa Marta, Colombia.
Materials and methods: We conducted a cross-sectional study with a probabilistic sample of high school students between 13 and 17 years of age from official and private schools.
We analyzed the use of Cannabis some time in life and suicide risk was quantified using the suicide ideation scale designed by the Center for Epidemiological Studies on Depression.
Scores greater than eight were categorized as a high suicide risk. The crude and adjusted opportunity ratio (OR) was estimated.
Results: A total of 1,462 students participated. Their mean age was 14.4 years (SD=0.8) and 60.3% were women. The lifetime prevalence of Cannabis use was 11.6% (95%CI: 10.0-13.2) and 13.3% of the students reported high suicide risk (95%CI: 11.6-15.0). Cannabis consumption was associated with high suicide risk adjusted by other variables (OR=1.88; 95%CI: 1.23-2.88).
Conclusions: Cannabis use was associated with high suicide risk in high school adolescents in Santa Marta, Colombia. Other variables should be studied in order to further examine this association.","A los estudiantes de psicología ayudantes de investigación, por su invaluable cooperación en el proceso de recolección de la información: Adriana Rodríguez Martínez, Ana Celis Márquez, Carlos Fuentes López, Daniela Gonzales Cantillo, Heiner Tordecilla Arroyo, Nataly Tapia Duarte, Sandra Gómez Mariscal y Yuleinys Dávila Gómez, y a los profesionales de psicología de apoyo: Amparo Echeverry Arias, Heigui Araújo Zúñiga, Johana Guerrero Bolaño y María Paola Jiménez Villamizar.",,Biomédica,,,"Adolescent; Colombia; Confidence Intervals; Cross-Sectional Studies; Depression; Family Characteristics; Female; Humans; Male; Marijuana Abuse; Prevalence; Risk Factors; Social Class; Students; Suicidal Ideation; Suicide, Attempted",2020-09-24,2020,2020-09-24,,40,3,569-577,All OA; Gold,Article,"Campo-Arias, Adalberto; Suárez-Colorado, Yuli Paola; Caballero-Domínguez, Carmen Cecilia","Campo-Arias, Adalberto (Programa de Medicina, Facultad de Ciencias de la Salud, Universidad del Magdalena, Santa Marta, Colombia, Universidad del Magdalena, Facultad de Ciencias de la Salud, Universidad del Magdalena, Santa Marta, Colombia); Suárez-Colorado, Yuli Paola (Programa de Psicología, Universidad Cooperativa de Colombia, Santa Marta, Colombia, Universidad Cooperativa de Colombia, Universidad Cooperativa de Colombia, Santa Marta, Colombia); Caballero-Domínguez, Carmen Cecilia (Programa de Psicología, Facultad de Ciencias de la Salud, Universidad del Magdalena, Santa Marta, Colombia, Universidad del Magdalena, Facultad de Ciencias de la Salud, Universidad del Magdalena, Santa Marta, Colombia)","Campo-Arias, Adalberto (University of Magdalena)","Campo-Arias, Adalberto (University of Magdalena); Suárez-Colorado, Yuli Paola (Cooperative University of Colombia); Caballero-Domínguez, Carmen Cecilia (University of Magdalena)",16,5,1.09,3.14,https://revistabiomedica.org/index.php/biomedica/article/download/4988/4579,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1131234109,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3214 Pharmacology and Pharmaceutical Sciences; 52 Psychology,3 Good Health and Well Being

The main features of ILs are high thermal stability, recyclability, low flash point, and low vapor pressure. This study investigated pure chalcopyrite dissolution in the presence of the ionic liquid 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium hydrogen sulfate, [BMIm]HSO4, and a bromide-like complexing agent. The proposed system was compared with acid leaching in sulfate media with the addition of chloride and bromide ions. The results demonstrated that the use of ionic liquid and bromide ions improved the chalcopyrite leaching performance. The best operational conditions were at a temperature of 90 °C, with an ionic liquid concentration of 20% and 100 g/L of bromide.","The authors are grateful for the contribution of the Scientific Equipment Unit- MAINI of the Universidad Católica del Norte for facilitating the chemical analysis of the solutions.

261,pub.1126576955,10.3390/met10040497,,,Extraction of Titanium from Low-Grade Ore with Different Leaching Agents in Autoclave,"The progressive depletion of primary sources to obtain metals has led to the search for alternative sources for their recovery. In the particular case of titanium, titaniferous sands are a viable option for obtaining this metal. This paper presents the results of the dissolution of titanium from titaniferous sands of Buenos Aires province (Argentina) in a laboratory autoclave (450 mL of capacity). The operating parameters studied were as follows: different acids (HF, H2SO4 and mixtures of these acids); leaching agent concentration, 5–20% v/v; temperature, 75–150 °C; time, 30–180 min; solid–liquid ratio, 0.9–3.6% w/v; stirring speed, 110–550 rpm. The obtained results indicate that the increase in the leaching agent(s) concentration, temperature and time of contact with the acid mixtures have a marked effect on the dissolution reaction of titanium. Optimal conditions to achieve 89% extraction of titanium were obtained by leaching at 123 °C, 330 rpm, 80 min and 1.8% w/v with a mixture of 15% HF (v/v) and 10% H2SO4 (v/v).","The authors thank the Universidad Nacional de Cuyo, Secretaria de Investigación, Internacionales y Posgrado (SIIP) and Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Científicas y Técnicas (CONICET), for the. financial support.",This research received no external funding.,Metals,,,,2020-04-09,2020,2020-04-09,,10,4,497,All OA; Gold,Article,"Rodriguez, Mario H.; Rosales, Gustavo D.; Pinna, Eliana G.; Tunez, Fernando M.; Toro, Norman","Rodriguez, Mario H.

Antimalarial therapies show little effectiveness to avoid neurological deficits and brain tissue alterations elicited by severe malaria. Melatonin is a well-recognized endogenous hormone involved in the control of brain functions and maintenance of blood-brain barrier integrity. The current study has evaluated the effect of melatonin on the histological alterations, blood-brain barrier leakage, and neurocognitive impairments in mice developing cerebral malaria. Swiss mice infected with Plasmodium berghei ANKA strain was used as cerebral malaria model. Melatonin treatment (5 and 10 mg/kg) was performed for four consecutive days after the infection, and data have shown an increased survival rate in infected mice treated with melatonin. It was also observed that melatonin treatment blocked brain edema and prevented the breakdown of blood-brain barrier induced by the Plasmodium infection. Furthermore, hematoxylin and eosin staining revealed that melatonin mitigates the histological alterations in Plasmodium-infected animals. Melatonin was also able to prevent motor and cognitive impairments in infected mice. Taken together, these results show for the first time that melatonin treatment prevents histological brain damages and neurocognitive alterations induced by cerebral malaria.",,"Funding.

From a review and discussion of the literature on neoliberalism as forms of production of citizenship and subjectivity, with special emphasis on that exploring the Latin American case, but also the literature from political ecology on commoditization of nature, we answer the following question: what strategies have been generated among local actors for facing effect on their identities of the arrival and production of the salmon commodity? We argue from political ecology and related approaches, the thesis that the commoditization of nature and territory not only implies the control or co-production of the environment but is also interwoven with processes of identity and citizenship formation.

In this study, we used seascape genomic tools to evaluate the genetic structure of the commercially important ascidian Pyura chilensis, a species that exhibits a low larval transport potential but high anthropogenic dispersal. A recent study in this species recorded significant genetic differentiation across a transition zone around 30°S in putatively adaptive SNPs, but not in neutral ones, suggesting an important role of environmental heterogeneity in driving genetic structure. Here, we aim to understand genomic-oceanographic associations in P. chilensis along the Southeastern Pacific coast using two combined seascape genomic approaches. Using 149 individuals from five locations along the HCS, a total of 2,902 SNPs were obtained by Genotyping-By-Sequencing, of which 29–585 were putatively adaptive loci, depending on the method used for detection. In adaptive loci, spatial genetic structure was better correlated with environmental differences along the study area (mainly to Sea Surface Temperature, upwelling-associated variables and productivity) than to the geographic distance between sites. Additionally, results consistently showed the presence of two groups, located north and south of 30°S, which suggest that local adaptation processes seem to allow the maintenance of genomic differentiation and the spatial genomic structure of the species across the 30°S biogeographic transition zone of the Humboldt Current System, overriding the homogenizing effects of gene flow.","Authors thanks to Natalia Muñoz-Herrera, Raúl Vera and Francisca Gálvez for help with sampling and laboratory procedures.

1452,pub.1126937558,10.3390/sym12040666,,,Direct Power Compensation in AC Distribution Networks with SCES Systems via PI-PBC Approach,"Here, we explore the possibility of employing proportional-integral passivity-based control (PI-PBC) to support active and reactive power in alternating current (AC) distribution networks by using a supercapacitor energy storage system. A direct power control approach is proposed by taking advantage of the Park’s reference frame transform direct and quadrature currents ( i d and i q ) into active and reactive powers (p and q). Based on the open-loop Hamiltonian model of the system, we propose a closed-loop PI-PBC controller that takes advantage of Lyapunov’s stability to design a global tracking controller. Numerical simulations in MATLAB/Simulink demonstrate the efficiency and robustness of the proposed controller, especially for parametric uncertainties.","This work was partially supported by the National Scholarship Program Doctorates of the Administrative Department of Science, Technology and Innovation of Colombia (COLCIENCIAS), by calling contest 727-2015.",,Symmetry,,,,2020-04-23,2020,2020-04-23,,12,4,666,All OA; Gold,Article,"Gil-González, Walter; Serra, Federico Martin; Montoya, Oscar Danilo; Ramírez, Carlos Alberto; Orozco-Henao, César","Gil-González, Walter (Laboratorio Inteligente de Energía, Universidad Tecnológica de Bolívar, km 1 vía Turbaco, Cartagena 131001, Colombia;, omontoya@utb.edu.co); Serra, Federico Martin (Laboratorio de Control Automático (LCA), Universidad Nacional de San Luis, Villa Mercedes 5730, Argentina;, fmserra@unsl.edu.ar); Montoya, Oscar Danilo (Laboratorio Inteligente de Energía, Universidad Tecnológica de Bolívar, km 1 vía Turbaco, Cartagena 131001, Colombia;, omontoya@utb.edu.co; Facultad de Ingeniería, Universidad Distrital Francisco José de Caldas, Carrera 7 No. 40B - 53, Bogotá D.C 11021, Colombia); Ramírez, Carlos Alberto (Facultad de Ciencias Básicas, Universidad Tecnológica de Pereira.

Thus, water availability for irrigation is decisive for crop success, such as the case of highbush blueberry (Vaccinium corymbosum L.). Therefore, drought stress may compromise blueberry production due to lower fruit weight or fruit yield. Despite this, it is unclear if there is any difference in the response of blueberry cultivars to water deficit, either in terms of physiological and molecular parameters, or in terms of their sensitivity or resistance to drought. In this study, we determined the effect of drought on different physiological parameters in blueberry plants (relative water content (RWC), photochemical efficiency of photosystem II (Fv/Fm), Carbon Isotopic Discrimination, and proline content) in six V. corymbosum cultivars. We also explored molecular responses in terms of gene expression coding for late embryogenesis abundant proteins. Finally, we estimated cultivar water deficit resistance using an integrative model based on physiological results. Upon water deficit conditions, we found reductions in Fv/Fm, RWC, and isotopic discrimination of 13C (Δ13C), while proline content increased significantly for all cultivars. Additionally, we also found differences in the estimated water deficit resistance index. These results indicate differences in water deficit resistance, possibly due to variations in cultivars' genetic composition.","The authors are grateful to Maria Jose Romero for help with the physiological measurements, Ricardo Perez-Díaz and Samuel Morales-Navarro for help with the qPCR analysis, and Miguel Garriga for help with the experimental design.

This aspect has been changing in recent years due to an increased interest in the use of these yeasts in the winemaking process. The majority of these yeasts have a low fermentation power, being used in mixed fermentations with Saccharomyces cerevisiae due to their ability to produce metabolites of enological interest, such as glycerol, fatty acids, organic acids, esters, higher alcohols, stable pigments, among others. Additionally, existing literature reports various compounds derived from the cellular structure of non-Saccharomyces yeasts with benefits in the winemaking process, such as polysaccharides, proteins, enzymes, peptides, amino acids, or antimicrobial compounds, some of which, besides contributing to improving the quality of the wine, can be used as a source of nitrogen for the fermentation yeasts.

The sensitization process was verified by diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS). The qualitative and quantitative analyses of the anthocyanins were carried out using high-performance liquid chromatography with photodiode array detection (HPLC-DAD), which provided the total content anthocyanin equivalent to delphinidin chloride (TAEDC) per mL of the extract, of 10.0 ± 0.8 µg TAEDC/mL. Here, three main anthocyanins were identified, being cyanidin-3-rutinoside the most abundant constituent (ca. 76%). The interaction of the dyes with a TiO2 slab model and their adsorption energies were determined through computational simulations. In addition, the molecular modelling evidenced that the sensitization of the semiconductor improved the light absorption in the visible range of the spectrum. As a final point, the photocatalytic test showed that the photocatalytic activity increased 26% for TiO2/B. guineensis thin films under visible radiation respect to bare TiO2.","The authors would like to thank the Grants FONDECYT 1180565 1161416 and 1201880 ANID/FONDAP/ 15110019, Universidad del Atlántico (primera convocatoria interna, que otorga apoyo económico para el desarrollo de trabajos de grado en investigación formativa – nivel pregrado y postgrado).

Using a multiple linear regression method, several mathematical models with statistical significance were obtained. The robustness of the models was validated, employing the leave-one-out cross-validation and Y-scrambling methods. The entire data set was docked against penicillin-binding protein, iso-tyrosyl tRNA synthetase, and DNA gyrase. The most active cannabinoids had high affinity to penicillin-binding protein (PBP), whereas the least active compounds had low affinities for all of the targets. Among the cannabinoid compounds, Cannabinoid 2 was highlighted due to its suitable combination of both antimicrobial activity and higher scoring values against the selected target; therefore, its docking performance was compared to that of oxacillin, a commercial PBP inhibitor. The 2D figures reveal that both compounds hit the protein in the active site with a similar type of molecular interaction, where the hydroxyl groups in the aromatic ring of cannabinoids play a pivotal role in the biological activity. These results provide some evidence that the anti-Staphylococcus aureus activity of these cannabinoids may be related to the inhibition of the PBP protein; besides, the robustness of the models along with the docking and Quantitative Structure–Activity Relationship (QSAR) results allow the proposal of three new compounds; the predicted activity combined with the scoring values against PBP should encourage future synthesis and experimental testing.","We thank three institutions for their generous support: Universidad Del Norte, Universidad San Francisco de Quito, and Universidad de la Costa.",This research received no external funding.,Crystals,,,,2020-08-11,2020,2020-08-11,,10,8,692,All OA; Gold,Article,"Cortes, Eliceo; Mora, José; Márquez, Edgar","Cortes, Eliceo (Grupo de Investigación en Ciencias Naturales y Exactas, Departamento de Ciencias Naturales y Exactas, Universidad de la Costa, Barranquilla 080002, Colombia); Mora, José (Grupo de Química Computacional y Teórica (QCT-USFQ), Departamento de Ingeniería Química, Universidad San Francisco de Quito, Diego de Robles y Vía Interoceánica, Quito 170901, Ecuador); Márquez, Edgar (Grupo de Investigaciones en Química y Biología, Departamento de Química y Biología, Facultad de Ciencias Exactas, Universidad del Norte, Carrera 51B, Km 5, vía Puerto Colombia, Barranquilla 081007, Colombia)","Cortes, Eliceo (University of the Coast); Mora, José (Universidad San Francisco de Quito); Márquez, Edgar (Universidad del Norte)","Cortes, Eliceo (University of the Coast); Mora, José (Universidad San Francisco de Quito); Márquez, Edgar (Universidad del Norte)",22,10,,2.88,https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4352/10/8/692/pdf?version=1597106291,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1130061228,34 Chemical Sciences; 3404 Medicinal and Biomolecular Chemistry,

The Aα -spectrum of G is the multiset of eigenvalues of Aα (G) and these eigenvalues are the α-eigenvalues of G. A cluster in G is a pair of vertex subsets (C, S), where C is a set of cardinality |C| ≥ 2 of pairwise co-neighbor vertices sharing the same set S of |S| neighbors. Assuming that G is connected and it has a cluster (C, S), G(H) is obtained from G and an r-regular graph H of order |C| by identifying its vertices with the vertices in C, eigenvalues of Aα (G) and Aα (G(H)) are deduced and if Aα (H) is positive semidefinite, then the i-th eigenvalue of Aα (G(H)) is greater than or equal to i-th eigenvalue of Aα (G). These results are extended to graphs with several pairwise disjoint clusters (C1, S1), . . . , (Ck, Sk). As an application, the effect on the energy, α-Estrada index and α-index of a graph G with clusters when the edges of regular graphs are added to G are analyzed.

Methods: A finite elements model of a four-week-old infant skull was developed for simulating low height impact from 30 cm and 50 cm falls. Two impacts were simulated: An occipito-parietal impact on the lambdoid suture and a lateral impact on the right parietal and six cases were considered: unossified and fully ossified sutures, and sagittal, metopic, right lambdoid and right coronal craniosynostosis. Results: 26 simulations were performed. Results showed a marked increase in strain magnitudes in skulls with unossified sutures and fontanels. Higher deformations and lower Von Mises stress in the brain were found in occipital impacts. Fully ossified skulls showed less overall deformation and lower Von Mises stress in the brain. Results suggest that neonate skull impact when falling backward has a higher probability of resulting in permanent damage.

These growing anthropogenic disturbances represent major and relatively new environmental challenges for many animals, and invariably alter selection on traits adapted to previous environments. Those species that survive often have moved from their original habitat or modified their phenotype through plasticity or genetic evolution. Based on the most recent advances in this research area, we predict that wild individuals with highly plastic capacities, relatively high basal stress level, and that are generally shy—in other words, individuals displaying a reactive phenotype—should better cope with sudden and widespread HIREC than their counterparts' proactive phenotypes. If true, this selective response would have profound ecological and evolutionary consequences and can therefore impact conservation strategies, specifically with respect to managing the distribution and abundance of individuals and maintaining evolutionary potential.

The aim of this project was to establish past variations in the main oceanographic and climatic features of a transitional semiarid ecosystem on the north-central Chilean coast. We analyzed recent sedimentary records retrieved from two bays, Guanaqueros and Tongoy (30∘ S), for geochemical and biological analyses, including the following: sensitive redox trace elements, biogenic opal, total organic carbon (TOC), diatoms and stable isotopes of organic carbon and nitrogen. Three remarkable periods were established with different environmental conditions and productivities: (1) > 6600 cal BP, (2) 4500–1800 cal BP and (3) 140 cal BP to the present (2015 CE). The first period was characterized by a remarkably higher productivity (higher diatom abundances and opal) in which large fluxes of organic compounds were also inferred from the accumulation of elements, such as Ba, Ca, Ni, Cd and P, in the sediments. Meanwhile, significantly reduced conditions at the bottom of the bays were suggested based on the large accumulation of Mo, Re and U, showing a peak at 6600 cal BP, when sulfidic conditions could have been present. According to the pollen moisture index (PMI), this was also identified as the driest interval. These conditions should be associated with an intensification of the Southern Pacific Subtropical Anticyclone (SPSA) and stronger southerly western winds, emulating La Niña-like conditions, as has been described for the SE Pacific during the early Holocene and part of the mid-Holocene. During most of the second period, lower productivity was observed; however, a small increase was identified between 3400 and 4000 cal BP, although lower amounts of diatom (valves g−1) and nutrient-type metal accumulations were evident. Anoxic conditions at the bottom of the bays changed to an almost stable suboxic condition during this time interval. The third period was marked by intense oxygenation after 1800 cal BP, as observed by a drastic change in the accumulation of U, Mo and Re. This was followed by a return to more reduced conditions over the past 2 centuries, characterized by a small productivity rise after ∼140 cal BP, as suggested by the opal accumulations. Overall, lower primary productivity, lower reduced conditions at the bottom and higher-humidity conditions were established after 6600 cal BP to the present. We suggest that the oxygenation might be associated with a weak effect from the oxygen minimum zone over the shelf and intensified El Niño activity, introducing oxygenated waters to the coastal zones through the propagation of equatorial waves and establishment of conditions that reduced the primary productivity from the mid-Holocene toward the beginning of the modern era.","We would like to thank the R/V Stella Maris II crew of Universidad Católica del Norte for their help and support during field work.

In particular, we consider the existence of a dust fluid source while for the underlying geometry we assume a line element which belongs to the family of silent universes. We solve explicitly the field equations and we find the Szekeres spacetimes in Weyl Integrable theory. We show that only the isotropic family can describe inhomogeneous solutions where the LTB spacetimes are included. A detailed analysis of the dynamics of the field equations is given where the past and future attractors are determined. It is interesting that the Kasner spacetimes can be seen as past attractors for the gravitation models, while the unique future attractor describes the Milne universe similar with the behaviour of the gravitational model in the case of General Relativity.","AP &amp; GL were funded by Agencia Nacional de Investigación y Desarrollo - ANID through the program FONDECYT Iniciación Grant no. 11180126.

It starts by defining the parachurch ministries as organisations that work outside and across denominations, and seek to come alongside the church and specialise in activities that individual churches may not be able to specialise in by themselves. These movements are characterised as Protestant, evangelical and ecumenical, focused on evangelism and social welfare, and of course focused on and specialist in methods of their activities. In order to understand them, their legitimacy should be argued from historical perspective more than from Scriptural perspective. Their critics lean towards scriptural and theological debate to deregulate them, whilst their proponents use historical and effectiveness to defend them. The historical proliferation of parachurches centres them in nodal dialogue as important partners in Christianity. The areas of tensions with the church are highlighted as those based on theology, finances, accountability, governance, and human resources. The reality of parachurches is irreversible. They make impact on South African Christianity by producing outstanding leaders that are currently in key positions in the civil service, churches and corporate world. An appeal is that the church and the parachurch should enter into dialogue with each other in order to find a common ground of how to advance the kingdom of God in the world wreathing in pain of oppression, poverty, unemployment, social stigmas, etc. Intradisciplinary and/or interdisciplinary implications: This article is written from a personal experience and perspective. Almost three quarters of my ministry involvement is with the parachurch organisations. By reviewing the literature from church history and missiology and practical and systematic theology, it reveals the rationale behind tensions between church and parachurch organisations. These tensions are debated theologically and historically, and thus it is recommended that these two entities must draw a synergy by engaging dialogically in order to see how to complement each other.",,,Verbum et Ecclesia,,,,2020-12-15,2020,2020-12-15,,41,1,8,All OA; Gold,Article,"Resane, Kelebogile T.","Resane, Kelebogile T.

239,pub.1129865228,10.4102/hts.v76i2.5985,,,The black church as the timeless witness to change and paradigm shifts posed by the Fourth Industrial Revolution,"The current technological and scientific developments of the Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR) signal great leaps in human intellect and creativity. At the crossroad of great steps into the future, a future that will be determined by science and innovation, the smeared bond between theology and science recoils upon theological consideration of human intellect. Black liberation theology has stressed a change in paradigm, which takes oppression, class and intellect seriously. This research seeks to elaborate that a general acceptance of human intellect and science tends to ignore that modern-day science is part of Western civilisation. The Western world view remains dominant in the world. It will be argued that while the 4IR is important, the intellect, politics, economics and need for a 4IR, however, remain synonymous with the need of the West to ‘civilise’ the world. Institutions such as the World Economic Forum are Western institutions and still represent the goals of Western civilisation. This article argues that great leaps in science must be measured by the Christian church’s commitment to eschatology and a building of an egalitarian society on earth. The article seeks to explore if the notion of a black church can be instrumental in the 4IR for focusing on the human condition and humanity of the oppressed in Africa and Latin America. The article argues that the church’s role is to witness great change in society and it must be prepared to actively respond to great societal change posed by the 4IR. Contribution: This article focuses on theology and the Fourth Industrial Revolution, as such, cutting across disciplines. This allows engagements to occur in all disciplines, proving the relevance of theology today. The contribution of this research is its emphasis on the role of theology within techno-political development.",,,HTS Teologiese Studies / Theological Studies,,,,2020-08-03,2020,2020-08-03,,76,2,9,All OA; Gold,Article,"Mdingi, Hlulani M.","Mdingi, Hlulani M.

Taking into account plurilingual and pluricultural competence (PPC) and the efficacy of virtual exchanges for language learning, we used a series of tasks for students to participate in a wide range of activities of varying complexity regarding German and Colombian culture for a six-week exchange.  Students self-assessed their written and spoken online interactions as well as their perceived skills in mediating texts and communication based on the recently added descriptors in the Companion Volume to the CEFR. They also rated their plurilingual and pluricultural competences on a PPC scale at both the beginning and end of the project.

Extremophile microbial communities inhabiting evaporitic halite nodules (salt rocks) in the Atacama Desert, Chile, are a good model ecosystem for investigating factors leading to microbiome heterogeneity, due to their diverse taxonomic composition and the spatial segregation of individual nodules. We investigated the abiotic factors governing microbiome composition across different spatial scales, allowing for insight into the factors that govern halite colonization from regional desert-wide scales to micro-scales within individual nodules. We found that water availability and community drift account for microbiome assembly differently at different distance scales, with higher rates of cell dispersion at the smaller scales resulting in a more homogenous composition. This trend likely applies to other endoliths, and to non-desert communities, where dispersion between communities is limited. At the intra-nodule scales, a light availability gradient was most important in determining the distribution of microbial taxa despite intermixing by water displacement via capillary action.","We thank Mathias Meier for capturing aerial drone footage of the sampling area, Victoria Meslier for their help in sample collection, and Brian Glass for organizing field expeditions.",Funding.

This has prompted efforts to restore these ecosystems, however, the trajectory of community establishment on artificial reefs has not being widely described. We examined the composition of the species and functional groups of invertebrates and fish in relation to the artificial reefs over soft-bottom and barren-ground habitats over a 10-month period. We evaluated the community structure based on species richness, biomass, species diversity, and dominance of species and functional groups. We assessed the trajectories of the ecological succession of artificial reefs planted with kelp on each bottom type and determined the changes in the dissimilarity of species and functional groups over time. We also analysed the relationship between the biogeny (of macroalgae) over time (months) and the changes in macrobenthic community structure. Successional development of reefs communities was similar across the two habitat types, macroalgae contributed most to the early stage, while invertebrates and fish were the groups that contributed the most during the middle and late successional stages. A positive relationship was found between the presence of artificial reefs with kelp seedlings and the biomass of specific species and functional groups. This study showed that new kelp habitats promote the construction of biogenic structures that increase the habitat complexity, promote biodiversity, and increase populations of commercially harvested species. In this sense, artificial reefs should be considered an important tool for restoring the function of degraded benthic ecosystems.","This work was conducted as part of the doctoral thesis of the first author finance by Chilean National Commission for Scientific and Technical Development (CONICYT) and the Programa de Doctorado en Ciencias Aplicadas mención Sistemas Marinos Costeros at the University of Antofagasta, Chile.",,Global Ecology and Conservation,,,,2020-09,2020,,2020-09,23,,e01184,All OA; Gold,Article,"Campos, Leonardo; Ortiz, Marco; Rodríguez-Zaragoza, Fabián A.; Oses, Rómulo","Campos, Leonardo (Centro Regional de Investigación y Desarrollo Sustentable de Atacama (CRIDESAT), Universidad de Atacama, Copiapó, Región of Atacama, Chile; Programa de Doctorado en Ciencias Aplicadas Mención Sistemas Marinos Costeros, Universidad de Antofagasta, Av.

Then, by estimation of the parameters of the new model using least square fitting with field training data and comparing to the GNU model and Braun model (based on consumption), it was shown that the proposed model provides a better prediction in order to evaluate consumption of a centrifugal chiller in regular operation, by improving the coefficient of variation (CV), CV = 3.24% and R2 = 92.52% for a filtered sub-data. Through an algorithm built from steady-state cycle analysis, physical parameters (Sgen, Qleak,eq, R) were estimated to compare with the same parameters obtained by regression to check the influence of the interception term in the model. It was found that without an interception term, the estimated parameters achieve relative errors (ER) below 20%. Additional comparison between external and internal power prediction is shown, with CV = 3.57 % and mean relative error (MRE) of 2.7%, achieving better accuracy than GNU and Braun model.","The authors would like to thank Universidad del Norte and Colciencias through Convocatoria Doctorados Nacionales 727 of Fondo Nacional de Financiamiento para la Ciencia, la Tecnología e Innovación FCTeI, by Sistema General de Regalías SGR for supporting this research.","This research was funded by Colciencias through Convocatoria Doctorados Nacionales 727 of Fondo Nacional de Financiamiento para la Ciencia, la Tecnología e Innovación FCTeI, by Sistema General de Regalías SGR and Universidad del Norte.",Energies,,,,2020-04-28,2020,2020-04-28,,13,9,2135,All OA; Gold,Article,"Foliaco, Blanca; Bula, Antonio; Coombes, Peter","Foliaco, Blanca (Department of Mechanical Engineering, Universidad del Norte, Puerto Colombia 081001, Colombia;, abula@uninorte.edu.co); Bula, Antonio (Department of Mechanical Engineering, Universidad del Norte, Puerto Colombia 081001, Colombia;, abula@uninorte.edu.co); Coombes, Peter (School of Environment, Science and Engineering, Southern Cross University, Lismore NSW 2480, Australia;, peter.coombes@scu.edu.au)","Foliaco, Blanca (Universidad del Norte)","Foliaco, Blanca (Universidad del Norte); Bula, Antonio (Universidad del Norte); Coombes, Peter (Southern Cross University)",10,4,,2.74,https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/13/9/2135/pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1127273003,33 Built Environment and Design; 3302 Building; 40 Engineering,

Notwithstanding the rich fossil record of the modern great white shark (Carcharodon carcharias, GWS), its use of nursery areas in the fossil record has never been assessed before. Here, we analysed the fossil record of the GWS from three South American Pliocene localities, assessed body size distributions and applied previously established criteria to identify palaeo-nurseries. We found that juveniles dominate the Coquimbo locality (Chile), whereas subadults and adults characterize Pisco (Peru) and Caldera (Chile), respectively. These results, summed to the paleontological and paleoenvironmental record of the region, suggest that Coquimbo represents the first nursery area for the GWS in the fossil record. Our findings demonstrate that one of the top predators in today’s oceans has used nursery areas for millions of years, highlighting their importance as essential habitats for shark survival in deep time.","We thank C.

The Rapanui ethnic group assumes as one of its main claims against the State of Chile that the administration of the park be transferred to it, following the example of the lican antai indigenous communities (San Pedro de Atacama, Chile). The actions taken to achieve the transfer of the administration and the results reached by the rapanui part account for the political and economic uses of the Park, as an identity reference and source of income, in a context of increasing differentiation with respect to the State of Chile. The PNRN has various declarations of heritage since it concentrates monumental archeology sites on the island.

There are few investigations on this mineral in spite of it being formed during the leaching of chalcocite or digenite; the other investigations on covellite are with the use of mineraloids, copper concentrates, and synthetic covellite. The present investigation applied the surface optimization methodology using a central composite face design to evaluate the effect of leaching time, chloride concentration, and sulfuric acid concentration on the level of copper extraction from covellite (84.3% of purity). Copper is dissolved from a sample of pure covellite without the application of temperature or pressure; the importance of its purity is that the behavior of the parameters is analyzed, isolating the impurities that affect leaching. The chloride came from NaCl, and it was effectuated in a size range from –150 to +106 μm. An ANOVA indicated that the leaching time and chloride concentration have the most significant influence, while the copper extraction was independent of sulfuric acid concentration. The experimental data were described by a highly representative quadratic model obtained by linear regression (R2 = 0.99).","The authors are grateful for the contribution of the Scientific Equipment Unit-MAINI of the Universidad Católica del Norte for facilitating the chemical analysis of the solutions.

H-02-3 Reveals the Presence of Heavy Metal and Antibiotic Resistance Determinants,"Nuclear production and industrial activities led to widespread contamination of the Department of Energy (DOE) managed Savannah River Site (SRS), located in South Carolina, United States. The H-02 wetland system was constructed in 2007 for the treatment of industrial and storm water runoff from the SRS Tritium Facility. Albeit at low levels, mercury (Hg) has been detected in the soils of the H-02 wetland ecosystem. In anoxic sediments, Hg is typically methylated by anaerobic microbiota, forming the highly neurotoxic methylmercury (MeHg), which biomagnifies across food webs. However, in surficial oxic wetland soils, microbially mediated demethylation and/or volatilization processes can transform Hg2+ into the less toxic Hg0 form which is released into the atmosphere, thus circumventing MeHg formation. To obtain a deeper understanding on bacterial Hg volatilization, a robust Hg-resistant (HgR) bacteria, called as strain H-02-3 was isolated from the H-02 soils. A draft genome sequence of this strain was obtained at a coverage of 700×, which assembled in 44 contigs with an N50 of 171,569 bp. The genomic size of the strain H-02-3 was 4,708,612 bp with a total number of 4,240 genes; phylogenomic analysis revealed the strain as an Arthrobacter species. Comparative genomics revealed the presence of 1100 unique genes in strain H-02-3, representing 26.7% of the total genome; many identified previously as metal resistance genes (MRGs). Specific to Hg-cycling, the presence of mercuric ion reductase (merA), the organomercurial lyase (merB), and the mercuric resistance operon regulatory protein, were identified. By inference, it can be proposed that the organomercurial lyase facilitates the demethylation of MeHg into Hg2+ which is then reduced to Hg0 by MerA in strain H-02-3. Furthermore, gene prediction using resistome analysis of strain H-02-3 revealed the presence of several antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs), that statistically correlated with the presence of metal resistant genes (MRGs), suggesting co-occurrence patterns of MRGs and ARGs in the strain. Overall, this study delineates environmentally beneficial traits that likely facilitates survival of Arthrobacter sp. H-02-3 within the H-02 wetland soil. Finally, this study also highlights the largely ignored public health risk associated with the co-development of ARGs and MRGs in bacteria native to historically contaminated soils.","We acknowledge Drs.

Microbial communities in SH are exposed to low atmospheric pressure, high UV radiation, wide temperature ranges, salinity gradient and the presence of toxic compounds such as arsenic (As). In this work we focus on arsenic stress as one of the main adverse factors in SH and bacteria that belong to the Exiguobacterium genus due to their plasticity and ubiquity. Therefore, our aim was to shed light on the effect of niche conditions pressure (particularly arsenic), on the adaptation and divergence (at genotypic and phenotypic levels) of Exiguobacterium strains from five different SH sites. Also, to capture greater diversity in this genus, we use as outgroup five As(III) sensitive strains isolated from Easter Island (Chile) and The Great Salt Lake (United States). For this, samples were obtained from five different SH sites under an arsenic gradient (9 to 321 mg/kg: sediment) and isolated and sequenced the genomes of 14 Exiguobacterium strains, which had different arsenic tolerance levels. Then, we used comparative genomic analysis to assess the genomic divergence of these strains and their association with phenotypic differences such as arsenic tolerance levels and the ability to resist poly-stress. Phylogenetic analysis showed that SH strains share a common ancestor. Consequently, populations were separated and structured in different SH microenvironments, giving rise to multiple coexisting lineages. Hence, this genotypic variability is also evidenced by the COG (Clusters of Orthologous Groups) composition and the size of their accessory genomes. Interestingly, these observations correlate with physiological traits such as growth patterns, gene expression, and enzyme activity related to arsenic response and/or tolerance. Therefore, Exiguobacterium strains from SH are adapted to physiologically overcome the contrasting environmental conditions, like the arsenic present in their habitat.","We like to thank Dra.

Methods: a descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted with 77 patients with NCDs and their family caregivers, who were selected through systematic sampling between 2018 and 2019. Results: Most people with NCDs are women (55 %) at an average age of 70. Four out of five caregivers are women, at an average age of 40, who deliver care for an average of 14 hours a day. The total monthly cost for patient care was on average 324,207 COP. The most significant costs are related to health, food, housing, transport, and communication. 60.5 % of NCDs patients were responsible for household finances before becoming ill. About half of them stopped working and the other half experienced a reduction of 33 % in their monthly income after becoming ill. Conclusion: due to the need for complementary and comprehensive treatment, care, and interventions, costs related to care of NCDs patients increase despite the income of NCDs patients and their caregivers do not.",,,Aquichan,,,,2020-06-30,2020,2020-06-30,2020-06-30,20,2,2022,All OA; Gold,Article,"Páez Esteban, Astrid Nathalia; Torres Contreras, Claudia Consuelo; Campos de Aldana, María Stella; Solano Aguilar, Sonia; Quintero Lozano, Nubia; Chaparro Díaz, Olivia Lorena","Páez Esteban, Astrid Nathalia (Universidad de Santander); Torres Contreras, Claudia Consuelo (Universidad de Santander); Campos de Aldana, María Stella (Universidad de Santander); Solano Aguilar, Sonia (Universidad de Santander); Quintero Lozano, Nubia (Hospital San Juan de Dios de Floridablanca); Chaparro Díaz, Olivia Lorena (Universidad Nacional de Colombia)",,"Páez Esteban, Astrid Nathalia (Universidad de Santander); Torres Contreras, Claudia Consuelo (Universidad de Santander); Campos de Aldana, María Stella (Universidad de Santander); Solano Aguilar, Sonia (Universidad de Santander); Quintero Lozano, Nubia (Hospital San Juan de Dios de Floridablanca); Chaparro Díaz, Olivia Lorena (National University of Colombia)",8,5,,2.6,https://aquichan.unisabana.edu.co/index.php/aquichan/article/download/11635/5827,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1128874683,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 42 Health Sciences; 4203 Health Services and Systems; 4205 Nursing; 4206 Public Health,3 Good Health and Well Being

It is therefore necessary to have instruments with appropriate measurement properties to identify and measure this variable, so that inferences or interpretations are valid for decision-making.Objective: This study analyzes the measurement properties of the WHOQOL-OLD questionnaire for Peruvian institutionalized seniors.Method: Participants included 300 adults over 65 years (Mage=78.41) institutionalized in a nursing home in the city of Lima, of which 173 (57.7%) were men and 127 (42.3%) were women. The internal structure of the WHOQOL-OLD was assessed through confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), whereas the convergent validity was analyzed using the Quality of Life Index (QLI). In addition, reliability scores were calculated and a scale for the study sample was obtained.Results: The results show that the structure of the six factors involved in the WHOQOL-OLD is suitably adjusted to data (CFI = .97; TLI = .97; SRMR = .02; RMSEA = .06), with proper internal consistency (Cronbach’s α ranging from .94 to .98). Likewise, it is possible to observe significant relationships with the autonomy (rs = .13, p < .05) and social involvement (rs = .16, p < .01) dimensions included in the QLI.Conclusions: The WHOQOL-OLD Quality of Life Questionnaire has empirical evidence of validity and reliability that makes it an appropriate instrument to measure the quality of life variable.",,,Enfermería Global,,,,2020-09-20,2020,2020-09-20,,19,4,259-288,All OA; Gold,Article,"Ore, Stephanie Antonella Queirolo; Barboza-Palomino, Miguel; Ventura-León, José","Ore, Stephanie Antonella Queirolo (Universidad Peruana de Ciencias Aplicadas); Barboza-Palomino, Miguel (Universidad Privada del Norte); Ventura-León, José (Universidad Privada del Norte)",,"Ore, Stephanie Antonella Queirolo (Peruvian University of Applied Sciences); Barboza-Palomino, Miguel (Private University of the North); Ventura-León, José (Private University of the North)",8,5,,2.59,https://revistas.um.es/eglobal/article/download/420681/287421,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1133541031,42 Health Sciences; 4203 Health Services and Systems,

Concomitant with cell viability determination during storage (28 days), the pH, titratable acidity, syneresis, protein and fat were evaluated. The results indicated that neither UTNGt28 nor LacAT displayed a high capacity to ferment whole milk and survive during storage; a statistically significant difference (p < 0.05) in cell viability was registered for UTNGt28 compared with LacAT when inoculated alone or in combination with S. thermophilus. A principal component analysis showed a clear difference between the yogurt formulations at day 1 and 28 of storage. The PC 1 explained 46.8% of the total variance (day 28), was loaded in the negative (-) direction with titratable acidity (% lactic acid), while the PC 2 explained 22.5% (day 1) with pH.

We know that these seniors live increasingly alone, and this impairs their health and general wellbeing. Studies suggest that social networking sites (SNS) can reduce isolation, improve social participation, and increase autonomy. However, there is a lack of knowledge about the characteristics of older adult users of SNS in these new territories. Without this information, it is not possible to improve the adoption of SNS in this population. Based on decision trees, this study analyzes how the elderly users of various SNS in Chile are like. For this purpose, a segmentation of the different groups of elderly users of social networks was constructed, and the most discriminating variables concerning the use of these applications were classified. The results highlight the existence of considerable differences between the various social networks analyzed in their use and characterization. Educational level is the most discriminating variable, and gender influences the types of SNS use.

This interaction allows the specific association of microbial communities, which participate in a variety of processes in the host including protection against pathogens. Marine aquatic invertebrates such as scallops are also colonized by diverse microbial communities. Scallops remain healthy most of the time, and in general, only a few species are fatally affected on adult stage by viral and bacterial pathogens. Still, high mortalities at larval stages are widely reported and they are associated with pathogenic Vibrio. Thus, to give new insights into the interaction between scallop immune response and its associated microbiota, we assessed the involvement of two host antimicrobial effectors in shaping the abundances of bacterial communities present in the scallop Argopecten purpuratus hemolymph. To do this, we first characterized the microbiota composition in the hemolymph from non-stimulated scallops, finding both common and distinct bacterial communities dominated by the Proteobacteria, Spirochaetes and Bacteroidetes phyla. Next, we identified dynamic shifts of certain bacterial communities in the scallop hemolymph along immune response progression, where host antimicrobial effectors were expressed at basal level and early induced after a bacterial challenge. Finally, the transcript silencing of the antimicrobial peptide big defensin ApBD1 and the bactericidal/permeability-increasing protein ApLBP/BPI1 by RNA interference led to an imbalance of target bacterial groups from scallop hemolymph. Specifically, a significant increase in the class Gammaproteobacteria and the proliferation of Vibrio spp. was observed in scallops silenced for each antimicrobial. Overall, our results strongly suggest that scallop antimicrobial peptides and proteins are implicated in the maintenance of microbial homeostasis and are key molecules in orchestrating host-microbiota interactions. This new evidence depicts the delicate balance that exists between the immune response of A. purpuratus and the hemolymph microbiota.","We thank German Lira for all his support with scallop maintenance and procurement.

325,pub.1127524769,10.4102/hts.v76i2.5659,,,Developing pastoral therapy as a professional qualification in South Africa: Rationale and motivation,"The professional training of pastoral therapists has been a topic of controversy for many years in South Africa. Up to date, the training of pastoral workers has been limited to the study of ministry and as such is limited by the primary aims and outcomes of this curriculum. In a post-apartheid, post-colonial South Africa, the need for pastoral workers is intensified by the needs of community- and faith-based organisations for trained and registered therapists to alleviate the counselling needs of their beneficiaries on all social levels. This article discusses the current state of affairs of the training and curriculum related to the profession of pastoral therapy in the context of South Africa, the various sociopolitical and religious needs that are still left unanswered in the field, and makes recommendations for the registration and accreditation of the profession with a specific curriculum focused on multicultural, multi-spiritual and post-modern nuances. The author argues that such a curriculum, accredited by a statutory body, can operate as a national health resource, will be more cost-effective than other related health services and may transform the social justice landscape related to both the providers and beneficiaries of this type of care.",,,HTS Teologiese Studies / Theological Studies,,,,2020-05-12,2020,2020-05-12,,76,2,11,All OA; Gold,Article,"Meyer, Juanita","Meyer, Juanita (Department of Practical and Missional Theology, Faculty of Theology and Religion, University of the Free State, Bloemfontein)",,"Meyer, Juanita (University of the Free State)",1,1,,2.57,https://hts.org.za/index.php/hts/article/download/5659/15024,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1127524769,50 Philosophy and Religious Studies; 5004 Religious Studies; 5005 Theology,

By focusing on SGI South Africa, which has been able to reach out to a significant number of black, and, to a lesser extent, Coloured and Indian/Asian members, this ethnographic study aims to contribute to the understanding of Buddhism’s interplay with a broader cross-section of post-apartheid South African society, and, secondarily, to add to the existing literature on this Japanese new religious movement overseas. After a brief overview of the historical development of SGI in South Africa, my analysis focuses on SGI South Africa’s main ritual, social, and missionary activities; its interplay with local religions; its attempts to establish a meaningful link with South African culture; and, finally, on the religious experiences and narratives of SGI’s South African members.",,This project has received funding from the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under the Marie Sklodowska-Curie grant agreement No 793853.,Religions,,,,2020-11-11,2020,2020-11-11,,11,11,598,All OA; Gold,Article,"Dessì, Ugo","Dessì, Ugo (Department of Religious Studies, University of Vienna, Vienna 1010, Austria)",,"Dessì, Ugo (University of Vienna)",1,0,,2.57,https://www.mdpi.com/2077-1444/11/11/598/pdf?version=1605063580,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1132562741,50 Philosophy and Religious Studies; 5004 Religious Studies; 5005 Theology,
169,pub.1131075068,10.3389/fmars.2020.540643,,,Size-Fractionated Contribution of Microbial Biomass to Suspended Organic Matter in the Eastern Tropical South Pacific Oxygen Minimum Zone,"Cell membrane intact polar lipids (IPLs) are chemotaxonomic biomarkers whose abundances and distributions in water column environments reflect the living biomass of in situ microbial communities, and can be used to determine the relative contribution of distinct functional and phylogenetic groups to water column carbon stocks. The diversity of IPLs in marine environments is, however, vast, while our knowledge of their biological origins remains limited. Here, we study the distribution of IPLs in size-fractionated suspended organic matter from the oxygen minimum zone (OMZ) of the eastern tropical South Pacific (ETSP) off northern Chile. Canonical correspondence analyses of total IPL abundances and water column physiochemistry demonstrate distinct distributions of microbial sources associated with different geochemical regions in the water column (chlorophyll maximum, upper chemocline, lower chemocline, upper OMZ, core OMZ, and mesopelagic region). Furthermore, the distribution of IPLs in free-living (0.3–2.7 μm) and particle-attached (2.7–53 μm) suspended organic matter differs, suggesting distinct biological sources in each size fraction. While some parallels exist, the diversity and distribution of IPLs in the OMZ system of the ETSP off northern Chile exhibited some unique features compared to other OMZ systems; for instance, we observed a significantly lower contribution of betaine lipids from phytoplanktonic sources, possibly reflecting a physiological response to severe N-limitation in this area. The overall IPL abundance in the two size fractions also indicates a dominance of free-living biomass in the OMZ and mesopelagic regions, suggesting that these areas of the water column could provide additional sources of submicrometer-sized organic carbon to deeper waters. This study improves the utility of IPLs as chemotaxonomic biomarkers by providing insight into the contrasting distributions of microbial biomass from different life modes (free-living and particle-attached). Our results suggest that microbial production in low oxygen environments may be more important to total water column carbon stocks than previously thought.","We thank the captain and crew of the AGS-61 Cabo de Hornos, the chief scientist of the LowpHOx-2 cruise, Dr. Wolfgang Schneider (UdeC), in addition to personnel from the Millennium Institute of Oceanography (IMO) and the Laboratory of Aquatic Ecosystem Functioning at the University of Concepción for their assistance during the LowpHOx-2 cruise.

Prevalence of helminthic parasite infection of two (2) commercially important and easily-culturable fish species of Nigeria (Clarias gariepinus and Tilapia zillii) was studied in relation to sex and fish age (length and weight). 51 samples of Claris gariepinus and 34 samples of Tilapia zillii in Chanchaga River were caught by the use of a trawling net over a period of 24 months (September 2014 and October 2016). Four (4) classes of parasites were encountered between Clarias gariepinus and Tilapia zillii as the two species were infected with similar parasites: Monogenea, Cestode, Nematodes, and Acanthocephala, although nematode parasites were by far the most abundant. The infection rates of both Clarias gariepinus and Tilapia zillii with helminth parasites were high as their percentage infection was 88.2 % and 91.2, respectively. Females were slightly more infected than the males for both fish species, although the difference was not significant (P < 0.05). Fishes of higher lengths and weight for both Clarias gariepinus and Tilapia zillii were more prevalent in parasitic infection (higher % infection) than their counterparts with lower lengths and weights (lower % infection). There were no striking differences between Clarias gariepinus and Tilapia zillii in terms of parasite representation, sex, and age parameters. This phenomenon may not be unconnected to the fact that both fish species shared similar environmental conditions, dietary composition, and feeding habits. This study recommends a change of feeding habits and dietary composition with age and immune system state in order to reduce the infestation of parasites with the goal of increasing field yield efficiency.",,,Egyptian Journal of Aquatic Biology and Fisheries,,,,2020-08-12,2020,2020-08-12,2020-08-12,24,5,1-11,All OA; Gold,Article,"Mgbemena, Amaka; Arimoro, Francis; Omalu, Innocent; Keke, Unique","Mgbemena, Amaka (); Arimoro, Francis (); Omalu, Innocent (); Keke, Unique ()",,"Mgbemena, Amaka (); Arimoro, Francis (); Omalu, Innocent (); Keke, Unique ()",8,5,,2.56,https://ejabf.journals.ekb.eg/article_102364_1b628073b51523d1ff691a415ab75094.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1129540112,"30 Agricultural, Veterinary and Food Sciences; 3005 Fisheries Sciences; 3009 Veterinary Sciences",

The results of an adequate philosophical education are related to the training of autonomous, ethical subjects capable of living in democracy and who are self-conscious of the criteria of knowledge. In this approach, competencies and philosophical practice are defined, forming a heterogeneous group of abilities, experiences and values in which philosophy can be practiced in different places, situations and contexts. A more practical approach to philosophy makes students see this discipline more applicable, increases their taste for study and allows for dialogue and philosophical learning in other disciplines. The aim of this reflective work is to understand this philosophical learning as well as its contribution to the teaching of philosophy.",,,Praxis & Saber,,,,2020-01-02,2020,2020-01-02,,11,25,155-178,All OA; Gold,Article,"Rojas-Devia, Jorge Anibal; Londoño, Carlos Arturo","Rojas-Devia, Jorge Anibal (Universidad Pedagógica y Tecnológica de Colombia); Londoño, Carlos Arturo (Universidad Pedagógica y Tecnológica de Colombia)",,"Rojas-Devia, Jorge Anibal (Pedagogical and Technological University of Colombia); Londoño, Carlos Arturo (Pedagogical and Technological University of Colombia)",4,1,,2.54,https://revistas.uptc.edu.co/index.php/praxis_saber/article/download/9910/8690,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1124286173,39 Education; 3901 Curriculum and Pedagogy; 3903 Education Systems; 50 Philosophy and Religious Studies,4 Quality Education
160,pub.1128987945,10.3390/rs12132122,,,First Measurements of Gas Flux with a Low-Cost Smartphone Sensor-Based UV Camera on the Volcanoes of Northern Chile,"UV cameras have been used for over a decade in order to remotely sense SO2 emission rates from active volcanoes, and to thereby enhance our understanding of processes related to active and passive degassing. Whilst SO2 column density retrievals can be more accurate/sophisticated using alternative techniques (e.g., Differential Optical Absorption Spectrometer (DOAS), Correlation Spectrometer (COSPEC)), due to their higher spectral resolutions, UV cameras provide the advantage of high time-resolution emission rates, a much greater spatial resolution, and the ability to simultaneously retrieve plume speeds. Nevertheless, the relatively high costs have limited their uptake to a limited number of research groups and volcanic observatories across the planet. One recent intervention in this regard has been the introduction of the PiCam UV camera, which has considerably lowered instrumental cost. Here we present the first data obtained with the PiCam system from seven persistently degassing volcanoes in northern Chile, demonstrating robust field operation in challenging conditions and over an extended period of time, hence adding credence to the potential of these units for more widespread dissemination to the international volcanic gas measurement community. Small and weak plumes, as well as strongly degassing plumes were measured at distances ranging 0.6–10.8 km from the sources, resulting in a wide range of SO2 emission rates, varying from 3.8 ± 1.8 to 361 ± 31.6 td−1. Our acquired data are discussed with reference to previously reported emission rates from other ground-based remotely sensed techniques at the same volcanoes, in particular considering: resolution of single plume emissions in multi-plume volcanoes, light dilution, plume geometry, seasonal effects, and the applied plume speed measurement methodology. The main internal/external factors that influence positive/negative PiCam measurements include camera shake, light dilution, and the performance of the OpenCV and control points post processing methods. A simple reprocessing method is presented in order to correct the camera shake. Finally, volcanoes were separated into two distinct groups: low and moderate SO2 emission rates systems. These groups correlate positively with their volcanological characteristics, especially with the fluid compositions from fumaroles.","Our acknowledgments to Álvaro Vergara (Núcleo de Investigación en Riesgo Volcánico-Ckelar Volcanes) and José Sepúlveda (University of Florence, Italy) by their support in the fieldwork.","This research was partially funded by VRIDT-UCN Proyectos Especiales 2017 “Procesos que controlan el balance de masa en volcanes activos del norte de Chile” (FA, FR, and PA) and CONICYT-PCHA/Doctorado Nacional/2016-21160276 (SL).

First, the study framework is contextualized based on burnout syndrome and its incidence in various professions, then the methodology that guided the bibliographic review is exposed. Burnout syndrome has been (and still is) the subject of study in numerous investigations for more than three decades. This is how, through these, its incidence has been observed in a different way depending on the performance area of each profession. Hence the importance of knowing what the burnout syndrome consists of, symptoms and how the situations currently faced by professionals in the country because of the pandemic make us look back at it.",,,Interconectando Saberes,,,,2020-08-05,2020,2020-08-05,,,10,,All OA; Gold,Article,"De Arco Paternina, Lilian Karina; Hernández, José Andrés Castillo","De Arco Paternina, Lilian Karina (Universidad Americana de Europa (UNADE)); Hernández, José Andrés Castillo (Universidad Americana de Europa (UNADE))",,"De Arco Paternina, Lilian Karina (Universidad Americana de Europa (UNADE)); Hernández, José Andrés Castillo (Universidad Americana de Europa (UNADE))",4,0,,2.53,https://is.uv.mx/index.php/IS/article/download/2675/4570,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1131816453,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 48 Law and Legal Studies; 4802 Environmental and Resources Law,

Extracellular ATP is known to signal through plasma membrane receptors of the P2Y and P2X families. Among the P2X receptors, P2X7 has attracted increasing interest in the field of inflammation as well as in cancer. P2X7 is expressed by immune cells and by most malignant tumor cells where it plays a crucial yet complex role that remains to be clarified. P2X7 activity has been associated with production and release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, modulation of the activity and survival of immune cells, and the stimulation of proliferation and migratory properties of tumor cells. Hence, P2X7 plays an intricate role in the tumor microenvironment combining beneficial and detrimental effects that need to be further investigated. For this, we developed a novel methodology termed AAVnano based on the use of Adeno-associated viral vectors (AAV) encoding nanobodies targeting P2X7. We discuss here the advantages of this tool to study the different functions of P2X7 in cancer and other pathophysiological contexts.",,Funding.

In these revisions many species have been provisionally classified in the genus Octopus. Recent genetic studies have synonymized some New Zealand species with octopuses from other regions. The present study investigates the systematics and phylogeny of octopuses from New Zealand using eighty eight specimens, three mitochondrial genes (16S rRNA, cytochrome c oxidase subunit I, and cytochrome c oxidase subunit III) and one nuclear gene (Rhodopsin). Forty-four new octopod DNA sequences (belonging to 13 species) were included, adding to the 83 existing sequences from GenBank. All sequences were used to generate phylogenetic trees based on Maximum Likelihood (ML) and Bayesian inference (BI), with a data set composed by 97 species, including octopod sister groups and Vampyroteuthis infernalis as an outgroup. Gene tree and species delimitation analyses revealed a distinct genetic difference between two sympatric Graneledone subspecies, which we propose as valid species. Muusoctopus tangaroa is a sister species of M. thielei from Kerguelen; while Enteroctopus zealandicus forms a clade with E. megalocyathus from South America and E. dofleini from the North Pacific. Similarly, Octopus campbelli, O. huttoni, and O. mernoo form a monophyletic group with Robsonella fontaniana from South America, Scaeurgus unicirrhus from the Atlantic and O. pallidus from Australia. Pinnoctopus cordiformis is close to Grimpella thaumastocheir and several species of Octopus sensu lato as in previous phylogenetic studies. This study suggests that octopuses from New Zealand have different phylogenetic and biogeographic origins and represent independent radiations into this region.","We appreciate the assistance of Keith Michael, Sadie Mills, Diana Macpherson, Fabiola Peña, Angela Fleming, Simon Morton, Darren W.

The aim of the present work was to evaluate the cytotoxic and antitumor activity of a polyphenolic fraction obtained from Thalassia testudinum marine plant and thalassiolin B in human colorectal cancer cells. Human cancer cell lines, including HCT15, HCT116, SW260, and HT29 were treated with tested products for cytotoxicity evaluation by crystal violet assay. The potential proapoptotic effect of these natural products was assessed by flow cytometry in HCT15 cells at 48 h using Annexin V-FITC/propidium iodide. In addition, reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation was measured by fluorescence using DCFH-DA staining, and sulfhydryl concentration by spectrophotometry. The in vivo antitumor activity of the polyphenolic fraction (25 mg/kg) was evaluated in a xenograft model in nu/nu mice. In vivo proapoptotic effect was also evaluated by immunohistochemistry using anti-caspase 3 and anti-Bcl-2 antibodies. The results showed that tested products exert colorectal cancer cell cytotoxicity. Besides, the tested products induced a significant increase (p < 0.05) of intracellular ROS generation, and a depletion of sulfhydryl concentration in HCT15 cells. The polyphenolic fraction arrested tumor growth and induced apoptosis in the xenograft mice model. These results demonstrate the cytotoxic activity of T. testudinum metabolites associated, at least, with ROS overproduction and pro-apoptotic effects. Here we demonstrated for the first time the antitumor activity of a T. testudinum polar extract in a xenograft mice model. These results suggest the potential use of T. testudinum marine plant metabolites as adjuvant treatment in cancer therapy.","The authors are grateful to N.

Para ello, se plantea la posibilidad de aprehensión del horizonte del sí mismo del Dasein, en contra de los propios análisis heideggerianos sobre el uno (§§ 25-27), y, también, se muestra de qué manera la mismidad del Dasein se presupone ya en el modo de aparición del mundo-entorno a través del existenciario significatividad. La conclusión del artículo intentará descubrir los posibles rendimientos fenomenológicos de la apertura del horizonte del sí-mismo del Dasein.
Abstract The main goal of the paper is to determine who is the Dasein itself from the appearance of the world in the Book of Martin Heidegger Being and time (§§ 14-18). For this, it raises the possibility of understanding the horizon of the self of Dasein itself differently to Heidegger’s analysis about the they (§§ 25-27) and also it shows how the Selfhood of Dasein is presupposed already in the appearance of the world-environment through the existential meaningfulness. The conclusion of this paper will try to discover the phenomenological yields of Dasein’s openness as horizon of its Selfhood.",,,Trans/Form/Ação,,,,2020,2020,2020,,43,spe,0269-0294,All OA; Gold,Article,"Periñán, Juan José Garrido","Periñán, Juan José Garrido (Universidad de Sevilla, Sevilla, España., Universidad de Sevilla, Sevilla, España)",,"Periñán, Juan José Garrido (University of Seville)",2,0,,2.48,http://www.scielo.br/pdf/trans/v43nspe/0101-3173-trans-43-spe-0269.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1137513724,50 Philosophy and Religious Studies; 5003 Philosophy,

Most ENM algorithms provide normally exhaustive searches through variable space; however, selecting variables to include in models is a first challenge. The estimation of the explanatory power of variables and the selection of the most appropriate variable set within models can be a second challenge. Although some ENMs incorporate the variable selection rubric inside the algorithms, there is no integrated rubric to evaluate the variable importance in the Genetic Algorithm for Ruleset Production (GARP). Here, we designed a novel variable selection methodology based on the rulesets generated from a GARP experiment. The importance of the variables in a GARP experiment can be estimated based on the consideration of the prevalence of each environmental variable in the dominant presence rules of the best subset of models and its coverage. We tested the performance of this variable selection method based on simulated species with both weak and strong responses to simulated environmental covariates. The variable selection method generally performed well during the simulations with over 2/3 of the trials correctly identifying most covariates. We then predict the distribution of Toxostoma rufum (a bird with a cosmopolitan distribution) in the continental United States (US) and apply our variable selection procedure as a real-world example. We found that the distribution of T. rufum could be accurately modeled with 13 or 10 of 21 variables, using an UI cutoff of 0.5 or 0.25, respectively, arriving at parsimonious environmental coverages with good model accuracy. We also provide tools to simulate species distributions for testing ENM approaches using R.","This study was supported by the National Institutes of Health (No. 1R01GM117617) to Jason K. Blackburn.

1576,pub.1129630091,10.7307/ptt.v32i4.3385,,,Factors Influencing Crash Frequency on Colombian Rural Roads,"Traffic crashes in Colombia have become a public health problem causing about 7,000 deaths and 45,000 severe injuries per year. Around 40% of these events occur on rural roads, taking note that the vulnerable users (pedestrians, motorcyclists, cyclists) account for the largest percentage of the victims. The objective of this research is to identify the factors that influence the frequency of crashes, including the singular orography of the country. For this purpose, we estimated Negative Binomial (Poisson-gamma) regression, Zero-inflated model, and generalized the linear mixed model, thus developing a comparative analysis of results in the Colombian context. The data used in the study came from the official sources regarding records about crashes with consequences; that is, with the occurrence of fatalities or injuries on the Colombian roads. For collecting the highway characteristics, an in-field inventory was conducted, gathering information about both infrastructure and operational parameters in more than three thousand kilometres of the national network. The events were geo-referenced, with registries of vehicles, involved victims, and their condition. The results suggest that highways in flat terrain have higher crash frequency than highways in rolling or mountainous terrain. Besides, the presence of pedestrians, the existence of a median and the density of intersections per kilometre also increase the probability of crashes. Meanwhile, roads with shoulders and wide lanes have lower crash frequency. Specific interventions in the infrastructure and control for reducing crashes risk attending the modelling results have been suggested.",,,PROMET - Traffic&Transportation,,,,2020-07-09,2020,2020-07-09,,32,4,449-460,All OA; Gold,Article,"Arévalo-Támara, Andrea; Orozco-Fontalvo, Mauricio; Cantillo, Víctor","Arévalo-Támara, Andrea (Santo Tomás University, Bogotá, Colombia); Orozco-Fontalvo, Mauricio (Universidad Militar Nueva Granada, Bogotá, Colombia); Cantillo, Víctor (Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia)",,"Arévalo-Támara, Andrea (Santo Tomás University, Bogotá, Colombia); Orozco-Fontalvo, Mauricio (Military University Nueva Granada); Cantillo, Víctor (Universidad del Norte)",9,3,,2.44,https://traffic.fpz.hr/index.php/PROMTT/article/download/3385/561561836,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1129630091,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3509 Transportation, Logistics and Supply Chains; 40 Engineering; 4005 Civil Engineering",3 Good Health and Well Being

Here we present a study aimed at characterizing the viral fraction and the microbial communities through metagenomic analysis. Two ponds (H0 and H3) were examined in November 2015. Water samples were processed using tangential flow filtration to obtain metagenomes from which the DNA fraction of the sample was amplified and sequenced (HiSeq system, Illumina). The ponds were characterized by freshwater and the viral-like particles to picoplankton ratio was 12.1 and 2.3 for H0 and H3, respectively. A great number of unassigned viral sequences were found in H0 (55.8%) and H3 (32.8%), followed by the family Fuselloviridae 20.8% (H0) and other less relatively abundant groups such as Microviridae (H0, 11.7% and H3, 3.3%) and Inoviridae (H3, 2.7%). The dominant viral sequences in both metagenomes belong to the order Caudovirales, with Siphoviridae being the most important family, especially in H3 (32.7%). The most important bacteria phyla were Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes in both sites, followed by Cyanobacteria (H0). Genes encoding lysogenic and lytic enzymes (i.e., recombinases and integrases) were found in H0 and H3, indicating a potential for active viral replication at the time of sampling; this was supported by the presence of viral metabolic auxiliary genes at both sites (e.g., cysteine hydrolase). In total, our study indicates a great novelty of viral groups, differences in taxonomic diversity and replication pathways between sites, which contribute to a better understanding of how viruses balance the cycling of energy and matter in this extreme environment.","We are grateful to Melline Noronha and Ricardo Valencia for their technical support in data analysis.

However, there are few studies on the relationship between workplace climate and violence in the university context. Objective: To analyze the relationship between workplace climate and violence in public university employees. Materials and Methods: A descriptive correlational study with a cross-sectional design was conducted with 410 workers. The Work Climate Questionnaire of the Administrative Department of Public Service of Colombia and the Inventory of Violence and Psychological Harassment at Work were used. Results: It was found that there is a negative relationship between climate and violence in the workplace (r = -0.441, p <0.005), in which two close associations are highlighted: (i) the dimension of work performance obstacles and the leadership style; and (ii) human talent management and general climate. Conclusions: The presence of workplace violence is related to low levels of a favorable work environment and vice versa. The characteristic behaviors of the dimension world performance obstacles and those related to the variable manipulation to induce punishment are the ones that contribute the most to this unfavorable association.

Understanding how these can be modulated at low-frequency is thus critical to infer their role in the climate system. Here we use 26 years of satellite altimeter data and regional oceanic modeling to investigate the modulation of eddy kinetic energy (EKE) off Peru and Chile by ENSO, the main mode of natural variability in the tropical Pacific. We show that EKE tends to increase during strong Eastern Pacific (EP) El Niño events along the Peruvian coast up to northern Chile and decreases off central Chile, while it is hardly changed during Central Pacific El Niño and La Niña events. However the magnitude of the EKE changes during strong EP El Niño events is not proportional to their strength, with in particular the 1972/1973 El Niño event standing out as an extreme event in terms of EKE increase off Peru reaching an amplitude three times as large as that during the 1997/1998 El Niño event, and the 2015/2016 El Niño having instead a weak impact on EKE. This produces decadal changes in EKE, with a similar pattern than that of strong EP El Niño events, resulting in a significant negative (positive) long-term trend off Peru (central Chile).",Carlos Conejero was supported by a doctoral scholarship from the National Chilean Research and Technology Council (CONICYT) through the program Becas Chile (scholarship N°72170554).

Andes centro-sur, norte de Chile","The Province of El Loa, historically inhabited by the Andean population dedicated to agriculture, herding and exchange activities, has occupied a strategic place in the expansion of Chilean copper industry and its international insertion. Here is located Chuquicamata, the largest copper mine in the world by an important part of the 20th century. To advance in the understanding of the territory that produces this activity, we carry out a historical-structural analysis of the agriculture practiced in the province between 1929/30 and 2006/07. We characterize analytically the agrarian transformations of the area relating their development with the expansion of the great copper mining. Theoretically, we position ourselves from the paradigm of the agrarian question, which we re-problematize by linking it with the studies on extractivism. Methodologically we use descriptive statistics of agricultural censuses for the characterization of the agrarian structure, and historical and secondary sources that allow us to understand their connections with the copper exploitation.",,,Estudios Atacameños,,,,2020-11-18,2020,2020-11-18,,,66,387-417,All OA; Gold,Article,"Calderón, Matías; Prieto, Manuel","Calderón, Matías (Universidad Católica del Norte); Prieto, Manuel (Universidad de Tarapacá)",,"Calderón, Matías (Catholic University of the North); Prieto, Manuel (University of Tarapacá)",4,3,,2.4,https://revistas.ucn.cl/index.php/estudios-atacamenos/article/download/3361/3681,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1132759181,44 Human Society; 4404 Development Studies,

Pineapple is one of the common fruits sold as ready-to-eat slices by ambulant vendors in the street or on public transport at risk of contamination by various microorganisms. Previously, we selected Lactobacillus plantarum UTNCys5-4 and Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis Gt28 strains producing peptides with high capacity to inhibit pathogen growth in vitro. In this study, the effect of different edited formulations containing a mixture of Cys5-4/Gt28 peptides was evaluated in vitro and ex vitro against a pathogenic cocktail containing E. coli (2), Salmonella (2) and Shigella (1). The growth of bacterial cocktail co-inoculated with cell-free supernatant containing peptides (formulation T1) and precipitated peptides (formulation T6), in a ratio of Cys5-4/Gt28:1:1 (v/v), results in a decrease of total cell viability with 1.85 and 1.2 log CFU/mL orders of magnitude at 6 h of incubation. About the same decrease (1.9 log CFU/g) was observed when pineapple slices artificially inoculated with the pathogenic cocktail were coated with T1 formulation, indicating the capacity to diminish simultaneous pathogens in situ, thus demonstrating its great biological control and protection. However, the E. coli cell counts reduced by 2.08 log CFU/g while Salmonella and Shigella cell counts reduced by 1.43 and 1.91 log CFU/g, respectively, at 5 days of refrigeration. In the untreated pineapple slices, the total cell density was maintained during storage, suggesting the adaptation of the pathogens to the fruit matrix. The peptide-based formulation exerted a bacteriolytic mode of action inducing pathogenic cell death. The results indicate that coating pineapple slices with peptide-based formulation is a promising approach to protect them from further contamination by microbial spoilage as well as an alternative to increase the food safety.",I express my gratitude to Ing.

However, little research has focused on exploring the factors that can mitigate this effect. Within this framework, the present study examined the mediating role of positive and negative affects in the relationship between ethnic and racial discrimination and psychological well-being in the migrant population. About 919 Colombians, first-generation migrants, residing in Chile (Arica, Antofagasta, and Santiago) were evaluated, of which 50.5% were women, and the participants' average age was 35 years (range: 18-65 years). Krieger's discrimination questionnaires, Watson's Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS), and Ryff's Psychological Well-Being Scale were applied. The measurement models of each variable were estimated, and then the structural equation models were used. The results of the hypothesized multiple mediation model showed that the main mediator in the relationship between ethnic-racial discrimination and psychological well-being was positive affects over negative ones.",,Funding.

This scheme is a member of the family of asymmetric cryptographic primitives based on multivariable polynomials over a finite field K and has been submitted as candidate to the ongoing National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) standardisation process of post-quantum signature schemes. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that this scheme is evaluated in this setting. To perform our assessment of the scheme in this setting, we review two implementations of this scheme, the reference implementation and the libpqcrypto implementation, to learn the most common in-memory private key formats and next develop a key recovery algorithm exploiting the structure of this scheme. Since the LUOV’s key generation algorithm generates its private components and public components from a 256-bit seed, the key recovery algorithm works for all the parameter sets recommended for this scheme. Additionally, we tested the effectiveness and performance of the key recovery algorithm through simulations and found the key recovery algorithm may retrieve the private seed when α = 0.001 (probability that a 0 bit of the original secret key will flip to a 1 bit) and β (probability that a 1 bit of the original private key will flip to a 0 bit) in the range { 0.001 , 0.01 , 0.02 , … , 0.15 } by enumerating approximately 2 40 candidates.",,This research was funded by Universidad del Norte grant number 2019-029 and the APC was funded by Universidad del Norte.,Applied Sciences,,,,2020-06-15,2020,2020-06-15,,10,12,4106,All OA; Gold,Article,"Villanueva-Polanco, Ricardo","Villanueva-Polanco, Ricardo (Computer Science Department, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla 080001, Colombia)",,"Villanueva-Polanco, Ricardo (Universidad del Norte)",8,2,,2.32,https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3417/10/12/4106/pdf?version=1592209930,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1128516293,46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4604 Cybersecurity and Privacy,

Peracarid crustaceans are one of the dominant and most species-rich groups of the SO benthos. To date, our knowledge on the influence of environmental variables in shaping abundance and species composition in the SO’s peracarid assemblages is limited, and with regard to ice coverage it is unknown. The aim of our study was to assess the influence of sea ice coverage, chlorophyll-a, and phytoplankton concentrations on abundance, distribution and assemblage structure of peracarids. In addition, the influence of other physical parameters on peracarid abundance was assessed, including depth, temperature, salinity, sediment type, current velocity, oxygen, iron, nitrate, silicate and phosphate. Peracarids were sampled with an epibenthic sledge (EBS) in different areas of the Atlantic sector of the SO and in the Weddell Sea. Sampling areas were characterized by different regimes of ice coverage (the ice free South Orkney Islands, the seasonally ice-covered Filchner Trough and the Eastern Antarctic Peninsula including the Prince Gustav Channel which was formerly covered by a perennial ice shelf). In total 64766 individuals of peracarids were collected and identified to order level including five orders: Amphipoda, Cumacea, Isopoda, Mysidacea, and Tanaidacea. Amphipoda was the most abundant taxon, representing 32% of the overall abundances, followed by Cumacea (31%), Isopoda (29%), Mysidacea (4%), and Tanaidacea (4%). The Filchner Trough had the highest abundance of peracarids, while the South Orkney Islands showed the lowest abundance compared to other areas. Ice coverage was the main environmental driver shaping the abundance pattern and assemblage structure of peracarids and the latter were positively correlated with ice coverage and chlorophyll-a concentration. We propose that the positive correlation between sea ice and peracarid abundances is likely due to phytoplankton blooms triggered by seasonal sea ice melting, which might increase the food availability for benthos. Variations in ice coverage extent and seasonality due to climate change would strongly influence the abundance and assemblage structure of benthic peracarids.","We would like to thank the scientists and crew that were on board of the RRS James Clark Ross and the RV Polarstern expeditions, and the people who helped to collect the samples.

Objective: To estimate the association between physical disability and the incidence of clinically significant depressive symptoms in older Mexican adults.
Materials and methods: We conducted a retrospective cohort study with data from the Encuesta Nacional sobre Salud y Envejecimiento en México (ENASEM). The analytical sample (n=6,780) included adults over 50 years old with measurements for the main variables and no clinically significant depressive symptoms reported in the first round. These symptoms were evaluated with the CESD-9 scale and disability by means of the report of activities of daily living (ADL) or instrumental activities of daily living (IADL). Descriptive, bivariate, and multivariate analyses were performed using logistic regression models adjusted by sociodemographic variables, health conditions, childhood adversities, social participation, and stressful life events.
Results: The incidence of clinically significant depressive symptoms was 25.75% (95% CI: 24,70 - 26,80). Compared to those without IADL limitations, an increased risk of 68% for the development of clinically significant depressive symptoms was found (95% CI: 1.10-2.57; p= 0,015). With the ADL model, the OR for the development of clinically significant depressive symptoms was 1.36 (1.01 -1.81; p= 0.039). Both models were adjusted by confounding variables.
Conclusion: Presenting limitations in daily life is an important risk factor for the development of clinically significant depressive symptoms at two years of follow-up.",,,Biomédica,,,"Activities of Daily Living; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Confidence Intervals; Depression; Disabled Persons; Female; Humans; Incidence; Logistic Models; Male; Mexico; Middle Aged; Obesity; Retrospective Studies; Social Participation; Stress, Psychological",2020-12-02,2020,2020-12-02,,40,4,641-655,All OA; Gold,Article,"Luna-Orozco, Karen; Fernández-Niño, Julián Alfredo; Astudillo-García, Claudia Iveth","Luna-Orozco, Karen (Departamento de Salud Pública, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia, Universidad del Norte, Departamento de Salud Pública, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); Fernández-Niño, Julián Alfredo (Departamento de Salud Pública, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia, Universidad del Norte, Departamento de Salud Pública, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); Astudillo-García, Claudia Iveth (Servicios de Atención Psiquiátrica, Secretaría de Salud, Ciudad de México, México, Escuela de Enfermería de la Secretaría de Salud del DF, Secretaría de Salud, México, Mexico)","Astudillo-García, Claudia Iveth (Secretaria de Salud)","Luna-Orozco, Karen (Universidad del Norte); Fernández-Niño, Julián Alfredo (Universidad del Norte); Astudillo-García, Claudia Iveth (Secretaria de Salud)",7,3,0.52,2.29,https://revistabiomedica.org/index.php/biomedica/article/download/5398/4586,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1133086102,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3202 Clinical Sciences; 42 Health Sciences; 4203 Health Services and Systems,

Only regarding the environmental impact, the application of these biological coatings on buildings has the potential of acting as a thermal, moisture, noise, and electromagnetic barrier. At the urban scale, they might reduce the heat island effect and sewage system load, improve runoff water and air quality, and reconstruct natural landscapes including wildlife. In spite of these significant benefits, the current design and construction methods are not completely regulated by law because there is a lack of knowledge of their technical performance. Hence, this review of the current state of the art presents a proper green roof classification based on their components and vegetation layer. Similarly, a detailed description from the key factors that control the hydraulic and thermal performance of green roofs is given. Based on these factors, an estimation of the impact of green roof systems on sustainable construction certifications is included (i.e., LEED—Leadership in Energy and Environment Design, BREEAM—Building Research Establishment Environmental Assessment Method, CASBEE—Comprehensive Assessment System for Built Environment Efficiency, BEAM—Building Environmental Assessment Method, ESGB—Evaluation Standard for Green Building). Finally, conclusions and future research challenges for the correct implementation of green roofs are addressed.","The authors thank Dos Mundos (Cali, Colombia) and Pontificia Universidad Javeriana Cali (Colombia) for the technical support given during the experiments reported in this article.",This research received no external funding.,Coatings,,,,2020-01-13,2020,2020-01-13,,10,1,69,All OA; Gold,Article,"Naranjo, Alejandra; Colonia, Andrés; Mesa, Jaime; Maury, Heriberto; Maury-Ramírez, Aníbal","Naranjo, Alejandra (Department of Civil and Industrial Engineering, Pontificia Universidad Javeriana Cali, Cali 760031, Colombia;, alejanaranjo@gmail.com); Colonia, Andrés (Gerencia, Dos Mundos, Cali 760050, Colombia;, gerencia@dosmundos.org); Mesa, Jaime (Department of Mechanical Engineering, Universidad Tecnológica de Bolívar, Cartagena de Indias 130001, Colombia;, jmesa@utb.edu.co); Maury, Heriberto (Department of Mechanical Engineering, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla 081007, Colombia;, hmaury@uninorte.edu.co); Maury-Ramírez, Aníbal (Department of Civil and Industrial Engineering, Pontificia Universidad Javeriana Cali, Cali 760031, Colombia;, alejanaranjo@gmail.com; Engineering Faculty, Universidad De La Salle, Bogotá 111711, Colombia)","Maury-Ramírez, Aníbal (Pontificia Universidad Javeriana; University of La Salle)","Naranjo, Alejandra (Pontificia Universidad Javeriana); Colonia, Andrés (Gerencia, Dos Mundos, Cali 760050, Colombia;, gerencia@dosmundos.org); Mesa, Jaime (Universidad Tecnológica de Bolívar); Maury, Heriberto (Universidad del Norte); Maury-Ramírez, Aníbal (Pontificia Universidad Javeriana; University of La Salle)",21,6,,2.27,https://www.mdpi.com/2079-6412/10/1/69/pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1124067287,40 Engineering; 4016 Materials Engineering,11 Sustainable Cities and Communities
1273,pub.1128814952,10.1002/ppp3.10113,,,Building a socio‐ecological monitoring platform for the comprehensive management of tropical dry forests,"Societal Impact Statement Tropical dry forests (TDF) underpin the wellbeing of millions, mostly rural populations; yet have suffered from severe clearing in Colombia, triggering cascading effects such as desertification. By engaging scientists, society, and institutions in the establishment of platforms for monitoring biodiversity and ecosystem functioning, crucial knowledge gaps will be bridged, helping to find a path toward sustainable development. Science‐led but socially and economically anchored information on biodiversity will help to incorporate nature's contributions to people into the society's cultural values. Ultimately, these transformative actions will translate into the comprehensive management of TDF through a greater impact in decision making.  Summary   Thousands of permanent plots have been established across the tropics with the purpose of monitoring tree communities. Research outcomes from these platforms, however, have been mainly directed toward the academic community, and their contribution to society has been limited so far. Here, we show how generating robust data on biodiversity has supported decision making in Colombian tropical dry forests (TDF), where less than 8% of their original cover remains. As a first step to build a national dialogue around the critical status of this ecosystem, a national collaborative network on TDF research and monitoring was born in 2014, the Red de Investigación y Monitoreo del Bosque Seco Tropical en Colombia (Red BST‐Col). Our main goal is to generate scientifically sound information that feeds into the comprehensive management of this ecosystem. To do so, a set of biodiversity monitoring platforms has been established across the country, which have already served to answer socio‐ecological questions related with deforestation drivers, citizen science, or the valuation of ecosystem services. Overall, this research agenda has nurtured the four lines that underpin the Program for the comprehensive management of dry forests in Colombia (knowledge management, preservation, restoration, and sustainable use), formulated by the Humboldt Institute, the United Nations Development Programme, and the Ministry of Environment in 2019. Many challenges are ahead, however, for a complex territory where multiple social actors and productive sectors coexist. The ultimate goal is to integrate all the dimensions of biodiversity to achieve a synthetic understanding of the functioning of the most endangered ecosystem in Colombia, and its relationship with local communities' wellbeing.","This paper is the result of many years of collaborative work among members of the Red BST‐Col. The research agenda in TDF would not have been possible without the hospitality and assistance of all the owners, administrators, and indigenous communities of all TDF areas that we visited. We warmly thank all the members of the Red BST‐Col for their invaluable commitment.

Herein, MFCs were manufactured using zinc and copper electrodes and three types of organic waste (R. ulmifolius, H. undatus, and M. citrifolia) as the substrate. The results revealed that the H. undatus waste generated the highest voltage and current values, i.e., 1.17 ± 0.12 V and 25.78 ± 0.89 mA, respectively, in an open circuit. However, all the substrates exhibited acidic pH values. The H. undatus substrate reported the highest voltage, power density (PD), and current density (CD) values at a V max value of 1.11 ± 0.25 V, a PD max value of 0.0719 ± 0.0012 W/cm2, and a CD max value of 0.051 A/cm2. Conversely, the R. ulmifolius substrate exhibited the lowest values at a V max value of 0.96 ± 0.13 V, a PD max value of 0.0668 ± 0.0013 W/cm2, and a CD max value of 0.025 A/cm2.

The number of cases peaks during the rainy season and may reach epidemic proportions in the event of flooding. It is possible that people living in areas affected by natural disasters are at greater risk of contracting the disease. The aim of this study was to identify clusters of relatively higher risk for leptospirosis occurrence, both in space and time, in six municipalities of Santa Catarina, Brazil, which had the highest incidence of the disease between 2000 and 2016, and to evaluate if these clusters coincide with the occurrence of natural disasters. The cases were geocoded with the geographic coordinates of patients' home addresses, and the analysis was performed using SaTScan software. The areas mapped as being at risk for hydrological and mass movements were compared with the locations of detected leptospirosis clusters. The disease was more common in men and in the age group from 15 to 69 years. In the scan statistics performed, only space-time showed significant results. Clusters were detected in all municipalities in 2008, when natural disasters preceded by heavy rainfall occurred. One of the municipalities also had clusters in 2011. In these clusters, most of the cases lived in urban areas and areas at risk for experiencing natural disasters. The interaction between time (time of disaster occurrence) and space (areas at risk of experiencing natural disasters) were the determining factors affecting cluster formation.",,,Geospatial Health,,,"Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Brazil; Child; Child, Preschool; Cities; Environment; Humans; Infant; Infant, Newborn; Leptospirosis; Male; Middle Aged; Natural Disasters; Spatial Analysis; Spatio-Temporal Analysis; Young Adult",2020-11-26,2020,2020-11-26,,15,2,,All OA; Gold,Article,"Silva, Ana Elisa Pereira; Chiaravalloti Neto, Francisco; Conceição, Gleice Margarete de Souza","Silva, Ana Elisa Pereira (School of Public Health, University of São Paulo, São Paulo. anaepsilva@hotmail.com.); Chiaravalloti Neto, Francisco (School of Public Health, University of São Paulo, São Paulo. franciscochiara@usp.br.); Conceição, Gleice Margarete de Souza (School of Public Health, University of São Paulo, São Paulo. gleice@usp.br.)",,"Silva, Ana Elisa Pereira (Universidade de São Paulo); Chiaravalloti Neto, Francisco (Universidade de São Paulo); Conceição, Gleice Margarete de Souza (Universidade de São Paulo)",10,6,1.12,2.24,https://geospatialhealth.net/index.php/gh/article/download/903/914,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1132947816,40 Engineering; 4013 Geomatic Engineering; 42 Health Sciences; 4202 Epidemiology,

Hydrometallurgical plants are currently changing to concentration by flotation-matte smelting deposits when oxide minerals run out and chalcopyrite appears in deposits. The change from hydrometallurgical processing to flotation is mainly dependent on whether comminution costs can be absorbed given the copper grade. It is important to develop alternative technologies to work profitably with low-grade copper sulphide ores. One alternative that has been recently studied is the pretreatment of low copper grade sulphide minerals, especially chalcopyrite, to improve leaching efficiency. The curing time, as pretreatment, improves dissolution kinetics and shortens leaching time. This study used a pure sample of chalcopyrite mineral with 28.5% copper. Chalcanthite (copper sulphate) represented 9% of total copper in the sample. The effect of curing time as a function of copper extraction prior to leaching was evaluated using different concentrations of sodium chloride (NaCl), potassium nitrate (KNO3) and sulphuric acid (H2SO4). A 23% copper dissolution was obtained prior to leaching using 25kg/t NaCl, 15kg/t H2SO4 and 15 days of curing time. The ANOVA analysis reported that curing time was the most important variable (56.4 and 54.7% of contribution) in tests with NaCl and KNO3. According to the results, KNO3 does not have a significant effect on copper extraction prior to leaching.","The authors thanks to Universitat de Barcelona and the Universidad Católica del Norte for the opportunity and funding provided to develop this research.

The size of the aggregates is represented by the mean chord length, determined by the focused beam reflectance measurement (FBRM) technique. The PBM follows the dynamics of aggregation and breakage processes underlying flocculation and provides a good approximation to the temporal evolution of aggregate size. The structure of the aggregates during flocculation is described by a constant or time-dependent fractal dimension. The results revealed that the compensations between the aggregation and breakage rates lead to a correct representation of the flocculation kinetics of the tailings of particles in seawater and, in addition, that the representation of the flocculation kinetics in optimal conditions is equally good with a constant or variable fractal dimension. The aggregation and breakage functions and their corresponding parameters are sensitive to the choice of the fractal dimension of the aggregates, whether constant or time dependent, however, under optimal conditions, a constant fractal dimension is sufficient. The model is robust and predictive with a few parameters and can be used to find the optimal flocculation conditions at different mixing intensities, and the optimal flocculation time can be used for a cost-effective evaluation of the quality of the flocculant used.",The authors thank Centro CRHIAM Project Conicyt/Fondap/15130015.

We focus our study on the Quebrada de Quereo site (13480-13070 cal BP) located in the coast of Northern Semiarid Chile. To build a comparative analog, different combinations of taphonomic and technological variables are explored in an assemblage of natural origin from a nearby ravine that mimics lithic knapping attributes. This same set of variables was tested on the anthropogenic lithic assemblage of the Quebrada Santa Julia site (12990-12730 cal BP). This procedure allowed us developing an analytic system centered on the characteristics of chipped edges to weigh taphonomic and technological attributes and their natural production in torrential ravine contexts. By applying this scheme to a sample of the lithic material of Quebrada de Quereo, we discuss which pieces are most likely to be considered as lithic artifacts. We conclude that most of the Quebrada de Quereo lithic assemblage may be explained as produced by natural causes, thus those pieces should be considered pseudo-artifacts.",,,Estudios Atacameños,,,,2020,2020,2020,,,65,217-245,All OA; Gold,Article,"Elola, Javier Carranza; Méndez, César","Elola, Javier Carranza (Investigador asociado a Fondecyt 1180306); Méndez, César (Centro de Investigación en Ecosistemas de la Patagonia)",,"Elola, Javier Carranza (Investigador asociado a Fondecyt 1180306); Méndez, César (Patagonian Ecosystems Investigation Research Center)",5,3,,2.22,https://revistas.ucn.cl/index.php/estudios-atacamenos/article/download/3011/3518,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1129918962,"37 Earth Sciences; 3705 Geology; 43 History, Heritage and Archaeology; 4301 Archaeology",

KSS is a rare mitochondrial disease defined by a classic triad of progressive external ophthalmoplegia, atypical pigmentary retinopathy, and onset before 20 years. PMPS presents in the first year of life with bone marrow failure and exocrine pancreatic dysfunction, and can evolve into KSS later in life. Even though an mtDNA deletion is the most frequent mutation in KSS and PMPS, cases of duplications and molecular rearrangements have also been described. In Colombia, few case reports of KSS and PMPS have been published in indexed journals or have been registered in scientific events.
METHODS: We discuss clinical and genetic aspects of two case reports of pediatric female patients, with initial clinical diagnosis of PMPS who later evolved into KSS, with confirmatory molecular studies of an mtDNA deletion and an mtDNA duplication.
RESULTS: A large-scale mtDNA deletion, NC_012920.1:m.8286_14416del, was confirmed by Southern Blot in patient 1. An mtDNA duplication of 7.9 kb was confirmed by MLPA in patient 2.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings are compatible with the phenotypic and genetic presentation of PMPS and KSS.

To systematically estimate expression-associated SNPs (eSNPs) that confer genetic predisposition to GC, we evaluated the associations of 314,203 stomach tissue-specific eSNPs with GC risk in three GWAS datasets (2,631 cases and 4,373 controls). Subsequently, we conducted a gene-based analysis to calculate the cumulative effect of eSNPs through sequence kernel association combined test and Sherlock integrative analysis. At the SNP-level, we identified two novel variants (rs836545 at 7p22.1 and rs1892252 at 6p22.2) associated with GC risk. The risk allele carriers of rs836545-T and rs1892252-G exhibited higher expression levels of DAGLB (P = 3.70 × 10-18) and BTN3A2 (P = 3.20 × 10-5), respectively. Gene-based analyses identified DAGLB and FBXO43 as novel susceptibility genes for GC. DAGLB and FBXO43 were significantly overexpressed in GC tissues than in their adjacent tissues (P = 5.59 × 10-7 and P = 3.90 × 10-6, respectively), and high expression level of these two genes was associated with an unfavorable prognosis of GC patients (P = 1.30 × 10-7 and P = 7.60 × 10-3, respectively). Co-expression genes with these two novel genes in normal stomach tissues were significantly enriched in several cancer-related pathways, including P53, MAPK and TGF-beta pathways. In summary, our findings confirm the importance of eSNPs in dissecting the genetic basis of GC, and the identified eSNPs and relevant genes will provide new insight into the genetic and biological basis for the mechanism of GC development.",,Funding.

This study analyzed the verbal clauses and the graduation resources of the theoretical frameworks in 20 research articles in Spanish language published in Colombian journals from the area of applied linguistics.

In this context, the measurement of work satisfaction is important for organizations that profess an interest in engaged and satisfied workers. Therefore, this study aims to examine the psychometric properties of the Satisfaction with Job Life Scale (SWJLS) in Portuguese workers by combining the procedures of the Classical Test Theory (CTT) and the Item Response Theory (IRT). Specifically, internal structure of the scale was studied, its reliability (consistency), correlations with other measures of wellbeing (life satisfaction, loneliness, emotional wellbeing at work, and job satisfaction) were also estimated, and finally, the sacle waqs tested for gender measurement invariance. Participants were 404 workers, 61% women and 39% men, aged between 18 and 64 years (M = 36.85; SD = 14.50). Confirmatory Factor Analysis indicated that the one-dimensional model of the SWJLS was adequate (Robust χ2(5) = 9.89, p = .078; CFI = .993; RMSEA = .049, 90% CI [.000 - .094]; SRMR = .011.) and had good internal consistency (ω = .947, 95% CI [.936, 956]; α = .947, 95% CI [.935, .955]). Subsequent analyses revealed that the scores of the SWJLS were related to other measures of job satisfaction (r = .742), job-related emotional well-being (r = .628), satisfaction with life (r = .808) and loneliness (r = -.455). Factorial invariance suggests that the structure of the SWJLS measures the same construct (satisfaction with work-life) in both female and male workers. Moreover, IRT analysis suggests that higher levels of work-life satisfaction are needed to choose the upper response options, while a very low level of work-life satisfaction is required to increase the likelihood of choosing the lower response options. In this sense, the SWJLS is useful and reliable, especially for identifying people with low levels of job satisfaction.

Weighting criteria in Multi-Attribute Decision Making (MADM) has been developing as the most attractive section in the field. Although many ideas have been developed during the last decades, there is no such great diversity that can be mentioned in the literature. This study is looking from outside the box and is presenting something totally new by using big data and text mining in a Prospective MADM outline. PMADM is a hybrid interconnected concept between the Futures Studies and MADM fields. Text mining, which is known as a useful tool in Futures Studies, is applied to create a widespread pilot system for weighting and criteria selection in the PMADM outline. Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA), as an influential method inside the general concept of text mining, is applied to show how a data warehouse’s output, which in this case is Scopus, can reach the final criteria selection and weighting of the criteria.",,"Proyecto Nº 11190104: New approaches to the future-based decision making based on Prospective Multiple Attribute Decision Making (PMADM) outline; Programa Fodecyt, Conicyt, Ministrio de Educacion, Chile.",Symmetry,,,,2020-05-25,2020,2020-05-25,,12,5,868,All OA; Gold,Article,"Hashemkhani Zolfani, Sarfaraz; Derakhti, Arman","Hashemkhani Zolfani, Sarfaraz (School of Engineering, Catholic University of the North, Larrondo 1281, Coquimbo 1780000, Chile); Derakhti, Arman (School of Engineering, Catholic University of the North, Larrondo 1281, Coquimbo 1780000, Chile)","Hashemkhani Zolfani, Sarfaraz (Catholic University of the North)","Hashemkhani Zolfani, Sarfaraz (Catholic University of the North); Derakhti, Arman (Catholic University of the North)",8,5,,2.14,https://www.mdpi.com/2073-8994/12/5/868/pdf?version=1590402959,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1127920690,46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4605 Data Management and Data Science,

Critical elements as rare-earth elements (REEs) can be obtained from electronic wastes or tailings and could be recovered using these green alternatives. In this study, walnut shell (WS) was tested to determine whether several REEs can be efficiently retained by this green adsorbent. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), thermogravimetry, and differential scanning calorimetry (TG-DSC) were used to characterize WS before and after REE adsorption. Analytical performance of REE quantification was evaluated, besides adsorption capacity and isotherms that were calculated in order to determine the model that fit well to REE adsorption. ICP-OES results indicated the lowest limit of detection and quantification (LOD and LOQ) with Eu (0.08 and 0.23 ppb, respectively); nevertheless, quantification of other elements was also at the ppb level. In order to obtain the highest adsorption of metals, 75- and 2,000-μm particle sizes were studied, reaching >80% of adsorption with both sizes. Additionally, several pH values were tested in order to determine the optimum condition for maximal adsorption and adsorption capacity, noticing that pH 4 showed the best adsorption percentage (>85%, qe = 6.5–8 mg/g). The Langmuir isotherm model fitted well for the Eu, La, Sm, and Gd adsorption equilibrium. Characterization of WS was done using FTIR, TG-DSC, and SEM. FTIR analysis showed several changes in the spectra after adsorption of REE tested, but major changes were observed at the OH group, which shifted up to 31 cm−1 of wavelength. Additionally, TG-DSC showed that WS pyrolysis was divided in three stages: vaporization of moisture (about 10% of weight loss); thermal decomposition of hemicellulose, cellulose, and lignin (higher than 60% of weight loss); and high-temperature calcination of residues (<25%). Finally, SEM characterization showed empty and filled pores of different sizes in WS after metal adsorption, and a more rugged aspect was observed. This study reveals that WS is an efficient low-cost adsorbent for REEs and can be used for future recovery of these elements from secondary sources.",,"Funding.

In the present study, the genetic diversity of a wild population from Neguanje Bay, Santa Marta (Colombia), was estimated using microsatellite markers, and the effect of the presence of null alleles on this estimation was assessed. A total of 8 microsatellite markers were developed, the first described for this species, and their amplification conditions were standardized. They were used to determine the genotype of 48 wild individuals from Naguanje Bay, and 1,010 individuals derived from the offspring of 38 directed crosses. For each locus, the frequencies of the identified alleles, including null alleles, were estimated using the statistical package Micro-Checker, and the parental genotypes were confirmed using segregation analysis. Three to 8 alleles per locus with frequencies from 0.001 to 0.632 were detected. The frequencies of null alleles ranged from 0.10 to 0.45, with Ho from 0.0 to 0.79, and He from 0.53 to 0.80. All loci were in H-W disequilibrium. The null allele frequencies values were high, with lower estimations using segregation analysis than estimated using Micro-Checker. The present results show high levels of population genetic diversity and indicate that null alleles were not the only cause of deviation from H-W equilibrium in all loci, suggesting that the wild population under study presents signs of inbreeding and Wahlund effect.","ACKNOWLEDGMENTS The authors thank to GIBEA research group of the Universidad del Magdalena, as well as Katherina Brokordt and Claudia Cárcamo of the Universidad Católica del Norte (Chile) for its support in the molecular analysis and María Vicenta Valdivia for her help in the preparation of the English version of the manuscript, the staff of the Laboratorio de Moluscos y Microalgas of the Universidad del Magdalena and the Asociación de Pescadores y Ostioneros de Taganga (ASPOTAG) for their help during the experiments.

This area is divided into four Franciscana Management Areas (FMA). The northern portion of this species distribution is not continuous and a previous genetic study using mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) separated it into FMAIa (Espírito Santo state) and FMAIb (North of Rio de Janeiro state). In order to increase the information about this population we expanded the sample number and evaluated mitochondrial and nuclear DNA diversity. Samples of 68 franciscanas found stranded on beaches from 2005 to 2020 were analyzed. Analyses included 350 bp of the mtDNA control region (D-loop) and 12 microsatellite loci. We identified three control region haplotypes in FMAIa, two of them not previously observed in this population, one being a new haplotype. Haplotype and nucleotide diversities were 0.0408 and 0.00012 respectively, the lowest reported for all FMAs analyzed until now. The Neutrality tests were not significant and Mismatch Distribution analysis did not reject the hypothesis of population expansion. One of the microsatellite loci was monomorphic, and for the other loci, two to nine alleles were identified, with expected heterozygosities ranging from 0.306 to 0.801. No substructure was revealed and effective population size (Ne) was estimated in 117.9 individuals. Even with an increased sample size, the high mitochondrial genetic homogeneity suggested for the population in a previous study was confirmed. Among six loci previously analyzed in other franciscana populations, five showed the lowest observed heterozygosities for the Espírito Santo population. The novel microsatellite data also showed low genetic diversity and could not reject the hypothesis of a single, panmitic population along the coast of Espírito Santo. This species has been intensively impacted in the last years by incidental capture during fishing activities and habitat degradation, caused by pollution, coastal development and environmental disasters in FMAIa. Considering that this population is small, isolated, and with low levels of genetic diversity, we reinforce the necessity of different conservation actions, focusing mainly on the reduction of bycatch of this species in the region.","We thank CTA – Serviços em Meio Ambiente for the samples provided.

Evidence of past environmental conditions is commonly preserved in natural archives, such as lacustrine sediments. Sediment records obtained from Inca Coya Lake (22°20'S-68°35'W, 2534 m.a.s.l.), a small lake located in the Atacama Desert, reflected the evolution of regional mining activity during the 20th century and sedimentation associated with decadal climate variability. We studied the aquatic community structure changes recorded in sediment records from Inca Coya Lake. By analysis of magnetic properties (susceptibility, hysteresis curves and Curie temperatures), grain size and geochemical composition of the sediments, we identified environmental periods and changes in the community of benthic and planktonic organisms (diatoms and diapausing egg bank). We identified three detrital episodes that we interpret as dry/wet phases during the last 90 years associated with the increase of flash flood events promoting hypoxia oscillations; anthropogenic (mining activity) signals were also identified. Invertebrate community structure (primary consumers) reflected the metal exposure, measured as changes in assemblage composition through species turnover. Diatom community composition was best associated with variables related to wetter/drier alternation and consequent changes in oxygen availability. Bioindicators analyzed (diatoms, diapausing egg bank and invertebrate community) demonstrated to be excellent indicators of the bioavailability of compounds in the aquatic ecosystem of Inca Coya Lake, allowing the environmental impact assessment of the water resources due to flash floods and mining activity in the driest desert of the world.","This work was supported by: A.A-A.

278,pub.1134265822,10.3390/math9010077,,,Monte Carlo Simulation of a Modified Chi Distribution with Unequal Variances in the Generating Gaussians. A Discrete Methodology to Study Collective Response Times,"The Chi distribution is a continuous probability distribution of a random variable obtained from the positive square root of the sum of k squared variables, each coming from a standard Normal distribution (mean = 0 and variance = 1). The variable k indicates the degrees of freedom. The usual expression for the Chi distribution can be generalised to include a parameter which is the variance (which can take any value) of the generating Gaussians. For instance, for k = 3, we have the case of the Maxwell-Boltzmann (MB) distribution of the particle velocities in the Ideal Gas model of Physics. In this work, we analyse the case of unequal variances in the generating Gaussians whose distribution we will still represent approximately in terms of a Chi distribution. We perform a Monte Carlo simulation to generate a random variable which is obtained from the positive square root of the sum of k squared variables, but this time coming from non-standard Normal distributions, where the variances can take any positive value. Then, we determine the boundaries of what to expect when we start from a set of unequal variances in the generating Gaussians. In the second part of the article, we present a discrete model to calculate the parameter of the Chi distribution in an approximate way for this case (unequal variances). We also comment on the application of this simple discrete model to calculate the parameter of the MB distribution (Chi of k = 3) when it is used to represent the reaction times to visual stimuli of a collective of individuals in the framework of a Physics inspired model we have published in a previous work.",It is a pleasure to thank F.

The gold and silver contained represent an interesting opportunity for processing by non-toxic and aggressive leaching reagents like thiosulfate. The preliminary kinetic study indicated that the leaching process was poorly affected by temperature and thiosulfate concentration. The reaction order was −0.61 for Ag, considering a thiosulfate concentration between 200–500 mol·m−3, while, for Au, it was −0.09 for a concentration range between 32–320 mol·m–3. By varying the pH 7–10, it was found that the reaction order was n = 5.03 for Ag, while, for Au, the value was n = 0.94, considering pH 9.5–11. The activation energy obtained during the silver leaching process was 3.15 kJ·mol−1 (298–328 K), which was indicative of a diffusive control of the process. On the other hand, during gold leaching, the activation energy obtained was of 36.44 kJ·mol−1, which was indicative that this process was mixed controlled process, first at low temperatures by diffusive control (298–313 K) and then by chemical control (318–323 K).","Authors want to thank the CONACyT of the Mexican Government for its support given through the Ph.D. scholarship to the student Edmundo R.

Both the maar crater and the surrounding tephra rim deposits are typically formed due to magma–water explosive interactions. Northern Chile is located in the Central Volcanic Zone of the Andes where, in literature, 14 maars have been recognized as parasite (6) and individual (8) volcanoes. Amongst these individual maars, 3 of them, namely the Tilocálar Sur, Cerro Tujle, and Cerro Overo volcanoes, are not related to calderas and were emplaced <1 Ma ago by magmatic explosive-effusive and phreatomagmatic eruptions. Based on the evolution and control of the volcanic eruptive styles of these three maars, which have been determined in previous research through fieldwork, stratigraphic, morphometric, textural (density and vesicularity), petrographic, and geochemical analyses, a set of key features that favor a prediction of the emplacement location of maar volcanoes in Central Andes, northern Chile are proposed. The set of features that permit and favor the growth mechanisms for maar formations corresponds to (i) a compressive tectonic setting (e.g., ridge structures), (ii) groundwater recharge (e.g., snowmelt and seasonal rainfall), (iii) the lithological setting (e.g., layers of low permeability), (iv) the presence of aquifer and/or endorheic basins (e.g., lakes or salars), and (v) a period of stress relaxation that permits magma ascent to the surface in volcanically active areas. Considering these characteristics, it is possible to identify places where phreatomagmatic eruption can occur. If the magma ascent flux is lower than the groundwater flux, this can lead to a phreatomagmatic eruption because of groundwater coming into contact with the magma. These eruptive features evidence internal—and external—factors that play an essential role in the transition from explosive-effusive magmatic to phreatomagmatic volcanic eruption styles during the same eruptive period that is one of the biggest challenges in volcanic hazard evaluations. Although, in this contribution, a set of features that permit and favor the growth mechanisms for a prediction of the emplacement location of maars in northern Chile is proposed, these considerations could also be applied to identify potential locations in other parts of the world where magma–water interaction eruption could occur. Therefore, this approach could be useful in the prediction of hydromagmatic volcanic eruptions and, thus, in mitigating the impact of volcanic hazard for the inhabitants of the surrounding areas.","The authors wish to thank Mary T.

Both compounds showed in vitro cytotoxic activity with IC50 values: 7.1 μM (QS-21) and 13.6 μM (QA) on SNU1 cells; 7.4 μM (QS-21) and 67 μM (QA) on KATO III cells. QS-21 and QA induce apoptosis on SNU1 and KATO III, as demonstrated by TUNEL, Annexin-V and Caspase Assays. Additionally, we performed in silico docking studies simulating the binding of both triterpenic compounds to key proteins involved in apoptotic pathways. The binding energies (∆Gbin) thus calculated, suggest that the pro-apoptotic protein Bid might be a plausible target involved in the apoptotic effect of both triterpenic compounds. Although QA shows some antiproliferative effects on SNU1 cells cultured in vitro, our results suggest that QS-21 is a more powerful antitumor agent, which merits further investigation regarding their properties as potential therapeutic agents for gastric cancer.","Special consideration is given to Dr. Dawit Kidane-Mulat (University of Texas -Austin) who donated GES-1 cells (normal gastric epithelium cell line).

Methods: The proposed research met the criteria of a qualitative descriptive study with nine in-depth interviews in the three abovementioned social groups (three participants from each social group) that have an impact on teleworking. Discourse analysis by maps of association of ideas was employed as an information analysis technique. Results: The study results suggested that the meaning and value that the workers assign to organizing their work, social interactions, routines, and the use of objects and positioning is unknown to the policy makers. Moreover, the discourses of the government and the employer are similar, and therefore, a time of psychosocial narrative is consolidated; the second psychosocial time is developed by the discourse of the teleworker. Discussions: In the first psychosocial time, teleworking means an opportunity to help workers regarding their quality of life and productivity. In the second psychosocial time, teleworking means a different way of working in which individuals occupy a physical space as workers, but they are actually in a virtual space that allows to give work a meaning other than the traditional one. Conclusions: The study concluded that teleworking is perceived by the government as an opportunity to improve employability indicators and give access to people with special abilities to the market; for employers, it is a mechanism for increasing flexibility that would help them with cost reduction, and for workers, it involves freedom and work flexibility.",,,Desarrollo Gerencial,,,,2020-07-31,2020,2020-07-31,,12,2,1-25,All OA; Gold,Article,"Cifuentes-Leiton, Diana Milec","Cifuentes-Leiton, Diana Milec (Universidad del Valle, Cali, Colombia)",,"Cifuentes-Leiton, Diana Milec (University of Valle)",4,1,,2.04,https://revistas.unisimon.edu.co/index.php/desarrollogerencial/article/download/3913/5288,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1130305783,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3505 Human Resources and Industrial Relations",

In this context, the objective of this study was to assess the implementation of a community needs assessment process before a climate disaster through the methodological implementation of the Service-Learning strategy (ApS) in a course of psychology students in Chile. To do so, we selected a representative case study of community management in the face of a climate disaster in the north of Chile, using a participatory action research design (PAR). The data were produced using an inter-method triangulation of six techniques, creating a four areas scheme of the learning process results. These areas were: i) theoretical-conceptual, ii) methodological, iii) practical and iv) ethical-political. The results showed the use of ApS in the teaching-learning process of the community assessment, identifying both advantages and limitations in the development of disciplinary, transversal and professional competences, as well as those competences related to the service provided. This study concludes that it is important to integrate horizontal, participative strategies, and use them in the process of professional training and education, according to the integral type of university education required to face the complex psychosocial problem of climate change.",,,Alteridad,,,,2020-12-27,2020,2020-12-27,,16,1,23-37,All OA; Gold,Article,"Sandoval-Diaz, José; Cuadra-Martínez, David; Orellana-Fonseca, Cristian; Sandoval-Obando, Eduardo","Sandoval-Diaz, José (Universidad del Bío Bío); Cuadra-Martínez, David (Universidad de Atacama); Orellana-Fonseca, Cristian (Universidad del Bío Bío); Sandoval-Obando, Eduardo (Universidad Autónoma de Chile)",,"Sandoval-Diaz, José (University of Bío-Bío); Cuadra-Martínez, David (University of Atacama); Orellana-Fonseca, Cristian (University of Bío-Bío); Sandoval-Obando, Eduardo (Universidad Autónoma de Chile)",3,2,,2.01,https://alteridad.ups.edu.ec/index.php/alteridad/article/download/1.2021.02/4226,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1134139888,39 Education; 3901 Curriculum and Pedagogy; 52 Psychology,11 Sustainable Cities and Communities; 13 Climate Action

Tumor-repopulating cells (TRCs) are cancer stem cell (CSC)-like cells with highly tumorigenic and self-renewing abilities, which were selected from tumor cells in soft three-dimensional (3D) fibrin gels.
METHODS: Here, we presented a genome-wide map of methylated cytosines for time-series samples in TRC selection, in a 3D culture using whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS).
RESULTS: A comparative analysis revealed that the methylation degrees of many differentially methylated genes (DMGs) were increased by the mechanical environment and changed from 2D rigid to 3D soft. DMGs were significantly enriched in stemness-related terms. In 1-day, TRCs had the highest non-CG methylation rate indicating its strong stemness. We found that genes with continuously increasing or decreasing methylation like CREB5/ADAMTS6/LMX1A may also affect the TRC screening process. Furthermore, results showed that stage-specific/common CSCs markers were biased toward changing their methylation in non-CG (CHG and CHH, where H corresponds to A, T, or C) methylation and enriched in gene body region.
CONCLUSIONS: WGBS provides DNA methylome in TRC screening. It was confirmed that non-CG DNA methylation plays an important role in TRC selection, which indicates that it is more sensitive to mechanical microenvironments and affects TRCs by regulating the expression of stemness genes in tumor cells.",The authors thank Huazhong University of Science and Technology for their technical support.,Funding.

METHODS: We performed a systematic review of published CPGs on CAP from January 2007 to May 2019. All reviewers independently assessed each CPG using the AGREE II instrument. A standardised score was calculated for each of the six domains.
RESULTS: Our search strategy identified 4125 citations but just 18 met our inclusion criteria. Agreement among reviewers was very good: 0.98. The domains that scored better were: ""scope and purpose"" and ""clarity and presentation"". Those that scored worse were ""editorial independence"", and ""applicability"". According to the AGREE II evaluation for each Guideline, the NICE, IDSA, BTS, SWAB, Korea, Consensur II, Colombian and Peruvian CPGs were the only recommended with no further modifications. In addition, ERS and SEPAR CPGs were recommended with modifications, with lower scores regarding the editorial independence and applicability.
CONCLUSION: In conclusion, published CPGs for CAP management vary in quality with a need to improve the methodological and applicability rigour. This could be achieved following the standards for guidelines development and a better emphasis on how to apply CPGs recommendations in clinical practice.",DISCLOSURE None of the authors reports a conflict of interest with regard to this manuscript.,Funding information The authors report no funding for this work.,International Journal of Clinical Practice,,,Algorithms; Community-Acquired Infections; Humans; Pneumonia; Practice Guidelines as Topic,2020-02-24,2020,2020-02-24,2020-05,74,5,e13478,All OA; Gold,Article,"Triana, Abel J.; Molinares, Jorge L.; Del Rio‐Pertuz, Gaspar; Meza, Jose L.; Ariza‐Bolívar, Orlando; Robledo‐Solano, Andrea; Acosta‐Reyes, Jorge","Triana, Abel J.

The strain is able to grow and oxidize ferrous ions in the range of pH 1.4-2.6 with optimal pH 2.0. The optimal temperature for growth is 35°C. Acidithiobacillus sp. Ksh has shown the highest activity for pyrite oxidation among other strains. It also demonstrated high activity in oxidation for copper and copper-gold bearing ores (Armenia). The isolate Acidithiobacillus sp. Ksh was identified as Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans based on phylogenetic and physiological studies. Comparative studies of EPS production by cells grown on ferrous ions or pyrite were carried out. The chemical composition of capsular and colloidal EPS produced by Acidithiobacillus (At.) ferrooxidans Ksh were revealed to be proteins and carbohydrates. Exosaccharide produced by At. ferrooxidans Ksh is present mainly as polysaccharide in contrast to Leptospirillum (L.) ferriphilum CC, which is oligosaccharide. The structural difference of colloidal particles of these polysaccharides was due to the degree of hydration of the saccharide molecules.",We acknowledge support by the Open Access Publication Fund of the University of Duisburg-Essen.,Funding.

Leaching bacteria are characterized by having resistance mechanisms for several metals found in their acidic environments, some of which have been partially described in the Acidithiobacillus genus (mainly on ferrooxidans species). However, the response to copper has not been studied in the psychrotolerant Acidithiobacillus ferrivorans strains. Therefore, we propose to elucidate the response mechanisms of A. ferrivorans ACH to high copper concentrations (0-800 mM), describing its genetic repertoire and transcriptional regulation. Our results show that A. ferrivorans ACH can grow in up to 400 mM of copper. Moreover, we found the presence of several copper-related makers, belonging to cop and cus systems, as well as rusticyanins and periplasmatic acop protein in the genome. Interestingly, the ACH strain is the only one in which we find three copies of copB and copZ genes. Moreover, transcriptional expression showed an up-regulation response (acop, copZ, cusA, rusA, and rusB) to high copper concentrations. Finally, our results support the important role of these genes in A. ferrivorans copper stress resistance, promoting the use of the ACH strain in industrial leaching under low temperatures, which could decrease the activation times of oxidation processes and the energy costs.",,This work was supported by ANID (Agencia Nacional de Investigación y Desarrollo de Chile).

The main aim of this study was to evaluate the role of live feed as a source of antibacterial-resistant bacteria in a commercial culture of G. chilensis. Samples of rotifer and Artemia cultures used as live feed were collected during the larval growth period and culturable bacterial counts were performed using a spread plate method. Rotifer and Artemia cultures exhibited high levels of resistant bacteria (8.03 × 104 to 1.79 × 107 CFU/g and 1.47 × 106 to 3.50 × 108 CFU/g, respectively). Sixty-five florfenicol-resistant isolates were identified as Vibrio (81.5%) and Pseudoalteromonas (15.4%) using 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis. A high incidence of resistance to streptomycin (93.8%), oxytetracycline (89.2%), co-trimoxazole (84.6%), and kanamycin (73.8%) was exhibited by resistant isolates. A high proportion of isolates (76.9%) carried the florfenicol-resistance encoding genes floR and fexA, as well as plasmid DNA (75.0%). The high prevalence of multiresistant bacteria in live feed increases the incidence of the resistant microbiota in reared fish larvae, thus proper monitoring and management strategies for live feed cultures appear to be a priority for preventing future therapy failures in fish larval cultures.","The authors acknowledge Piero Magnolfi and all staff of the Colorado Chile company for providing facilities, materials, and support to develop control and treated live-feed cultures, as well as for good collaboration with live-feed culture maintenance and sampling collection.

METHOD: This was a non-experimental and cross-sectional study. Two populations of nursing students in two nursing programs were studied: Universidad San Sebastián (Santiago, Chile) and Universidad Mayor (Temuco, Chile). The original data on empathy, assessed by the Jefferson Scale of Empathy, were combined into a single data base. They were then analyzed by means of normality tests and homoscedasticity, Cronbach's alpha, analysis of variance; the standard deviation of the dependent outcome measure (Sy.x) and the coefficient of determination (R2) were estimated.
RESULTS: The sample sizes from the two programs were 479 and 277, respectively. It was found that the distributions of the averages over the course of study for empathy (and its components) were constant, and in some cases increased.
CONCLUSION: It was found that the distribution of the means of empathy in the nursing students analyzed did not conform to the classical empathic decline observed in other studies. Therefore, it is inferred that the traditional factors identified as causes of empathic erosion were not operating in the same way in the studied context.",,,Revista da Escola de Enfermagem da USP,,,"Burnout, Professional; Chile; Cross-Sectional Studies; Empathy; Humans; Students, Nursing",2020,2020,2020,,54,,e03619,All OA; Gold,Article,"Díaz-Narváez, Víctor P; Calzadilla-Núñez, Aracelis; López-Orellana, Paulina; Utsman-Abarca, Robert; Alonso-Palacio, Luz Marina","Díaz-Narváez, Víctor P (Universidad de Andres Bello, Facultad de Odontología, Departamento de Investigaciones, Santiago, Chile.); Calzadilla-Núñez, Aracelis (Universidad Bernardo OHiggins, Facultad de Salud, Santiago, Chile.; Universidad Autónoma de Chile, Facultad de Ciencias de la Salud, Santiago, Chile.); López-Orellana, Paulina (Universidad de Valparaíso, Faculdad de Medicina, Escuela de Obstetricia y Puericultura, Valparaíso, Chile.); Utsman-Abarca, Robert (Universidad Latinoamericana de Ciencia y Tecnología, Departamento de Investigaciones, San José, Costa Rica.); Alonso-Palacio, Luz Marina (Universidad del Norte, División de Ciencias de la Salud, Departamento de Salud Pública.

213,pub.1129053988,10.3390/min10070604,,,Assessment of the Supply Chain under Uncertainty: The Case of Lithium,"Modeling the global markets is complicated due to the existence of uncertainty in the information available. In addition, the lithium supply chain presents a complex network due to interconnections that it presents and the interdependencies among its elements. This complex supply chain has one large market, electric vehicles (EVs). EV production is increasing the global demand for lithium; in terms of the lithium supply chain, an EV requires lithium-ion batteries, and lithium-ion batteries require lithium carbonate and lithium hydroxide. Realistically, the mass balance in the global lithium supply chain involves more elements and more markets, and together with the assortment of databases in the literature, make the modeling through deterministic models difficult. Modeling the global supply chain under uncertainty could facilitate an assessment of the lithium supply chain between production and demand, and therefore could help to determine the distribution of materials for identifying the variables with the highest importance in an undersupply scenario. In the literature, deterministic models are commonly used to model the lithium supply chain but do not simultaneously consider the variation of data among databases for the lithium supply chain. This study performs stochastic modeling of the lithium supply chain by combining a material flow analysis with an uncertainty analysis and global sensitivity analysis. The combination of these methods evaluates an undersupply scenario. The stochastic model simulations allow a comparison between the known demand and the supply calculated under uncertainty, in order to identify the most important variables affecting lithium distribution. The dynamic simulations show that the most probable scenario is one where supply does not cover the increasing demand, and the stochastic modeling classifies the variables by their importance and sensibility. In conclusion, the most important variables in a scenario of EV undersupply are the lithium hydroxide produced from lithium carbonate, the lithium hydroxide produced from solid rock, and the production of traditional batteries. The global sensitivity analysis indicates that the critical variables which affect the uncertainty in EV production change with time.",,"This research was funded by Agencia Nacional de Investigacion y Desarrollo (ANID), Fondecyt program grant number 1180826.",Minerals,,,,2020-07-03,2020,2020-07-03,,10,7,604,All OA; Gold,Article,"Calisaya-Azpilcueta, Daniel; Herrera-Leon, Sebastián; Lucay, Freddy A.; Cisternas, Luis A.","Calisaya-Azpilcueta, Daniel (Departamento de Ingeniería Química y Procesos de Minerales, Universidad de Antofagasta, Antofagasta 1270300, Chile;, luis.cisternas@uantof.cl); Herrera-Leon, Sebastián (School of Engineering Science, LUT University, P.O.

Conventional surgical methods are not applicable in some special types of nerve injury, prompting scholars to seek to develop more effective nerve translocation repair technologies. The purpose of this study was to explore the functional state of neurons in injured lower limbs after translocation repair, with a view to preliminarily clarify the molecular mechanisms underlying this process. Eighteen Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into the normal, tibial nerve in situ repair, and common peroneal nerve transposition repair tibial nerve groups. Nerve function assessment and immunohistochemical staining of neurofilament 200 (NF-200), protein kinase B (Akt), mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), and ribosomal protein S6 kinase (p70S6K) in the dorsal root ganglia were performed at 12 weeks after surgery. Tibial nerve function and neuroelectrophysiological analysis, osmic acid staining, muscle strength testing, and muscle fiber staining showed that the nerve translocation repair could restore the function of the recipient nerve to a certain extent; however, the repair was not as efficient as the in situ repair. Immunohistochemical staining showed that the translocation repair resulted in changes in the microstructure of neuronal cell bodies, and the expressions of Akt, mTOR, and p70S6K in the three dorsal root ganglia groups were significantly different (p < 0.05). This study demonstrates that the nerve translocation repair technology sets up a new reflex loop, with the corresponding neuroskeletal adjustments, in which, donor neurons dominate the recipient nerves. This indicates that nerve translocation repair technology can lead to neuronal remodeling and is important as a supplementary treatment for a peripheral nerve injury. Furthermore, the Akt/mTOR/p70S6K signaling pathway may be involved in the formation of the new neural reflex loop created as a result of the translocation repair.",,"Funding.

On the one hand, because it has managed to expand an interdisciplinary field that has allowed the training of professionals. On the other hand, because work spaces have been developed with access to the use of different analytical techniques, as well as dialogue and exchange in the analysis of the results between specialists. Regarding the study of archaeological ceramic materials, advances in the development of techniques and technology related to archaeological work has facilitated the review of results and data that were obtained in a timely manner during the investigations, in order to continue exploring archaeological problems and solve pending issues related to processes of production and circulation of ceramic materials, social practices of exchange, interaction and integration and their associated rituals, among others. This work aims to present the application of new technologies and methodologies adapted to ceramic materials to evaluate their potential related to the scope of the information obtained and to review and incorporate new data related to the study of the origin of raw materials, characterization of pastes and techniques of manufacturing used by Andean potters. For this, two case studies of archaeological ceramics from the Quebrada de Humahuaca, Jujuy province (Argentina), are presented, based on analyzes carried out with petrography-QEMSCAN, Raman-IFT-IR, UV-IR microscope and pigment microstratrigraphy. The results obtained have offered additional and specific information to interpret the interactions inside and outside the space of the Quebrada de Humahuaca in different chronological moments of the pre-Hispanic past, giving an account of the use of the circumpuneño space by the communities that inhabited it",,,Anuario de Arqueología,,,,2020-12-01,2020,2020-12-01,,12,12,67-85,All OA; Gold,Article,"Acevedo, Verónica; Staropoli, Laura; Soto, Camila Riera; Soto, Daiana; Herrera, Valeria; Rossi, Leonardo","Acevedo, Verónica (Universidad de Buenos Aires; Facultad de Filosofía y Letras; Instituto de Arqueología.

Worldwide and in Cameroon, little attention has been paid to this growing problem in the pediatric population. Identification of risk factors will contribute significantly to prevention. A cross-sectional case-control study was carried out in children ≤ 15 years to identify the risk factors of UTI, etiologic agents, and their antibiotic susceptibility. Samples (urine) were collected from in and outpatients with symptoms of UTI attending two health facilities in Buea. Controls were age- and sex-matched children in the community and those visiting these health facilities for unrelated reasons. Samples were analyzed by microscopy, culture, and antibiotic susceptibility of bacteria isolates tested by the disc diffusion technique. Questionnaires were administered to collect sociodemographic, clinical characteristics and data on risk factors. Odds ratios and bivariate and multivariate analyses were used to assess the relationship between predictors (symptoms and risk factors) and UTI. P < 0.05 was considered significant. A total of 405 participants (200 cases and 205 controls) were investigated. UTI prevalence was 12% in cases. From the UTI cases, bacteria was the major cause of infection, with E. coli (39.4%) predominating. Parasitic organisms, Trichomonas vaginalis (0.5%) and Schistosoma spp (0.5%), and yeast (6%) were also detected. Urinary urgency (F = 4.98, P = 0.027) and back pain (F = 12.37, P = 0.001) were associated to UTI following bivariate analysis. These parameters could be used to predict UTI in the pediatric population in the study area.

Interacting with the pathogen membranes might produce visible changes in shape or cell wall damage. Previously, we showed that the peptides produced by Lactobacillus plantarum UTNGt2, Lactobacillus plantarum UTNCys5-4, and Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis UTNGt28 exhibit a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity against several foodborne pathogens in vitro. In this study, their possible mode of action against the commensal microorganism Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica ATCC51741 was investigated. The target membrane permeability was determined by detection of beta-galactosidase release from ONPG (o-nitro-phenyl-L-D-galactoside) substrate and changes in the whole protein profile indicating that the peptide extracts destroy the membrane integrity and may induce breaks in membrane proteins to some extent. The release of aromatic molecules such as DNA/RNA was detected after the interaction of Salmonella with the peptide extract. Transmission electronic microscopy (TEM) micrographs depicted at least four simultaneous secondary events after the peptide extract treatment underlying their antimicrobial actions, including morphological alterations of the membrane. Spheroplast and filament formation, vacuolation, and DNA relaxation were identified as the principal events from the Gt2 and Cys5-4 peptide extracts, while Gt28 induced the formation of ghost cells by release of cytoplasmic content, filaments, and separation of cell envelope layers. Gel retarding assays indicate that the Gt2 and Gt28 peptide extracts are clearly binding the Salmonella DNA, while Cys5-4 partially interacted with Salmonella genomic DNA. These results increased our knowledge about the inhibitory mechanism employed by several peptide extracts from native lactic acid bacteria against Salmonella. Further, we shall develop peptide-based formulation and evaluate their biocontrol effect in the food chains.","I expressed my gratitude to Ing. E. Pita for the technical support and C.

Yet, evidence of such linkage for copepods, the most abundant metazoans in the oceans, remains scarce, particularly for naturally corrosive Eastern Boundary Upwelling systems (EBUs). This study assessed the relationship between pH levels and traits (body and egg size) and performance (ingestion rate (IR) and egg reproduction rate (EPR)) of the numerically dominant neritic copepod Acartia tonsa, in a year-round upwelling system of the northern (23° S) Humboldt EBUs. The study revealed decreases in chlorophyll (Chl) ingestion rate, egg production rate and egg size with decreasing pH as well as egg production efficiency, but the opposite for copepod body size. Further, ingestion rate increased hyperbolically with Chl, and saturated at ~1 µg Chl. L−1. Food resources categorized as high (H, >1 µg L−1) and low (L, <1 µg L−1) levels, and pH-values categorized as equivalent to present day (≤400 µatm pCO2, pH > 7.89) and future (>400 µatm pCO2, pH < 7.89) were used to compare our observations to values globally employed to experimentally test copepod sensitivity to OA. A comparison (PERMANOVA) test with Chl/pH (2*2) design showed that partially overlapping OA levels expected for the year 2100 in other ocean regions, low-pH conditions in this system negatively impacted traits and performance associated with copepod fitness. However, interacting antagonistically with pH, food resource (Chl) maintained copepod production in spite of low pH levels. Thus, the deleterious effects of ocean acidification are modulated by resource availability in this system.","We thank Dr. Mauricio Cerda, Mr. Espiridion Montanares and Mr. Lucas Vega for their valuable help during cruises and experiments.

The main factors considered for the construction and evaluation of these systems are the localization accuracy and the time spent to calculate and deliver this information. The challenge in developing successful positioning systems is to find a tolerable relationship between those factors. In this proposal, after a careful analyses of related works, we associated different methodologies and technologies to construct a hybrid positioning model that uses a mapping algorithm called Linear Weighted Policy Learner, a navigation model called iterative Pedestrian Dead Reckoning (which uses the Kalman filter to deliver real-time location), and an obstacle detection algorithm that combines sounds and stereo vision sensorial capabilities. The adopted choices were based on the published state-of-the-art, and comparisons of the obtained results showed that our system is accurate and fast enough to be very competitive with the current stage of the technology.","This work was supported in part by CAPES (Coordenação de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior) under Grant 001, in part by CNPq (Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico), in part by FAPEAM (Fundação de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado do Amazonas) through scholarships for the graduate programs of the Federal University of Amazonas (UFAM), Brazil.

223,pub.1128964427,10.3390/pr8070776,,,Is Recycling Always the Best Option? Environmental Assessment of Recycling of Seashell as Aggregates in Noise Barriers,"Waste recycling is an essential part of waste management. The concrete industry allows the use of large quantities of waste as a substitute for a conventional raw material without sacrificing the technical properties of the product. From a circular economy point of view, this is an excellent opportunity for waste recycling. Nevertheless, in some cases, the recycling process can be undesirable because it does not involve a net saving in resource consumption or other environmental impacts when compared to the conventional production process. In this study, the environmental performance of conventional absorption porous barriers, composed of 86 wt % of natural aggregates and 14 wt % cement, was compared with barriers composed of 80 wt % seashell waste and 20 wt % cement through an attributional cradle-to-grave life cycle assessment. The results show that, for the 11 environmental impact categories considered, the substitution of the natural aggregates with seashell waste involves higher environmental impacts, between 32% and 267%. These results are justified by the high contribution to these impacts of the seashell waste pre-treatment and the higher cement consumption. Therefore, the recycling of seashells in noise barrier manufacturing is not justified from an environmental standpoint with the current conditions. In this sense, it could be concluded that life cycle assessments should be carried out simultaneously with the technical development of the recycling process to ensure a sustainable solution.",The authors would like to acknowledge Carmen Barros and Diego Iribarren for their contribution to the article.,"This research was funded by Innovation Funds for competitiveness from Regional Government of Coquimbo (Chile), grant number BIP 40014353-0.",Processes,,,,2020-07-02,2020,2020-07-02,,8,7,776,All OA; Gold,Article,"Peceño, Begoña; Leiva, Carlos; Alonso-Fariñas, Bernabé; Gallego-Schmid, Alejandro","Peceño, Begoña (Facultad de Ciencias del Mar, Escuela de Prevención de Riesgos y Medioambiente, Universidad Católica del Norte, Larrondo 1281, Coquimbo 1780000, Chile;, begopc@ucn.cl); Leiva, Carlos (Departamento de Ingeniería Química y Ambiental, Escuela Técnica Superior de Ingeniería, Universidad de Sevilla, Camino de los Descubrimientos s/n, 41092 Seville, Spain;, cleiva@us.es); Alonso-Fariñas, Bernabé (Departamento de Ingeniería Química y Ambiental, Escuela Técnica Superior de Ingeniería, Universidad de Sevilla, Camino de los Descubrimientos s/n, 41092 Seville, Spain;, cleiva@us.es); Gallego-Schmid, Alejandro (Tyndall Centre for Climate Change, School of Mechanical, Aerospace and Civil Engineering, The University of Manchester, Pariser Building, Sackville Street, Manchester M13 9PL, UK)","Alonso-Fariñas, Bernabé (University of Seville); Gallego-Schmid, Alejandro (University of Manchester)","Peceño, Begoña (Catholic University of the North); Leiva, Carlos (University of Seville); Alonso-Fariñas, Bernabé (University of Seville); Gallego-Schmid, Alejandro (University of Manchester)",18,9,,1.87,https://www.mdpi.com/2227-9717/8/7/776/pdf?version=1593670796,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1128964427,40 Engineering; 4004 Chemical Engineering,12 Responsible Consumption and Production

Different variables were evaluated: sulfuric acid concentration, sodium nitrate concentration, chloride concentration, source of water (distilled water, seawater, and brine), temperature, concentrate sample type, nitrate source (analytical grade and industrial salt), and pre-treatment methods in order to obtain maximum copper extraction. All tests were performed at moderate temperatures (≤45 °C) and atmospheric pressure. The leaching system using distilled water, seawater, and brine base media resulted in copper extraction of 70.9%, 90.6%, and 86.6% respectively. The leaching media, with a concentration of 20 g/L Cl−, obtained a maximum Cu extraction of 93.5%. An increase in the concentration of H2SO4 and NaNO3 from 0.5 to 0.7 M, led to an increase in the copper extraction. The use of an industrial salt compared to the analytical salt did not show great variations in the percentage of extraction achieved, which would be a good and cost effective alternative. The increase in temperature from 25 to 45 °C showed a great effect on the copper leaching (of 60% until 90.6%, respectively). The pre-treatment is suggested to increase copper extraction from 60.0% to 71.4%.",The authors thank to Laboratorio de Investigación de Procesos of Universidad de Antofagasta for the support provide.,This research was funded by ANID-Chile through Fondecyt de Iniciación Project N°11170179 and Project ING2030 CORFO Code 16ENI2–71940.,Minerals,,,,2020-05-23,2020,2020-05-23,,10,5,477,All OA; Gold,Article,"Hernández, Pía; Dorador, Alexis; Martínez, Monserrat; Toro, Norman; Castillo, Jonathan; Ghorbani, Yousef","Hernández, Pía (Departamento de Ingeniería Química y Procesos de Minerales, Universidad de Antofagasta, Av.

RSV could be used to mitigate damages associated to metabolic diseases and aging. Particularly, RSV regulates different aspects of mitochondrial metabolism. However, no information is available about the effects of RSV on Coenzyme Q (CoQ), a central component in the mitochondrial electron transport chain. Here, we report for the first time that RSV modulates COQ genes and parameters associated to metabolic syndrome in mice. Mice fed with high fat diet (HFD) presented a higher weight gain, triglycerides (TGs) and cholesterol levels while RSV reverted TGs to control level but not weight or cholesterol. HFD induced a decrease of COQs gene mRNA level, whereas RSV reversed this decrease in most of the COQs genes. However, RSV did not show effect on CoQ9, CoQ10 and total CoQ levels, neither in CoQ-dependent antioxidant enzymes. HFD influenced mitochondrial dynamics and mitophagy markers. RSV modulated the levels of PINK1 and PARKIN and their ratio, indicating modulation of mitophagy. In summary, we report that RSV influences some of the metabolic adaptations of HFD affecting mitochondrial physiology while also regulates COQs gene expression levels in a process that can be associated with mitochondrial dynamics and turnover.",,"J.D.H.C. is a predoctoral research fellow from the Spanish Ministry of Education, Culture and Sports [FPU16/03264].",Antioxidants,,,,2020-05-15,2020,2020-05-15,,9,5,431,All OA; Gold,Article,"Meza-Torres, Catherine; Hernández-Camacho, Juan Diego; Cortés-Rodríguez, Ana Belén; Fang, Luis; Thanh, Tung Bui; Rodríguez-Bies, Elisabet; Navas, Plácido; López-Lluch, Guillermo","Meza-Torres, Catherine (Centro Andaluz de Biología del Desarrollo, Universidad Pablo de Olavide-CSIC-JA, and CIBERER, Instituto de Salud Carlos III, 41013 Sevilla, Spain;, mezacathemeza@gmail.com, (C.M.-T.);, jdhercam@upo.es, (J.D.H.-C.);, abcorrod@upo.es, (A.B.C.-R.);, tungasia82@yahoo.es, (T.B.T.);, ecrodbie1@upo.es, (E.R.-B.);, pnavas@upo.es, (P.N.)); Hernández-Camacho, Juan Diego (Centro Andaluz de Biología del Desarrollo, Universidad Pablo de Olavide-CSIC-JA, and CIBERER, Instituto de Salud Carlos III, 41013 Sevilla, Spain;, mezacathemeza@gmail.com, (C.M.-T.);, jdhercam@upo.es, (J.D.H.-C.);, abcorrod@upo.es, (A.B.C.-R.);, tungasia82@yahoo.es, (T.B.T.);, ecrodbie1@upo.es, (E.R.-B.);, pnavas@upo.es, (P.N.)); Cortés-Rodríguez, Ana Belén (Centro Andaluz de Biología del Desarrollo, Universidad Pablo de Olavide-CSIC-JA, and CIBERER, Instituto de Salud Carlos III, 41013 Sevilla, Spain;, mezacathemeza@gmail.com, (C.M.-T.);, jdhercam@upo.es, (J.D.H.-C.);, abcorrod@upo.es, (A.B.C.-R.);, tungasia82@yahoo.es, (T.B.T.);, ecrodbie1@upo.es, (E.R.-B.);, pnavas@upo.es, (P.N.)); Fang, Luis (Immunology and Molecular Biology Group, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla 081007, Colombia;, lfang@uninorte.edu.co); Thanh, Tung Bui (Centro Andaluz de Biología del Desarrollo, Universidad Pablo de Olavide-CSIC-JA, and CIBERER, Instituto de Salud Carlos III, 41013 Sevilla, Spain;, mezacathemeza@gmail.com, (C.M.-T.);, jdhercam@upo.es, (J.D.H.-C.);, abcorrod@upo.es, (A.B.C.-R.);, tungasia82@yahoo.es, (T.B.T.);, ecrodbie1@upo.es, (E.R.-B.);, pnavas@upo.es, (P.N.); School of Medicine and Pharmacy, Vietnam National University, Hanoi 100000, Vietnam); Rodríguez-Bies, Elisabet (Centro Andaluz de Biología del Desarrollo, Universidad Pablo de Olavide-CSIC-JA, and CIBERER, Instituto de Salud Carlos III, 41013 Sevilla, Spain;, mezacathemeza@gmail.com, (C.M.-T.);, jdhercam@upo.es, (J.D.H.-C.);, abcorrod@upo.es, (A.B.C.-R.);, tungasia82@yahoo.es, (T.B.T.);, ecrodbie1@upo.es, (E.R.-B.);, pnavas@upo.es, (P.N.); Departamento de Deporte e Informática, Universidad Pablo de Olavide, 41013 Sevilla, Spain); Navas, Plácido (Centro Andaluz de Biología del Desarrollo, Universidad Pablo de Olavide-CSIC-JA, and CIBERER, Instituto de Salud Carlos III, 41013 Sevilla, Spain;, mezacathemeza@gmail.com, (C.M.-T.);, jdhercam@upo.es, (J.D.H.-C.);, abcorrod@upo.es, (A.B.C.-R.);, tungasia82@yahoo.es, (T.B.T.);, ecrodbie1@upo.es, (E.R.-B.);, pnavas@upo.es, (P.N.)); López-Lluch, Guillermo (Centro Andaluz de Biología del Desarrollo, Universidad Pablo de Olavide-CSIC-JA, and CIBERER, Instituto de Salud Carlos III, 41013 Sevilla, Spain;, mezacathemeza@gmail.com, (C.M.-T.);, jdhercam@upo.es, (J.D.H.-C.);, abcorrod@upo.es, (A.B.C.-R.);, tungasia82@yahoo.es, (T.B.T.);, ecrodbie1@upo.es, (E.R.-B.);, pnavas@upo.es, (P.N.))","López-Lluch, Guillermo (Centro Andaluz de Biología del Desarrollo)","Meza-Torres, Catherine (Centro Andaluz de Biología del Desarrollo); Hernández-Camacho, Juan Diego (Centro Andaluz de Biología del Desarrollo); Cortés-Rodríguez, Ana Belén (Centro Andaluz de Biología del Desarrollo); Fang, Luis (Universidad del Norte); Thanh, Tung Bui (Centro Andaluz de Biología del Desarrollo; Vietnam National University, Hanoi); Rodríguez-Bies, Elisabet (Centro Andaluz de Biología del Desarrollo; Pablo de Olavide University); Navas, Plácido (Centro Andaluz de Biología del Desarrollo); López-Lluch, Guillermo (Centro Andaluz de Biología del Desarrollo)",13,6,0.88,1.84,https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3921/9/5/431/pdf?version=1589550843,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1127676234,31 Biological Sciences; 3101 Biochemistry and Cell Biology,

Objective: To establish the prevalence of Leptospira spp. in vaccinated working dogs and in the occupationally exposed population in six police units in Colombia.
Materials and methods: A total of 92 vaccinated dogs (65 males and 27 females) and 69 people from six police units in the municipalities of Manizales, Pereira, Armenia, Ibagué, Tuluá, and Cali were tested. Three structured instruments were applied and blood samples were obtained from people and dogs, which were processed with the microagglutination test (MAT) in 24 serogroups. A clinical examination of the dogs was performed and urine samples were obtained for urine cultures.
Results: The seroprevalence of human leptospirosis was 2.9% (n=2) and in dogs, it was 57.61% (n=53). Among the dogs, serogroups L. canicola and L. panama were the most prevalent. Urine cultures were positive in 58.7% (54/92) of the samples. A statistically significant association was found between the age of the dogs (≥10 years; p=0.043) and the location of the police unit (p=0.016) with the urine culture.
Conclusion: The epidemiological characteristics of leptospirosis in dogs suggest an endemic presentation of the infection. There is an urgent need to improve current diagnostic methods to investigate canine leptospirosis and differentiate between vaccine and natural infection antibodies.","Los autores agradecen a la Vicerrectoría de Investigaciones y Posgrados de la Universidad de Caldas, la Universidad del Valle y la Policía Nacional, por la financiación de la investigación.",,Biomédica,,,Adult; Animals; Bacterial Vaccines; Colombia; Dog Diseases; Dogs; Female; Humans; Leptospirosis; Male; Occupational Diseases; Prevalence; Risk Assessment; Working Dogs; Young Adult,2020-05-01,2020,2020-05-01,,40,Supl. 1,62-75,All OA; Gold,Article,"Murcia, César A.; Astudillo, Miryam; Romero, Marlyn H.","Murcia, César A.

The weak acid corresponds to a wastewater effluent from sulfuric acid plants produced in the gas treatment of copper smelting processes. This effluent is basically water with high acidity (pH-value low at 1), which contains several toxic elements and some valuable metals. The results indicated that there is no positive or negative effect on the incorporation of the weak acid in the curing stage, while the case of the leaching stage is favored. Toxicity characteristic leaching procedure (TCLP) and synthetic precipitation leaching procedure (SPLP) toxicity tests were performed on the solid leaching residues, determining that they accomplish the stability ranges of the impurities (Pb, Cd, Hg, Cr, Ba, Se, As, and Ag).","The authors would like to thank Innovation Fund for Competitiveness of the Regional Government of Atacama, project approved by Consejo Regional de Atacama (BIP 30486516-0), CONICYT and GORE Atacama for funding the equipment used in this study (FONDEQUIP EQUVII 0001 and EQUR 16001) and the contribution of the Unit of Scientific Equipment - MAINI, from Catholic University of the North for facilitating the mineralogical tests.

Chalcocite has been identified as having economic interest due to its abundance, although the water necessary for its dissolution is scarce in many regions. In this work, the replacement of fresh water by sea water or by reject brine with high chloride content from desalination plants is analyzed. Additionally, the effect of adding MnO2 from available manganese nodules in vast quantities at the bottom of the sea is studied. Reject brine shows better results than sea water, and the addition of MnO2 to the brine significantly increases the kinetics of chalcocite dissolution in a short time. H2SO4 concentration is found to be irrelevant when working at high concentrations of chloride and MnO2. The best results, 71% Cu extractions in 48 h, are obtained for reject brine, 100 mg of MnO2 per 200 g of mineral and H2SO4 0.5 mol/L. The results are expected to contribute to a sustainable process of dissolution of chalcocite by using the reject brine from desalination plants.",The authors thank the Scientific Equipment Unit-MAINI of the Universidad Católica del Norte for all the chemical analyses in this work.

This will also enable existing plants to continue operation. The objective of this work is to study the behavior of chalcopyrite leaching by stirring in an acid-nitrate-chloride media where seawater and brines provide chloride ions and nitrate ions can be provided from the caliche industry. The variables studied were sulfuric acid, nitrate and chloride concentration, source of water (dissolvent), temperature, solid/liquid ratio, particle size, mineral sample, and pretreatment before the leaching process. Despite being a refractory mineral, chalcopyrite can be leached in this system obtaining favorable recoveries at the conditions studied. It was possible to obtain 50% Cu in 0.7 M of H2SO4 and NaNO3, using brine at 45 °C. The nitrate-chloride-acid system was highly temperature dependent, with an activation energy of 82.6 kJ/mol, indicative of chemical reaction control of leaching kinetics. SEM/EDS indicated the presence of sulfur on the surface of the mineral after leaching. This study demonstrates that sources such as seawater or discard brines (such as from the reverse osmosis process) and waste (solid or solutions) from the caliche industry can provide a highly oxidative system for the dissolution of chalcopyrite.",The authors thank to Laboratorio de Investigación de Procesos of Universidad de Antofagasta for the support provide.,This research was funded by ANID-Chile through Fondecyt de Iniciación Project N°11170179 and Project ING2030 CORFO Code 16ENI2–71940.,Metals,,,,2020-04-24,2020,2020-04-24,,10,4,551,All OA; Gold,Article,"Hernández, Pía; Gahona, Giovanni; Martínez, Monserrat; Toro, Norman; Castillo, Jonathan","Hernández, Pía (Departamento de Ingeniería Química y Procesos de Minerales, Universidad de Antofagasta, Av.

A recently described factor involved in this process is glutamate. Through NMDA ionotropic receptor, glutamate modifies intracellular Ca2+ dynamics allowing the oriented cell migration and proliferation, essentials processes in neurulation. Glutamate synthesis depends on the mitochondrial enzyme known as glutaminase 1 (GLS1) that is widely expressed in brain and kidney. The participation of GLS 1 in prenatal neurogenic processes and in the adult brain has been experimentally established, however, its participation in early stages of embryonic development has not been described. The present investigation describes for the first time the presence and functionality of GLS1 in Xenopus laevis embryos during neurulation. Although protein expression levels remains constant, the catalytic activity of GLS1 increases significantly (~66%) between early (stage 12) and middle to late (stages 14-19) neurulation process. Additionally, the use of 6-diazo-5-oxo-L-norleucine (L-DON, competitive inhibitor of glutamine-depend enzymes), reduced significantly the GLS1 specific activity during neurulation (~36%) and induce the occurrence of neural tube defects involving its possible participation in the neural tube closure in Xenopus laevis embryos.","The authors thank Susana Rojas, Jocelyn Gonzalez, Alejandra Ilabaca and Laurie Aguayo for their outstanding technical assistance.","This work was funded by FONDECYT 11160562 and VRID 220.033.112-4 (PAC).

Most of the toxin is accumulated in the digestive gland, but this organ contains several cell types whose contribution to the accumulation of the toxin is unknown. Determining the time-course of the depuration by analyzing whole organs is difficult because the inter-individual variability is high. A sampling method, using biopsies of the digestive gland, has been developed. This method allows for repetitive sampling of the same scallop, but the representativeness of the samples obtained in this way needs to be validated. In this work, we found that the distribution of DA in the digestive gland of the scallops is mostly homogeneous. Only the area closest to the gonad, and especially its outer portion, had a lower concentration than the other ones, probably due to a transfer of the toxin to the intestinal loop. Samples obtained by biopsies can therefore be considered to be representative. Most of the toxin was accumulated in large cells (mostly digestive cells), which could be due to differences during the toxin absorption or to the preferential depuration of the toxin from the small cells (mostly secretory).",We acknowledge Carmen Mariño and Helena Martín by their technical assistance.,"“This research was funded by the Programa de Programa de Recursos Marinos of the Consellería de Innovación, Industria e Comercio, Xunta de Galicia, grant number PGIDIT04RMA501007PR” and “The APC was funded by “CONICYT+FONDEF/PRIMER CONCURSO INVESTIGACION TENOLÓGICA TEMATICO EN SISTEMAS PESQUERO ACUICOLAS FRENTE A FLORECIMIENTOS ALGALES NOCIVOS FANS IDeA DEL FONDO DE FOMENTO AL DESARROLLO CIENTIFICO Y TECNOLÓGICO, FONDEF/CONYCIT 2017 IT17F10002, Universidad Católica del Norte, Coquimbo, Chile, and Centro de Investigacións Mariñas, Xunta de Galicia.

Materials and Methods: A bibliometric analysis was conducted using 1995-2017 data from the Scopus data-base. The following search strategy was used: country (Cuba), subject area (dentistry), publication source (Journals), article type (Original Research, Review Article). Bibliometric indicators of output, visibility, leadership, collaboration and impact were examined. Result: 521 articles were published in 21 Journals, of which 20 are international and 13 are within the first quartile (Q1), led by Clinical Oral Implants Research. There was a prevalence of Spanish language publications, without collaboration, and in Revista Cubana de Estomatología. The Cuban scientific leadership significantly diminishes in the journals located in the highest visibility quartile (Q1) (p=0.0144). The high dependency of citation-based indicators, as well as international collaboration, in rela-tion to the journals’ quartile, was confirmed. Conclusion: The national scientific output in first quartile journals that has the biggest influence on the scientific international community is dependent on international collaboration to reach high levels of visibility and impact, and the national scientific output is not still able to systematically generate research that impacts in a significant way the scientific international community.",,,Journal Of Oral Research,,,,2020-04-30,2020,2021-01-01,2020-04-30,9,2,129-141,All OA; Gold,Article,"Corrales-Reyes, Ibraín; "", Universidad  de Ciencias Médicas de Granma Hospital General Universitario; Fornaris-Cedeño, Yasmany; Dorta-Contreras, Alberto; Pacheco-Mendoza, Josmel; de Céspedes"", Carlos Manuel; Granma, Cuba; Universidad    de Ciencias Médicas de  de Ciencias Médicas de  de Ciencias Médicas de  de Ciencias Médicas de La Habana Facultad de Ciencias Médicas La Habana, Cuba | Instituto Nacional de Neurología y Neurocirugía La Habana; Universidad   de de de Central Habana, Cuba  de Ciencias Médicas  de Ciencias Médicas  de Ciencias Médicas  de Ciencias Médicas de La Habana Facultad de Ciencias Médicas Dr Miguel Enríquez Laboratorio  La Habana Facultad de Ciencias Médicas Dr Miguel Enríquez Laboratorio Central del Líquido Cefalorraquídeo La; San Ignacio  Lima, Perú Universidad  de Loyola Unidad de Investigación en Bibliometría","Corrales-Reyes, Ibraín (); "", Universidad  de Ciencias Médicas de Granma Hospital General Universitario (); Fornaris-Cedeño, Yasmany (); Dorta-Contreras, Alberto (); Pacheco-Mendoza, Josmel (); de Céspedes"", Carlos Manuel (); Granma, Cuba (); Universidad    de Ciencias Médicas de  de Ciencias Médicas de  de Ciencias Médicas de  de Ciencias Médicas de La Habana Facultad de Ciencias Médicas La Habana, Cuba | Instituto Nacional de Neurología y Neurocirugía La Habana (); Universidad   de de de Central Habana, Cuba  de Ciencias Médicas  de Ciencias Médicas  de Ciencias Médicas  de Ciencias Médicas de La Habana Facultad de Ciencias Médicas Dr Miguel Enríquez Laboratorio  La Habana Facultad de Ciencias Médicas Dr Miguel Enríquez Laboratorio Central del Líquido Cefalorraquídeo La (); San Ignacio  Lima, Perú Universidad  de Loyola Unidad de Investigación en Bibliometría ()",,"Corrales-Reyes, Ibraín (); "", Universidad  de Ciencias Médicas de Granma Hospital General Universitario (); Fornaris-Cedeño, Yasmany (); Dorta-Contreras, Alberto (); Pacheco-Mendoza, Josmel (); de Céspedes"", Carlos Manuel (); Granma, Cuba (); Universidad    de Ciencias Médicas de  de Ciencias Médicas de  de Ciencias Médicas de  de Ciencias Médicas de La Habana Facultad de Ciencias Médicas La Habana, Cuba | Instituto Nacional de Neurología y Neurocirugía La Habana (); Universidad   de de de Central Habana, Cuba  de Ciencias Médicas  de Ciencias Médicas  de Ciencias Médicas  de Ciencias Médicas de La Habana Facultad de Ciencias Médicas Dr Miguel Enríquez Laboratorio  La Habana Facultad de Ciencias Médicas Dr Miguel Enríquez Laboratorio Central del Líquido Cefalorraquídeo La (); San Ignacio  Lima, Perú Universidad  de Loyola Unidad de Investigación en Bibliometría ()",3,0,,1.77,https://doi.org/10.17126/joralres.2020.020,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1128501078,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3203 Dentistry; 46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4610 Library and Information Studies,

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time this scheme is assessed in the cold boot attacks setting. In particular, our evaluation is focused on the reference implementation of this scheme. Furthermore, we present a dedicated key-recovery algorithm for SIKE in this setting and show that the key recovery algorithm works for all the parameter sets recommended for this scheme. Moreover, we compute the success rates of our key recovery algorithm through simulations and show the key recovery algorithm may reconstruct the SIKE secret key for any SIKE parameters for a fixed and small α=0.001 (the probability of a 0 to 1 bit-flipping) and varying values for β (the probability of a 1 to 0 bit-flipping) in the set {0.001,0.01,…,0.1}.

The pathogen infects gastroenteric epithelia, including digestive gland, disrupting the digestive system and causing a progressive wilting in abalone. Nonetheless, our knowledge about WS implications in digestive gland microbiota, and its role in diseases progress remains largely unknown. This study aims to determine whether digestive gland-associated microbiota differs between healthy red abalone (Haliotis rufescens) and red abalone affected with WS. Using high-throughput sequencing of the V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene, our results revealed differences in microbiota between groups. Bacterial genera, including Mycoplasma, Lactobacillus, Cocleimonas and Tateyamaria were significantly more abundant in healthy abalones, whilst Candidatus Xenohaliotis californiensis and Marinomonas were more abundant in WS-affected abalones. Whilst Mycoplasma was the dominant genus in the healthy group, Candidatus Xenohaliotis californiensis was dominant in the WS group. However, Candidatus Xenohaliotis californiensis was present in two healthy specimens, and thus the Mycoplasma/Candidatus Xenohaliotis californiensis ratio appears to be more determinant in specimens affected with WS.

Nevertheless, these positive effects appear to be modulated by the composition and amount of the N pool in the soil, being greater when plant hosts are growing where N is scarce as is the case of Antarctic soils. Nevertheless, in some coastal areas of this continent, seabirds and marine mammal colonies exert, through their accumulated feces and urine a strong influence on the edaphic N content surrounding their aggregation points. To evaluate if the fungal symbionts (root endophytes), associated to the only two Antarctic vascular plants Colobanthus quitensis and Deschampsia antarctica, act as N-uptake enhancers, even in such N-rich conditions as those found around animal influence, we assessed, under controlled conditions, the process of N mineralization in soil by the accumulation of NH4 + in the rizhosphere and the biomass accumulation of plants with (E+) and without (E-) fungal symbionts. Complementarily, taking advantage of the isotopic N-fractionation that root-fungal symbionts exert on organic N molecules during its acquisition process, we also determined if endophytes actively participate in the Antarctic plants N-uptake, when inorganic N is not a limiting factor, by estimating the δ15N isotopic signatures in leaves. Overall, symbiotic interaction increased the availability of NH4 + in the rhizosphere of both species. As expected, the enhanced availability of inorganic N resulted in a higher final biomass in E + compared with E- plants of both species. In addition, we found that the positive role of fungal symbionts was also actively linked to the process of N-uptake in both species, evidenced by the contrasting δ15N signatures present in E+ (-0.4 to -2.3‰) relative to E- plants (2.7-3.1‰). In conclusion, despite being grown under rich N soils, the two Antarctic vascular plants showed that the presence of root-fungal endophytes, furthermore enhanced the availability of inorganic N sources in the rhizosphere, has a positive impact in their biomass, remarking the active participation of these endophytes in the N-uptake process for plants inhabiting the Antarctic continent.","We thank the Chilean Antarctic Institute (INACH) and the “Henryk Arctowski” Polish Antarctic Station for their logistical support.

Associated with the use of these waters, silicon fertilization constitutes an important attenuator of salt stress. In this perspective, this study aimed to evaluate the phytomass production and quality of the passion fruit cultivar ‘Gigante Amarelo’ grown with saline water and silicon fertilization. The experiment was conducted in a plant nursery belonging to the Center of Agrifood Science and Technology, in the municipality of Pombal-PB. A completely randomized block design in a 5 x 5 factorial scheme was used, referring to five levels of electrical conductivity of the irrigation water (0.3, 1.0, 1.7, 2.4, and 3.1 dS m-1) and five doses of silicon fertilization (0; 25; 50; 75, and 100 g of potassium silicate/plant), with four replications and two plants per plot. The phytomass accumulation (leaves, stem, and roots), as well as the total dry phytomass, shoot dry phytomass, root/shoot ratio, and the quality index of Dickson were evaluated. The data obtained were subjected to the F-test at 0.01 and 0.05 level of probability. The electrical conductivity of water from 0.3 dS m-1 caused the decrease of phytomass production in seedlings of the passion fruit cultivar ‘Gigante Amarelo’, although it is possible to produce good quality passion fruit seedlings with water salinity up to 3.1 dS m-1. The doses of silicon fertilization mitigated the effect of salt stress on the root/shoot ratio of plants of the passion fruit cultivar ‘Gigante Amarelo’.",,,Comunicata Scientiae,,,,2020-07-13,2020,2020-07-13,,11,,e3400-e3400,All OA; Gold,Article,"Diniz, Genilson Lima; Nobre, Reginaldo Gomes; Lima, Geovani Soares de; Souza, Leandro de Pádua; Soares, Lauriane Almeida dos Anjos; Gheyi, Hans Raj","Diniz, Genilson Lima (); Nobre, Reginaldo Gomes (); Lima, Geovani Soares de (); Souza, Leandro de Pádua (); Soares, Lauriane Almeida dos Anjos (); Gheyi, Hans Raj ()",,"Diniz, Genilson Lima (); Nobre, Reginaldo Gomes (); Lima, Geovani Soares de (); Souza, Leandro de Pádua (); Soares, Lauriane Almeida dos Anjos (); Gheyi, Hans Raj ()",6,3,,1.71,https://www.comunicatascientiae.com.br/comunicata/article/download/3400/931,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1129327350,"30 Agricultural, Veterinary and Food Sciences; 3004 Crop and Pasture Production",

MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total of 294 samples from patients with clinical diagnosis of febrile syndrome compatible with dengue were collected between June 2015 and December 2016. All samples were tested for DENV and ZIKV by RT-PCR using C6/36 cells culture supernatant.
RESULTS: Thirty-three percent of the samples were positive (97/294); from these, 61.8% were positive for DENV and 31% were positive for Zika. The predominant serotype was DENV-2 (70.1%), followed by DENV-3 (8.9%), DENV-4 (6%), and DENV-1 (3%). DENV/ZIKV coinfection was identified in 7.2% of the cases associated with DENV-1 and DENV-3 serotypes. The confirmed cases of dengue, Zika, and DENV/ZIKV coinfections were clinically mild and self-limited.
CONCLUSIONS: We reported the co-circulation of all four DENV serotypes, with a higher frequency of DENV-2, and ZIKV introduction in Córdoba department-Colombia in August 2015. This scenario favored the appearance of DENV/ZIKV coinfections.","This research was supported by Gobernación de Córdoba and Sistema General de Regalías (SGR), Colombia (Grant N° 754/2013), and Universidad del Sinú, Colombia.",,International Journal of Infectious Diseases,,,"Aged; Child, Preschool; Coinfection; Colombia; Cross-Sectional Studies; Dengue; Dengue Virus; Female; Fever; Humans; Infant; Male; Serotyping; Zika Virus; Zika Virus Infection",2020-08-07,2020,2020-08-07,2020-10,99,,458-465,All OA; Gold,Article,"Avilés-Vergara, Paula A; Trujillo-Correa, Andrea; Gómez-Suárez, Luz A; Ricardo-Caldera, Dina; Soto-De León, Sara C; Brango, Hugo; Tovar Acero, Catalina","Avilés-Vergara, Paula A (Grupo de investigación en Enfermedades Tropicales y Resistencia Bacteriana, Universidad del Sinú, Montería, Córdoba, Colombia.

The ER data used in the study were excerpted from the Texas flexible pavements and overlays database, namely, the Texas Data Storage System (DSS), covering plant‐mix extracted PG XX‐22 asphalt‐binders (i.e., rolling thin film oven (RTFO) residues) from 20 different sources and measured using the Ductilometer test at 10°C. The findings of the study indicated that material source has an impact on the ER property of asphalt‐binders. Statistically significant differences were observed among some sources and suppliers that reported the same low‐temperature asphalt‐binder type/grade (i.e., PG XX‐22). Overall, the study contributes to enriching the literature on the material‐source effects on asphalt‐binders’ ER properties, consistency, variability, and data quality. In particular, the study highlights the sensitivity nature of the asphalt‐binder ER parameter to material‐source effects.",Conflicts of Interest The authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest.

Prediction studies for energy demand require a high level of reliability since a deviation in the forecasting demand could affect operation costs. This paper proposed a short-term forecasting energy demand methodology based on hierarchical clustering using Dynamic Time Warp as a similarity measure integrated with Artificial Neural Networks. Clustering was used to build the typical curve for each type of day, while Artificial Neural Networks handled the weather sensibility to correct a preliminary forecasting curve obtained in the clustering stage. A statistical analysis was carried out to identify those significant factors in the prediction model of energy demand. The performance of this proposed model was measured through the Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE).

To identify the effect of the multimodal high-intensity interval training on body composition, lipid profile, and glucose metabolism in elderly diabetics. Methods: Elderly diabetic individuals (n = 48) were randomly divided in a Sedentary Control (SC) group, a Moderate-Intensity Continuous Training (MICT) group, and a High-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT) group. MICT and HITT were conducted over 60 days, 3x per week, with 40 minutes of exercise. Blood was collected prior to intervention, at four, and at eight weeks subsequently to assess glucose metabolism and lipid profiles. Body composition was determined before and after the intervention period. To verify the normality Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistical test was performed, followed by student ""t"" test or two-way ANOVA with Bonferroni’s post hoc test with significance of 5 % the Cohen’s f test to indicate the magnitude of the differences. HIIT significantly lowered cholesterol and triglyceride levels, and significantly lowered blood glucose and glycosylated haemoglobin levels (p<0.05). MICT and HIIT significantly increased levels of high-density lipoprotein, decreased total body mass and body mass index. HIIT resulted in significantly smaller waist circumferences, waist-to-hip ratios, and weight-to-height ratios over 60 days of training. HIIT is more effective than MICT for improving lipid and glycaemic profiles, decreasing body fat, and improving fat distribution elderly diabetics. RESUMEN: El ejercicio podra desempear un papel central en el manejo de la grasa y el metabolismo de la glucosa, lo que puede ser un papel crtico en el estado de salud de las personas diabticas, pero el ejercicio intenso intenso sigue teniendo datos controvertidos sobre sus efectos. El objetivo del estudio fue identificar el efecto del entrenamiento multimodal de intervalos de alta intensidad sobre la composicin corporal, el perfil lipdico y el metabolismo de la glucosa en diabticos de edad avanzada. Los individuos diabticos de edad avanzada (n = 48) se dividieron aleatoriamente en un grupo de control sedentario (SC), un grupo de entrenamiento continuo de intensidad moderada (MICT) y un grupo de entrenamiento de intervalos de alta intensidad (HIIT). MICT y HITT se realizaron durante 60 das, 3 veces por semana, con 40 minutos de ejercicio. Se recogi sangre antes de la intervencin, a las cuatro y a las ocho semanas posteriormente para evaluar el metabolismo de la glucosa y los perfiles de lpidos.

277,pub.1124116092,10.3390/met10010123,,,Reducing-Effect of Chloride for the Dissolution of Black Copper,"Oxidized black copper ores are known for their difficulty in dissolving their components of interest through conventional methods. This is due to its non-crystalline and amorphous structure. Among these minerals, copper pitch and copper wad are of great interest because of their considerable concentrations of copper and manganese. Currently, these minerals are not incorporated into the extraction circuits or left untreated, whether in stock, leach pads, or waste. For the recovery of its main elements of interest (Cu and Mn), it is necessary to use reducing agents that dissolve the present MnO2, while allowing the recovery of Cu. In this research, the results for the dissolution of Mn and Cu from a black copper mineral are exposed, evaluating the reducing effect of NaCl for MnO2 through pre-treatment of agglomerate and curing, and subsequently leaching in standard condition with the use of a reducing agent (Fe2+). High concentrations of chloride in the agglomerate process and prolonged curing times would favor the reduction of MnO2, increasing the dissolution of Mn, while the addition of NaCl did not benefit Cu extractions. Under standard conditions, low Mn extractions were obtained, while in an acid-reducing medium, a significant dissolution of MnO2 was achieved, which supports the removal of Cu.","The authors are grateful for the contribution of the Scientific Equipment Unit-MAINI of the Universidad Católica del Norte for facilitating the chemical analysis of the solutions.

Challenges like mitigating the damage to surrounding communities have promoted the need to reuse, recycle and/or reduce their generation. Besides, these residues may become a source of materials, which are capable of being recovered and reused in several industries, minimizing the environmental impact. In the mining region of Pachuca, Mexico, waste from the mining industry have been generated for more than 100 years, which have a high SiO2 content that can be recovered for various industrial applications. This work aims to recover silica from a material of the Dos Carlos dam. A columnar system composed of two-stage of cleaning was used, considering a JLT (surface liquid rate) value of 0.45 and 0.68 cm/s, respectively; while the Jg (surface gas rate) value was 0.30 cm/s for both stages. Similar bubble sizes in the range of Jg 0.10 to 0.30 cm/s, with values between 0.14 and 0.16 cm in the first stage, and 0.05 to 0.06 cm in the second one. This provided a recovery of 75.10% for all the allotropic phases of silica (quartz, trydimite, and cristobalite) leaving a concentration of 24.90% of a feldspathic phase (orthoclase), as flotation tails.",Authors thank to the PRODEP–SEP for the financial support granted in the publication of this paper.

Measures were taken early in order to strengthen the health system before the potential spread of the virus. Mandatory isolation measures impacted on the energy system: they modified energy demand and production patterns, and caused reasons for uncertainty among investors and project stakeholders. Nevertheless, profound changes caused by the pandemic, pave the way for the adoption of sustainable solutions with the potential to improve people's quality of life. This paper aims to explore the effects of the COVID-19 lockdown on the Argentinian energy sector and on the course of the transition. By means of secondary sources, such as public reports and national statistics, and semi-structured interviews, changes in the energy sector are analysed as well as local-scale alternatives for the post-pandemic. Community-led energy initiatives and the possibility of implementing sustainable practices, could contribute to reducing uncertainty and valorizing local resources and capabilities.",Institutions that support our research: National Council of Scientific and Technical Research (CONICET).

AIM: To assess the psychometric properties of ACE-III, analyzing its factor structure, its reliability (from an Item Response Theory [TRI] model) and its diagnostic usefulness.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: We studied 1101 older people without cognitive impairment and 63 currently having a diagnosis and receiving treatment for dementia.
RESULTS: The presence of two factors for the Attention subscale (Orientation and Attention, separately) was suggested. The factorial analysis showed adequate adjustment in all the subscales, except for the new Attention subscale. In the TRI analysis, the Attention subscale presented a greater number of items with lack of fit compared to the other subscales. Using a proposed threshold of 66 points or less to identify cognitive impairment related to dementia, a sensitivity of 0.97 and specificity of 0.81 was obtained.
CONCLUSIONS: ACE-III is a valid, reliable, and useful measure for the clinical detection of dementia. The combined use of Orientation and Memory subscales is proposed as an alternative and time-saving ACE-III indicator.",,,Revista Medica de Chile,,,"Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Cognition; Cognitive Dysfunction; Dementia; Humans; Neuropsychological Tests; Psychometrics; Reproducibility of Results",2020-09,2020,2020-09,2020-09,148,9,1279-1288,All OA; Gold,Article,"Véliz García, Óscar; Calderón Carvajal, Carlos; Beyle Sandoval, Christian","Véliz García, Óscar (Escuela de Psicología, Facultad de Humanidades, Universidad Católica del Norte, Antofagasta, Chile.); Calderón Carvajal, Carlos (Escuela de Psicología, Facultad de Humanidades, Universidad Católica del Norte, Antofagasta, Chile.); Beyle Sandoval, Christian (Departamento de Psicología, Facultad de Ciencias de la Salud, Universidad Católica de Temuco, Temuco, Chile.)",,"Véliz García, Óscar (Catholic University of the North); Calderón Carvajal, Carlos (Catholic University of the North); Beyle Sandoval, Christian (Temuco Catholic University)",5,3,0.47,1.62,http://www.scielo.cl/pdf/rmc/v148n9/0717-6163-rmc-148-09-1279.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1134179868,42 Health Sciences; 4203 Health Services and Systems,

These relations can also occur transgenerationally. For instance, progeny plants whose mothers experienced herbivory can be more resistant to herbivores. Certain fungal endophytes that are vertically transmitted endow plants with alkaloids and resistance to herbivores. However, endophyte-symbiotic plants exposed to the oxidative agent ozone became susceptible to aphids. Here, we explored whether this effect persists transgenerationally. We exposed Lolium multiflorum plants with and without fungal endophyte Epichloë occultans to ozone (120 or 0 ppb), and then, challenged the progeny with aphids (Rhopalosiphum padi). The endophyte was the main factor determining the resistance to aphids, but its importance diminished in plants with ozone history. This negative ozone effect on the endophyte-mediated resistance was apparent on aphid individual weights. Phenolic compounds in seeds were increased by the symbiosis and diminished by the ozone. The endophyte effect on phenolics vanished in progeny plants while the negative ozone effect persisted. Independently of ozone, the symbiosis increased the plant biomass (≈24%). Although ozone can diminish the importance of endophyte symbiosis for plant resistance to herbivores, it would be compensated by host growth stimulation.",We thank the three anonymous reviewers whose work and suggestions helped us to significantly improve the article.

Our group previously showed that distinct strains of T. cruzi (JG and Col1.7G2) acquired differential tissue distribution in the chronic stage in dually infected BALB/c mice. To investigate changes in the host triggered by the two distinct T. cruzi strains, we assessed the gene expression profiles of BALB/c mouse hearts infected with either JG, Col1.7G2 or an equivalent mixture of both parasites during the initial phase of infection. This study demonstrates the clear differences in modulation of host gene expression by both parasites. Col1.7G2 strongly activated Th1-polarized immune signature genes, whereas JG caused only minor activation of the host immune response. Moreover, JG strongly reduced the expression of genes encoding ribosomal proteins and mitochondrial proteins related to the electron transport chain. Interestingly, the evaluation of gene expression in mice inoculated with a mixture of the parasites produced expression profiles with both up- and downregulated genes, indicating the coexistence of both parasite strains in the heart during the acute phase. This study suggests that different strains of T. cruzi may be distinguished by their efficiency in activating the immune system, modulating host energy metabolism and reactive oxygen species production and decreasing protein synthesis during early infection, which may be crucial for parasite persistence in specific organs.","We would like to acknowledge the valuable contributions of Neuza Antunes Rodrigues and Afonso da Costa Viana, who assisted us with the mouse procedures and parasite handling, and Fabricio Rodrigues dos Santos for providing access to the 7900HT Fast Real-Time PCR System for the qPCR analyses.

C. gariepinus considered a good source of protein for human consumption and has been believed as an important fish for farming. The present study aims to investigate the gastrointestinal parasites of C. gariepinus in a local area within Qaluobaya Governorate, Egypt. Thirty males and females C. gariepinus(Teleostei: Clariidae) were examined for the presence of gastrointestinal parasites. Two parasite species were found naturally infect C. gariepinus. Polyonchobothrium clarias (Cestoda:  Pseudophyllidea) which infected the pyloric stomach, small intestine, bile duct, and gall bladder. The other parasite was Procamallanus laeviconchus (Nematoda: Camallanidae) which infects the small intestine of C. gariepinus. The prevalence of P. clarias was 33.33 % which was higher than the prevalence of P. laeviconchus (6.67 %). The prevalence of infection in males of C. gariepinus was 26.67 %, however, the prevalence of infection in females was 6.67 % which was significantly lower than the prevalence of infection in males. The total recovered P. clarias was 188 worms, while the total number of P. laeviconchus was 23 worms. It was also observed that the tissues at the infected sites were greatly destructed.

One of the most conspicuous traits in butterflies is their wing color pattern, which has been shown to be important in speciation. The evolution of many taxa in the Neotropics has also been influenced by major geological events. Using a dated, species-level molecular phylogenetic hypothesis for Preponini, a colorful Neotropical butterfly tribe, we evaluated whether diversification rates were constant or varied through time, and how they were influenced by color pattern evolution and biogeographical events. We found that Preponini originated approximately 28 million years ago and that diversification has increased through time consistent with major periods of Andean uplift. Even though some clades show evolutionarily rapid transitions in coloration, contrary to our expectations, these shifts were not correlated with shifts in diversification. Involvement in mimicry with other butterfly groups might explain the rapid changes in dorsal color patterns in this tribe, but such changes have not increased species diversification in this group. However, we found evidence for an influence of major Miocene and Pliocene geological events on the tribe's evolution. Preponini apparently originated within South America, and range evolution has since been dynamic, congruent with Andean geologic activity, closure of the Panama Isthmus, and Miocene climate variability.","ACKNOWLEDGMENTS We are deeply grateful to everyone that was involved in the field and who donated material to be included in this study.

Imiquimod has ability to moderate immune response and used to treat a wide variety of infections and tumors. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effect of imiquimod on the tachyzoites of T. gondii and infected macrophages in vitro and in BALB/c mice. The viability of T. gondii was assessed in the presence of various concentrations of imiquimod by direct counting after 6 and 24 h. The MTT assay was used to identify the viability of uninfected macrophages. The apoptotic effects were determined with flow cytometry on the tachyzoites and infected macrophages. For evaluation of parasite load in pre-treatment or post-treatment of macrophages Quantitative real time PCR (qPCR) was performed. For in vivo experiments, BALB/c mice received imiquimod before and after challenge with parasites. The mortality rate of mice, parasite numbers in spleen, and the INF-γ and IL-4 cytokine levels in spleen lymphocytes were evaluated. Imiquimod demonstrated anti-Toxoplasma effects by reducing the number of tachyzoites. The results of flow cytometry for drug-treated tachyzoites showed that apoptosis did not rise significantly relative to the control group (p < 0.05). Moreover, apoptosis was enhanced in infected macrophages as the concentration of imiquimod was reduced. The parasitic burden in imiquimod pretreated macrophages was significantly lower than those treated after infection (p < 0.01). A marked reduction was observed in survival rate, parasite load and INF-γ level in BALB/c mice that received imiquimod before parasitic challenge relative to those received drug after parasitic challenge (p < 0.01). Overall, imiquimod in the pretreated group had greater anti-Toxoplasma effects than imiquimod in posttreated group in vitro and in vivo. imiquimod may be considered as a candidate for use against Toxoplasmosis both therapeutically and prophylactically.","The authors would like to thank all staff of Department of Parasitology of Tarbiat Modares University, Iran.

A total of 31 contigs were assembled, with a total length of 1,924,087 bases, 20 contig hits match the core genome of different groups within Weissella, while for 11 contigs no match was found in the database. The GT content was 39.53% and the genome repeats sequences constitute around 186,760 bases of the assembly. The UTNGt21O matches the W. cibaria genome with 83% identity and no gaps (0). The sequencing data were deposited in the NCBI Database (BioProject accessions: PRJNA639289). The antibacterial activity and interaction mechanism of the peptide UTNGt21O on target bacteria were investigated by analyzing the growth, integrity, and morphology of the bacterial cells following treatment with different concentrations (1×, 1.5× and 2× MIC) of the peptide applied alone or in combination with chelating agent ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) at 20 mM. The results indicated a bacteriolytic effect at both early and late target growth at 3 h of incubation and total cell death at 6 h when EDTA was co-inoculated with the peptide. Based on BAGEL 4 (Bacteriocin Genome Mining Tool) a putative bacteriocin having 33.4% sequence similarity to enterolysin A was detected within the contig 12. The interaction between the peptide UTNGt21O and the target strains caused permeability in a dose-, time- response manner, with Salmonella (3200 AU/mL) more susceptible than E. coli (6400 AU/mL). The results indicated that UTNGt21O may damage the integrity of the cell target, leading to release of cytoplasmic components followed by cell death. Differences in membrane shape changes in target cells treated with different doses of peptide were observed by transmission electronic microscopy (TEM). Spheroplasts with spherical shapes were detected in Salmonella while larger shaped spheroplasts with thicker and deformed membranes along with filamentous cells were observed in E. coli upon the treatment with the UTNGt21O peptide. These results indicate the promising potential of the putative bacteriocin released by the novel W. cibaria strain UTNGt21O to be further tested as a new antimicrobial substance.",The skillful technical assistance of D.

Case 2 and 3 consist in a unique collector operating continuously for 24 h with PCM and without PCM, respectively. It was determined that the use of PCM in ISD increased the night thermal performance and extended the operational time of the system. On the other hand, results indicate that the use of two alternating collectors presents similar discharge behavior to using one collector with PCM operating continuously.

This study estimated the occurrence of body image dissatisfaction in primary schoolchildren aged 9-13 years and investigated its association with obesity and other factors.
Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted, for which 533 students attending three public primary schools in Acapulco were recruited. Students completed a facilitated self-administered questionnaire about their age, sex, socioeconomic level, body image satisfaction, and perception of their parents' body image. We registered anthropometry of the students and calculated body mass index (BMI). We examined the associations of BMI category and other factors with body image dissatisfaction, calculating the cluster-adjusted odds ratio and 95% confidence intervals.
Results: From the total number of participants, 75% (181/243) of girls and 73% (170/232) of boys were dissatisfied with their body image and wanted a slimmer body. About half were overweight or obese: 45% (121/271) of girls and 52% (135/262) of boys. Overweight or obese children were much more likely to be dissatisfied with their body image (cluster adjusted: 6.73; 95% CI: 5.42-8.36). No other factors were significantly associated with body image dissatisfaction. One-third of the girls (32%, 86/271) and 17% (45/261) of the boys reported an underweight desired body image.
Conclusions: The high level of obesity is a cause for concern and an even higher level of body image dissatisfaction as well. The high dissatisfaction among children suggests that boys, as well as girls in Mexico, may now be subjected to intense social pressure about desirable body image.",,,Boletín Médico del Hospital Infantil de México,,,Body Image; Child; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Humans; Male; Mexico; Pediatric Obesity; Schools,2020-07-15,2020,2020-07-15,2020-07-15,77,3,119-126,All OA; Gold,Article,"Casarrubias-Jaimez, Ana I; Legorreta-Soberanis, José; Sánchez-Gervacio, Belén M; Serrano-de Los Santos, Felipe R; Paredes-Solís, Sergio; Flores-Moreno, Miguel; Andersson, Neil; Cockcroft, Anne","Casarrubias-Jaimez, Ana I (Centro de Investigación de Enfermedades Tropicales, Universidad Autónoma de Guerrero, Acapulco de Juárez, Guerrero, Mexico.); Legorreta-Soberanis, José (Centro de Investigación de Enfermedades Tropicales, Universidad Autónoma de Guerrero, Acapulco de Juárez, Guerrero, Mexico.); Sánchez-Gervacio, Belén M (Centro de Investigación de Enfermedades Tropicales, Universidad Autónoma de Guerrero, Acapulco de Juárez, Guerrero, Mexico.); Serrano-de Los Santos, Felipe R (Centro de Investigación de Enfermedades Tropicales, Universidad Autónoma de Guerrero, Acapulco de Juárez, Guerrero, Mexico.); Paredes-Solís, Sergio (Centro de Investigación de Enfermedades Tropicales, Universidad Autónoma de Guerrero, Acapulco de Juárez, Guerrero, Mexico.); Flores-Moreno, Miguel (Centro de Investigación de Enfermedades Tropicales, Universidad Autónoma de Guerrero, Acapulco de Juárez, Guerrero, Mexico.); Andersson, Neil (Centro de Investigación de Enfermedades Tropicales, Universidad Autónoma de Guerrero, Acapulco de Juárez, Guerrero, Mexico.; University McGill, Montreal, Canada.); Cockcroft, Anne (Centro de Investigación de Enfermedades Tropicales, Universidad Autónoma de Guerrero, Acapulco de Juárez, Guerrero, Mexico.; University McGill, Montreal, Canada.)",,"Casarrubias-Jaimez, Ana I (Autonomous University of Guerrero); Legorreta-Soberanis, José (Autonomous University of Guerrero); Sánchez-Gervacio, Belén M (Autonomous University of Guerrero); Serrano-de Los Santos, Felipe R (Autonomous University of Guerrero); Paredes-Solís, Sergio (Autonomous University of Guerrero); Flores-Moreno, Miguel (Autonomous University of Guerrero); Andersson, Neil (Autonomous University of Guerrero; McGill University); Cockcroft, Anne (Autonomous University of Guerrero; McGill University)",6,4,0.29,1.54,https://www.bmhim.com/files/bmhim_20_77_3_119-126.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1127750467,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3210 Nutrition and Dietetics; 42 Health Sciences; 4206 Public Health,

The monoalgal diets in phase I were Tisochrysis lutea, Pavlova lutheri and Nannochloropsis sp. In phase II, Tetraselmis suecica, T. chuii, Chaetoceros gracilis and Ch. muelleri were incorporated. The bialgal diets (combination of P. lutheri + Ch. gracilis in proportions 1:3, 1:1 and 3:1) were chosen according to the results of the monoalgal trials and were evaluated against the classic diet = control (T. lutea + Ch. gracilis). The microalgae size and their fatty acid composition were determined. We recommend the combination T. lutea + Ch. gracilis, initially using T. lutea for mixotrophic larvae (6 days Post Fertilization‐PF), then incorporating Ch. gracilis in a ratio of 1:1 until completing phase I (8–10 PF). In phase II, the ratio should change to 1:3 until larvae with eyespot are obtained (18–20 PF). Suggestions were based on the higher demand for DHA in initial larvae and the need for EPA from the early umbonated phase. Finally, as a third experiment, microsubstrates (pieces of shells, sandpaper, polycarbonate and ground rubber) were evaluated to promote the settlement of pediveliger larvae. A settlement of 20% was obtained in pieces of shells of the same species. We consider that the settlement technology has not been optimized; therefore, evaluations directed at the behaviour of the species are recommended.","ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS J.

Un estudio de caso sobre persuasión, distorsión y emoción en las noticias","This article describes how a deceptive event framed in the “interview” journalistic genre makes up a deceptive narrative that, even after being rectified, will continue to affect the audiences summoned emotionally and ideologically. It is a case study developed through a content analysis to explain how a fake news appears in a newscast of private television in Colombia, through the introduction of false phrases that, combined with the framing, emotional narratives and the distortions, sharpen the political polarization and reveal how are these emotions inserted in the news narrative. The results show us that the biases of distortion, not necessarily partisan, and the emotions aligned with the ideological principles together with the gains of the market, are the breeding ground for the gestation of false news. The objective of this paper is to show how traditional media, such as television and its strategies of narrative persuasion, provide their audiences, (fake) materials for the (skewed) construction of (fake) news, while exciting the public, which generates political and economic benefits for the news médium the economic group that it is part of, and the presidential candidate supported by the group.

Firstly, the state of the coastal lagoon was assessed, finding that hydrology, wave climate, and the morphological changes of the coastline explain recent changes in the coastal wetlands. Key variables were used to describe the level of conservation or degradation of the coastal lagoon system and to identify measures to improve its ecological functions. Finally, to mimic some of these functions and improve connectivity of the ecosystems, green infrastructure alternatives were proposed for the short and medium term to recover the services of these ecosystems and restore their resilience.","The authors would like to acknowledge all the support given by Universidad del Norte, and Universidad Tecnológica de Bolívar through the scholarship program for Master degree and the management of the Research and Innovation office in both universities, National University of Mexico (UNAM), Exceed-Swindon Network, Red de Investigaciones en Ecohidrologia y Ecohidraulica (REDECOHH Network), and World Association for Waterborne Transport Infrastructure (PIANC) colombian chapter.

It plays an important role in the ecological and economic development of the most water-stressed region, revealing the impact of the mining industry, which exacerbate regional water shortages for many organisms and ecological processes. Despite this, the river system has remained understudied. To our knowledge, this study provides the first effort to attempt to compare the microbial communities at spatial scale along the Loa River, as well as investigate the physicochemical factors that could modulate this important biological component that still remains largely unexplored. The analysis of the spatial bacterial distribution and their interconnections in the water column and sediment samples from eight sites located in three sections along the river catchment (upper, middle and lower) was conducted using 16S rRNA gene-based Illumina MiSeq sequencing. Among a total of 543 ASVs identified at the family level, over 40.5% were cosmopolitan in the river and distributed within a preference pattern by the sediment substrate with 162 unique ASVs, while only 87 were specific to the column water. Bacterial diversity gradually decreased from the headwaters, where the upper section had the largest number of unique families. Distinct groupings of bacterial communities often associated with anthropogenic disturbance, including Burkholderiaceae and Flavobacteriaceae families were predominant in the less-impacted upstream section. Members of the Arcobacteraceae and Marinomonadaceae were prominent in the agriculturally and mining-impacted middle sector while Rhodobacteraceae and Coxiellaceae were most abundant families in downstream sites. Such shifts in the community structure were also related to the influence of salinity, chlorophyll, dissolved oxygen and redox potential. Network analyses corroborated the strong connectivity and modular structure of bacterial communities across this desert river, shedding light on taxonomic relatedness of co-occurring species and highlighting the need for planning the integral conservation of this basin.","Ana Zárate was supported by a Scientific and Technological Research Scholarship for Doctoral Studies (CONICYT-PCHA/DoctoradoNacional/2015–21150407) and Cristina Dorador (Fondecyt 1181773), and Centro de Bioingeniería y Biotecnología (CeBiB) FB0001.

Particularly, we consider the Tahuando River from Ibarra, Ecuador, as a case study. The main goal of this research is to determine the river’s status throughout its route, by generating data reports into an interactive user interface. To this end, we use an array of sensors collecting several measures such as: turbidity, temperature, water quality, pH, and temperature. Subsequently, from the information collected on an Internet-of-Things (IoT) server, we develop a data analysis scheme with both data representation and supervised classification. As an important result, our system outputs a map that shows the contamination levels of the river at different regions. Furthermore, in terms of data analysis performance, the proposed system reduces the data matrix by 97% from its original size, while it reaches a classification performance over 90%. Furthermore, as an additional remarkable result, we here introduce the so-called quantitative metric of balance (QMB), which measures the balance or ratio between performance and power consumption.",This work is supported by the Smart Data Analysis Systems Group—SDAS Research Group (http://sdas-group.com).,This research received no external funding.,Remote Sensing,,,,2020-06-20,2020,2020-06-20,,12,12,1988,All OA; Gold,Article,"Rosero-Montalvo, Paul D.; López-Batista, Vivian F.; Riascos, Jaime A.; Peluffo-Ordóñez, Diego H.","Rosero-Montalvo, Paul D.

Under these conditions, the goal of understanding the evolution of permafrost in the near future requires monitoring studies of the current state of permafrost and, first of all, its thermal conditions. In this work, based on the experience of many years of research at the Melnikov Permafrost Institute of Siberian Branch of the Russian Academy of Science (MPI SB RAS), methodological and technical issues of equipping experimental sites for monitoring the thermal state of permafrost in Eastern Siberia are considered. It is demonstrated that the reliability of permafrost thermal monitoring depends not only on measurement devices used but also on proper borehole system design and adequate choice of a method for active-layer thickness measurement depending on soil composition and properties. The use of protective tubes significantly lengthens the life of sensors in soils. A method of protecting the loggers from surface waters is recommended.",We are grateful to the Russian Foundation of Basic Research and the National Natural Science Foundation of China for financial support of these studies.,Financial support for this study was provided by RFBR and NSFC grant 20-55-53014.,Land,,,,2020-11-27,2020,2020-11-27,,9,12,476,All OA; Gold,Article,"Konstantinov, Pavel; Zhelezniak, Mikhail; Basharin, Nikolay; Misailov, Ivan; Andreeva, Varvara","Konstantinov, Pavel (Laboratory of Permafrost Landscapes, Melnikov Permafrost Institute, Siberian Branch of the Russian Academy of Science, 36 Merzlotnaya str., 677010 Yakutsk, Russia); Zhelezniak, Mikhail (Laboratory of Permafrost Geothermics, Melnikov Permafrost Institute, Siberian Branch of the Russian Academy of Science, 36 Merzlotnaya str., 677010 Yakutsk, Russia;, fe@mpi.ysn.ru, (M.Z.);, ventura-83@mail.ru, (I.M.)); Basharin, Nikolay (Laboratory of GIS and Mapping, Melnikov Permafrost Institute, Siberian Branch of the Russian Academy of Science, 36 Merzlotnaya str., 677010 Yakutsk, Russia;, Nikolay_B89@mail.ru); Misailov, Ivan (Laboratory of Permafrost Geothermics, Melnikov Permafrost Institute, Siberian Branch of the Russian Academy of Science, 36 Merzlotnaya str., 677010 Yakutsk, Russia;, fe@mpi.ysn.ru, (M.Z.);, ventura-83@mail.ru, (I.M.)); Andreeva, Varvara (Laboratory of General Geocryology, Melnikov Permafrost Institute, Siberian Branch of the Russian Academy of Science, 36 Merzlotnaya str., 677010 Yakutsk, Russia;, varvara-andreev@mail.ru)","Konstantinov, Pavel (Melnikov Permafrost Institute of the Siberian Branch of the Russian Academy of Science)","Konstantinov, Pavel (Melnikov Permafrost Institute of the Siberian Branch of the Russian Academy of Science); Zhelezniak, Mikhail (Melnikov Permafrost Institute of the Siberian Branch of the Russian Academy of Science; Laboratory of Permafrost Geothermics, Melnikov Permafrost Institute, Siberian Branch of the Russian Academy of Science, 36 Merzlotnaya str., 677010 Yakutsk, Russia;, fe@mpi.ysn.ru, (M.Z.);, ventura-83@mail.ru, (I.M.)); Basharin, Nikolay (Melnikov Permafrost Institute of the Siberian Branch of the Russian Academy of Science); Misailov, Ivan (Melnikov Permafrost Institute of the Siberian Branch of the Russian Academy of Science; Laboratory of Permafrost Geothermics, Melnikov Permafrost Institute, Siberian Branch of the Russian Academy of Science, 36 Merzlotnaya str., 677010 Yakutsk, Russia;, fe@mpi.ysn.ru, (M.Z.);, ventura-83@mail.ru, (I.M.)); Andreeva, Varvara (Melnikov Permafrost Institute of the Siberian Branch of the Russian Academy of Science)",5,1,,1.46,https://www.mdpi.com/2073-445X/9/12/476/pdf?version=1606530342,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1133167690,33 Built Environment and Design; 3301 Architecture; 3304 Urban and Regional Planning; 41 Environmental Sciences; 4104 Environmental Management,

Because of this, different alternatives have been evaluated such as natural coagulants, which are considered safe for human health and contain fewer contaminants than chemicals due to their biodegradation properties. The main objective of this study was to evaluate the efficiency of mixing nopal mucilage and cassava starch for turbidity removal in water purification. In this paper, test jars and the treatment equipment (TA-scale FQ-005/PE manufactured by Generatoris SA de CV of Mexico) was applied in order to measure turbidity and pH parameters before and after the process of coagulation-flocculation, which was applied to water from the Magdalena River in Colombia. Samples from two sampling periods were assessed. One was evaluated during the rainy season and the other was evaluated without precipitation (drought) with initial turbidities of 316 NTU and 80 NTU, respectively. It was found that aluminum sulfate as a coagulant reference obtained better turbidity removal results (up to 99%) as compared to nopal (up to 60.4%), and nopal-starch combination of cassava (up to 67%), indicating that this mixture increases the effectiveness of natural coagulants used individually.

The present study aimed at estimating genetic parameters and selecting genotypes of early Carioca beans by analyzing simultaneous attributes, including yield, adaptability, and stability. In the agricultural year of 2015 and 2016, three trials were conducted, using a randomized block design, with three repetitions each, in the Agreste and Sertao regions of Pernambuco State. The genetic parameters were estimated using the mixed model procedure, and the selection was based on the harmonic mean of the relative performance of genetic values (MHPRVG, abbreviation in Portuguese) method. The environments influenced the phenotypic expression of the bean genotypes during both years, setting a specific adaptation. The mean heritability of the genotypes regarding yield exhibited low magnitude values  in the trials of 2015 (5.78%) and 2016 (13.77%), indicating costly conditions for the selection of the improved genotypes. Genotype CNFC 15856 was selected, considering the genetic gain predicted for yield, by the average and specific performance in the three environments, and by the simultaneous attributes of yield, adaptability, and stability.

The results show that some physicochemical parameters exceed permitted concentrations (Hg, Cd, and cyanide). D. magna showed sensitivity and L. sativa showed inhibition and excessive growth in the analyzed water. Mutagenic values were obtained for all of the sample stations. The presence of bacteria and somatic coliphages in the water show a health risk to inhabitants. In conclusion, the presence of Cd, Hg, and cyanide in the waters for domestic consumption was evidenced in concentrations that can affect the environment and the health of the Monterrey inhabitants.

Due to the decrease in the copper oxide mineral grades, leaching of copper sulfide minerals (secondary sulfides) has positioned itself as a benchmark of operation for the Chilean mining industry. The present work proposes the study of the effects of sulfuric acid, chloride concentration and time on the extraction of copper from sulfuric minerals (chalcocite), considering an experimental design, the surface optimization methodology and the adjustment of a quadratic model. The experimental data were adjusted by multiple regression analysis and were statistically analyzed.

For the above, we used the analytical method and the documentary analysis technique to track theoretical background and statistics and to understand the current state of the teaching and practice of law. Within the findings, we observed that they put in doubt the models that are nourished by technical instruments and argumentation, which, in theory, allow the investigation of the legal phenomenon, ensuring validity and reliability in the result. However, the object of study of legal science involves law as normativity, social effectiveness and value of justice.

In the year 2002, Colombian municipalities were entrusted with autonomous management of their local public education based solely on a population threshold. I estimate the impact that autonomy has had on education performance across the territory, using a municipality and time fixed-effects model. I find a quality gap arising between highly developed and low-developed autonomous municipalities, in a trend that reinforces over time: the reform has induced regional inequality in education quality. I am able to support the hypothesis that autonomous and nonautonomous municipalities were on similar performance trends before decentralization was implemented, even when looking within different local development ranges. Based on the analysis of detailed municipal balance sheet data and administration indicators, I argue that local administration capacity represents the most likely explanation of why the autonomy-related discrepancies have been arising.",,,IZA Journal of Labor Economics,,,,2020-01-01,2020,2020-04-29,2020-01-01,9,1,20200003,All OA; Gold,Article,"Brutti, Zelda","Brutti, Zelda (IEB - Institut d'Economia de Barcelona, UB School of Economics, University of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain)","Brutti, Zelda (University of Barcelona)","Brutti, Zelda (University of Barcelona)",3,1,,1.36,https://content.sciendo.com/downloadpdf/journals/izajole/9/1/article-20200003.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1127406896,38 Economics; 3801 Applied Economics; 3803 Economic Theory,4 Quality Education

Nutritional content such as starch, protein, fiber, phenolics, minerals content; technological properties as hydration kinetics and cooking kinetics were studied. As results, the lines of pigeon pea presented high content of calcium, manganese and fiber, but lower content of iron, protein, and zinc in comparison to other commercial legume grains, such as chickpeas and common beans. Once the nutritional composition of the nine studied lines was similar, the lines whose grains presented higher hydration capacity were selected since this is desirable for reaching homogeneous texture after the cooking process. Consequently, two lines (namely g18‐95 and g57‐95) were selected and recommended due to their complete hydration and homogeneous cooking for being produced in higher scale for human consumption. Many lines of pigeon pea grow in Brazil, but not all of them are suitable for large scale production. Therefore, selecting new lines of pigeon peas opens the market for new foods considering desirable aspects for the consumer as good nutritional quality and good cooking properties, as an alternative to other commercial pulses.","ACKNOWLEDGMENT This work was founded by UNIPASTO (“Associação para o Fomento à Pesquisa de Melhoramento de Forrageiras”, Brazil) and Brazilian Agricultural Research Corporation (Embrapa).

Severity classification is based on the Glasgow Coma Scale. However, the neurological worsening in an acute setting does not always correspond to the initial severity suggesting an underestimation of the real magnitude of the injury.
Objective: To study the correlation between the initial severity according to the Glasgow Coma Scale and the patient outcome in the context of different clinical and tomography variables.
Materials and methods: We analyzed a retrospective cohort of 490 patients with closed traumatic brain injury requiring a stay in the intensive care unit of two third-level hospitals in Barranquilla. The risk was estimated by calculating the OR (95% CI). The significance level was established at an alpha value of 0.05.
Results: Forty-one percent of all patients required orotracheal intubation; 51.2% were initially classified with moderate trauma and 6,0% as mild. The delay in the aggressive management of the traumas affected mainly those patients with traumas classified as moderate in whom lethality increased to 100% when there was delay in the detection of the neurological worsening and in the establishment of the aggressive treatment beyond 4 to 8 hours while the lethality in patients who received this treatment within the first hour reduced to <20%.
Conclusions: The risk of lethality in traumatic brain injury increases with the delayed detection of neurological worsening in an acute setting, especially when aggressive management is performed after the first hour post-trauma.","Manifestamos nuestro agradecimiento especial al Hospital Universidad del Norte y a la Fundación Clínica Campbell, por proporcionar acceso a los registros clínicos para esta investigación.",,Biomédica,,,"Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Brain Injuries, Traumatic; Child; Colombia; Coma; Combined Modality Therapy; Confidence Intervals; Consciousness Disorders; Decompressive Craniectomy; Female; Foundations; Glasgow Coma Scale; Hospitals, University; Humans; Hypertonic Solutions; Hypnotics and Sedatives; Intubation, Intratracheal; Male; Middle Aged; Odds Ratio; Retrospective Studies; Subarachnoid Hemorrhage, Traumatic; Young Adult",2020-03-01,2020,2020-03-01,,40,1,89-101,All OA; Gold,Article,"Rodríguez, Alexander; Cervera, Eliana; Tuesca, Rafael; Flórez, Karen; Romero, Ricardo; Villalba, Pedro J.","Rodríguez, Alexander (Departamento de Medicina, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia, Universidad del Norte, Departamento de Medicina, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); Cervera, Eliana (Departamento de Medicina, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia, Universidad del Norte, Departamento de Medicina, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); Tuesca, Rafael (Departamento de Medicina, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia, Universidad del Norte, Departamento de Medicina, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); Flórez, Karen (Departamento de Medicina, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia, Universidad del Norte, Departamento de Medicina, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); Romero, Ricardo (Unidad de Cuidado Intensivo, Fundación Clínica Campbell, Barranquilla, Colombia, Fundación Clínica Campbell, Barranquilla, Colombia); Villalba, Pedro J.

To date, there is not a practical, as well as an accurate sample for reflecting chronic glucose levels. We measured earwax glucose in 37 controls. Participants provided standard serum, glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) and earwax samples at two time-points, one month apart. The specimens measured baseline fasting glucose, a follow-up postprandial glucose level and a between sample chronic glucose, calculated using the average level on the two occasions. The baseline earwax sample was obtained using a clinical method and the follow-up using a novel self-sampling earwax device. The earwax analytic time was significantly faster using the novel device, in comparison to the clinical use of the syringe. Earwax accurately reflected glucose at both assessments with stronger correlations than HbA1c. Follow-up postprandial concentrations were more significant than their respective fasting baseline concentrations, reflecting differences in fasting and postprandial glycemia and more efficient standardization at follow up.

Earwax glucose measurements were approximately 60% more predictable than HbA1c in reflecting glycemia over a month.

Thus, an attempt we made to outline an overview of sanitation in the Brazilian Amazon and its possible impacts on the most vulnerable populations and on the health system in a pandemic situation, based on bibliographic and documentary review and exploratory analysis of data related to basic sanitation and health. The Amazon has a huge deficit in sanitation and in the structure of health services, especially in rural areas, increasing the risk of spreading infectious diseases such as COVID-19, whose progress has placed some of the Amazonian states in a prominent position in the rankings of incidence and mortality.   What do you want to do ?

The main systems affected are the central nervous and renal systems, although effects on the reproductive system have also been found. Objective: To explore the relationship between mercury levels in women and their possible sources of contamination. A cross-sectional study was conducted from 2013 to 2015 with women residing in 11 municipalities in La Mojana, Colombia, using non-random sampling. Standardized instruments were used to identify sociodemographic characteristics, mercury use, mining-related activities, water and fish consumption, and other factors. Blood, urine, and hair samples were taken to quantify mercury levels. A logistic regression model was used to identify factors associated with elevated mercury values in the participants' samples. A total of 428 women were included, with an average age of 36.7 ± 16.7 years, 3.3% of whom were pregnant at the time of the survey and 8.4% of whom were exposed occupationally. High levels of mercury were present in 62.8% of the women, in any one of the three samples processed. Those exposed occupationally and environmentally had similar values (p = 0.821). Frequency of fish consumption and source of drinking water were associated with higher levels of mercury (p < 0.05).","We express our gratitude to the people who participated in the study, to the professionals of the Directorates and Risk Analysis in Public Health and Research in Public Health of the National Institute of Health, and to the professionals of the Secretaries of Departmental and Municipal Health, for their valuable contributions in obtaining the field work information.","This work was carried out with operating resources of the Directorates of Surveillance and Risk Analysis in Public Health and Research in Public Health, and Groups of Environmental Risk Factors and Occupational and Environmental Health of the National Institute of Health.",International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health,,,Adult; Animals; Colombia; Cross-Sectional Studies; Dietary Exposure; Drinking Water; Female; Fishes; Gold; Humans; Mercury; Middle Aged; Mining; Pregnancy; Young Adult,2020-03-01,2020,2020-03-11,2020-03-01,17,6,1827,All OA; Gold,Article,"Diaz, Sonia Mireya; Palma, Ruth Marien; Muñoz, Maria Nathalia; Becerra-Arias, Carolina; Niño, Julián Alfredo Fernández","Diaz, Sonia Mireya (Group of Environmental Risk Factors, National Institute of Health, Bogotá 111321, Colombia;, sdiaz21@gmail.com, (S.M.D.);, natamunozg@gmail.com, (M.N.M.)); Palma, Ruth Marien (Environmental and Labor Health Group, National Institute of Health, Bogotá 111321, Colombia;, rpalma@ins.gov.co); Muñoz, Maria Nathalia (Group of Environmental Risk Factors, National Institute of Health, Bogotá 111321, Colombia;, sdiaz21@gmail.com, (S.M.D.);, natamunozg@gmail.com, (M.N.M.)); Becerra-Arias, Carolina (Secretary of Health and Environment of Bucaramanga.

However, FARC ex-combatants have faced significant challenges in receiving healthcare, and little is known about physicians' abilities to address this population's healthcare needs.
METHODS: An electronic questionnaire sent to the Colombian Emergency Medicine professional society and teaching hospitals assessed physicians' knowledge, attitudes, and experiences with the FARC ex-combatant reincorporation process.
RESULTS: Among 53 participants, most were male (60.4%), and ∼25% were affected by the FARC conflict (22.6%). Overall knowledge of FARC reincorporation was low, with nearly two-thirds of participants (61.6%) scoring in the lowest category. Attitudes around ex-combatants showed low bias. Few physicians received training about reincorporation (7.5%), but 83% indicated they would like such training. Twenty-two participants (41.5%) had identified a patient as an ex-combatant in the healthcare setting. Higher knowledge scores were significantly correlated with training about reincorporation (r = 0.354, n = 53, P = 0.015), and experience identifying patients as ex-combatants (r = 0.356, n = 47, P = 0.014).
CONCLUSION: Findings suggested high interest in training and low knowledge of the reincorporation process. Most physicians had low bias, frequent experiences with ex-combatants, and cared for these patients when they self-identify. The emergency department (ED) serves as an entrance into healthcare for this population and a potential setting for interventions to improve care delivery, especially those related to mental healthcare. Future studies could evaluate effects of care delivery following training on ex-combatant healthcare reintegration.",CONFLICTS Of INTEREST The authors declare no conflicts of interest.,"Funding and support: This project was funded through a Fulbright U.S. Student Researcher Scholarship, with Pontificia Universidad Javeriana, Bogotá as the Fulbright Host Country Supporting University, and Brown Emergency Medicine Innovation Grant.",Journal of the American College of Emergency Physicians Open,,,,2020-05-05,2020,2020-05-05,2020-10,1,5,757-765,All OA; Gold,Article,"Reynolds, Christopher W.; Aguiar, Leonar G.; Moretti, Katelyn; Duarte, Andres; Romero, Fabián Andrés Rosas; Patiño, Andres; Fricke, Adrienne; Zarama, Virginia; Moreno, Atilio; Carranza, Heidy; Arbelaez, Christian","Reynolds, Christopher W.

Despite the major role that microorganisms play on the marine biogeochemical cycling and ecosystem functioning, the response of bacterial communities upon OA scenarios is still not well understood. Here, we have conducted a detailed characterization of the composition and relative abundance of bacterial communities in the water column of an open-ocean station in the Eastern Tropical South Pacific (ETSP) off northern Chile and their interactions with environmental factors. In addition, through a short-term microcosm experiment, we have assessed the effect of low pH/high pCO2 conditions over the abundance and genetic diversity of bacterial communities. Our results evidence a clear partitioning of community composition that could be attributed mostly to dissolved oxygen. However, our experimental approach demonstrated that low pH/high pCO2 conditions might modify the structure of the bacterial community, evidencing that small changes in pH may impact significantly the abundance and diversity of key microorganisms. This study constitutes a first step aiming to provide insight about the influence of changing carbonate chemistry conditions on natural bacterial communities and to shed light on the potential impact of OA in biogeochemical cycles on the ETSP region.",We acknowledge Project AUB 12806 Trophic food webs and carbon cycle in low pH/low O2 waters (LowpHOX I): Potential impact of El Niño phenomenon any data used in this paper can be obtained by contacting the corresponding author.,"This work was supported by National Agency for Research and Development of Chile (ANID), Millennium Science Initiative-ANID Program (grant ICN12_019-IMO), FONDECYT Grants N° 3170732 (P.A.) and N° 1170065 (C.V.G).",Microorganisms,,,,2020-12-04,2020,2020-12-04,,8,12,1924,All OA; Gold,Article,"Aguayo, Paulina; Campos, Víctor L.; Henríquez, Carlos; Olivares, Francisca; De Ia Iglesia, Rodrigo; Ulloa, Osvaldo; Vargas, Cristian A.","Aguayo, Paulina (Department of Aquatic System, Faculty of Environmental Sciences & Environmental Sciences Center EULA Chile, Universidad de Concepción, Concepción 4070386, Chile;, crvargas@udec.cl; Millennium Institute of Oceanography (IMO), Universidad de Concepción, Concepción 4070386, Chile;, frolivares@udec.cl, (F.O.);, oulloa@udec.cl, (O.U.); Institute of Natural Resources, Faculty of Veterinary medicine and agronomy, Universidad de Las Américas, Sede Concepcion, Chacabuco 539, Concepcion 3349001, Chile); Campos, Víctor L.

The objectives of this study were to evaluate the effect of: (i) water quality, host sex, size and body condition on adult digenean parasite infections; (ii) digenean infections and host sex and size on the oxidative stress biomarkers and body condition of hosts; and (iii) water quality on the oxidative stress biomarkers and body condition in Clarias gariepinus. Water quality variables were measured and C. gariepinus were collected each month for a year for examination of two intestinal digeneans, Masenia nkomatiensis and Glossidium pedatum, and determination of body condition and measurement of biomarkers in the host. The results indicated that the intensity of M. nkomatiensis was positively correlated with electrical conductivity and total dissolved solids. Prevalence of G. pedatum was negatively correlated with electrical conductivity, salinity and total dissolved solids. High summer water temperature was strongly associated with high digenean infections. There was no host body condition, sex or size bias for any of the parasite infection variables. Differences in the biomarker levels and body condition between uninfected fish and those infected with M. nkomatiensis or G. pedatum were insignificant indicating a low effect of the digenean parasites on oxidative stress biomarkers and body condition in the fish. However, total protein levels were positively associated with host size, and lipid peroxidation was negatively related to host body condition; total protein levels were also positively correlated with temperature and negatively correlated with dissolved oxygen. Host body condition was only negatively correlated with dissolved oxygen. Overall the trends observed in the data showed that the parasites have a negligible effect on oxidative stress in host fish and the trends observed for all variables (water quality, stress biomarkers, body condition and parasite infections) showed a strong seasonal pattern.","We sincerely thank R.

Therefore, the aim of this study was to compare some health indicators related to the Sustainable Development Goals between the Venezuelan migrant population and the Colombian population.   Methods: A longitudinal, descriptive analysis of the maternal mortality ratio; the neonatal, infant and under-five mortality; the proportionate mortality due to undernourishment; and the rates of alleged sexual felony, intimate partner violence and domestic violence in the Venezuelan migrant population in Colombia and in the Colombian population in the 2015-2019 period was conducted. Maternal and child health and undernourishment indicators were estimated for the 2015-18 period, while the gender-based violence indicators were obtained only for 2018-19, since those were the years with information available for each of these indicators. Data was extracted from official sources, such as the National Administrative Department of Statistics (DANE), National Institute of Legal Medicine and Forensic Sciences (INMLCF) and Migración Colombia. The categorical and numerical variables were described through percentages and rates, respectively.   Results: Venezuelan migrants in Colombia had higher rates of maternal, neonatal, infant and under-five mortality, as well as proportionate mortality due to undernourishment, than the Colombian population throughout the study years, although the difference between them decreased at the end of the period. As for the gender-based violence indicators, the Colombian population showed higher rates than the Venezuelan migrants, and both Colombian and Venezuelan female victims showed higher rates in these violence indicators than their male counterparts of the same nationality.   Conclusions: Some apparent inequalities still persist despite the efforts of the Colombian government to attend to the health needs of the Venezuelan migrant population. Colombia must keep and strengthen migratory inclusion in its public policies to impact on migrants’ health.",The author(s) declared that no grants were involved in supporting this work.,,F1000Research,,,,2020-07-07,2020,2020-07-07,,9,,684,All OA; Gold,Article,"Bonilla-Tinoco, Laura Juliana; Aguirre-Lemus, Melissa; Fernández-Niño, Julián Alfredo","Bonilla-Tinoco, Laura Juliana (Universidad Industrial de Santander, Bucaramanga, Colombia); Aguirre-Lemus, Melissa (Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); Fernández-Niño, Julián Alfredo (Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia)","Aguirre-Lemus, Melissa (Universidad del Norte)","Bonilla-Tinoco, Laura Juliana (Industrial University of Santander); Aguirre-Lemus, Melissa (Universidad del Norte); Fernández-Niño, Julián Alfredo (Universidad del Norte)",5,2,,1.29,https://f1000research.com/articles/9-684/v1/pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1129071928,42 Health Sciences; 4206 Public Health; 44 Human Society; 48 Law and Legal Studies,3 Good Health and Well Being

In response, ecological baselines for their sustainable exploitation and the development of seaweed aquaculture have been implemented. In recent years, the culture of commercial red seaweed Chondracanthus chamissoi has been developed experimentally by spore and vegetative reproduction. These methods are facilitated by the formation of secondary attachment discs (SADs), generated to fasten the inoculated algae to substrates. In this study, the vegetative propagation was carried over an artificial substrate installed in a sea bottom culture system. The biomass yields, total amount of epiphytes, length of new thalli and number of SADs, per season and culture times (1, 2, 3 and 4 months) are reviewed in this work. Chondracanthus chamissoi showed growth under all treatments, with a maximum accumulated biomass of 60 g m−1, recorded in summer, and with no significant differences in biomass yield reported in autumn and spring seasons. A similar pattern was observed for epiphyte biomass, while the greatest SAD number and thalli lengths were recorded in winter.",ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS We gratefully appreciate the efforts of Marine Botany Laboratory Staff at Universidad Católica del Norte and the members of the fishermen&#x27;s union association of Puerto Aldea.

METHODS: This study reports, for the first time, the genome size and nuclear repetitive elements, including the 45S ribosomal DNA operon, 5S unit, and microsatellites, of P. argus.
RESULTS: Using a k-mer approach, the average haploid genome size estimated for P. argus was 2.17 Gbp. Repetitive elements comprised 69.02% of the nuclear genome. In turn, 30.98% of the genome represented low- or single-copy sequences. A considerable proportion of repetitive sequences could not be assigned to known repeat element families. Taking into account only annotated repetitive elements, the most frequent belonged to Class I-LINE which were noticeably more abundant than Class I-LTR-Ty- 3/Gypsy, Class I-LTR-Penelope, and Class I-LTR-Ty-3/Bel-Pao elements. Satellite DNA was also abundant. The ribosomal operon in P. argus comprises, in the following order, a 5' ETS (length = 707 bp), ssrDNA (1,875 bp), ITS1 (736 bp), 5.8S rDNA (162 bp), ITS2 (1,314 bp), lsrDNA (5,387 bp), and 3' ETS (287 bp).

Sin embargo, el concepto de “identidad”, pese a su gran presencia en los discursos públicos, sigue siendo afectado por una profunda ambigüedad definitoria que limita su utilidad analítica y dificulta la transferencia de conocimiento de las investigaciones científicas que pudieran contribuir a debates informados en el ámbito público. El presente artículo, en base a la revisión de estudios existentes, aboga por la conceptualización de la identidad como un proceso multidimensional. La elaboración teórica sobre los mecanismos de construcción identitaria lleva a plantear cinco precauciones principales a considerar a la hora establecer relaciones entre las categorías identitarias y las pautas sociales. Se realiza una reflexión sobre la necesidad de combinar el antiesencialismo analítico con el estudio de los esencialismos cotidianos y sus implicaciones.
Abstract The understanding of present social and political tensions generates a renewed interest in the study of identity construction processes. However, the concept of “identity”, despite its wide presence in the public discourses, remains profoundly affected by ambiguity in terms of its definition. This limits its analytical usage and hinders the dissemination of the findings of scientific research that could contribute to creating informed debates in the public domain. The present paper, based on the review of existing studies, argues for a conceptualization of identity that defines it as a multidimensional process. The theoretical discussion concerning the main mechanisms of identity construction leads us to propose five precautions which should be taken into account when analysing the relation between identity categories and social patterns. Finally, we reflect on the necessity of combining analytical anti-essentialism with the study of everyday essentialisms and their implications.",,,Sociologias,,,,2020-08,2020,2020-08,,22,54,202-229,All OA; Gold,Article,"Sobczyk, Rita; Soriano-Miras, Rosa; Caballero-Calvo, Andrés","Sobczyk, Rita (Universidad del Norte, Colombia); Soriano-Miras, Rosa (Universidad de Granada, Spain); Caballero-Calvo, Andrés (Universidad del Norte, Colombia)",,"Sobczyk, Rita (Universidad del Norte); Soriano-Miras, Rosa (University of Granada); Caballero-Calvo, Andrés (Universidad del Norte)",1,1,,1.23,http://www.scielo.br/j/soc/a/nLV4kXFkXsc9S8nFbfYZTrG/?format=pdf&lang=es,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1130477438,"44 Human Society; 47 Language, Communication and Culture; 4702 Cultural Studies",

For that, twenty behaviors within five personality profiles are classified and categorized into NAO. Five basic emotions are considered: anger, boredom, interest, surprise, and joy. Selected behaviors are grouped according to these five different emotions. Common behaviors (e.g., movements or body postures) used by the robot during vocational guidance sessions are based on a theory of personality traits called the “Five-Factor Model”. In this context, a predefined set of questions is asked by the robot—according to a theoretical model called the “Orientation Model”—about the person’s vocational preferences. Therefore, NAO could react as conveniently as possible during the interview, according to the score of the answer given by the person to the question posed and its personality type. Additionally, based on the answers to these questions, a vocational profile is established, and the robot could provide a recommendation about the person’s vocation. The results show how the intelligent selection of behaviors can be successfully achieved through the proposed approach, making the Human–Robot Interaction friendlier.","This work was supported by Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla—Colombia.",This research received no external funding.,Electronics,,,,2020-06-11,2020,2020-06-11,,9,6,971,All OA; Gold,Article,"Goenaga, Selene; Navarro, Loraine; Quintero M., Christian G.; Pardo, Mauricio","Goenaga, Selene (Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla 081007, Colombia); Navarro, Loraine (Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla 081007, Colombia); Quintero M., Christian G.

This text approaches and addresses the normative and jurisprudential plexus related to the protection of the sacred spaces of the Arhuaco, Kogui, Wiwa, and Kankuamo peoples of the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta, set down or delimited in what these ethnic communities have called the “Black Line” (Séshizha, in the Kagaba language of the Kogui people; Shetana Zhiwa, in the Damana language of the Wiwa people; or Seykutukunumaku, in the Iku language of the Kankuamo people), a spiritual, cultural, and physical concept of the Law of Origin. The recognition by the Colombian State of the indigenous communities of the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta, and of their sacred and ancestral sites, through various actions of the branches of public power –administrative acts and court decisions– is a great step towards understanding the importance of ethnic minorities, advocating for the respect and conservation of natural resources and the relevance of both their material and spiritual lives. For this reason, it is appropriate to study whether the normative scaffolding is sufficient and adequate for the preservation and maintenance of the sacred sites that comprise the “Black Line”, which is found in the ancestral memory of the spiritual authorities of our “elder brothers”.",,,Revista Iusta,,,,2020-01-01,2020,2020-01-01,,,53,,All OA; Gold,Article,"Rozo, Leandro Alberto López","Rozo, Leandro Alberto López ()",,"Rozo, Leandro Alberto López ()",1,1,,1.23,https://revistas.usantotomas.edu.co/index.php/iusta/article/download/6271/5917,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1132788804,"47 Language, Communication and Culture; 4702 Cultural Studies; 48 Law and Legal Studies","16 Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions"

Detection of Leishmania donovani antigens in urine has the potential to provide both a non-invasive diagnostic and a test of cure. We searched for L. donovani antigens in urine of VL patients from India and Sudan to contribute to the development of urine antigen capture immunoassays. VL urine samples were incubated with immobilised anti-L. donovani polyclonal antibodies and captured material was eluted. Sudanese eluted material and concentrated VL urine were analysed by western blot. Immunocaptured and immunoreactive material from Indian and Sudanese urine was submitted to mass spectrometry for protein identification. We identified six L. donovani proteins from VL urine. Named proteins were 40S ribosomal protein S9, kinases, and others were hypothetical. Thirty-three epitope regions were predicted with high specificity in the 6 proteins. Of these, 20 were highly specific to Leishmania spp. and are highly suitable for raising antibodies for the subsequent development of an antigen capture assay. We present all the identified proteins and analysed epitope regions in full so that they may contribute to the development of non-invasive immunoassays for this deadly disease.","TM was funded by the Sir Halley Stewart Trust (http://www.sirhalleystewart.org.uk/).

In this work, different artificial neural network (ANN) architectures for modeling the mineral concentrate in a rougher-cleaner-scavenger (RCS) circuit based on the main process variables are generated (variables as the recovery of the rougher, cleaner and scavenger cells, along with disaggregated variables). Analysis of the global sensitivity was performed to study the importance of the individual and joint performances of the stages of the flotation circuit, reflected by sensitivity indicators that allow to infer the impact that the stages and operational parameters produce on the dependent variables (mineral concentrate in rougher, cleaner and scavenger cells, in addition to the global concentration in the RCS circuit). It should be noted that the ANN is a useful tool for modeling dynamic systems such as flotation, while sensitivity analysis shows that the operation of the three threads turns out to be crucial for the subsequent evaluation of the circuit, while the Unbundled variables that most interact with the overall recovery are gas flow rate, bubble and particle diameters, bubble velocity, particle density, and surface tension.

Although it has been extensively studied at the molecular level, sequencing of the 5' and 3' ends of the untranslated regions (UTR) commonly requires specific approaches for completion and corroboration. The present study aimed to characterize the 5' and 3' ends of dengue virus types 1 to 4. The 5' and 3' ends of twenty-nine dengue virus isolates from acute infections were amplified through a modified protocol of the rapid amplification cDNA ends approach. For the 5' end cDNA synthesis, specific anti-sense primers for each serotype were used, followed by polyadenylation of the cDNA using a terminal transferase and subsequent PCR amplification with oligo(dT) and internal specific reverse primer. At the 3' end of the positive-sense viral RNA, an adenine tail was directly synthetized using an Escherichia coli poly(A) polymerase, allowing subsequent hybridization of the oligo(dT) during cDNA synthesis. The incorporation of the poly(A) tail at the 5' and 3' ends of the dengue virus cDNA and RNA, respectively, allowed for successful primer hybridization, PCR amplification and direct sequencing. This approach can be used for completing dengue virus genomes obtained through direct and next-generation sequencing methods.","To the National Laboratory Network for routine virologic surveillance of dengue in Colombia.

                    is an analysis of the current state of the universities of the North Caucasus Federal District from the point of view of creating competitive regional development centers, bearing in mind the Spatial Development Strategy of Russia.
                  
                  
                    The research methodology

                    Results.
                    In the course of the study, features of the development of the NCFD universities were revealed, various aspects of their activities were analyzed. Detailed mapping of the development of the NCFD universities has been made on a wide range of parameters and indicators. The authors note the lack of intelligible parameters used in the formation of the target admission levels in the universities of the North Caucasus Federal District, the weak connection of these figures with the real economy. The absence of status universities in the North Caucasus Federal District, in particular a flagship university, contributes to the outflow of talented students to central Russian and foreign universities.

                    The results of this work can be applied in the activities of the Ministry of Science and Higher Education of the Russian Federation in developing the new university model – “HEIs, providing personnel for basic branches of regional economy” and in planning the target admission levels of universities, setting goals for universities in the region in terms of synchronization their development programs with administrations for the implementation of national projects, programs for the socioeconomic development of the North Caucasus Federal District.
                  
                  
                    Findings.
                    The peculiarities of the socio-political and economic development of the NCFD indicate the difficulties in planning the training of highly skilled specialists for the region. Despite the fact that the “full range” of educational institutions in the North Caucasus Federal District is economically disadvantageous in the short term, the opportunity for young people to receive higher education in their region can be viewed as one of the few really effective channels of self-realization and socialization for a significant part of North Caucasian youth. Insufficient funding, weak involvement of universities in solving the problems of sustainable development of the region do not contribute to the creation and development of universities which can be the real drivers of sustainable and innovative development of the North Caucasus Federal District and competitive scientific and educational centers.",,,Vysshee Obrazovanie v Rossii = Higher Education in Russia,,,,2020-06-04,2020,2020-06-04,,29,5,22-33,All OA; Gold,Article,"Petrosyants, D.

We studied the Maipo River Basin, one of the most polluted with untreated wastewater in Chile, for a period of 12 years (2007-2019). Since the implementation of new public policies, including the operation of a wastewater collector (2012), the Maipo River Basin is currently much less polluted by untreated water than before. To analyze the impact of wastewater reduction in this river basin, we studied the native silverside (Basilichthys microlepidotus), which inhabits both polluted and unpolluted areas of the river basin. Previous studies reported the overexpression of the ornithine decarboxylase (odc) gene, heterozygote deficit, and high frequency of a homozygote odc genotype in silverside populations that inhabit wastewater-polluted sites, suggesting a phenotypic change and genotypic selection in response to pollution. Here, a population affected and another population unaffected by wastewater were studied before and after implementing the wastewater collector. The physicochemical data of water samples, changes in odc expression and microsatellite variability, and odc genotype frequencies were analyzed. The results showed physicochemical changes in the affected site before and after the operation of the wastewater collector. The microsatellite loci showed no changes in either population. The odc expression in the affected site was higher before the operation of the wastewater collector. Significant changes in the genotype frequencies of the odc gene before and after the wastewater collector operation were detected only at the affected site, wherein the homozygous dominant genotype decreased from >59% to <25%. Our results suggest that public policies aimed at mitigating aquatic pollution can indirectly affect both gene expression and genotype frequencies of important functional genes.","ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS Authors thanks C Quezada‐Romegialli, S Scott, R Gauci, M Briones, J Cortes, and P Acuña for fieldwork.

In the course of the study, the tasks of developing a mathematical model were solved, it was implemented in the existing software for component simulation “Internal combustion engine research and development” (ICE RnD), created using the Modelica language, and verification was undertaken using the results of bench tests of diesel engines with injection fuel and water into the intake manifold. The mathematical model is based on a system of equations for the energy and mass balances of gases and includes detailed mathematical submodels of the processes of simultaneous evaporation of fuel and water in the intake manifold; it takes into account the effect of the evaporation of fuel and water on the parameters of the gas state in the intake manifold; it takes into account the influence of the state parameters of the working fluid in the intake manifold on the physical characteristics of fuel and water; it meets the principles of component modeling, since it does not contain parameters that are not related to the simulated component; it describes the process of simultaneous transfer of vapors and non-evaporated liquids between components; and it does not include empirical relationships requiring data on the dynamics of fuel evaporation under reference conditions. According to the results of a full-scale experiment, the adequacy of the mathematical model developed was confirmed. This model can be used to determine the rational design parameters of the fuel and water injection system, the adjusting parameters of the forced diesel engine that provide the required power, and economic indicators, taking into account the limitations on the magnitude of the mechanical and thermal loads of its parts.",The authors thank South Ural State University (SUSU) for support of the research.,"The work was supported by the Government of the Russian Federation (Resolution No. 211 of 16 March 2013), contract No. 02.A03.21.0011.",Energies,,,,2020-08-20,2020,2020-08-20,,13,17,4315,All OA; Gold,Article,"Bondar, Vladimir; Aliukov, Sergei; Malozemov, Andrey; Das, Arkaprava","Bondar, Vladimir (Institute of Engineering and Technology, South Ural State University, 454080 Chelyabinsk, Russia;, bandarvn@susu.ru, (V.B.);, malozemovaa@susu.ru, (A.M.)); Aliukov, Sergei (Institute of Engineering and Technology, South Ural State University, 454080 Chelyabinsk, Russia;, bandarvn@susu.ru, (V.B.);, malozemovaa@susu.ru, (A.M.)); Malozemov, Andrey (Institute of Engineering and Technology, South Ural State University, 454080 Chelyabinsk, Russia;, bandarvn@susu.ru, (V.B.);, malozemovaa@susu.ru, (A.M.)); Das, Arkaprava (Atmospheric Plasma Division, Institute for Plasma Research, Gandhinagar 382428, Gujarat, India;, arkapravadas222@gmail.com)","Aliukov, Sergei (South Ural State University)","Bondar, Vladimir (South Ural State University); Aliukov, Sergei (South Ural State University); Malozemov, Andrey (South Ural State University); Das, Arkaprava (Institute for Plasma Research)",6,1,,1.19,https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/13/17/4315/pdf?version=1597922336,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1130254586,40 Engineering; 4002 Automotive Engineering; 4017 Mechanical Engineering,

Spectrofluorometric techniques were used to evaluate the effect of tested products on rat and human CYP1A and CYP2B activity. The antimutagenic effect of tested products was evaluated in benzo[a]pyrene (BP)-induced mutagenicity assay by an Ames test. Finally, the antimutagenic effect of Thalassia testudinum (100 mg/kg) was assessed in BP-induced mutagenesis in mice. The tested products significantly (p < 0.05) inhibit rat CYP1A1 activity, acting as mixed-type inhibitors of rat CYP1A1 (Ki = 54.16 ± 9.09 μg/mL, 5.96 ± 1.55 μg/mL and 3.05 ± 0.89 μg/mL, respectively). Inhibition of human CYP1A1 was also observed (Ki = 197.1 ± 63.40 μg/mL and 203.10 ± 17.29 μg/mL for the polyphenolic fraction and for thalassiolin B, respectively). In addition, the evaluated products significantly inhibit (p < 0.05) BP-induced mutagenicity in vitro. Furthermore, oral doses of Thalassia testudinum (100 mg/kg) significantly reduced (p < 0.05) the BP-induced micronuclei and oxidative damage, together with an increase of reduced glutathione, in mice. In summary, Thalassia testudinum metabolites exhibit antigenotoxic activity mediated, at least, by the inhibition of CYP1A1-mediated BP biotransformation, arresting the oxidative and mutagenic damage. Thus, the metabolites of T. testudinum may represent a potential source of chemopreventive compounds for the adjuvant therapy of cancer.",The authors acknowledge the technical support given by Cindel Cuellar.,"This research was funded by: CITMA P211LH005-019 (Cuba); the program Becas de Excelencia del Gobierno de México para Extranjeros 2016 (México); FONDECYT 1130601 (Chile), as well as Programas Institucionales del Instituto de Investigaciones Biomédicas, UNAM (México).",Marine Drugs,,,"Activation, Metabolic; Animals; Antimutagenic Agents; Benzo(a)pyrene; Cytochrome P-450 CYP1A1; Cytochrome P-450 CYP1A2; Cytochrome P-450 CYP1A2 Inhibitors; Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme Inhibitors; DNA Damage; Flavonoids; Humans; Hydrocharitaceae; Isoenzymes; Kinetics; Micronuclei, Chromosome-Defective; Micronucleus Tests; Oxidative Stress; Polyphenols; Rats; Salmonella typhi",2020-11-19,2020,2020-11-19,,18,11,566,All OA; Gold,Article,"Delgado-Roche, Livan; Santes-Palacios, Rebeca; Herrera, José A.; Hernández, Sandra L.; Riera, Mario; Fernández, Miguel D.; Mesta, Fernando; Garrido, Gabino; Rodeiro, Idania; Espinosa-Aguirre, Jesús Javier","Delgado-Roche, Livan (Departamento de Farmacología, Instituto de Ciencias del Mar (ICIMAR), Loma 14, Alturas del Vedado, Plaza de la Revolución, La Habana 10600, Cuba;, ldelgado@liomont.com.mx, (L.D.-R.);, mario@icimar.cu, (M.R.);, migueldavid@cebimar.cu, (M.D.F.); Dirección Médica, Laboratorios Liomont S.A. de C.V., Carretera México-Toluca 5420, Ciudad de México 05320, Mexico); Santes-Palacios, Rebeca (Laboratorio de Toxicología Genética, Instituto Nacional de Pediatría, Insurgentes Sur 3700, Insurgentes Cuicuilco, Ciudad de México 04530, Mexico;, rebeca.santes@inp.mx); Herrera, José A.

The catalysts were characterized by elemental analysis, textural properties, XRD, XPS, EDS elemental mapping and High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM). The chemical analyses by X-ray Fluorescence (XRF) and CHNS-O elemental analysis showed results for all compounds in agreement, within experimental accuracy, according to stoichiometric values proposed to Mo/Ni = 6 and (V+Ni)/(V+Ni+Mo) = 0.35. The sol-gel synthesis method increased the surface area by incorporation of Ga3+ ions into the Al2O3 forming Ga-O-Al bonding; whereas the impregnation synthesis method leads to decrease by blocking of alumina pores, as follows NiMoV/Al-Ga(1%-I) < NiMoV/Al-Ga(1%-SG) < NiMo/Al2O3 < Al2O3-Ga2O3(1%-I) < Al2O3-Ga2O3(1%-SG) < Al2O3, propitiating Dp-BJH between 6.18 and 7.89 nm. XRD confirmed a bulk structure typical of (NH4)4[NiMo6O24H6]•5H2O and XPS the presence at the surface of Mo4+, Mo6+, NixSy, Ni2+, Ga3+ and V5+ species, respectively. The EDS elemental mapping confirmed that Ni, Mo, Al, Ga, V and S are well-distributed on Al2O3-Ga2O3(1%-SG) support. The HRTEM analysis shows that the length and stacking distribution of MoS2 crystallites varied from 5.07 to 5.94 nm and 2.74 to 3.58 with synthesis method (SG to I). The results of the characterization sulfided catalysts showed that the synthesis method via impregnation induced largest presence of gallium on the surface influencing the dispersion V5+ species, this effect improves the dispersion of the MoS2 phase and increasing the number of active sites, which correlates well with the dibenzothiophene HDS and naphthalene HYD activities. The dibenzothiophene HDS activities with overall pseudo-first-order rate constants’ values (kHDS) from 1.65 to 7.07 L/(h·mol·m2) follow the order: NiMoV-S/Al-Ga(1%-I) < NiMo-S/Al2O3 < NiMoV-S/Al-Ga(1%-SG), whereas the rate constants’ values (k) of naphthalene HYD from 0.022 to 2.23 L/(h·mol·m2) as follow: NiMoV-S/Al-Ga(1%-SG) < NiMo-S/Al2O3 < NiMoV-S/Al-Ga(1%-I). We consider that Ga and V act as structural promoters in the NiMo catalysts supported on Al2O3 that allows the largest generation of BRIM sites for HYD and CUS sites for DDS.","The authors also gratefully the financial support provided by Universidad del Norte, under Project number: 2019-017.

In this research, archival and archaeological sources complement each other to offer more complexity regarding the social reality of interpersonal violence, which has been understudied in early colonial contexts to date.",,,Anuario de Estudios Americanos,,,,2020-11-20,2020,2020-11-20,,77,2,513-544,All OA; Gold,Article,"Ceballos, Jorge Díaz; Rivera-Sandoval, Javier","Ceballos, Jorge Díaz (European University Institute - Universidad Pablo de Olavide); Rivera-Sandoval, Javier (Universidad del Norte)",,"Ceballos, Jorge Díaz (European University Institute - Universidad Pablo de Olavide); Rivera-Sandoval, Javier (Universidad del Norte)",1,0,,1.1,http://dx.doi.org/10.3989/aeamer.2020.2.05,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1132827154,"43 History, Heritage and Archaeology; 4301 Archaeology; 4303 Historical Studies","16 Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions; 5 Gender Equality"

Based on such a view, in appraisal theory, monoglossic and heteroglossic propositions are defined as two discursive interpersonal choices for signalling the absence or presence of other voices within the category of engagement (Martin, White, 2005). Even though monoglossic propositions in advertisements apparently diminish their interpersonal and subjective value through undialogised positioning due to the absence of engagement elements, this value is nevertheless commonly increased by the highly evaluative nature of advertisements, which is often permeated by ideology. The paper identifies types of monoglossic propositions and investigates their evaluative charge in advertisements, which may contribute significantly to the overall persuasive rhetoric of advertisements, within the appraisal system (Martin, White, 2005).",,,Ars & Humanitas,,,,2020-06-23,2020,2020-06-23,,14,1,171-185,All OA; Gold,Article,"Križan, Agata","Križan, Agata (University of Maribor, Faculty of Arts, Slovenia)",,"Križan, Agata (University of Maribor)",1,0,,1.1,https://revije.ff.uni-lj.si/arshumanitas/article/download/9369/8994,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1128761636,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 47 Language, Communication and Culture; 4703 Language Studies; 4704 Linguistics",

To analyze locally the behavior of the solutions near a sonic line v2=γ-1$$v^2=\gamma -1$$, where v is the tilt, a new “shock” variable is used. Two new equilibrium points on this line are found. These points do not exist in General Relativity when 1<γ<2$$1<\gamma <2 $$. In the limiting case of General Relativity these points represent stiff solutions with extreme tilt.

The method works as follows: via an ensemble of model realizations, a well-conditioned and full-rank square-root approximation of the background error covariance matrix is obtained. This square-root approximation serves as a control space onto which analysis increments can be computed. These are calculated via Line-Search (LS) optimization. We theoretically prove the convergence of the MLEF-MC. Experimental simulations were performed using an Atmospheric General Circulation Model (AT-GCM) and a highly nonlinear observation operator. The results reveal that the proposed method can obtain posterior error estimates within reasonable accuracies in terms of ℓ - 2 error norms. Furthermore, our analysis estimates are similar to those of the MLEF with large ensemble sizes and full observational networks.","This work was supported in part by award UN 2018-38, and by the Applied Math and Computer Science Laboratory at Universidad del Norte (AML-CS).",,Sensors,,,,2020-02-06,2020,2020-02-06,,20,3,877,All OA; Gold,Article,"Nino-Ruiz, Elias David; Mancilla-Herrera, Alfonso; Lopez-Restrepo, Santiago; Quintero-Montoya, Olga","Nino-Ruiz, Elias David (Applied Math and Computer Science Laboratory, Department of Computer Science, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla 080001, Colombia;, amancill@uninorte.edu.co); Mancilla-Herrera, Alfonso (Applied Math and Computer Science Laboratory, Department of Computer Science, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla 080001, Colombia;, amancill@uninorte.edu.co); Lopez-Restrepo, Santiago (Mathematical Modelling Research Group, Department of Mathematical Sciences, Universidad EAFIT, Medellín 050001, Colombia;, slopezr2@eafit.edu.co, (S.L.-R.);, oquinte1@eafit.edu.co, (O.Q.-M.); Delft Institute of Applied Mathematics, Delft University of Technology, 2625 Delft, The Netherlands); Quintero-Montoya, Olga (Mathematical Modelling Research Group, Department of Mathematical Sciences, Universidad EAFIT, Medellín 050001, Colombia;, slopezr2@eafit.edu.co, (S.L.-R.);, oquinte1@eafit.edu.co, (O.Q.-M.))","Nino-Ruiz, Elias David (Universidad del Norte)","Nino-Ruiz, Elias David (Universidad del Norte); Mancilla-Herrera, Alfonso (Universidad del Norte); Lopez-Restrepo, Santiago (EAFIT University; Delft University of Technology); Quintero-Montoya, Olga (EAFIT University)",4,0,,1.03,https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/20/3/877/pdf?version=1581493640,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1124753647,"40 Engineering; 4008 Electrical Engineering; 4009 Electronics, Sensors and Digital Hardware; 46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4606 Distributed Computing and Systems Software",

Efforts have been directed to search for candidate genes such as LEP, LEPR, and MC4R involved in the leptin-melanocortin system. The neuroendocrine regulation of these genes on energy intake and balance influences the pathogenesis of this disease. Contradictory results regarding the association of these genes with obesity raise the need for new research.
Objective: To analyze the association between obesity and LEP rs2167270, LEPR rs1137101, and MC4R rs17782313 polymorphisms and the clinical and biochemical variables in obese adults from Barranquilla, Colombia.
Materials and methods: We analyzed 111 obese adults and 155 non-obese individuals as controls. The polymorphisms were determined by real-time PCR. Besides, anthropometric measures, blood pressure, and biochemical tests were evaluated.
Results: No statistical differences were found in allele and genotype frequencies of gene polymorphisms between groups. The CC genotype of MC4R rs17782313 polymorphism was associated with increased systolic blood pressure and T allele and TT genotype, with decreased HDL cholesterol in obese adults. The effect of the other polymorphisms on these variables was not evidenced.
Conclusions: LEP rs2167270, LEPR rs1137101, and MC4R rs17782313 polymorphisms were not associated with obesity in the population under study.

Magnetic susceptibility was measured in both the field and laboratory. Data obtained allowed for designing spatial magnetic susceptibility distribution maps, showing the horizontal variation of the tailings. In addition, boxplots were used to show the variation of magnetic susceptibility and the concentration of the elements analyzed at different depths of the copper tailings terrace. The degree of correlation between magnetic and chemical variables was defined with coefficient R2. The horizontal and vertical variations of magnetic susceptibility, the concentration of elements, and the significant correlations between them show a relationship between magnetic susceptibility and the chemical processes occurring in the tailing management facility, such as pyrite oxidation. Thus, the correlation functions obtained could be used as semiquantitative tools to characterize tailings or other mining residues.","The authors are thankful to CORFO-INNOVA project (08CM01-05), titled “Integrated development of magneto-chemical technologies and phytotechnologies applied to the remediation of heavy metals in the development of mining environmental liabilities”, for the financial support of this project.","This research was funded by CORFO-INNOVA project (08CM01-05), titled “Integrated development of magneto-chemical technologies and phytotechnologies applied to the remediation of heavy metals in the development of mining environmental liabilities”.",Minerals,,,,2020-10-22,2020,2020-10-22,,10,11,939,All OA; Gold,Article,"Lam, Elizabeth J.; Carle, Rodrigo; González, Rodrigo; Montofré, Ítalo L.; Veloso, Eugenio A.; Bernardo, Antonio; Cánovas, Manuel; Álvarez, Fernando A.","Lam, Elizabeth J.

Introduction The educational hospital climate provides meaningful learning, and is dependent on the perception of its staff. Burnout syndrome appears in professionals who work directly with other people, and both can have a significant influence on the training and performance of future physicians. Objective To evaluate the correlation between the educational environment of hospitals and the Burnout syndrome in the Foundation of doctors in the Lambayeque region of Peru during 2018. Material and methods A descriptive, cross-sectional and observational study was conducted on a sample that consisted of all foundation year doctors from the Lambayeque region during 2018. The Postgraduate Hospital Educational Environment Measurement (PHEEM) questionnaire was used to measure the educational climate, the Maslach Burnout Inventory-Human Services Survey to measure burnout syndrome, as well as a socio-demographic-occupational questionnaire. Results It was found that 28% of the foundation year doctors had burnout syndrome. A more positive than negative educational climate was observed in 5 hospitals in the Lambayeque region (PHEEM=80-120), and only in a reference hospital of the Ministry of Health there was an educational climate with many problems (PHEEM=40-80). There was a statistically significant correlation (p=0.019), and an inverse and low correlation (r=−0.19) between hospital educational climate and burnout syndrome in foundation year doctors in the Lambayeque region. In addition, a significant correlation was found between the sociodemographic occupational factors and burnout syndrome, inverse and low with hours of sleep (r=−0.22 and p=0.009), and direct and low with hours of work (r=0.28 and p=.001).

These have an amorphous crystalline structure that makes them refractory to conventional leaching processes. For this reason, these mineral resources are not incorporated in industrial leaching heap processes and are taken to dumps. In the present study, an agglomerate pretreatment process incorporating NaCl is evaluated, and a curing stage, followed by acid-reducing leaching for Cu and Mn dissolution from a high-grade black copper mineral. For this, an experimental design was developed both to evaluate the impact of the dependent variables on the response, to generate analytical models that represent the copper and manganese recoveries under the set of sampled conditions. The models indicate that the curing time and the NaCl concentration have a primary effect on the recovery of both elements. In contrast, the optimization model suggests that the optimal operating levels are reached at relatively high levels of time (>130 h) and of NaCl concentration (>22 kg/t).","The authors are grateful for the contribution of the Scientific Equipment Unit- MAINI of the Universidad Católica del Norte for facilitating the QEMSCAN analysis.

Key environmental drivers, such as temperature, can profoundly modulate prey energetic costs in ectotherms, although we currently lack knowledge of how both temperature and predation risk can challenge prey physiology and ecology. Such uncertainties in predator-prey interactions are particularly relevant for marine regions experiencing rapid environmental changes due to climate change. Using the octopus (Octopus maorum)-spiny lobster (Jasus edwardsii) interaction as a predator-prey model, we examined different metabolic traits of sub adult spiny lobsters under predation risk in combination with two thermal scenarios: 'current' (20°C) and 'warming' (23°C), based on projections of sea-surface temperature under climate change. We examined lobster standard metabolic rates to define the energetic requirements at specific temperatures. Routine metabolic rates (RMRs) within a respirometer were used as a proxy of lobster activity during night and day time, and active metabolic rates, aerobic scope and excess post-exercise oxygen consumption were used to assess the energetic costs associated with escape responses (i.e. tail-flipping) in both thermal scenarios. Lobster standard metabolic rate increased at 23°C, suggesting an elevated energetic requirement (39%) compared to 20°C. Unthreatened lobsters displayed a strong circadian pattern in RMR with higher rates during the night compared with the day, which were strongly magnified at 23°C. Once exposed to predation risk, lobsters at 20°C quickly reduced their RMR by ~29%, suggesting an immobility or 'freezing' response to avoid predators. Conversely, lobsters acclimated to 23°C did not display such an anti-predator response. These findings suggest that warmer temperatures may induce a change to the typical immobility predation risk response of lobsters. It is hypothesized that heightened energetic maintenance requirements at higher temperatures may act to override the normal predator-risk responses under climate-change scenarios.","This study contributed to the project ‘Preparing fisheries for climate change: identifying adaptation options for four key fisheries in south eastern Australia (DCC &amp; FRDC – Marine Biodiversity and Fisheries Climate Change, Project 2011/039).

These complexes modify histone-DNA interactions and therefore play a pivotal role in different DNA-dependent processes. In Trypanosoma cruzi, a protozoan that controls gene expression principally post-transcriptionally, the transcriptional regulation mechanisms mediated by chromatin remodeling are poorly understood. OBJECTIVE To characterise the ISWI remodeler in T. cruzi (TcISWI). METHODS A new version of pTcGW vectors was constructed to express green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged TcISWI. CRISPR-Cas9 system was used to obtain parasites with inactivated TcISWI gene and we determined TcISWI partners by cryomilling-affinity purification-mass spectrometry (MS) assay as an approximation to start to unravel the function of this protein. FINDINGS Our approach identified known ISWI partners [nucleoplasmin-like protein (NLP), regulator of chromosome condensation 1-like protein (RCCP) and phenylalanine/tyrosine-rich protein (FYRP)], previously characterised in T. brucei, and new components in TcISWI complex [DRBD2, DHH1 and proteins containing a domain characteristic of structural maintenance of chromosomes (SMC) proteins]. Data are available via ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD017869. MAIN CONCLUSIONS In addition to its participation in transcriptional silencing, as it was reported in T. brucei, the data generated here provide a framework that suggests a role for TcISWI chromatin remodeler in different nuclear processes in T. cruzi, including mRNA nuclear export control and chromatin compaction. Further work is necessary to clarify the TcISWI functional diversity that arises from this protein interaction study.","To Fiocruz for the use of its facilities, especially to Dr Priscila Mazzocchi Hiraiwa, Dr Rodrigo Netto Costa and Dr Kelly Cavalcanti Machado.

METHODS: We carried out a systematic review to identify previously published tools. A composite proposal of algorithm was made by following the steps from clinical experience to deprescribe medications. A 2-round electronic Delphi method was conducted to establish consensus. Eighteen experts from different countries (Colombia, Spain and Argentina) accepted to be part of the panel representing geriatricians, internists, endocrinologist, general practitioners, pharmacologists, clinical pharmacists, family physicians and nurses. Panel members were asked to mark a Likert Scale from 1 to 9 points (1= strongly disagree, 9= strongly agree). The content validity ratio, item-level content validity, and Fleiss' Kappa statistics was measured to establish reliability. The same voting method was used for round 2.
RESULTS: A 7-question algorithm was proposed. Each question was part of a domain and conduct into a decision. In round 1, a consensus was not reached but statements were grouped and organized. In round 2, the tool met consensus. The inter-rater reliability was between substantial and almost perfect for questions with Kappa=0.77 (95% CI 0.60-0.93), for domains with Kappa= 0.73 (95%CI 0.60-0.86) and for decisions with Kappa= 0.97 (95%CI 0.90-1.00).
CONCLUSIONS: This is a novel tool that captures and supports healthcare professionals in clinical decision-making for deprescribing potentially inappropriate medication. This includes patient's and caregiver's preferences about medication. This tool will help to standardize care and provide guidance on the prescribing/deprescribing process of older persons' medications. Also, it provides a holistic way to reduce polypharmacy and inappropriate medications in clinical practice.","The authors thank the Universidad Nacional de Colombia and the entire collaborating group for their valuable contributions and participation in the validation process.

In addition, both signaling pathways fulfill important roles in cancer initiation and progression. The present study was aimed at identifying mechanistic differences between INSR and IGF1R using a recently developed bioinformatics tool, the Biological Network Simulator (BioNSi). This application allows to import and merge multiple pathways and interaction information from the KEGG database into a single network representation. The BioNsi network simulation tool allowed us to exploit the availability of gene expression data derived from breast cancer cell lines with specific disruptions of the INSR or IGF1R genes in order to investigate potential differences in protein expression that might be linked to biological attributes of the specific receptor networks. Modeling-generated information was corroborated by experimental and biological assays. BioNSi analyses revealed that the expression of 75 and 71 genes changed during simulation of IGF1R-KD and INSR-KD, compared to control cells, respectively. Out of 16 proteins that BioNSi analysis was based on, validated by Western blotting, nine were shown to be involved in DNA repair, eight in cell cycle checkpoints, six in proliferation, eight in apoptosis, seven in oxidative stress, six in cell migration, two in energy homeostasis, and three in senescence.

One of those is the process of reintegrating ex-combatants into society, in which ensuring their rights to health is a particularly significant challenge in rural areas affected by armed conflict. These areas, known as Territorial Spaces for Training and ReintegrationReincorporation (ETCR, in Spanish), are geographically dispersed throughout 24 municipalities and 13 departments in Colombia. This study aimed to describe how ex-combatants in ETCR regions perceived access to health services one year after the signing of the peace accords. Methods: A descriptive, cross-sectional study was performed between September and October 2018. It included 591 adults and their families, from 23 ETCRs. The study was designed, culturally validated, and piloted. Interviewers were trained and a structured survey was administered containing five dimensions that characterized the perception of effective access to health services. Results: The majority of interviewees were women, heads of household, young adults, ex-combatants, and residents in an ETCR. In total of 96.4% were enrolled in Colombia's subsidized health system, and 20.8% indicated that a member of their household required emergency health services. The regional health center provided the majority of the services. Most of those surveyed (96.0%) reported that they did not have to pay for the services, and that they received respectful (91.6%) and good quality (66.6%) care. There were few referrals to disease prevention and health promotion activities, and only 19.0% of households reported having been visited by extramural health care teams, whose activities were highly valued (80%). Lastly, there was little knowledge about community health activities. Conclusions: While residents of ETCR regions have a favorable perception of their access to health services, they need to be made aware of extramural and public health activities.","The present work was performed under the auspices of Health for Peace, a project sponsored by the United Nation’s Multi-Donor Trust Fund for post-conflict (MDTF), led by the Ministry of Health and Social Protection and implemented by three United Nation agencies: United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), Pan-American Health Organization (PAHO/WHO), and the International Organization for Migration (OIM).

1706,pub.1124692590,10.3390/atmos11020167,,,A Four Dimensional Variational Data Assimilation Framework for Wind Energy Potential Estimation,"In this paper, we propose a Four-Dimensional Variational (4D-Var) data assimilation framework for wind energy potential estimation. The framework is defined as follows: we choose a numerical model which can provide forecasts of wind speeds then, an ensemble of model realizations is employed to build control spaces at observation steps via a modified Cholesky decomposition. These control spaces are utilized to estimate initial analysis increments and to avoid the intrinsic use of adjoint models in the 4D-Var context. The initial analysis increments are mapped back onto the model domain from which we obtain an estimate of the initial analysis ensemble. This ensemble is propagated in time to approximate the optimal analysis trajectory. Wind components are post-processed to get wind speeds and to estimate wind energy capacities. A matrix-free analysis step is derived from avoiding the direct inversion of covariance matrices during assimilation cycles. Numerical simulations are employed to illustrate how our proposed framework can be employed in operational scenarios. A catalogue of twelve Wind Turbine Generators (WTGs) is utilized during the experiments. The results reveal that our proposed framework can properly estimate wind energy potential capacities for all wind turbines within reasonable accuracies (in terms of Root-Mean-Square-Error) and even more, these estimations are better than those of traditional 4D-Var ensemble-based methods. Moreover, large variability (variance of standard deviations) of errors are evidenced in forecasts of wind turbines with the largest rate-capacity while homogeneous variability can be seen in wind turbines with the lowest rate-capacity.",This work was supported by the Applied Math and Computer Science Laboratory at Universidad del Norte (AML-CS).,This research received no external funding.,Atmosphere,,,,2020-02-05,2020,2020-02-05,,11,2,167,All OA; Gold,Article,"Nino-Ruiz, Elias D.; Calabria-Sarmiento, Juan C.; Guzman-Reyes, Luis G.; Henao, Alvin","Nino-Ruiz, Elias D.

151,pub.1132919189,10.5194/esurf-8-995-2020,,,A photogrammetry-based approach for soil bulk density measurements with an emphasis on applications to cosmogenic nuclide analysis,"Abstract. The quantification of soil bulk density (ρB) is a cumbersome and time-consuming task when traditional soil density sampling techniques are applied. However, it can be important for terrestrial cosmogenic nuclide (TCN) production rate scaling when deriving ages or surface process rates from buried samples, in particular when short-lived TCNs such as in situ 14C are applied. Here, we show that soil density determinations can be made using structure-from-motion multi-view stereo (SfM-MVS) photogrammetry-based volume reconstructions of sampling pits. Accuracy and precision tests as found in the literature and as conducted in this study clearly indicate that photographs taken from both a consumer-grade digital single-lens mirrorless (DSLM) and a smartphone camera are of sufficient quality to produce accurate and precise modelling results, i.e. to regularly reproduce the “true” volume and/or density by >95 %. This finding holds also if a freeware-based computing workflow is applied. The technique has been used to measure ρB along three small-scale (<1 km) N–S transects located in the semi-arid to arid Altos de Talinay, northern central Chile (∼30.5∘ S, ∼71.7∘ W), during a TCN sampling campaign. Here, long-term differences in microclimatic conditions between south-facing and north-facing slopes (SFSs and NFSs, respectively) explain a sharp contrast in vegetation cover, slope gradient and general soil condition patterns. These contrasts are also reflected by the soil density data, generally coinciding with lower densities on SFSs. The largest differences between NFSs and SFSs are evident in the lower portion of the respective slopes, close to the thalwegs. In general, field-state soil bulk densities were found to vary by about 0.6 g cm−3 over a few tens of metres along the same slope. As such, the dataset that was mainly generated to derive more accurate TCN-based process rates and ages can be used to characterise the present-day condition of soils in the study area, which in turn can give insight into the long-term soil formation and prevailing environmental conditions. This implies that the method tested in this study may also being applied in other fields of research and work, such as soil science, agriculture or the construction sector.","We would like to thank the Unternehmensgruppe (consortium) Tholen, Geilenkirchen, Germany, who allowed us to conduct our BD17 field tests on their property and who provided valuable information about the geological setting at the site.

Gene-specific mRNA-to-protein correlation is the consequence of the dynamic interplays of the different regulatory processes of proteotranscriptomic landscape. So far, the critical impact of mRNA and protein stability on their subsequent correlation on a global scale remained unresolved. Whether the mRNA-to-protein correlations are constrained by their stability and conserved across mammalian species including human is unknown. Moreover, whether the stability-dependent correlation pattern is altered in the tumor has not been explored. To establish the quantitative relationship between stability and correlation between mRNA and protein levels, we performed a multi-omics data integration study across mammalian systems including diverse types of human tissues and cell lines in a genome-wide manner. The current study illuminated an important aspect of the mammalian proteotranscriptomic landscape by providing evidence that stability-constrained mRNA-to-protein correlation follows a hierarchical pattern that remains conserved across different tissues and mammalian species. By analyzing the tumor and non-tumor tissues, we further illustrated that mRNA-to-protein correlations deviate in tumor tissues. By gene-centric analysis, we harnessed the hierarchical correlation patterns to identify altered mRNA-to-protein correlation in tumors and characterized the tumor correlation-enhancing and -repressing genes. We elucidated the transcriptional regulatory circuits controlling the correlation-enhancing and -repressing genes that are associated with metabolic reprogramming and cancer-associated pathways in tumor tissue. By tightly controlling the mRNA-to-protein correlation of specific genes, the transcriptional regulatory circuits may enable the tumor cells to evolve in varying tumor microenvironment. The mRNA-to-protein correlation analysis thus can serve as a unique approach to identify the pathways prioritized by the tumor cells at different clinical stages. The component of transcriptional regulatory circuits identified by the current study can serve as potential candidates for stage-dependent anticancer therapy.","We thank Dr. Marcel Schilling (German Cancer Research Center, DKFZ, Heidelberg), Dr. Lorenz Adlung (Weizmann Institute of Sciences, Rehovot, Israel), and Dr. Rajib Chakravorty (Faculty of Science, University of Sydney) for their advice and fruitful discussion.",Funding.

280,pub.1124816357,10.1155/2020/5248509,,,Characterization of Filamentous Flocs to Predict Sedimentation Parameters Using Image Analysis,"In wastewater treatment plants, the degradation of complex substances that contaminate water is carried out by microorganisms, which are fixed by a network formed by filamentous bacteria, creating large flocs that settle easily. However, the excessive growth of said bacteria causes a series of drawbacks such as the reduction of settling velocity, leakage of activated sludge with the effluent, and formation of supernatant, a phenomenon known as bulking. This research work seeks to develop and evaluate a procedure for the physical characterization of the flocs to determine the parameters that affect the settling velocity and thereby detect and control bulking. For this purpose, sedimentation and image analysis tests were carried out from wastewater from the Aguas Antofagasta treatment plant (Chile). The image analysis was performed with images captured from an optical microscope in two magnifications (100x and 50x), which were analyzed by marking each floc individually and characterized by an image processing software. Additionally, sedimentation tests were performed on columns (area of 74 (cm
                    2
                    ) and height of 70 (cm)). As a result, an inversely proportional dependence was found on the settling velocity evaluated by the Vesilind equation in the zone of constant fall velocity with respect to the number of flocs connected per cluster, giving an estimate of the settling velocity depending on the number of flocs connected. This would allow predicting settling velocity with image analysis, taking into account that the problem of bulking is determined by the type of filamentous bacteria that causes it and the sedimentation process is affected in large part by local factors. It can be concluded through this study that as the number of flocs connected per cluster increases, the settling velocity decreases. This study provides wastewater treatment plants with a practical tool to determine sedimentation times and thus improve the quality of the treated water, avoiding problems of flocs leaking with the effluent. In addition, the image analysis itself allows rapid detection of the phenomenon of bulking and its severity.",The authors wish to acknowledge the material support provided by the Aguas Antofagasta and the financial support provided by Universidad Católica del Norte and to the student Mariano Molina for his contribution with his chemical engineer thesis.,,Journal of Sensors,,,,2020-02-11,2020,,2020-02-11,2020,,1-8,All OA; Gold,Article,"Molina, M.

Lirima, our study site, is a polyextreme, high-altitude, hydrothermal ecosystem located in the Chilean Andean highlands. Herein, we analyze the benthic communities of three nearby springs in a gradient of temperature (42-72 °C represented by stations P42, P53, and P72) and pH, and we characterize their microbial diversity by using bacteria 16S rRNA (V4) gene metabarcoding and 16S rRNA gene clone libraries (bacteria and archaea). Bacterial clone libraries of P42 and P53 springs showed that the community composition was mainly represented by phototrophic bacteria (Chlorobia, 3%, Cyanobacteria 3%, at P42; Chlorobia 5%, and Chloroflexi 5% at P53), Firmicutes (32% at P42 and 43% at P53) and Gammaproteobacteria (13% at P42 and 29% at P53). Furthermore, bacterial communities that were analyzed by 16S rRNA gene metabarcoding were characterized by an overall predominance of Chloroflexi in springs with lower temperatures (33% at P42), followed by Firmicutes in hotter springs (50% at P72). The archaeal diversity of P42 and P53 were represented by taxa belonging to Crenarchaeota, Diapherotrites, Nanoarchaeota, Hadesarchaeota, Thaumarchaeota, and Euryarchaeota. The microbial diversity of the Lirima hydrothermal system is represented by groups from deep branches of the tree of life, suggesting this ecosystem as a reservoir of primitive life and a key system to study the processes that shaped the evolution of the biosphere.","We thank Valeria Souza, Valerie de Anda, Gabriel Ponce and Mirna Vázquez from UNAM (Mexico), for their invaluable help in metadata analysis.

238,pub.1129570982,10.1111/jfpp.14769,,,Automation of a Mattson Bean Cooker: A simple and a low‐cost approach,"This work aimed to automate the most popular method to determine the cooking time of grains: the Mattson Bean Cooker apparatus. The proposed system is a low‐cost and a simple approach, offering the possibility of calibration according to the size of the analyzed grains. The automation is based on the use of magnets, Hall effect sensors, potentiometers, and an operational amplifier to monitor the plungers' positions. The time required for each grain to be cooked is shown in a LCD display, and the connection among all the components is made by an ATmega328 microcontroller from the Arduino UNO R3 board. The proposed system can be assembled in an already existent device, costing ~US$200. Its validation was made with two different grains: carioca beans (Phaseolus vulgaris) and lentils (Lens culinaris). Despite the differences between sizes, both grains were suitably analyzed with the developed system. Cooking quality is an important property of beans, and evaluation of cooking kinetics is important for beans subjected to agronomic/genetic improvement and to processing using different techniques. In fact, the Mattson Bean Cooker can be used to determine the cooking kinetics of different grains. However, its use requires a constant observer, making the task tedious. Therefore, the present work reports an easy and low‐cost approach to automate the Mattson Bean Cooker device, automatically obtaining the cooking time of grains, which can be used for industrial or academic applications.","ACKNOWLEDGMENTS The authors are grateful to the São Paulo Research Foundation (FAPESP, Brazil) for funding project no. 2016/18052‐5 and the V.

In the current work, a mathematical model of a two-dimensional impact with three degrees of freedom (3DOF) is developed. The model was used to study wedge sections with knuckles, the vertical, horizontal, and rotational motion are considered. Pressure distribution, forces, and motion during the impact, considering both free fall and forced motion, are evaluated. The commercial CFD (Computational flow dynamics) software Star-CCM+ V9.06 was used to validate the formulation. Simulations with one, two, and three degrees of freedom were carried out, and the results were compared with CFD simulations, experimental data, and numerical solutions by others authors. The results show a good agreement with the authors. The model is extended to three dimensions applying slender body theory, and the forces in the hull are computed.

A Luenberger-Indicator approach,"Background: In Colombia, public policy has encouraged hospital efficiency and sustainability since 1993, when its health system underwent a profound change with the Law 100. Method: We estimate the efficiency and productivity of Colombian public hospitals using the Luenberger productivity indicator. This less restrictive indicator allows for a disaggregated regional analysis and does not overestimate the change in productivity when compared to other measures. It was made an empirical application to a sample of 260 hospitals during the 2004-2015 period. Results: The results show a productivity decline for Colombian public hospitals, explained mainly by the decrease in technological change as a result of low investment in technology. In fact, one out of every eighty-seven hospitals reached an improvement in efficiency and technological change simultaneously, while, one out of every two experienced the opposite. On average, hospitals in all regions showed a productivity decrease, in particular those in the Eastern region, an area that accounted, with the Central region, three-fifths of the overall decline. Discussion and conclusion: The efficiency and productivity that was sought to be achieved through the profound change in the health system were insufficient. Thus, governmental measures should: encourage managers to modernize their administrative and organizational factors, promote the development of technology and research in health by greater investments, and foster complementary and non-competitive relationships among hospitals.",,,Gerencia y Políticas de Salud,,,,2020-10-02,2020,2020-10-02,,19,,1-23,All OA; Gold,Article,"Orozco Gallo, Antonio José; Almanza Ramírez, Camilo","Orozco Gallo, Antonio José (); Almanza Ramírez, Camilo ()",,"Orozco Gallo, Antonio José (); Almanza Ramírez, Camilo ()",2,1,,0.88,https://revistas.javeriana.edu.co/index.php/gerepolsal/article/download/27315/24716,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1143221400,38 Economics; 3801 Applied Economics,

In this paper, we present a solution for integrating hardware-based public key cryptography into Converse.js, an open-source IM client for browsers enabled with the Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP). The proposal is developed as a plugin for Converse.js, thus overriding the original functions of the client; and a browser extension that is triggered by the plugin and is responsible for calling the encryption and decryption services for each sent and received message. This integrated artifact allowed the experimental validation of the proposal providing authenticity of IM users with digital certificates and protection of IM messages with hardware-based cryptography.

                    The aim is to determine the impact of HIIT in the neuromuscular and cardiorespiratory fitness of the elderly.
                  
                  
                    Methods:
                    Thirty-two elderly volunteers, 71.0 ± 2.1 years, were randomly divided into two groups, control (CG) (n = 16), that did not participate in any interventions, and experimental (EG) (n = 16) that participated in a 12-week exercise program based on HIIT 3 times a week, and 40 minutes by a meeting. Both groups were subjected before and after the intervention period to neuromuscular and cardiorespiratory testing, and monthly were clinically evaluated by a Physician.
                  
                  
                    Results:
                    
                      No orthopaedic events were reported to both groups, and the CG showed no enhancement to all variables. The EG, muscular endurance of the upper limbs was enhanced (
                      p
                      <0.0001), as was muscular endurance of the lower limbs (
                      p
                      <0.0001), localized muscular endurance of abdominal muscles (
                      p
                      <0.0001), lower limb muscle power (
                      p
                      <0.0001) and aerobic power (
                      p
                      <0.0001). There were no adverse events during or after the intervention period.
                    
                  
                  
                    Conclusion:

In particular, we investigate the flow of a glycerin–air mixture moving through a horizontal pipeline with a U-section installed midway along the pipe. Different combinations of liquid and air mass flow rates are experimentally tested. Then, we examine the moments of the statistical distributions obtained from the resulting pressure time series, in order to highlight the significant dynamical traits of the flow. Finally, we propose a novel correlation with two dimensionless parameters: the Euler number and a mass-flow-rate ratio to predict the pressure gradient in high-viscosity two-phase flow. Distinctive variations of the pressure gradients are observed in each section of the pipeline, which suggest that the local flow dynamics must not be disregarded in favor of global considerations.","The authors would like to acknowledge the support from Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México (UNAM), Universidad del Norte, Scholarship Contract Identification Number: UN-OJ-2017-38125 and Minciencias (Colciencias) through Convocatoria No. 727 de 2015.",This research received no external funding.,Journal of Marine Science and Engineering,,,,2020-12-08,2020,2020-12-08,,8,12,1000,All OA; Gold,Article,"Torres, Lizeth; Noguera, José; Guzmán-Vázquez, José Enrique; Hernández, Jonathan; Sanjuan, Marco; Palacio-Pérez, Arturo","Torres, Lizeth (Instituto de Ingeniería, Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México, Mexico City 04510, Mexico;, ftorreso@iingen.unam.mx, (L.T.);, JHernandezGa@iingen.unam.mx, (J.H.);, APalacioP@iingen.unam.mx, (A.P.-P.)); Noguera, José (Departamento de Mecánica, Facultad de Ingeniería, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla 081007, Colombia;, jfnoguera@uninorte.edu.co, (J.N.);, msanjuan@uninorte.edu.co, (M.S.)); Guzmán-Vázquez, José Enrique (Instituto de Ingeniería, Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México, Mexico City 04510, Mexico;, ftorreso@iingen.unam.mx, (L.T.);, JHernandezGa@iingen.unam.mx, (J.H.);, APalacioP@iingen.unam.mx, (A.P.-P.)); Hernández, Jonathan (Instituto de Ingeniería, Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México, Mexico City 04510, Mexico;, ftorreso@iingen.unam.mx, (L.T.);, JHernandezGa@iingen.unam.mx, (J.H.);, APalacioP@iingen.unam.mx, (A.P.-P.)); Sanjuan, Marco (Departamento de Mecánica, Facultad de Ingeniería, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla 081007, Colombia;, jfnoguera@uninorte.edu.co, (J.N.);, msanjuan@uninorte.edu.co, (M.S.)); Palacio-Pérez, Arturo (Instituto de Ingeniería, Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México, Mexico City 04510, Mexico;, ftorreso@iingen.unam.mx, (L.T.);, JHernandezGa@iingen.unam.mx, (J.H.);, APalacioP@iingen.unam.mx, (A.P.-P.))","Guzmán-Vázquez, José Enrique (National Autonomous University of Mexico; Instituto de Ingeniería, Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México, Mexico City 04510, Mexico;, ftorreso@iingen.unam.mx, (L.T.);, JHernandezGa@iingen.unam.mx, (J.H.);, APalacioP@iingen.unam.mx, (A.P.-P.))","Torres, Lizeth (National Autonomous University of Mexico; Instituto de Ingeniería, Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México, Mexico City 04510, Mexico;, ftorreso@iingen.unam.mx, (L.T.);, JHernandezGa@iingen.unam.mx, (J.H.);, APalacioP@iingen.unam.mx, (A.P.-P.)); Noguera, José (Universidad del Norte; Departamento de Mecánica, Facultad de Ingeniería, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla 081007, Colombia;, jfnoguera@uninorte.edu.co, (J.N.);, msanjuan@uninorte.edu.co, (M.S.)); Guzmán-Vázquez, José Enrique (National Autonomous University of Mexico; Instituto de Ingeniería, Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México, Mexico City 04510, Mexico;, ftorreso@iingen.unam.mx, (L.T.);, JHernandezGa@iingen.unam.mx, (J.H.);, APalacioP@iingen.unam.mx, (A.P.-P.)); Hernández, Jonathan (National Autonomous University of Mexico; Instituto de Ingeniería, Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México, Mexico City 04510, Mexico;, ftorreso@iingen.unam.mx, (L.T.);, JHernandezGa@iingen.unam.mx, (J.H.);, APalacioP@iingen.unam.mx, (A.P.-P.)); Sanjuan, Marco (Universidad del Norte; Departamento de Mecánica, Facultad de Ingeniería, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla 081007, Colombia;, jfnoguera@uninorte.edu.co, (J.N.);, msanjuan@uninorte.edu.co, (M.S.)); Palacio-Pérez, Arturo (National Autonomous University of Mexico; Instituto de Ingeniería, Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México, Mexico City 04510, Mexico;, ftorreso@iingen.unam.mx, (L.T.);, JHernandezGa@iingen.unam.mx, (J.H.);, APalacioP@iingen.unam.mx, (A.P.-P.))",4,2,,0.82,https://www.mdpi.com/2077-1312/8/12/1000/pdf?version=1607653616,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1133354126,40 Engineering; 4012 Fluid Mechanics and Thermal Engineering,

For that, this study was based on the main theories of restorative justice and resilience, joining them through the secondary theories of support and social bond. The methodological nature of this research was qualitative, with an exploratory character, using the semi-structured interview with persons deprived of liberty in the now-closed Topo Chico Prevention and Social Reintegration Center, in the city of Monterrey as a data collection instrument.",,,Estudios de derecho,,,,2020-12-15,2020,2020-12-15,,78,171,,All OA; Gold,Article,"Maíllo, Rafael Cantizani","Maíllo, Rafael Cantizani (Universidad Autónoma de Nuevo León)",,"Maíllo, Rafael Cantizani (Universidad Autónoma de Nuevo León)",1,0,,0.8,https://revistas.udea.edu.co/index.php/red/article/download/343074/20804877,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1136619139,44 Human Society; 4402 Criminology; 48 Law and Legal Studies; 4805 Legal Systems,11 Sustainable Cities and Communities

The underreported diagnosis of this clinical entity has been widely highlighted due to multiple factors, such as, among others, ignorance by the primary care practitioner consulted for this condition as well as clinical similarity to secondary gastroenteric symptoms and common food poisonings of bacterial, parasitic or viral etiology. Eventually, it was found that people affected by ciguatoxins had trips to coastal areas hours before the onset of symptoms. Thanks to multiple studies over the years, it has been possible to identify the relation between toxigenic dinoflagellates and seagrasses, as well as its incorporation into the food chain, starting by fish primarily inhabiting reef ecosystems and culminating in the intake of these by humans. Identifying the epidemiological link, its cardinal symptoms and affected systems, such as gastrointestinal, the peripheral nervous system and, fortunately with a low frequency, the cardiovascular system, leads to a purely clinical diagnostic impression without necessitating further complementary studies; in addition, what would also help fight ciguatera poisoning is performing an adequate treatment of the symptoms right from the start, without underestimating or overlooking any associated complications.","Simón Bolívar University and Ministery of Science, Technology, and Innovation of Colombia for facilitating the resources for article publication.","We declare that the funds or sources of support received in this specific internal report study were from Simón Bolívar University, Barranquilla, Colombia and that the external funding was from the Ministry of Science, Technology, and Innovation of Colombia, subsidy 125380763038 and 125380763188.

In decoding tasks, on the contrary, brain responses are used to predict the stimuli, and traditionally, the signals are assumed stationary within trials, which is rarely the case for natural stimuli. We hypothesize that a decoding model assuming each experimental trial as a realization of a random process more likely reflects the statistical properties of the undergoing process compared to the assumption of stationarity. Here, we propose a Coherence-based spectro-spatial filter that allows for reconstructing stimulus features from brain signal’s features. The proposed method extracts common patterns between features of the brain signals and the stimuli that produced them. These patterns, originating from different recording electrodes are combined, forming a spatial filter that produces a unified prediction of the presented stimulus. This approach takes into account frequency, phase, and spatial distribution of brain features, hence avoiding the need to predefine specific frequency bands of interest or phase relationships between stimulus and brain responses manually. Furthermore, the model does not require the tuning of hyper-parameters, reducing significantly the computational load attached to it. Using three different cognitive tasks (motor movements, speech perception, and speech production), we show that the proposed method consistently improves stimulus feature predictions in terms of correlation (group averages of 0.74 for motor movements, 0.84 for speech perception, and 0.74 for speech production) in comparison with other methods based on regularized multivariate regression, probabilistic graphical models and artificial neural networks. Furthermore, the model parameters revealed those anatomical regions and spectral components that were discriminant in the different cognitive tasks. This novel method does not only provide a useful tool to address fundamental neuroscience questions, but could also be applied to neuroprosthetics.","This work was performed thanks for the Swiss National Funds project grant to ALG 320030_163040, and to the EU FET-BrainCom project and NINDS R3723115.

METHODS: We conducted a comprehensive qualitative study with a hermeneutical strategy, which gathered information using well-researched questions that were posed to focus groups consisting of 32 participants. These participants were asked for opinions related to multimedia elements to display educational messages about physical activity and healthy eating in a mobile application. There were three analysis categories of multimedia elements: text, visual elements, and audio elements.
RESULTS: The majority of the participants, 93.75%, were in the low socioeconomic stratum; 68.75% are in a civil union with their partner; 53.12% completed or failed to complete secondary school, and 68.75% were housewives. Based on the qualitative results, we found that mobile applications become mediating tools that support the adoption of actions that tend to improve lifestyles and increase knowledge about proper nutrition and physical activity. Text messages used in mobile applications should promote healthy habits and remind users of their benefits. Images and videos should be accompanied by text and audio to provide greater clarity regarding recommendations of healthy habits.
CONCLUSIONS: Technology must provide accessibility and coverage opportunities, while meeting the needs and expectations of users. It should facilitate primary health intervention through education to transform unhealthy behaviors and generate lifestyles that improve the health of the user and their family context.","The authors thank all the women who are part of the New Life Generation Program; the field work team of Fundación Vida Nueva, for their contribution regarding the collection of information.

Similarly, the food transition during migration has been related to a high consumption of foods high in refined sugars and saturated fats. There are specific characteristics of the eating behavior that may influence quality in the migrant population's diet. Objective: to compare feeding behavior between the Colombian and Chilean populations residing in the north and center of Chile. Method: the structured interview E-TONA, focused on assessing the behavioral components of daily and anomalous eating habits, was administered to 1,872 individuals, both Chileans and Colombians. Descriptive analyses of frequency distribution and logistic regressions were performed, and odds ratios were calculated. Results: there are significant differences in the majority of eating behaviors, both daily and anomalous, between Chileans and Colombian migrants. Chileans tend to follow more regular schedules and ""snack"" more between meals than migrants. Migrants have twice the risk of eating alone because they feel ashamed of their eating amount and speed, tend to show fewer behaviors related to better quality in their diet, and tend to be less worried about their diet than Chileans; however, Chileans are almost twice as likely to binge on food and use food as a method to calm anxiety. Conclusion: there are significant differences in most of the evaluated eating behaviors that must be addressed in depth considering cultural differences.",,,Nutrición Hospitalaria,,,"Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Chile; Colombia; Cross-Sectional Studies; Diet; Emigrants and Immigrants; Feeding Behavior; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Young Adult",2020,2020,,2020,37,4,823-829,All OA; Gold,Article,"Hun Gamboa, Nelson; Urzúa Morales, Alfonso; López-Espinoza, Antonio","Hun Gamboa, Nelson (Escuela de Psicología.

The actual distribution feeder was built under the Universidad del Norte strategic energy area as a laboratory; therefore, the scaling and generator-load modules where carried out given the particular conditions of the university. This project becomes an actual test bench to fully explore strategies to many needs that exists today such as: energy efficiency, increased use of renewable energy, reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, increased safety of the supply and minimization of electrical losses. The main result of the present work is to defined the amount of solar energy that can be injected to a conventional power system, so that it can keep operation under a regulatory frame even under island operation, which allows to possibility to become a solution for lack of power from the network operator and/or explore schemes of distributed generation.",,,,"2018 15th International Conference on Electrical Engineering, Computing Science and Automatic Control (CCE)",,,2018-01-07,2018,,2018-01-07,00,,1-6,Closed,Proceeding,"De la Hoz, Paula; Jimenez, Elvin; Oliveros, Ingrid; Silva, Andrea; Castillo-Sierra, Rafael; Pardo, Mauricio","De la Hoz, Paula (Electric and Electronic Dept., Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); Jimenez, Elvin (Electric and Electronic Dept., Instituto Tecnológico de Santo Domingo, Republica Domincana); Oliveros, Ingrid (Electric and Electronic Dept., Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); Silva, Andrea (Electric and Electronic Dept., Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); Castillo-Sierra, Rafael (Electric and Electronic Dept., Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); Pardo, Mauricio (Electric and Electronic Dept., Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia)","De la Hoz, Paula (Universidad del Norte)","De la Hoz, Paula (Universidad del Norte); Jimenez, Elvin (Electric and Electronic Dept., Instituto Tecnológico de Santo Domingo, Republica Domincana); Oliveros, Ingrid (Universidad del Norte); Silva, Andrea (Universidad del Norte); Castillo-Sierra, Rafael (Universidad del Norte); Pardo, Mauricio (Universidad del Norte)",4,1,,0.9,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1109928228,"40 Engineering; 4008 Electrical Engineering; 4009 Electronics, Sensors and Digital Hardware",13 Climate Action; 7 Affordable and Clean Energy

Developable Architectural Surfaces in Experimental Pavilions,"We will analyze how the incorporation of digital manufacturing in our schools is motivating a deep reflection about the need to be familiar with both the foundations of geometry as well as with more advanced knowledge. The reinterpretation of our inherited graphic design discipline in light of current digital tools can open up new fields of study and work, such as is occurring in the field of developable surfaces, warped surfaces and many others. In addition, through non-linear graphic processes and digital tools of parametric design, we can arrive at an “expanded graphic thinking” that we can place at the service of production and morphological research. Thus, the old descriptive geometry—geometry based on graphics—comes to serve a cybernetically enlarged mind. We will present four experimental pavilions resulting from several workshops on geometry and digital manufacturing carried out in collaboration between the University of Seville and several Ibero-American Universities. Based on the deep geometric knowledge of developable helical surfaces and surfaces of equal slope, a guided exercise is proposed to approach the design, manufacturing and assembly phases of these architectural installations on a real scale.","THE BUTTERFLY GALLERY: Design and project: Andrés Martín-Pastor, Juan Expósito Bejarano; Academic coordination: María Angela Dias.

For example, a project team may be located in the US while the team lead resides in Sweden. How then should students be trained for this kind of work? Senior design or capstone projects offer students real-world hands-on experience but rarely while working internationally. One reason is that most instructors do not have international business contacts that allow them to find project sponsors in other countries. Another reason is the fear of having to invest a huge amount of time managing an international project. In this paper we present the general concepts related to ""International Capstone Project Exchanges"", the basic model behind the exchanges (student teams are led by an industry sponsor residing in a different country) and several alternate models that have been used in practice. We will give examples from projects in the US, Germany, Sweden, Australia, and Colombia. We have extended the model beyond software projects to include engineering projects as well as marketing, and journalism. We conclude with a description of an International Capstone Project Exchange website that we have developed to aid any university in establishing their own international project exchange.",,,,Proceedings of the 13th International Conference on Global Software Engineering,,,2018-05-27,2018,2018-05-27,2018-05-27,,,54-58,Closed,Proceeding,"Knudson, Dean; Kalafatis, Stavros; Kleiner, Carsten; Zahos, Stephen; Seegebarth, Barbara; Detterfelt, Jonas; Avazpour, Iman; Sandahl, Kristian; Gorder, Peter; Ginige, Jeewani Anupama; Radermacher, Alex; Caballero, Hugo; Gomez, Humberto; Roos, Mikael","Knudson, Dean (North Dakota State University); Kalafatis, Stavros (Texas A&M University); Kleiner, Carsten (Hannover University of Applied Sciences & Arts, Hannover, Germany); Zahos, Stephen (University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign); Seegebarth, Barbara (Technische Universität Braunschweig, Braunschweig, Germany); Detterfelt, Jonas (Linkoping University, Linkoping, Sweden); Avazpour, Iman (Deakin University, Burwood, Australia); Sandahl, Kristian (Linkoping University, Linkoping, Sweden); Gorder, Peter (Univ. of Colorado); Ginige, Jeewani Anupama (Western Sydney Univ., Australia); Radermacher, Alex (North Dakota State University); Caballero, Hugo (Universidad del Norte, Colombia, Barranquilla, Colombia); Gomez, Humberto (Universidad del Norte, Colombia, Barranquilla, Colombia); Roos, Mikael (Blekinge Institute of Technology (BTH), Karlskrona, Sweden)",,"Knudson, Dean (North Dakota State University); Kalafatis, Stavros (Texas A&M University System); Kleiner, Carsten (Hochschule Hannover); Zahos, Stephen (University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign); Seegebarth, Barbara (Technische Universität Braunschweig); Detterfelt, Jonas (Linköping University); Avazpour, Iman (Deakin University); Sandahl, Kristian (Linköping University); Gorder, Peter (Univ. of Colorado); Ginige, Jeewani Anupama (Western Sydney University); Radermacher, Alex (North Dakota State University); Caballero, Hugo (Universidad del Norte); Gomez, Humberto (Universidad del Norte); Roos, Mikael (Blekinge Institute of Technology)",6,2,,2.03,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1105723461,46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4612 Software Engineering,

Nevertheless, this literary construction is reproduced, interpreted and ‘re-construed’ discursively, in a socio-political-philosophical context, as Olympian religion (linked to the central demos of the polis), and as mystery religions (in peripheral dēmoi). Inasmuch as the ancient Greek religion has not generally been treated in an interdisciplinary way (in a socio-political context, for example), this paper aims to show an intimate and reciprocal influence between myth and politics based mainly on Attic synoecism, and how, through the propaganda needs of democracy, there arise mythifications of politics and ideologization of myth. These concerns are articulated in the following working hypothesis supported by the information from historical, epigraphic, and literary sources: the influence of Greek politics on the writing, reading and re-writing of the myths, from which the ritual practices of the mystery religions developed, and how these, in turn, served to confront and resolve, discursively and ‘liturgically’ (using grammars of exclusion/inclusion) the multiple challenges of the democratic politics of the central demos in the face of the economic and psychosocial needs of the peripheral dēmoi.",,,,Proceedings of the XXIII World Congress of Philosophy,,,2018,2018,2018,,61,,205-214,Closed,Chapter,"Casadiego, Yidy Paez","Casadiego, Yidy Paez ()",,"Casadiego, Yidy Paez ()",0,0,,0.0,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1105082083,"43 History, Heritage and Archaeology; 4303 Historical Studies; 47 Language, Communication and Culture; 4705 Literary Studies",

The development process followed for this work can be divided into 5 stages. During the first stage, suitable DICOM images are selected from a CT scan machine. In the second stage, the images are pre-processed in order to reduce noise levels and enhance relevant features. The third stage compares the performance of three image segmentation methods on the pre-processed images: Region growing, Otsu's algorithm and active contours. It was found that active contours achieves the best isolation of the Region of Interest (ROI), while the other two methods recognized morphological structures outside of the ROI. In the four stage, a 3D image of the ROI is renderized. Finally, the reconstructed 3D model is visualized in stage five using a custombuilt Graphical User Interface (GUI).

We propose a method that generates an approximate multicast routing graph, in which the scheme of simultaneous transmission and reception of packets using Network Coding can be checked. The proposal is based on the maximum flow algorithm, developed by Edmonds-Karp, which determines the individual maximum flow graph for each sourcesink pair. A debugging is carried out to determine the minimum flow between the set of individual solutions, and then the resulting graphs are mixed to establish the minimum common flow graph of a single session multicast routing system. A Network Coding scheme has a solution over the multicast graph, if and only if, the packets sent simultaneously from the source node can be recovered from a system of linear combinations that enter the sink nodes.",J.

Student performance in the course was good, but engagement during the class was perceived to be very low. As a result, the professor decided to change the course and used three different methods: evidence-centered assessment design, project based learning and experiential learning. At the end of the semester, students took a NSSE (National Survey of Student Engagement) survey [1]. Results show student engagement in different activities performed during the class, favoring a mixed-methods class over a traditional one.

This article presents the parallel implementation, using a graphical processing unit (GPU), of a Sequential Monte Carlo Method, which is a sophisticated model estimation technique based on simulations, also known as Particle Filter. The particle filter is applied to the localization of a simulated Ackerman mobile robot with a simplified kinematic model. The inputs for the model are the linear displacement of the car and the steering angle, subject to additive white Gaussian noise disturbances. The car model integrates a simulated GPS and a compass which also present Gaussian noise. The program was designed using a client/server architecture, considering that the energy constraints of embedded systems used in mobile robotics favor the separation of the tasks of visualization and localization. The client is a web program responsible for the task of visualization, developed in HTML5 using JS and AJAX, and the server implements the particle filter algorithm using the libraries CUDA and Thrust, improving considerably the performance time of the particle filter. The performance is approximately 9 times faster in GPU over CPU in the tested architecture. This opens the possibility to embed this type in simulations in real-time systems.",This work was supported by Universidad de Bogotá Jorge Tadeo Lozano and Universidad del Norte. D.

However, it has been previously shown that not only engineering students have deficiencies in these aspects, but also, evaluating these aspects is of great difficulty. For this reason, this research focuses on the application of a methodology to assess the coherence and cohesion of texts written by engineering students of several semesters in careers such as computer systems, electrical and electronics engineering. To do this, an evaluation instrument was created; this instrument allows measuring the performance on these aspects to be measured in an isolated manner in order to clearly identify the difficulties that students have when writing texts. Results show that, although several students manage to present good written documents, there are also many problems in aspects such as the connection of the text, the handling of exophoric and endophoric references, and providing enough information to argue.","This work was funded in part by Center of Teaching Excellence (CEDU), Universidad del Norte and by Universidad Nacional de Colombia, Sede Medellín.",,,2018 IEEE Global Engineering Education Conference (EDUCON),,,2018-04-01,2018,,2018-04-01,,,156-160,Closed,Proceeding,"Candelo, John E.; Soto, José D.; Torres, Luis; Schettini, Norelli; Calle, María; García, Lucy; de Castro, Adela","Candelo, John E.

For this purpose, it was designed and constructed experimental set up with a prototype of flat plate solar collector with phase change material containers located under the absorber plate. Experimental tests were performed under outdoor conditions with and without phase change material, from 7:00 am to 7:00 pm. Temperatures of the ambient, absorber plate, water outlet, water inlet and PCM are compared with the behavior of solar radiation for 3 different cases. It was observed that using PCM reduce the fluctuation in water outlet temperature and absorber plate temperature due to solar radiation reduction, in fact, temperature variations were 55 % and 49.8 % lower compared with test without PCM, respectively. In order to compare results under different solar radiation conditions with and without PCM, conclusions were obtained by comparing these temperatures in proportion to the reduction of solar radiation.",,,,2018 2nd International Conference on Green Energy and Applications (ICGEA),,,2018-05-08,2018,2018-05-08,,,,83-87,Closed,Proceeding,"Palacio, Mario; Carmona, Mauricio","Palacio, Mario (Faculty of Mechanical Engineering Universidad Pontificia Bolivariana Montería, Colombia); Carmona, Mauricio (Department of Mechanical Engineering Universidad del Norte Barranquilla, Colombia)",,"Palacio, Mario (Faculty of Mechanical Engineering Universidad Pontificia Bolivariana Montería, Colombia); Carmona, Mauricio (Universidad del Norte)",8,0,,1.68,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1103965654,"40 Engineering; 4009 Electronics, Sensors and Digital Hardware",

The incidence of this sector in the national and regional economy has led to the completion of various investigations, to learn about their behavior and detect opportunities for improvement. In this regard, previous studies carried out by entities in Colombia such as the Universidad del Norte [1], corroborated the growth potential of the sector; but one of its most relevant weaknesses was also identified in the quality factor and, at the same time, it was proposed as the main strategy for making decisions associated with productivity and competitiveness. Given this precedent, an analysis of the state of the art in this area was made, and it was found that there is not enough information on the current situation of quality management in the plastics processing and production industry in the Colombian Caribbean Region. Faced with this problem, a study was conducted to visualize the behavior of companies belonging to the plastics sector regarding quality management, identifying and analyzing the most significant needs for the approach of joint strategies to improve the sector.",,,Communications in Computer and Information Science,HCI International 2018 – Posters' Extended Abstracts,Constantine Stephanidis,,2018-06-07,2018,2018-06-07,2018,852,,273-281,Closed,Chapter,"Jimenez, Genett; Hernandez, Leonel; Hernandez, Hugo; Cabas, Luis; Ferreira, Jenny","Jimenez, Genett (Department of Industrial Processes Engineering, Engineering Faculty, Institución Universitaria ITSA, Barranquilla, Colombia; Department of Telematic Engineering, Engineering Faculty, Institución Universitaria ITSA, Barranquilla, Colombia); Hernandez, Leonel (Department of Industrial Processes Engineering, Engineering Faculty, Institución Universitaria ITSA, Barranquilla, Colombia; Department of Telematic Engineering, Engineering Faculty, Institución Universitaria ITSA, Barranquilla, Colombia); Hernandez, Hugo (Department of Business Administration, Universidad del Atlántico, Barranquilla, Colombia); Cabas, Luis (Engineering Faculty, Systems Engineering Program, Corporación Universitaria Latinoamericana CUL, Barranquilla, Colombia; Economic Sciences Faculty, Financial Management Program, Corporación Universitaria Latinoamericana CUL, Barranquilla, Colombia); Ferreira, Jenny (Engineering Faculty, Systems Engineering Program, Corporación Universitaria Latinoamericana CUL, Barranquilla, Colombia; Economic Sciences Faculty, Financial Management Program, Corporación Universitaria Latinoamericana CUL, Barranquilla, Colombia)","Jimenez, Genett (Department of Industrial Processes Engineering, Engineering Faculty, Institución Universitaria ITSA, Barranquilla, Colombia; Department of Telematic Engineering, Engineering Faculty, Institución Universitaria ITSA, Barranquilla, Colombia)","Jimenez, Genett (Department of Industrial Processes Engineering, Engineering Faculty, Institución Universitaria ITSA, Barranquilla, Colombia; Department of Telematic Engineering, Engineering Faculty, Institución Universitaria ITSA, Barranquilla, Colombia); Hernandez, Leonel (Department of Industrial Processes Engineering, Engineering Faculty, Institución Universitaria ITSA, Barranquilla, Colombia; Department of Telematic Engineering, Engineering Faculty, Institución Universitaria ITSA, Barranquilla, Colombia); Hernandez, Hugo (University of Atlántico); Cabas, Luis (Corporación Universitaria Latinoamericana; Corporación Universitaria Latinoamericana); Ferreira, Jenny (Corporación Universitaria Latinoamericana; Corporación Universitaria Latinoamericana)",7,0,,2.45,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1104438146,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3507 Strategy, Management and Organisational Behaviour",8 Decent Work and Economic Growth

As in any ensemble based method, the moments of background error distributions are approximated by means of an ensemble of model realizations. The precision background covariance is estimated via a modified Cholesky decomposition in order to decrease the impact of sampling errors. Once all hyper-parameters are estimated, samples from the posterior distribution are estimated via a Markov-Chain-Monte-Carlo (MCMC) method. The MCMC implementation is enhanced by means of linear approximations of the observation operator. Posterior ensembles are then built by using a series of rank-one updates over prior Cholesky factors. Experimental tests are carried out by using the Lorenz 96 model. The numerical results evidence that, as the degree of the observational operator increases, the accuracy of the proposed filter is not affected and even more, for full observational networks, posterior errors are much lower than those of backgrounds, in some cases, by several order of magnitudes.",,,,2018 7th International Conference on Computers Communications and Control (ICCCC),,,2018-05-01,2018,,2018-05-01,,,29-36,Closed,Proceeding,"Nino-Ruiz, Elias D.; Mancilla-Herrera, Alfonso M.; Beltran-Arrieta, Rolando","Nino-Ruiz, Elias D.

1833,pub.1106015647,10.1117/12.2322614,,,Estimation of sea state parameters using X-band marine radar technology in coastal areas,"X-Band marine radars have been broadly used as a coastal remote sensing tool since they are able to scan the roughness of sea surface with high spatial and temporal resolution. However, radar estimates are strongly affected by shadowing effects at extreme grazing incidence angles, mainly when the radar antenna is deployed below 50 m above the mean sea level (MSL). The present study presents a novel methodology based on filtering and interpolation techniques in order to improve the estimation accuracy of sea state parameters in coastal areas. The method differs from previous approaches since it employs enhancement techniques using intensities data beam by beam of the sea clutter image and considering extreme grazing incident angles from electromagnetic signal instead of offshore empirical MTF correction and calibration with in situ sensors. A FURUNO FR-8252 X-Band marine radar was deployed in Salgar (Colombia) at about 20 meters above the mean sea level to test the performance of the proposed methodology. Validation was performed with in situ data from a Nortek AWAC (Acoustic Wave and Current) sensor located at 1.4 km away from the radar antenna. Results show that the significant wave height was retrieved with 0.6% error (about -1.21 cm) and the estimation errors of the peak period and the peak wave direction were below to 0.75 seconds and 4, respectively. The wave frequency spectra derived from radar estimates, AWAC record and JONSWAP spectrum are presented to illustrate the improvement resulting from the proposed methodology over frequency domain.",,,Proceedings of SPIE--the International Society for Optical Engineering,Sixth International Conference on Remote Sensing and Geoinformation of the Environment (RSCy2018),"Kyriacos Themistocleous, Diofantos G.

Not only is a change of model required in the way we use and access these resources, but to incorporate technology in the search for greater efficiency and impact in health care. The Internet of Things (IoT) promises to be the ideal element to catalyze these purposes, providing an easier, faster and more constant interaction to people who seek welfare and quality of care. This paper presents first a review of the different IoT applications oriented to the health monitoring, but only focused in applications protocols for devices with restricted capacities. Second, this research identifies common components in the review and proposes the main units needed in an IoT health architecture based on interoperability.

The implications of the aforementioned arise on the difficulties associated with the aqueous processing of graphene sheets: from large-scale production to its utilization in solvent-assisted techniques like spin coating or layer-by-layer deposition. To overcome this, aqueous dispersions of graphene were stabilized by cellulose nanocrystals colloids. Aqueous cellulose nanocrystals dispersion highlights as a low-cost and environmentally friendly stabilizer towards graphene large-scale processing. Colloids of cellulose nanocrystals are formed by electrostatic repulsion of fibrils due to de-protonated carboxyl or sulfate half-ester functional groups. Graphene dispersions are obtained by hydrothermal reduction of electrochemically exfoliated graphene oxide in the presence of cellulose nanocrystals. This approach allows the preservation of the intrinsic properties of the nano-sheets by promoting non-covalent interactions between cellulose and graphene. The dispersions could be cast to form free-standing flexible conducting films or freeze-dried to form foams and aerogels for capacitive energy storage.Copyright © 2018 by ASME",,,,Volume 12: Materials: Genetics to Structures,,,2018-11-09,2018,2019-01-15,2018-11-09,,,v012t11a041-v012t11a041,Closed,Proceeding,"Illera, Danny; Wickramaratne, Chatura; Guillen, Diego; Jotshi, Chand; Gomez, Humberto; Goswami, D.

Toward this goal, we propose a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) that is able to automatically discover and assign sequences of activities that are most discriminative for an observed construction operation. To do so, the algorithm leverages dense trajectory features from a detected dynamic resource (e.g., excavator) in a video. Using these dense trajectory features, we train a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) to estimate the probability density function of each activity with multiple one-versus-all support vector machine classifiers. The proposed HMM also models duration of each activity, and the transition between activities (e.g., “swing bucket loaded” after “load bucket” for earth-moving activities of an excavator). As a proof-of-concept, we train and test our HMM+GMM model on an unprecedented dataset of 10 real-world long video sequences of interacting pairs of excavators and dumptrucks. Our preliminary experimental results on long-sequence activity recognition in presence of noise, occlusions, and scene clutter demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.",,,,Construction Research Congress 2018,,,2018-03-29,2018,2018-03-29,2018-03-29,,,164-173,Closed,Proceeding,"Roberts, Dominic; Golparvar-Fard, Mani; Niebles, Juan Carlos; Gwak, JunYoung; Bao, Ruxiao","Roberts, Dominic (Graduate Student, Dept. of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Univ. of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, 205 N Mathews Ave., Urbana, IL 61801.

The air-fuel flow in the admission line has an appreciable inertia due to the turbocharged operation, but the intake manifold, the admission valves and the throttle act as an obstruction for the air-natural gas. Considering everything considered before, this paper proposes a model for the volumetric efficiency on the 2MW Jenbacher Gas Engine, which is the capacity of the engine to fill the available geometric volume of the engine with a new charge of the air-fuel mix. A thermodynamic model was introduced to study the ratio between the real volume of air drawn off the cylinder, concerning the theoretical geometric volume of the cylinder based on a typical day of operation of the thermal power plant. Finally, to show the impact of the volumetric efficiency on the model results, a regression as a function of the intake manifold temperature and pressure, the volumetric gas flow and the engine revolutions was proposed. This allows to estimate the engine volumetric efficiency with a quadratic accumulated error ranging from 5.65 (when the volumetric efficiency model depends only on the air-gas mixture pressure) to 1.94 (when the model was correlated as a function of the pressure and temperature of the inlet manifold, motor angular speed, and the volumetric natural gas flow). The study gives evidence about a successful simulation of a Natural Gas Engine thermodynamic model built in Matlab due to the similarity found between the simulated results and the experimental data obtained fromt the data acquisition software installed on the equipment, obtaining in most cases a good accuracy to predict the effective efficiency and the electric power under different operation conditions.",,,Computer Aided Chemical Engineering,28th European Symposium on Computer Aided Process Engineering,,,2018,2018,,2018,43,,259-264,Closed,Chapter,"Valencia, Guillermo E.; Consuegra, Franklin E.; Osorio, Marisol","Valencia, Guillermo E.

However, patients are probably one of the actors that, despite being the main actor to be protected by regulations, have the least access to its information and control over what, who, when, how and why other actors in the healthcare system are doing with their information, especially in cases where just the existence of some tests may reveal an illness or a condition that should remain private. There is existing work and regulations on defining user-centered access control to the data, but the options are usually focused on defining policies on who has access to the information. This work introduces an incremental data access options in order to increase privacy over the data by considering the possibility of offering slightly altered or obfuscated data as an option to protect the original information, revealing just enough to enable the desired services.

Indeed, the small inertia of the isolated microgrids with the integration of variable generation is a challenge faced in the operation of these electricity supply systems. One way to tackle these problems is through demand response programs. In this perspective, this paper first presents a bibliographical review of the importance of the provision of frequency control services by the demand-side and some international experiences related, and later it is present a case of study, in which we assess the effects of high penetration levels of variable generation, specifically solar PV generation, in the power balance of the microgrid, and we evaluate some proposed demand response mechanisms, focused on the active participation of residential users, that respond to variations of the system’s frequency, showing that residential demand response has the potential to reduce the frequency variations that occur during the day, while increasing the use of renewable generation sources immersed in the microgrid.","The research for this paper was supported by Universidad Nacional de Colombia through the research department of Manizales – DIMA as part of the project “Evaluación del impacto de la remuneración de la generación distribuida y la demanda por la prestación de servicios de soporte técnico en el sistema de distribución eléctrico colombiano”, code 39039, developed by Environmental Energy and Education Policy – E3P research group.",,Communications in Computer and Information Science,Applied Computer Sciences in Engineering,"Juan Carlos Figueroa-García, Eduyn Ramiro López-Santana, José Ignacio Rodriguez-Molano",,2018-09-13,2018,2018-09-13,2018,915,,535-547,Closed,Chapter,"López-García, Dahiana; Arango-Manrique, Adriana; Carvajal-Quintero, Sandra X.","López-García, Dahiana (Faculty of Engineering and Architecture, Department of Electrical, Electronic and Computer Engineering, Research Group Environmental Energy and Education Policy – E3P, Universidad Nacional de Colombia, Manizales, Colombia); Arango-Manrique, Adriana (Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Grupo de Investigación en Sistemas Eléctricos de Potencia - GISEL, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); Carvajal-Quintero, Sandra X.

In this chapter, we present and explore socio-historical landmarks that have given rise to the origin and development of bioarchaeological research in Chile. Furthermore, we discuss the controversies concerning the study of human remains and point out the new directions currently being developed within the field of bioarchaeology across the country.We conclude that after a century of research involving human remains in Chile, academic and methodological approaches have undergone important developments in the context of the 20th century's national project, contemporary research streams, and the acknowledgement of multiculturalism. It is mostly during the last three decades that the field of bioarchaeology has expanded and diversified, as consequence of its professionalization and an expansion of the contract archaeology sector. However, whilst methodological developments have made great strides in different areas of bioarchaeological research, theoretical developments have been comparatively slower and have not yet shown an explicit and critical stance according to contemporary social circumstances.","The authors thank Prof. Eugenio Aspillaga, Dr. Silvia Quevedo, Dr. Verónica Silva, Prof. Felipe Martínez, and Prof. Pedro Andrade for their help in obtaining the information presented in the article.

Elaborating national policies about SC requires measuring cities' success in ICT adoption. This article describes the Smart City ICT Adoption Maturity Model (SCIAMM), which defines five maturity levels, and consists of five domains (e-government strategy, public innovation, data, infrastructure, and services), 15 key domain areas (KDA), and 48 critical variables (CV). An initial evaluation was conducted, using public data from the IT Ministry (MinICT) for the seven largest Colombian cities. A comparison of 2015 and 2016 values shows the simultaneous improvement some areas (Public Wi-Fi and Open Data) and worsening of some strategy-related areas (Governance, IT plans, and IT Operation); further examination suggests that it may reflect reprioritization of attention and resources as cities aimed to exploit new national programs on Public Wi-Fi and Open Data.

However, in the case of developing the capabilities needed to implement innovation, we have found that the ability to integrate knowledge into the supply chain is also crucial since it is an essential requirement for bringing in technological change and product innovation. The purpose of this chapter is to understand the role of supplier integration in the implementation of radical innovation. First, we propose a theoretical model to connect supplier integration as a dynamic capability to ordinary routines. Second, we study the connection between supplier integration and radical innovation through a case study in an innovative firm in the organic agro-food industry. Our analysis reveals that Herbes del Moli, the case under study, would be unable to survive and develop without the integration of the knowledge generated in the company and its painstaking and ongoing partnership with its suppliers to assimilate this knowledge throughout its supply chain. This discussion is relevant in management literature as it involves applying the dynamic capabilities approach to supply chain integration in order to understand the limitations and demands of radical innovation.","This research is part of the Project ECO2015-71380-R funded by the Spanish Ministry of Economy, Industry and Competitiveness and the State Research Agency.

The last part is devoted to the eschatological myth which is also split in three parts. The descent in the Hades needs to be read together with two other platonic myths that tell about the soul destiny: Gorgias and the Republic. In such triadic conception, Damascius is in debt with Proclus who was the first in evidencing the imbrications in these three dialogues.According to Damascius, the purpose of the myth is to assign tén choristén diagogén after the souls are separated from the body thus acquiring a certain way of life embodied as the highest, intermediate or lowest perfection.Thus, this paper puts foward the hypothesis that the myth is revealed as a way of living present in the term “diagogé” in which a religious sense is hidden. That sense implies considering philosophy like an initiation in the mysteries. That will demand taking into account the reflections carried out by Damascius when he analyses the “argument of the affinity of the soul with the Ideas” of the Platonic dialogue and his consideration of the philosopher as the happiest man that has been completely identified with Dionysos.",,,,Proceedings of the XXIII World Congress of Philosophy,,,2018,2018,2018,,2,4,37-41,Closed,Chapter,"Nieva, José María","Nieva, José María ()",,"Nieva, José María ()",0,0,,0.0,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1104501836,50 Philosophy and Religious Studies; 5002 History and Philosophy Of Specific Fields; 5004 Religious Studies,

Therefore, the removal of pesticides from the environment, or their transformation into less toxic compounds is a topic of research interest worldwide. This chapter discusses the potential of actinobacteria, mainly those belonging to the Streptomyces genus, to remove the isomers of hexachlorocyclohexane under different physicochemical conditions. Furthermore, the optimal pH and temperature conditions for the removal of hexachlorocyclohexane by regional Streptomyces strain (Streptomyces sp. M7) are presented. This chapter also reports the ability of this actinobacterium to remove a mixture composed of α-, β- and γ-HCH (lindane), which is important considering that multiple isomers are normally present in contaminated sites. This chapter highlights the ability of actinobacteria to remove α-, β-, and γ-HCH isomers from liquid and soil systems, under a diverse set of physicochemical conditions and postulates actinobacteria as potential agents to bioremediate environments contaminated with organochlorine pesticides.

In recent decades, organizational legitimacy has received a great deal of attention from researchers who have tried to establish how organizations acquire, manage, and use it. However, there is still no conceptual agreement on how organizational legitimacy should be understood and how it can be measured. This reflects the complexity in the literature about understanding this phenomenon and suggests research opportunities. This chapter aims to strengthen the understanding of the role legitimacy plays in organizations by reviewing the related literature and analyzing the relationship between legitimacy and trust. Our findings suggest that there is a positive relationship between these two concepts. Moreover, we conclude that legitimacy can be achieved in two different ways: the first via trust and the second via control. In the first instance, we found a double-loop relationship between legitimacy and trust, generating a feed-forward relationship, given that both of these concepts mutually reinforce each other. In the second instance, there is a single-loop relationship because legitimacy based on control improves stakeholders’ trust in the organization. However, there is no reciprocal impact given that the legalistic remedies used are, in fact, the substitutes of trust.","This research is part of the Project ECO2015-71380-R funded by the Spanish Ministry of Economy, Industry and Competitiveness and the State Research Agency, co-financed by the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF).",,,Organizational Legitimacy,"Emilio Díez-De-Castro, Marta Peris-Ortiz",,2018-05-15,2018,2018-05-15,2018,,,283-299,Closed,Chapter,"Moreno-Luzon, Maria D.; Chams-Anturi, Odette; Escorcia-Caballero, Juan P.","Moreno-Luzon, Maria D.

Therefore it is essential for these institutions to reach the highest levels of efficiency and excellence in company processes and structures and to achieve planned corporate goals and objectives. In this work an extensive and thorough review of the current literature was carried out in relation to the concept, in order to analyse the latest trends in Corporate Universities. A comparative evaluation with traditional university aspects was performed, identifying their own differentiators, for example the impact on social innovation, the development of sustainable competitive advantages, the influence on the company’s internal environment, the importance of cultural and technological factors, and the relationship with the organizations strategy, which are important factors in its successful development and interconnection within the company processes. The information obtained from the aforementioned literature review, in combination with the experience gained by the team of consultants and researchers at the PRIME Business School, Sergio Arboleda University, Bogota, Colombia, allowed to present proposed in general terms a new implementation model of Corporate University. This new model is based on five distinct phases, and with minor adaptations could be to any sector in an organization. The study shows that through this Corporate University model, an organization could gain differentiators to increase social innovation, in time gain sustainable competitive advantages, and a desirable alignment with the objectives and strategic goals of the organization.",,,,Strategies and Best Practices in Social Innovation,"Marta Peris-Ortiz, Jaime Alonso Gómez, Patricia Marquez",,2018-06-01,2018,2018-06-01,2018,,,153-169,Closed,Chapter,"Alonso-Gonzalez, Antonio; Peris-Ortiz, Marta; Palacios Chacon, Lorena A.","Alonso-Gonzalez, Antonio (EIAM—PRIME Business School, Universidad Sergio Arboleda, Bogotá, Colombia); Peris-Ortiz, Marta (Departamento de Organización de Empresas, Universitat Politècnica de Valencia, Valencia, Spain); Palacios Chacon, Lorena A.

This led to the creation of manifold location privacy protection mechanisms (LPPMs) in the scientific community. The authors propose the use of geospatial analyses as an evaluation tool of the impact of noise-based algorithms on location data. For this, the Pinwheel mechanism is tested, using different noise settings, to identify a threshold where privacy is provided, and geostatistical inferences are not affected greatly. Results show that 500 m of random noise introduce a small level of change that does not change the general trend in both heatmap and hotspot analysis but still can provide a minimum level of protection to individuals.",Acknowledgements to the Sustain-T Project (Technologies for Sustainable Development) by Erasmus Mundus partnership for supporting the author and encouraging international cooperation in research.,,Complex Networks and Dynamic Systems,Transportation Analytics in the Era of Big Data,"Satish V.

The analysis is performed on reduced scale centrifuge models of soil deposits. The models were instrumented with dense arrays of accelerometers and pore pressure transducers in order to capture the soil response under seismic excitation. Shear stresses and shear strains are estimated based on the recorded accelerations. A multi-yield surface constitutive model is used to infer the shear-volume behavior of the soil based on the acceleration and pore pressure response. The analysis offers insight into the coupled two-directional response of soil deposits.,,,,Geotechnical Earthquake Engineering and Soil Dynamics V,,,2018-06-07,2018,2018-06-07,2018-06-07,,,48-56,Closed,Proceeding,"Mercado, Vicente; Zeghal, Mourad; El-Shafee, Omar","Mercado, Vicente (Univ. del Norte, Dept. of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Barranquilla, Colombia, .

This odious mixture needs critique and reform. For while its structural inequalities and destructive impact are widely recognized, many analysts and people in power continue to perpetuate a sunny mythology of the benefits of tourism. These connections derive from decades of imagery sexualizing young women to attract visitors as part of nation-branding; the role of the United States in particular in the Colombian imaginary as a desired source of men and money; and Washington’s public diplomacy and military interventions in the region.

In recent years, the process of recovering this site and restoring it for tourist use has represented a major challenge, both economically and socially. The current situation in the country, resulting from new Cuban government policies, has led to great interest in developing public and private initiatives that enhance tourism in this area. This chapter presents Old Havana as a case study and addresses the economic and social impact that the tourism management carried out by the Office of the Historian of the City of Havana (OHCH) has had on its residents. The chapter opens by introducing historic centres and impacts of tourism, especially in Latin America. It then goes on to introduce the special features of tourism in Cuba. Next, it addresses the social impact on the Cuban population of the tourism policy implemented in the early 1990s, which focused on promoting international tourism at the expense of domestic tourism. It also describes the scenario that resulted from creating designated tourist areas, isolated from the Cuban population, which prevented visitor exchange with residents and cultural enrichment. Next, it discusses the tourism management model developed by the OHCH, which constitutes an outstanding example of sustainable tourism management practice. The chapter closes by presenting a series of final considerations regarding the future of tourism in Cuba, based on the current context.",,,Applying Quality of Life Research,Best Practices in Hospitality and Tourism Marketing and Management,"Ana María Campón-Cerro, José Manuel Hernández-Mogollón, José Antonio Folgado-Fernández",,2018-07-31,2018,2018-07-31,2019,,,353-369,Closed,Chapter,"Pérez Guilarte, Yamilé; Lois González, Rubén Camilo","Pérez Guilarte, Yamilé (University Institute for Studies and Development of Galicia, University of Santiago de Compostela, Santiago de Compostela, Spain); Lois González, Rubén Camilo (Faculty of Geography and History, University of Santiago de Compostela, Santiago de Compostela, Spain)","Pérez Guilarte, Yamilé (University of Santiago de Compostela)","Pérez Guilarte, Yamilé (University of Santiago de Compostela); Lois González, Rubén Camilo (University of Santiago de Compostela)",0,0,,0.0,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1105912881,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3504 Commercial Services; 3506 Marketing; 3508 Tourism; 44 Human Society; 4406 Human Geography",

For this reason, a timely cancer diagnosis is required in order to receive the adequate treatment, e.g., radiotherapy, chemotherapy, and surgery, or combination thereof, which are the most frequent therapeutical alternatives. If the cancer is detected and treated early, it has a high cure rate. Based on the statistical data recorded up to 2014, ca. 14 million of people were diagnosed, ca. 8 million of them died, and it is expected to increase ca. 19 million of people diagnosed for 2024. The cancers that produced the most deaths were lung cancer, liver cancer, colorectal cancer, stomach cancer, and breast cancer; it is very important to emphasize that cancer mortality is higher in men than in women (1.4 men/1 woman).",,,,Ethnobotany,"José L.

Therefore, many challenges have appeared in cities all over the world related to growth, overpopulation, urban planning, quality of services, competitiveness, environmental factors and citizenship values, which have become main priorities of the managers and mayors of these cities. The Smart City concept emerges as a paradigm that aims to solve these problems and challenges, by developing policies, infrastructure, services and public awareness programs that will transform today cities, for example a future self-sustaining innovation, growth, technological development, civic and ethical citizenship and social progress. This study presents an exploratory analysis in respect of the current global situation related to the concept of Smart City, comparing the different essential definitions and dimensions described in recent literature by cited authors and related to the nomenclature of the term. The effects, challenges and opportunities that Smart Cities can offer to their citizens, has been presented, for example in different programs, projects and initiatives, that cities all over the world have implemented, focusing on sustainable social innovations, economic growth, environmental protection, quality of life, participatory governance, social and community development, citizenship education, efficient urban mobility, tourism services, health and safety. The situation in Bogota and Medellin, the two main cities of Colombia have been reviewed and studied in this work, the aspects previously mentioned have been taken into account to establish a new definition of the Smart City concept. To perform this task, a set of six dimensions and 27 subcategories are essential to define and measure this concept in the Colombian paradigm, which can be used to monitor the current status, in order to approximate evaluations of Colombian cities to the qualification concept described as the Smart City. Due to the lack of studies observed in this work, further research must be focused, not only on getting more data from Bogota and Medellin, but also having the opportunity to observe the situation in other important cities such as Barranquilla, Cali, Bucaramanga or Cartagena, currently no data is available.",,,,Strategies and Best Practices in Social Innovation,"Marta Peris-Ortiz, Jaime Alonso Gómez, Patricia Marquez",,2018-06-01,2018,2018-06-01,2018,,,65-87,Closed,Chapter,"Alonso-Gonzalez, Antonio; Palacios Chacon, Lorena A.; Peris-Ortiz, Marta","Alonso-Gonzalez, Antonio (EIAM—PRIME Business School, Universidad Sergio Arboleda, Bogotá, Colombia); Palacios Chacon, Lorena A.

Also, this new model possesses equilibriums according to the physiological behavior, i.e. i) without insulin, the glycemia raises indefinitely, ii) with basal insulin, the glycemia is maintained at its actual value (it does not go to the basal levels, as it is stated by the standard models), and iii) with a carbohydrate input, the glycemia raises and remains at a high value if no insulin is administered. For the identification stage, different structures of the model are analyzed with different identification algorithms in order to select the best structure and algorithm (which minimizes the fit error). A set of data collected during 3 days from real and virtual patients (from the UVA/Padova simulator) was used to identify the model. The fit obtained was 20% y 70% for real and virtual patients, respectively. The conclusions of this study are i) the proposed model even its simplicity can be used to represent diabetic patients and ii) this promotes its potential application to the so-called artificial pancreas in the design of control strategies, as model predictive control.",,,,2017 IEEE 3rd Colombian Conference on Automatic Control (CCAC),,,2018-02-01,2018,2018-02-01,,,,1-6,Closed,Proceeding,"Colorado, Luisa F.; Godoy, Jose L.; Rivadeneira, Pablo S.","Colorado, Luisa F.

Paraguay’s border with Brazil and Argentina and the musical genres practiced at the intersection of these three countries in South America illustrate this dynamic. Through local musical practices, the musical connections between Paraguay, Argentina, and Brazil created interconnected territories that reveal a common identity – Alma Guarani (Guarani Soul) – that connects its inhabitants around musical genres, such as Argentine’s chamamé and Brazilian’s rasqueado, which are symbolic systems, historically and socially constructed from the settings of guarânia and Paraguayan polka. This chapter explores how border conditions impact local musicking and build territorialities that are, at the same time, integrated. Paraguay's border with Brazil and Argentina and the musical genres practiced at the intersection of these three countries in South America illustrate this dynamic. Across musical genres, the alma guarani is associated with the Paraguayan polka and guarania in Paraguay and with the chamame and guarania in northeastern Argentina. The Paraguayan polka is a music genre of rural origin that was detected in Paraguay in the second half of the 19th century. It is very difficult to distinguish a chamame from a Paraguayan polka or a guarania. These three genres have very similar musical characteristics and are all imbued with the spirit of the alma guarani.

Through these documents, it is possible to discover a slave society set within a frontier or even liminal social topography that reveals the multitude of possible dynamics created within the structures of such a heterogeneous community. We discover that much as the Spaniards and their Creole offspring may have sought to maintain the boundaries of what they envisioned as an ideal caste system, institutions such as the navy, the military and the church were forced to incorporate Africans and their descendants for various reasons. Free people of color (pardos libres) as well as the enslaved were agile in their appropriation of those narrow fissures in the rigid racial system that was the theoretical standard. From early on, Africans, Europeans, indigenous peoples and their descendants created a type of tropical Babylon in Cartagena, developing distinct geographical spaces along the coast and in the city and port that can be mapped out ethnically and culturally. Using a series of unusual parish books that record the sacraments performed by naval chaplains, that are in the Cartagena de Indias Cathedral, this chapter examines the intimate relations between various individuals and ethnic groups in the port city. Investigation into the demographic, naval, military and public health contexts of such phenomena as listed in these parish books draws into the bustling concourse of a port city characterized as the Key to the Indies. Cartagena de Indias has long been recognized as a crucial place in the developing historiography of New Granada's populations of African origin since it was the main port of entry for the enslaved forcibly transported to South America. Within Colombia itself though, the port city has been predominantly studied for its economic, commercial and military historical trajectory by nineteenth- and early twentieth-century historians, rather than for its cultural geography and the variety of ethnic influences that shaped it.","The author is very grateful to Father Tulio Aristizábal, SJ for his warm welcome to Cartagena and his constant willingness to share his expertise and friendship with me.

Merging both techniques shall provide a more robust monitoring structure to address the proper identification of normal and abnormal conditions, to improve the extraction of fundamental correlation among variables, and to improve the separation of both main variation and natural variation (noise) subspaces. This additional feature is key to limit the false alarm rate and to optimize the fault detection time when it is implemented on industrial applications. This paper presents an analysis to determine whether a segmentation approach, as a previous step of detection, enhances the fault detection strategies, specifically the principal component analysis performance. The data segmentation criteria assessed in this study includes two approaches: a) Sources (well) of the transmitted natural gas and b) Promigas’ natural gas pipeline division defined by the Energy and Gas Regulation Commission (CREG in Spanish). The performance assessment of segmentation criteria was carried out evaluating the false alarm rate and detection time when the natural gas transmission network presents faults of different magnitude. The results show that the implementation of a segmentation criteria provides an advantage in terms of the detection time, but it depends of the fault magnitude and the number of clusters. The detection time is improved by 25% in the case scenario I, when transition zones are considered. On the other hand, the detection time is slightly better with less than 10% in the case scenario II, where the segmentation is geographical.Copyright © 2018 by ASME",,,,Volume 2: Heat Exchanger Technologies; Plant Performance; Thermal Hydraulics and Computational Fluid Dynamics; Water Management for Power Systems; Student Competition,,,2018-06-24,2018,2018-10-04,2018-06-24,,,v002t09a011-v002t09a011,Closed,Proceeding,"Audivet, Cinthia; Pinzón, Horacio; García, Jesus; Consuegra, Marlon; Alexander, Javier; Sanjuán, Marco","Audivet, Cinthia (Promigas S.A.

In practice-based learning processes, children learn about this living nature of material things, as they make miniature pots and small weavings. By “following the materials” (sensu Ingold), in similar praxis-based approaches, archaeologists now suggest that ancient pottery from the Peruvian North coast (Moche) and Northwest Argentina is not matter solidified, but an expression of fluid social, political, and cosmic relations. And in Chavín stonework, they perceive material form fluid with images that inspired visiting pilgrims to perceive human–animal and plant relations from a shamanic perspective. This recent academic rethinking of material culture abandons former epistemological approaches for ontological ones, in which a return to animism, and sensitivity to perspectivist viewpoints and transformational experiences are proving more useful.",,,,The Andean World,"Linda J.

Human-based activities generate diverse waste types that have to be treated and disposed differently. This results in the need to build more facilities to manage the waste and to avoid further environmental damage. Colombia established a successful policy to close open dumps and to control pollution. Notwithstanding the advances that have been made in final disposal, it is necessary to extend the life of the final disposal sites and increase the closure of open landfills. Valle del Cauca is the third most populated Colombian province, and it is also considered the third province that generates more waste. This chapter addresses the problem of locating solid waste disposal centers in Valle del Cauca by applying the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) with fuzzy logic, a multicriteria method that compares opinions of a decision-making group. Additionally, each potential location area is characterized by considering industrial and environmental issues, societal dynamics, infrastructure and topography, costs, and taxes. After applying a variant of AHP, the decision-making group was able to find that Jamundi is the best location to open the disposal center. The method shows strong potential to identify and prioritize alternative locations for a diverse group of stakeholders. Most importantly, the methodology lets us structure better qualitative and quantitative data, as well as to link multiple levels to avoid choosing locations that will affect society, environment, and other stakeholders, without considering the trade-offs among diverse criteria considering benefits, opportunities, costs, and risks (BOCR).",,,,Supply Chain Management and Logistics in Latin America,"Hugo T.

A cross-sectional, comparative survey was made of 231 (77 cases and 154 controls) Mexican workers affiliated with the Mexican Institute of Social Security. Demographic data, workplace, and the section of the Nordic Questionnaire corresponding to back problems were collected. The cases demonstrated that the disorder had presented itself at a young age and in most of them, the LBP was intermittent and chronic. The lumbar symptoms had developed over a long period of time up to 20 years, including accumulated periods of disability totaling up to 5 years. The prevalence of pain in these cases was 83% (64). The occupations which presented the greatest differences in distribution between cases and controls were those of workers handling merchandise and materials, drivers, and members of the nursing profession. Scholarship and salary were protective factors (odds ratio (OR) = 0.17, IC95% 0.03–0.09, and OR 0.36, IC95% 0.1–0.8). Low back pain is a problem with serious repercussions in Mexico at personal and socioeconomic levels. The results suggest that the higher education and socioeconomic level a person has, the low the probability will be of developing lumbar spondyloarthrosis. Occupations which implicitly include heavy lifting and fixed sitting with vibration were those which demonstrated the most relevant difference between the two groups.",,,,Best Practices in Manufacturing Processes,"Jorge Luis García Alcaraz, Leonardo Rivera Cadavid, Rosa Guadalupe González-Ramírez, George Leal Jamil, Mario Gustavo Chong Chong",,2018-09-19,2018,2018-09-19,2019,,,487-503,Closed,Chapter,"Prado-León, Lilia Roselia; Rosales-Cinco, Rosa Amelia","Prado-León, Lilia Roselia (University of Guadalajara, Calzada Independencia Norte no. 5075.

To achieve this, we have approached the syntactic analysis of the site following an “archaeotectonic” approach, which encompasses both the formal analysis of buildings, construction forms and techniques, as well as the models of circulatory routes, and visibility conditions. The study of the built structures allowed us to identify a model of organization of monuments and ritual spaces, which suggests segmentation and social hierarchy within the settlement. Consequently, this research seeks to understand the social construction of the different ritual spaces that constitute Pucará de Turi as a sociocultural context of population interaction during the Late Intermediate Period (AD 900–1450). Finally, this study will enable us to understand and discuss corporate and segmented societies.","I would like to thank the researchers responsible for the project “CONICYT-USA 2013-0012: water management and agro-hydraulic systems in desert environments: the Alto Loa from the year 1000-1500 AD”, Andrés Troncoso, Diego Salazar, César Parcero-Oubiña, Pastor Fábrega-Álvarez and Frances Hayashida.

Traditional media (ruled by one-way communication processes) have failed to promote an open and interactive communication process with different groups of stakeholders. Previous research has also shown that corporate websites have been poorly employed as strategic communication resource for CSR. However, new media (e.g., social media) have changed how people interact and collaborate with each other. For instance, people are empowered through social media to demand more transparency about corporate operations that can impact society and environment. Today more than ever, thanks to the popularization of social platforms, companies must effectively communicate CSR with the purpose of building stakeholder relationships. But are companies ready to engage in CSR communication through new media? In other words are they ready to invest in relationships? This chapter proposes a theoretical framework for CSR online communication (both through corporate websites and social media platforms) based on an extensive theoretical review in the area of CSR and Internet communication. This framework was applied through the implementation of a content analysis to 50 corporate websites of Fortune companies and 50 social media official profiles (Facebook and Twitter) of Fortune companies. Results of this analysis showed that companies were not employing these platforms to promote feedback and interactivity regarding CSR.",,,"Accounting, Finance, Sustainability, Governance & Fraud: Theory and Application",Sustainability and Social Responsibility of Accountability Reporting Systems,"Kıymet Tunca Çalıyurt, Roshima Said",,2018-03-02,2018,2018-03-02,2018,,,197-217,Closed,Chapter,"Gomez, Lina M.","Gomez, Lina M.

It argues that, despite the limited research capacity in these countries, there are interesting initiatives including international collaboration that show promising accomplishments and merit documentation. The chapter discusses demographic, economic, and research and development indicators; science and technology (STI) capacity and outputs; and higher education and STI systems. It reviews international co-authorships and collaboration among scientific journals, presents four cases, and provides recommendations for small countries like Bolivia and Paraguay to develop international collaborations to promote STI.","The author is grateful to Daniel Moreno, founder and director of the think tank Ciudadanía, for conceding an interview; Jill Perry, education professor at the University of Pittsburgh for sharing her contacts and books on Paraguay; Gustavo Gregorutti and Nanette Svenson, editors of this book for their feedback and patience.",,International and Development Education,North-South University Research Partnerships in Latin America and the Caribbean,"Gustavo Gregorutti, Nanette Svenson",,2018-06-07,2018,2018-06-07,2018,,,141-173,Closed,Chapter,"Delgado, Jorge Enrique","Delgado, Jorge Enrique (University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA, USA; Pontificia Universidad Javeriana, Bogota, Colombia)","Delgado, Jorge Enrique (University of Pittsburgh; Pontificia Universidad Javeriana)","Delgado, Jorge Enrique (University of Pittsburgh; Pontificia Universidad Javeriana)",0,0,,0.0,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1104411089,39 Education; 46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4610 Library and Information Studies,

Thus, our aim in this chapter is to examine the participatory health research carried out on chronic noncommunicable diseases in the Latin American countries. We divided the chapter into three sections. The first describes the origins and emergence of participatory research and its variants in the region; the second gives an account of previous literature reviews on participatory health research; and the third is a review of 26 articles that use such research and focuses on chronic conditions. We identified four approaches: participatory action research, action research, community-based participatory research, and participatory research. The community’s participants were chronically sick people and their families as well as health workers and university staff working in the health services. The main aim of the participation was to change health knowledge and behaviors regarding risk factors and chronic conditions, and the nature of participation was passive in the form of consultation. We conclude that participatory action research has been displaced in the reviewed studies, since action research and participatory research have become the most commonly used approaches in the region.",,,,Participatory Health Research,"Michael T.

It begins with the consideration of cities as a complex and dynamic social system - far from equilibrium and open to their environment - that is composed of elements and actors, that is, endogenous resources, both natural as artificial - elaborated by human societies - that put in value the territorial resources. These are related and are part of other territorial systems of higher order (municipal, state, regional), which, in turn, are within a national system connected to the global scale.The incorporation of this analytical perspective to the study of the Metropolitan Area of San Luis Potosí (Mexico), and specifically the relationships between climate change, rainwater management and flood risk, would help to create more viable structures and networks, plastic and flexible, with a greater capacity to adapt and evolve to the turbulences and changes in their environment, and to have more viable, effective and efficient tools, within the framework of urban sustainability. The objective of the document is to generate knowledge to identify problems, elucidate dynamics and present tools that allow a better understanding of the urban systemic environment into the case study.The first part describes the fundamental elements of the approaches of complex systems and resilient cities and culminates with the methodological approach of the investigation and the proposal of an analytical model. The second part shows the application of the theoretical - methodological framework to the case study. A diagnosis and a systemic analysis of the case studied are made. The third section presents a proposal for intervention based on strategic and participatory planning approaches, supported by the scenario building tool, with measures that aim to solve the development and sustainability problems that this metropolitan area presents.",,,Resilient Cities,Urban Resilience for Risk and Adaptation Governance,"Grazia Brunetta, Ombretta Caldarice, Nicola Tollin, Marti Rosas-Casals, Jordi Morató",,2018-08-03,2018,2018-08-03,2019,,,175-206,Closed,Chapter,"Moreno-Mata, Adrián; Villasís-Keever, Ricardo; Morató, Jordi","Moreno-Mata, Adrián (Autonomous University of San Luis Potosí, San Luis Potosí, Mexico); Villasís-Keever, Ricardo (Autonomous University of San Luis Potosí, San Luis Potosí, Mexico); Morató, Jordi (UNESCO Chair of Sustainability, U.P.C, Barcelona, Spain)","Moreno-Mata, Adrián (Autonomous University of San Luis Potosí)","Moreno-Mata, Adrián (Autonomous University of San Luis Potosí); Villasís-Keever, Ricardo (Autonomous University of San Luis Potosí); Morató, Jordi (Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya)",2,0,,0.53,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1105971626,37 Earth Sciences; 44 Human Society; 4406 Human Geography,11 Sustainable Cities and Communities

GEM was established in order to (1) measure the differences regarding the relationship towards entrepreneurship, activities and aspirations of individuals in as many countries as possible, (2) uncover factors that encourage or hinder entrepreneurial activities, especially related to societal values, personal attributes and the entrepreneurship ecosystem, (3) provide a platform for assessing the extent to which entrepreneurial activity influences economic growth within individual economies and (4) uncover policy measures for the purpose of enhancing entrepreneurial capacity in an economy. The research helps to better understand the attitude of the society towards entrepreneurship and individual capabilities, among which are the perception of their own abilities for entrepreneurial activities, the ability to perceive opportunities, entrepreneurial intentions and fear of failure. As GEM monitors entrepreneurial activity throughout the phases of the life cycle (nascent, new businesses and established businesses, discontinuation), according to impact (high growth, innovation, internationalization) and by type (early-stage entrepreneurship activity, employee entrepreneurship activity), the picture is much richer than the one that is based only on data gathered from ordinary statistical databases.",,,,,,,2018-04-17,2018,2018-04-17,2018-04-17,,,,Closed,Monograph,"Rebernik, Miroslav; Širec, Karin; Rebernik, Miroslav; Tominc, Polona; Crnogaj, Katja; Bradač Hojnik, Barbara; Rus, Matej; Širec, Karin","Rebernik, Miroslav (); Širec, Karin (); Rebernik, Miroslav (); Tominc, Polona (); Crnogaj, Katja (); Bradač Hojnik, Barbara (); Rus, Matej (); Širec, Karin ()",,"Rebernik, Miroslav (); Širec, Karin (); Rebernik, Miroslav (); Tominc, Polona (); Crnogaj, Katja (); Bradač Hojnik, Barbara (); Rus, Matej (); Širec, Karin ()",3,0,,1.05,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1108933920,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3507 Strategy, Management and Organisational Behaviour",8 Decent Work and Economic Growth

I therefore hypothetize that the introduction of the concept of valence offers a crucial contribution in order to dismantle the above mentioned identity, thus paving the way for a more fruitful understanding of surprise, namely including cognition, bodily experience, time and language.Such a discussion about the emotional valence-character of surprise therefore requires to open up the fitting epistemological background for it. Instead of a mere body-brain interaction I will suggest the necessity of a more encompassing setting, namely: body-heart-brain, descriptible with the double-face rhythm of surprise, both lived emotional and cardio-vascular: hence the hypothesis of cardiophenomenology as an integrated epistemology including heart into the body-brain circulation: far more than the mere one-sided third person neurological level, the heart both in its physiological and in its lived affective aspects thus represents a unique possibility of intertwinning first person lived affections and third person organic pre-conscious sensations.The hypothesis of cardiophenomenology unfolds the general framework of the inquiry into the dynamics of surprise as including an emotional component while not being an emotion as such.

443,pub.1104325233,10.5840/wcp23201846919,,,The Communication Potential of Corporate Annual Reports of Companies,"According to several philosophers of science, optimism concerning communication in science diminished in the shift from positivism to subjectivist philosophy of science. Communication in accounting is also a problem. In both cases (science and accounting) there is a tension between objectivism and subjectivism. In science one of these approaches seems to prevail in different phases. In accounting there seems to be an oscillation or ambiguity between the two tendencies (subjectivism and objectivism) which remain side by side. As far as the information product of accounting namely corporate annual reports are concerned, a polarity seems to exist as the statutory financial reporting practices that produce statutory disclosures are influenced by objectivism, while the contextual financial reporting practices that produce contextual disclosures are inclined towards subjectivism. Subjectivism and objectivism can be interpreted as emphasizing certain modal aspects to the detriment of others. This is the case also as far as communication in accountancy is concerned. It is suggested that a balanced approach can be reached by paying attention to all the modalities, in particular to those which tend to be neglected under a certain approach (objectivism or subjectivism). In addition, both objectivism and subjectivism tend to focus on what is subjected to the law/norms and to bypass the normative side of each aspect.

One such avenue is visualizing the effect of an incident (say, a fatal crash) on travel time variation, within the vicinity of a crash over time, through the use of a decision support tool (DST). This paper outlines the development and implementation of such a DST, which uses historical travel time and crash data to assess the effect. Travel time variations are computed for each link within a chosen radius (proximal area), by comparing the travel time (at 15-minute intervals) during the selected time period on a day with crash, by severity, and the average travel time for the corresponding link (same time-of-the-day and day-of-the-week). The visual output from the DST can help identify links within the chosen radius to divert traffic due to a crash for incident management and re-routing traffic over time (say, up to 2 hours after the fatal crash), and to assist planners and engineers in their day-to-day activities (mobility and safety improvements at link- or corridor-level). It also assists transportation network users make reliable route, mode, and departure time decisions to avoid delay due to a crash.",This paper is prepared based on information collected for a research project funded by the United States Department of Transportation - Office of the Assistant Secretary for Research and Technology (USDOT/OST-R) under Cooperative Agreement Number RITARS-12-H-UNCC.

The historical context surrounding the incorporation of anthropology into the universities placed limitations on the discipline's clear identity. Both military rule and the transition to democracy challenged the progress that had been finally made through congresses and state funding for research, which increased significantly after 1990. However, anthropology gained notoriety through its main achievements in the study of indigenous peoples and its contribution to the promotion of human and indigenous rights.

Often, the dissatisfaction with the political leaders stems from economic disparities in income and opportunity, political corruption, authoritarian government rule, and a lack of educational opportunity. Notable examples include the Arab Spring that began in 2010 in Tunisia and spread throughout Arab countries and the Occupy Wall Street protest in 2011 in the United States that highlighted economic inequalities around the world. Can protests promulgated by social media and enacted by the young lead to democratic dialogue between political leaders and a country’s youth? The chapter considers this question in the context of the #FeesMustFall protest movement in South Africa. Specifically, the chapter describes the competing narratives offered in the news reporting about the social media-facilitated protests beginning in mid-October 2015 culminating at the end of October when President Jacob Zuma agreed not to raise college fees and including the subsequent protests in reaction to President Zuma’s announcement.",,,Springer International Handbooks of Education,Handbook of Comparative Studies on Community Colleges and Global Counterparts,"Rosalind Latiner Raby, Edward J.

Travel time based performance measures help not only quantify the effect of crashes by severity but also help use the outcomes to better plan and manage the transportation system. These performance measures can be broadly categorized into travel time (minimum or free flow, average, and maximum), travel time percentiles (10th, 15th, 50th, 85th, 90th, and 95th), and travel time reliability indices. However, not all travel time based performance measures are applicable and suitable to assess the effect of crashes by severity. Questions, such as which performance measure should one use to assess the effect of crashes by severity on transportation system performance, and, can travel time based performance measures be used to quantify non-recurring congestion and identify solutions from mobility and safety perspective, have been lingering in the minds of researchers and practitioners. Moreover, the relationship between crashes by severity and travel time based performance measures varies by the time-of-the-day and day-of-the-week. This paper, therefore, focuses on examining the relationship between crashes by severity and travel time, travel time percentiles as well as travel time reliability indices, by time-of-the-day and day-of-the-week, to recommend suitable performance measures to assess their effect. The number of fatal and injury type “A” crashes is most of the times weakly correlated with travel time based measures, with the exception of maximum travel time. The injury type “B” plus injury type “C” crashes are strongly correlated with travel time reliability indices only on Sunday from 4 PM to 5 PM. The trends in correlation with travel time based measures are similar for property damage only (PDO) crashes and the number of total crashes, possibly indicating that frequency effects travel time based measures more than severity of crash.",This paper is prepared based on information collected for a research project funded by the United States Department of Transportation - Office of the Assistant Secretary for Research and Technology (USDOT/OST-R) under Cooperative Agreement Number RITARS-12-H-UNCC.

For this purpose, the measurement instruments that were used to determine the permittivity were a Vector Network Analyzer (VNA) at frequencies from 10 MHz to 3 GHz and a built in-house open-ended coaxial probe. In this work, the permittivity of a hundred and forty apples and eighty purple sweet potatoes were measured. The apple and purple sweet potato dielectric properties were correlated with their physicochemical properties to get to know if the quality parameters can be predicted from the permittivity. According to the data obtained, the correlation of the apples shows better results than the correlation of the purple sweet potatoes. These values mean that it is more likely to predict the physicochemical characteristic of the apple than the purple sweet potatoes.",,,,2018 International Conference on Electromagnetics in Advanced Applications (ICEAA),,,2018-01-14,2018,,2018-01-14,00,,593-596,Closed,Proceeding,"Reyes, A.; Yarlequé, M.; Castro, W.; Chuquizuta, S.","Reyes, A.

Furthermore, in several processes, there are epistemic uncertainties in the evaluation of the performance of unit operations. This epistemic uncertainty is generated due to a lack of knowledge of the behavior of unit operations. This lack of knowledge generates the need to use semi-empirical models, or define some operational conditions a priori based on some approximation. Usually, these empirical models use parameters that are a function of the flowsheet design. Therefore, it is not possible to adjust these models based on experimental data as the experimental conditions are not known at the design stage. This work analyzes the effect of the epistemic uncertainties in the selection of flowsheet structures. Flotation circuit without grinding, flotation circuit with grinding units, and fractional crystallization were considered as case studies. As a result, this paper demonstrated that few structures exist that are optimal for a wide range of values in the performance of the process units. To demonstrate that there are few optimal structures when there is high uncertainty in the process units, two methods of proof were used: proof by construction, and proof by exhaustion.",The author thanks CONICYT for funding through Fondecyt 1171341.,,Computer Aided Chemical Engineering,13th International Symposium on Process Systems Engineering (PSE 2018),,,2018,2018,,2018,44,,199-204,Closed,Chapter,"Gálvez, Edelmira D.; Cisternas, Luis A.; Lucay, Freddy A.; Acosta-Flores, Renato","Gálvez, Edelmira D.

However, the strategies that companies should use to reach high information diffusion are not so clear yet. Previous studies on information diffusion have focused on two issues: the type of message that companies should post for it to have more probabilities to be shared, and the type of consumers who have to engage to reach higher information diffusion. A message repetition is a novel strategy, which we assess using an agent-based simulation model for information diffusion. The model considers that consumers can reach what we term their wear-out point (i.e., where an additional message exposure leads to negative effects) when they read a tweet several times. The results of the model show the number of times a company should send the same tweet before this action has negative effects on consumers.",,,,Proceedings of the 33rd Annual ACM Symposium on Applied Computing,,,2018-04-09,2018,2018-04-09,2018-04-09,,,1828-1830,Closed,Proceeding,"Leger, Paul; Hidalgo-Alcázar, Carmen; López, Manuela","Leger, Paul (Universidad Católica del Norte, Coquimbo, Chile); Hidalgo-Alcázar, Carmen (Universidad Católica del Norte, Coquimbo, Chile); López, Manuela (Universidad de Murcia, Murcia, Spain)",,"Leger, Paul (Catholic University of the North); Hidalgo-Alcázar, Carmen (Catholic University of the North); López, Manuela (University of Murcia)",1,1,,0.26,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1105354225,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3503 Business Systems In Context; 46 Information and Computing Sciences",

Combining technological and social perspectives, the contributors present emerging research on social innovation from different sectors such as entrepreneurship, education and energy. Collectively, the authors demonstrate the ways in which social innovation can drive sustainability and development in regions around the world. All societies are characterized by their political, economic and social institutions, as well as by how they utilize technology. The social innovations with the highest importance are those which modify existing institutions or create new ones, and based on their magnitude, they can be considered as radical or incremental. For example, when Joseph Chamberlain encouraged workers to organize in order to achieve universal male suffrage in Great Britain in 1885, this was a considered a radical innovation for British society, which in turn changed its political framework. Social innovations may be based on intelligence and commitment, on technology or on social entrepreneurship in its most open forms. In addition, social innovations can be classified into those which correspond to an entire country or region, a field (e.g., education) or a sector (e.g., entrepreneurship, technology, social reform). Featuring contributions on topics such as agro-food, smart cities, higher education, gender equality and sports, this book is ideal for academics, students, scholars, professionals and policy makers in the areas of innovation, entrepreneurship, sustainability and regional development.",,,,,"Marta Peris-Ortiz, Jaime Alonso Gómez, Patricia Marquez",,2018,2018,,2018,,,,Closed,Edited Book,,,,,7,2,,2.79,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1104328457,44 Human Society; 4410 Sociology,4 Quality Education

In this vast territory, different peoples produced engravings, paintings and massive earthworks, from the Atacama to the Amazon. These marks on the landscape were made by all different kinds of peoples, from some of the earliest hunter-gatherers in the continent to the very complex societies within the Inca Empire. This book brings together the work of specialists from throughout the continent, addressing this diversity, as well as the variety of approaches that the archaeology of rock art has taken in South America. Constructed of 11 thought-provoking chapters and arranged in three thematic parts, the book presents different theoretical approaches that are currently being used to understand the roles rock art played in prehistoric communities. The editors have skillfully crafted a book that presents the contribution the study of South American rock art can offer to the global research of this materiality, both theoretically and methodologically. This book will interest a broad range of scholars researching in archaeology, anthropology, history of art, heritage and conservation, as well as undergraduate and postgraduate students who will find interesting case studies showcasing the diverse ways in which rock art can be approached. Despite its focus on South America, the book is intended as a contribution towards the global study of rock art.",,,,,"Andrés Troncoso, Felipe Armstrong, George Nash",,2018-02-28,2018,2018-02-28,,,,,Closed,Monograph,,,,,45,16,,34.18,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1104409532,"43 History, Heritage and Archaeology; 4301 Archaeology; 4302 Heritage, Archive and Museum Studies; 4303 Historical Studies",

In addition, technological adoption is considered an important success factor. For this reason, it is relevant to have a broad view of ERP adoption. This study deals with a bibliometric analysis of the last 14 years of research on ERP systems adoption, based on publications from the Web of Science, conducting a statistical analysis going through WOS categories and publication years, passing through a journal relevant analysis and finally a review of the most important literature related to the topic employing a citation analysis approach. These results pursue to find references for future studies in the field of ERP adoption and success in general. We found that the most relevant studies in the field are mainly governed by TAM however, the number of documents associated with the topic poses the need for further research, taking the risk of including different theories used nowadays or hybrid models for adopting ERP or cloud ERP systems.",,,,Proceedings of the 2018 International Conference on Computers in Management and Business,,,2018-05-25,2018,2018-05-25,2018-05-25,,,35-39,Closed,Proceeding,"Valdebenito, Jose; Quelopana, Aldo","Valdebenito, Jose (Department of Computing and Systems Engineering, Universidad Catolica del Norte, Antofagasta, Chile); Quelopana, Aldo (Department of Computing and Systems Engineering, Universidad Catolica del Norte, Antofagasta, Chile)",,"Valdebenito, Jose (Catholic University of the North); Quelopana, Aldo (Catholic University of the North)",5,2,,1.41,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1106090069,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3503 Business Systems In Context; 46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4609 Information Systems",

These converters blast oxygen-enriched air into the matte, thereby eliminating iron and sulfur. The converting reactions are exothermic and, indeed, the converter heat balance is often a limiting consideration on the smelter throughput. If a portion of the matte were fed in solidified (granulated) form, this would support higher oxygen enrichment, and lower volumes of converter offgas, allowing higher throughput. This approach is not applied in conventional smelters, partly because of the copious amounts of water that must be evaporated in typical granulators, as in the Kennecott-Outotec process. The current paper recalls a waterless matte granulator that had been pioneered in the 1990’s, and is applicable to conventional smelters. A mathematical formulation is presented that can be used in the context of simulation-based optimization, to estimate the size and impact of waterless matte granulation.",,,"The Minerals, Metals & Materials Series",Extraction 2018,"Boyd R.

This research work focuses on the study of different models of solution reflected in the literature, which treat the optimization of the routing of vehicles by nodes and the optimal route for the university transport service. With the recent expansion of the facilities of a university institution, the allocation of the routes for the transport of its students, became more complex. As a result, geographic information systems (GIS) tools and operations research methodologies are applied, such as graph theory and vehicular routing problems, to facilitate mobilization and improve the students transport service, as well as optimizing the transfer time and utilization of the available transport units. An optimal route management procedure has been implemented to maximize the level of service of student transport using the K-means clustering algorithm and the method of node contraction hierarchies, with low cost due to the use of free software.",,,Lecture Notes in Computer Science,Hybrid Artificial Intelligent Systems,"Francisco Javier de Cos Juez, José Ramón Villar, Enrique A. de la Cal, Álvaro Herrero, Héctor Quintián, José António Sáez, Emilio Corchado",,2018-06-08,2018,2018-06-08,2018,10870,,95-107,Closed,Chapter,"Herrera-Granda, Israel D.; Lorente-Leyva, Leandro L.; Peluffo-Ordóñez, Diego H.; Valencia-Chapi, Robert M.; Montero-Santos, Yakcleem; Chicaiza-Vaca, Jorge L.; Castro-Ospina, Andrés E.","Herrera-Granda, Israel D.

In addition, in work areas such as education, gamification has spread as a useful strategy for make the classroom more dynamic. On the other hand, in the area of software engineering, the performance and productivity of the work team have been identified as key success factors, with motivation being an essential factor in achieving this success. Therefore, there is an important growth of gamification strategies in the classroom as alternatives to increase the motivation and commitment of the work teams. However, the existing teaching strategies in software engineering omit certain details about how to structure a possible learning environment, such as the classroom. In this work a methodological structure is proposed to gamify an educational environment of software engineering. The objective of this proposal is to contribute to the decrease of causes of failure of software development projects within which is the lack of motivation and commitment as well as social and human factors that affect processes related to software engineering. An example of activities developed in a course of agility for software process improvement of the Universidad de Medellín is presented. The methodological structure proposed was designed using technological tools and web 2.0 tools that managed to accompany the teaching-learning process taking into account defined gamification principles.",,,,2018 13th Iberian Conference on Information Systems and Technologies (CISTI),,,2018-06-28,2018,2018-06-28,,,,1-6,Closed,Proceeding,"Gasca-Hurtado, Gloria Piedad; Gomez, Maria Clara; Zepeda, Vianca Vega","Gasca-Hurtado, Gloria Piedad (Facultad de Ingenier&#x00ED;as, Universidad de Medell&#x00ED;n, UDEM, Medell&#x00ED;n, Colombia); Gomez, Maria Clara (Facultad de Ingenier&#x00ED;as, Universidad de Medell&#x00ED;n, UDEM, Medell&#x00ED;n, Colombia); Zepeda, Vianca Vega (Departamento de Ingenier&#x00ED;a de Sistemas y Computaci&#x00F3;n, Universidad Cat&#x00F3;lica del Norte, UCN, Antofagasta, Chile)",,"Gasca-Hurtado, Gloria Piedad (Facultad de Ingenier&#x00ED;as, Universidad de Medell&#x00ED;n, UDEM, Medell&#x00ED;n, Colombia); Gomez, Maria Clara (Facultad de Ingenier&#x00ED;as, Universidad de Medell&#x00ED;n, UDEM, Medell&#x00ED;n, Colombia); Zepeda, Vianca Vega (Catholic University of the North)",7,1,,2.37,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1105216434,46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4612 Software Engineering,4 Quality Education

PSC cycles produce batches of iron-free sulfide matte (or blister copper, in the case of copper smelters), that are subject to further processing. However, the number of cycles that can be performed simultaneously is limited by the offgas handling system. Moreover, PSC suffers from variation in the yield and duration of the cycles. This variation is managed by conventional smelter designs, in which the upstream smelting capacity exceeds the nominal converting capacity; PSC is thus a major bottleneck in conventional nickel and copper smelters. Stabilization and standardization of PSC operations can therefore increase smelter throughput. The current paper presents a discrete event simulation (DES) framework to assist in smelter debottlenecking. It features random number generation to represent cycle variability, and time-adaptive finite differences to represent thermochemical complexity.

With the availability and more affordability of optical based technologies, the astronomical scientific community, alone or joining forces with other actors, has managed in the last decade to boost the communication capability available to several of the astronomical installations in the northern Chilean region, the Atacama Desert, and to successfully increase the efficiency and effectivity of the existing Observatories and setting the basis for the coming ones. The paper, after providing a short summary of the projects developed to enable better communications and the future initiatives currently foreseen, focuses on the following show‐cases, from users that differ in size and aims, in served communities and in geographical locations: a) the observation of the First Light from Gravitational Wave Source (ESO, ALMA, et Al.); b) the use of virtual presence to bring the observer where things happen (ESO/PARANAL); c) remote operations for robotic installation (OCA); d) Contributing to develop the local environment (REUNA); e) provide the “muscle” for the current and future data challenge (ALMA).

Virtual Communities of Practice (VCoPs) create spaces for collaboration that provide communication and interaction between individuals, so that knowledge and experiences are shared. Collaboration is a significant tool for building knowledge around a domain. In this sense, a significant effort has been expended to discover guidelines that it allows to facilitate the collaboration. A significant aspect of collaboration is the sociability, since it refers to how people interact in an environment. In VCoPs the aspects of sociability and interactivity are significant for achieving the objectives of the collaboration. However, we must consider that people have cultural differences, and it sometimes impose conditions that prevent the access and inclusion of some people in virtual environments of collaboration. Thus, in this work, is proposed a heuristic to evaluate how sociability is treated in VCops, with emphasis on cultural diversity aspects. The proposed heuristic was applied in the evaluation of some VCoPs. The results support the proposal of guidelines for the treatment of cultural diversity, seeking to assist specialists to plan and create environment interfaces that allow to promote sociability effectively and satisfactorily.",,,Lecture Notes in Computer Science,"Cross-Cultural Design.

The conclusion argues that liberation theology as a movement has made a significant contribution to political theology, and that the fact that there are fewer theological works now being written on the subject indicates not a crisis but the primacy of Gutiérrez's challenge: it is a theology that arises out of faith and Christian experience at the level of parishes and basic Christian communities.",,,,The Wiley Blackwell Companion to Political Theology,"William T.

There are concerns among educationist on how e-learning systems can be harnessed to achieve the sustainable development goal (SDG) 4. While technology has enabled online education in various regions of the world, the same cannot be said for African public universities. Part of the problem lies in the lack of application of the Ubuntu philosophy to e-learning systems in higher education. To achieve the aims of this chapter, the author uses a combination of an empirical quantitative research conducted on e-learning in Ghanaian public universities and a literature analysis of the concept of Ubuntu. The study revealed that the teaching and learning culture of Ghanaian public universities encourages the adoption and usage of ICT tools as well as e-learning programs. Yet, the integration of technology into teaching and learning processes has remained largely rudimentary due to reasons such as the lack of e-learning technology, inadequate awareness, and absence of support from the ICT centers in the various public universities. Among other strategies, this chapter proposes the adoption of Ubuntu values as an effective pathway for the acceleration of the extensive use of e-learning technologies for teaching and learning in African public universities.

The knowledge of the tectonic architecture, timing, and the mechanisms of deformation that affected the western slope of the Chilean–Pampean flat-slab subduction segment of the Central Andes in northern Chile are a key to understand the complete evolution of this Andean segment. In Chile, this segment is composed of two tectonic provinces: The Coastal and the Frontal Cordilleras. Traditionally, this broad intracontinental deformation zone that characterized this segment has been compared with the Rocky Mountains, in terms of structural styles and age of deformation, although the complex interaction between extensional Mesozoic structures and different styles of contractional structures suggest that this segment resulted from multiple episodes of deformation. We present the results of a study developed along the Coastal and Frontal Cordillera of northern Chile (27°–28° S), based on regional fieldwork, structural analysis, and geochronological dating of synorogenic deposits. Our results have revealed that the structure of this region consists of NNE-striking inverted and basement-involved contractional structures. The occurrence of these structural styles suggests that a hybrid tectonic mechanism dominated by tectonic inversion and basement-involving thrusting was responsible of its current configuration. On the other hand, the U–Pb ages determined in the synorogenic deposits exposed on the footwall of the main faults indicate that the Andean deformation could have initiated during the Late Cretaceous in the Coastal Cordillera associated with tectonic inversion and then this migrated to the east as basement-involved thrusting during the Paleocene–Miocene times.","This work has been supported by the research project “The crustal structure and timing deformation along the Chilean flat-slab subduction segment (27°–29° S), Central Andes,” funded by the Fondo Nacional de Desarrollo Científico y Tecnológico (Fondecyt), Chile (grant 3140557).

Constitutions now often include newer forms of rights – such as socioeconomic and environmental rights – and are written with an explicitly transformative purpose. They also often reflect include new independent bodies such as human rights commissions and electoral tribunals whose position and function within the traditional structure is novel. The practice of the separation of powers has also changed, as the executive has tended to gain power and deliberative bodies like legislatures have often been thrown into a state of crisis. The chapters in this edited volume grapple with these shifts and the ways in which the doctrine of the separation of powers might respond to them. It also asks whether the shifts that are taking place are mostly a product of the constitutional systems of the global south, or instead reflect changes that run across most liberal democratic constitutional systems around the world.",,,,,"David Bilchitz, David Landau",,2018-05-25,2018,,,,,,Closed,Edited Book,,,,,1,0,,1.19,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1108912991,48 Law and Legal Studies; 4803 International and Comparative Law; 4807 Public Law,"16 Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions"

It suffers from two issues that have already been addressed in the field of type systems. First, it has a rigid focus on full-program verification. Also, it provides weak support for ""partial"" verification, relying on unproven lemmas that may lead to unsound runtime behavior. These issues are also present in Dafny, a verification-first programming language with full support for expressive pre-conditions and post-conditions that must be verified statically. Inspired by recent research on the field of gradual program verification in the Coq proof assistant, in this paper we present a first proposal for progressive verification in Dafny by presenting a minimal proof-of-concept implementation. Progressive verification means that programmers can use a new keyword to specify post-conditions that are assumed to be true during verification, but that will be tested at runtime by automatically-generated checks. We argue that our approach is correct by construction, by relying on the architecture of Dafny itself, and we also discuss several issues regarding the threats to the proposed approach as well as perspectives for further development.",,,,Proceedings of the XXII Brazilian Symposium on Programming Languages,,,2018-09-20,2018,2018-09-20,2018-09-20,,,90-97,Closed,Proceeding,"Figueroa, Ismael; García, Bruno; Leger, Paul","Figueroa, Ismael (Pontificia Universidad, Valparaíso, Chile); García, Bruno (Pontificia Universidad, Valparaíso, Chile); Leger, Paul (Universidad Católica del Norte, Coquimbo, Chile)",,"Figueroa, Ismael (Pontificial Catholic University of Valparaiso); García, Bruno (Pontificial Catholic University of Valparaiso); Leger, Paul (Catholic University of the North)",5,1,,1.62,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1106921961,46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4612 Software Engineering; 4613 Theory Of Computation,

In particular, it identifies flows and counter flows: tropicalism, hybridity and bordering as defining characteristics of the arts of the South. It looks at how the Havana Biennale for Third World Art was a significant event that promoted and enacted South-to-South flows of cultural and artistic exchange since its inception in 1984, while warning of the challenges of such exchanges in the context of realigned structures of global power. Most of the global South – which for this chapter refers to Latin America (Abya Yala), the Caribbean, Africa (Alkebulan) and Southeast Asia – was transformed by modernity/coloniality, their experiences interconnected under global routes of exchange and diverse forms and processes of migration. The stories of the peoples of the South cannot be disentangled from those of the global North, as these stories refer to the building of nation-states and the participation of the people of the South in the economies, cultures and epistemic understanding of the world.",,,,Routledge Handbook of South–South Relations,"Elena Fiddian-Qasmiyeh, Patricia Daley",,2018-12-07,2018,2018-12-07,2018-12-07,,,406-424,Closed,Chapter,"Rojas-Sotelo, Miguel","Rojas-Sotelo, Miguel ()",,"Rojas-Sotelo, Miguel ()",0,0,,0.0,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1117908764,"44 Human Society; 47 Language, Communication and Culture; 4702 Cultural Studies",

The key point is that the decolonisation call by students is battle based immediately at the university and for the university. It is important to note that 'all' institutions of learning fall under this category irrespective of whether they are public or private. This observation presents an immediate tactical and strategic dilemma for the student movement which has been arguing for access as one of the key demands of 'decolonisation'. Black academics gave Max Price the gift of legitimation and they delegitimised the students' militant struggles. Academics associated with 'decolonisation' such as Prof Mbembe have been carefully crafting a perspective of San Fanon as pacifist humanist by selectively reading his last chapter in Black Skins White Masks, or in Wretched of the Earth.",,,,Routledge Handbook of Postcolonial Politics,"Olivia U.

ANN are a set of mathematical nonlinear tools that allow to model complex systems. ANNs are computational networks which attempt to simulate, in a highly simplified model, the networks of nerve cells of the biological central nervous system. ANN architecture is usually represented by a graph where units operating on the same input variables are organized in layers, while the weights that modulate the combination of the nonlinear functions are represented as lines connecting units in different layers. Spectral spatial data generated by HIT require the application of chemometric techniques for its analysis in order to carry out food quality control.

During the process of recording the life stories of my former fieldwork assistant, Jimmy Mohale, he suffered a serious attack of pneumonia. I believed that his sickness might well have been AIDS related and gave him money to seek clinical treatment. Yet Jimmy attributed his misfortunes to his father's witchcraft, and, in the quest for a cure, consulted only diviners and Christian healers. Jimmy's health continued to deteriorate and he died on September 15, 2005. In retrospect, I question whether relativism is an appropriate anthropological orientation. While empathy is a prerequisite for ethical fieldwork, we can ill afford to see the evocation and interpretation of meanings as the only anthropological aim.

Its appeal derives from its extensive coverage of the literature. This contrasts with issues of data quality, which are still quite controversial. This chapter aims to evaluate the reliability and validity of bibliometric indicators taken from Scholar as well as their coverage of the scientific production in the social sciences. The analysis will be based on a comparison of Scholar with other bibliometric data sources (Web of Science and Scopus) plus an institutional dataset. The reliability of Scholar indicators will be investigated through correlational analysis, while their validity will be assessed using different external criteria (the results of national evaluation procedures based on a peer review approach). The analysis will be developed for the population of Italian university professors in a subset of SSH: political philosophy, history, political science and sociology.

The importance to developing countries of higher education and research in the basic sciences has been addressed by numerous experts. Science faculties are among the major faculties of most African universities and admit large numbers of freshmen. Some of these students join applied fields such as medicine, pharmacology, and engineering after initial courses in the basic sciences. In the 1960s and early 1970s, the number of African universities was reasonably low, as was the number of students enrolled in them. In the late 1970s and the 1980s, the student population increased dramatically, as did the number of universities. Many basic sciences departments have not recovered from the devastation of the last two decades.","Acknowledgements I would like to acknowledge the following persons for providing me with information that is included in this paper: K.

Colonial views about race and ethnicity adopted by Latin Americans as part of their class structure (Quijano 2000) established an early differentiation between the “civilized migrant” and the “uncivilized migrant” among groups that arrived on Latin America shores.

This article tells the story of the first unit to be deployed into South Africa in the new phase of the African National Congress’s (ANC) armed struggle. It details some of the challenges they faced implementing the lessons of MCW in the practical circumstances faced in South Africa. The years preceding 1976 had seen the ANC unable to prosecute military operations within South Africa owing to the logistical challenges of launching incursions to South Africa from their bases in Zambia and Tanzania. Independence for Angola and Mozambique had made such incursions possible, but only just, as this article shows. It explains how issues of command and control in a theatre of war spread over the whole southern African region remained formidable problems for the movement. This was the major factor that stalled the endeavours of this unit in reaching the state where it could begin operating militarily. It was a mix-up that occurred during an attempt that was made to establish contact between the ANC’s internal and external structures to discuss these issues, which led to the collapse of the mission. Finally, the article will consider the lessons learned by the ANC from the mission, and explain the significance of the experience within the entire context of the history of the armed struggle. This chapter describes the unit to be deployed into South Africa in the new phase of the African National Congress's (ANC) armed struggle. It details some of the challenges they faced implementing the lessons of Military Combat Work (MCW) in the practical circumstances faced in South Africa. The chapter also describes how relations between the ANC and Black Consciousness (BC) organisations were extended during the uprising, as the former sought to create a base amongst the latter from which its military wing Umkhonto we Sizwe (MK) could generate armed struggle. It revisits the 1976 Soweto Uprising – a major watershed in South African history – with specific focus on a theme receiving increased attention in the historiographical literature on the South African liberation struggle, namely the precise nature of the African National Congress's (ANC) involvement in the event.",,,,The ANC and the Liberation Struggle in South Africa,Thula Simpson,,2018-10-03,2018,2018-10-03,2018-10-03,,,311-332,Closed,Chapter,"Simpson, Thula","Simpson, Thula (University of Pretoria)",,"Simpson, Thula (University of Pretoria)",0,0,,0.0,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1107627572,"43 History, Heritage and Archaeology; 4303 Historical Studies; 44 Human Society","16 Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions"

192,pub.1104332199,10.1007/698_2017_134,,,Harvesting the Skies of Egypt: An Option to Recover the Evaporation Losses from the Aswan High Dam Reservoir,"The Aswan High Dam Reservoir (AHDR) is one of the largest man-made reservoirs with a surface area of 6,000 km2. It was built in the aridest zone of Egypt and Sudan. Evaporation losses range from 5 to 10 mm/m2/day throughout the year and average 7.4 mm/m2/day leading to an estimated loss of 16 km3 or 20% of the annual consumption of water by Egypt for farming, industrial, and domestic applications.These losses cannot be prevented and are difficult to reduce. Schemes to compensate for the evaporation, namely, weather modification and water harvesting from the air, are examined in this chapter. Evaporation losses are transported at low levels of a few hundred meters but also at heights of 1,500–4,000 m as there are different patterns of lower and upper winds.For the lower levels, there are two important technologies that have grown in other countries to extract water vapor from the air: fog harvesting and dew harvesting. The success of these technologies is very much dependent on the geography of the site and its climate. Efforts to utilize nocturnal radiation for refrigeration and natural ice making at night are not a recent phenomenon; the Ancient Egyptians and Ancient Persians were champions of nocturnal refrigeration where the intense cooling radiation to a black sky was used to freeze water and produce natural ice. This technology can be adapted in an Egyptian context. Fog collectors must be capable of resisting the strong “khamsin” windstorms between March and June.Egypt has an interesting pattern of inversion of temperature between night and day. This leads to the formation of dew and fog and low clouds particularly over the Delta and Cairo during certain periods of the year and just for few hours to few days but also to vigorous vertical currents rising to 4,000 m and transporting evaporated water.The direction of the winds over the Aswan High Dam Reservoir tends to blow from the north and northwest. This would suggest that water lost by evaporation tends to flow along the axis of the reservoir south toward Upper Nubia or Northern Sudan and southeast toward the Egyptian Eastern Desert, the Halayeb region, and the Red Sea coast. The Hadley cell pattern over the Earth forces the water lost by evaporation at the AHD Reservoir back to the equator. Coriolis forces due to the rotation of the Earth curb this flow slightly toward the east. While the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD) will deprive the AHD Reservoir of waters, the AHD Reservoir will continue to feed back the sources of the White Nile and the Blue Nile with water by evaporation. The governments of Egypt and Sudan should embark on weather modification to capture these losses. The clouds are overcast at 5–25% over Lake Nubia and Lake Nasser and will require a carefully planned approach.The technology of weather modification can also be tested on the northern coast of Egypt from Salum to Rafah and certain parts of the Delta where annual precipitation ranges from 50 to 200 mm/year. The Ancient Egyptians, the Greek, and Roman rulers had developed in the past a complex system of deep wells and water storage schemes for storing rainwater that should be revived in parallel to weather modification schemes.Cloud formation over the AHDR is at its peak during the flood season of July and August, while it is at a minimum over the north coast of Egypt. This opens an opportunity to maximize utilization of aircraft all year round with an emphasis on the north coast in the winter and on Lake Nasser in the summer. Weather modifications must be viewed as a carefully planned project. The conditions favor high-altitude cloud seeding at 4000 m to avoid the errors and pitfalls of low-altitude failures.Egypt and Sudan do not have currently a program for weather modification or cloud seeding. This chapter is, therefore, an attempt to open the discussion on the merits of this technology.",,,The Handbook of Environmental Chemistry,Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam Versus Aswan High Dam,"Abdelazim M.

Caridean shrimps exhibit six different sexual systems: gonochorism (separate sexes), strict protandry, partial protandry with primary females, partial protandry with primary males, partial protandry with primary males and primary females, and protandric simultaneous hermaphroditism. Within monophyletic clades belonging to the species-rich and ecologically dissimilar order Decapoda, gender expression is the most diverse in caridean shrimps. Additional studies on the life history and sexual system of caridean shrimps coupled with improvements on our understanding of the internal phylogenetic relationships within this species-rich clade are needed for a formal testing of transition asymmetries in the group. The historical origin of protandric simultaneous hermaphroditism, a sexual system that represents the “pinnacle” of evolution with respect to gender expression in the Caridea, remains to be fully understood. The conditions that maintain protandric simultaneous hermaphroditism include sex-dependent time commitments and sex-dependent energetic costs. The role of sexual selection in explaining the adaptive value of protandric simultaneous hermaphroditism needs to be addressed. Caridean shrimps represent excellent model systems to continue improving our understanding about the mechanisms explaining the diversity of gender expression patterns in nature.",I sincerely appreciate the comments by Raymond T.

It is the outcome of a symposium held at the XIX National Congress of Argentine Archaeology (San Miguel de Tucuman, August 8–12, 2016) entitled, ""Pukaras, strategic settlements and dispersed settlements: Political landscapes of the Late Intermediate Period in the Southern Andes."" Based on the topics discussed at the event, this book presents nine case studies covering a large geographic area within the Southern Andes (northwestern Argentina, northern Chile and southern Bolivia), and breaking the national barriers that tend to atomize pre-Hispanic landscapes. The respective chapters cover a wide range of themes: from architectural and settlement variability, ways to build and inhabit space, social segmentation and hierarchy; to endemic conflict, analysis of accessibility and visibility, spatiality and temporality of landscapes; as well as new dating. This book goes beyond the Late Intermediate Period (LIP) analyses from the perspective of fortified settlements and material evidence related to war, by placing the focus on how ancient political landscapes were constructed from the relation between the pukaras and other sites as part of the same territory. The methodologies used include pedestrian surveys, photogrammetric surveys with UAVs (unmanned aerial vehicles) or drones, topographic and architectural surveys, excavations of households, ceramic and rock art analysis, and spatial analysis with geographic information systems (GISs). Given the numerous thematic interconnections between the contributions, the Editors have organized the chapters geographically, moving from south to north: from the southern valleys of Catamarca Province in Argentina to Lipez in the southern part of the Bolivian Altiplano, passing through the Calchaqui valleys of Catamarca, the puna and Quebrada de Humahuaca of Jujuy in northwest Argentina and the Antofagasta region in northern Chile.

How can the people gain their voice and engage in a dialogue with hegemonic actors and discourses? In this book, Jorge Saavedra Utman examines the role of media and communicative practices during one of the largest social mobilisations in Latin America in the last 30 years: Chile’s 2011 students’ movement. Saavedra Utman observes the eye-catching, subversive, but also intimate practices that, in a country with a liberal democracy and neoliberal policies, allowed people to speak up and become political actors from grassroots positions. Presenting rich qualitative data that is sourced from interviews and focus groups with activists, he introduces a fresh perspective on the study of media and communications and social movements. Saavedra Utman paints a clearer picture of contentious events since 2011 – like the Arab Spring and Occupy – to understand the relevance of media and communications in contemporary quests for participation and democracy.

Parody’s chief task is to deconstruct and criticize the ideologies behind previous texts. During this process, new ideologies are inevitably constructed. However, postmodernism simultaneously recognizes the partiality of all ideologies and rejects their enthronement as absolute truth. This raises the question of how postmodern parody deals with the paradox inherent in its own existence on the threshold between ideology construction/deconstruction and the rejection of ideology. This book explores the relationship between parody and ideology, as well as this paradox of postmodern parody in works written by writers ranging from early twentieth-century poets to the most recent novel by the Nobel Prize-winning Mario Vargas Llosa.

The occupants of this community have fled the armed conflict and exist in a state of marginalisation and social exclusion amongst ongoing violences conducted by armed gangs and government forces. Young people negotiate these complexities and offer pointed critiques of national politics as well as grounded aspirations for the future. Colombia’s protracted conflict and its effects on the population raise many questions about how we think about peacebuilding in and with communities of conflict-affected people. Building on contemporary debates in international relations about post-liberal, everyday peace, Helen Berents draws on feminist international relations and embodiment theory to pay meaningful attention to those on the margins. She conceptualises a notion of embodied-everyday-peace-amidst-violence to recognise the presence and voice of young people as stakeholders in everyday efforts to respond to violence and insecurity. In doing so, Berents argues for and engages a more complex understanding of the everyday, stemming from the embodied experiences of those centrally present in conflicts. Taking young people’s lives and narratives seriously recognises the difficulties of protracted conflict, but finds potential to build a notion of an embodied everyday amidst violence, where a complex and fraught peace can be found.

The work explores the extent to which regional development issues are related to merely a decline of commodities´ prices and/or to the resilience of the historical structures within an unequal world order. Thus, the authors seek first to analytically explore the regional issues beyond the formal limitations of North American and Eurocentric approaches.

Synthesizing the most current theoretical insights and best practices, the contributing authors examine the ways in which organizational legitimacy can be understood, its perceived influence on the market, and the relationship between organizational legitimacy and overall organizational success. The authors draw from different methodological perspectives to develop a holistic approach to organizational legitimacy that transcends the traditional concepts of corporate reputation, business ethics or corporate social responsibility. Historically, efforts to understand how organizations acquire, manage and use legitimacy have applied insights from institutional theory, resource dependence theory, organizational ecology and stakeholder theory, but the field has remained fragmented, despite the profound implications of achieving legitimacy for ensuring organizational stability, survival and sustainability through access to capital, resources and business opportunities, as well as problem solving, performance measurement and stakeholder support.

The high ecosystem diversity of SBME putatively accounts for the high levels of endemism of the regional marine invertebrate fauna. However, until more taxonomical and biogeographical evidence is available, the SBME should be treated as a working biogeographical hypothesis rather than a cohesive unit identified by endemic fauna. As a consequence of urban, agricultural, and industrial development, the coastal areas from the SBME have been the most altered in the country over the last 500 years. Some of the largest cities and busiest harbors of the country are in or near the regional estuarine areas. The rapid environmental changes over the last several decades do not allow for the assessment if current similarities and dissimilarities in the benthic assemblages express pristine conditions or if they are already the result of major human interventions, especially in the case of the Guanabara, Sepetiba, and Santos estuaries.",,,Brazilian Marine Biodiversity,Brazilian Estuaries,"Paulo da Cunha Lana, Angelo Fraga Bernardino",,2018-07-10,2018,2018-07-10,2018,,,117-175,Closed,Chapter,"da Cunha Lana, Paulo; Christofoletti, Ronaldo; Gusmão Jr, João Bosco; Barros, Thayanne Lima; Spier, Daphne; Costa, Tânia Marcia; Gomes, Abílio Soares; dos Santos, Cinthya Simone Gomes","da Cunha Lana, Paulo (Universidade Federal do Paraná, Centro de Estudos do Mar, Paraná, Brazil); Christofoletti, Ronaldo (Universidade Federal de São Paulo, Instituto do Mar, Santos, São Paulo, Brazil); Gusmão Jr, João Bosco (Universidad Católica del Norte, Facultad de Ciencias del Mar, Departamento de Biología Marina, Millennium Nucleus for Ecology and Sustainable Management of Oceanic Islands (ESMOI), Coquimbo, Chile); Barros, Thayanne Lima (Universidade Federal do Paraná, Centro de Estudos do Mar, Paraná, Brazil); Spier, Daphne (Universidade Federal do Paraná, Centro de Estudos do Mar, Paraná, Brazil); Costa, Tânia Marcia (Universidade Estadual Paulista, Instituto de Biociências, Campus do Litoral Paulista, São Vicente, São Paulo, Brazil); Gomes, Abílio Soares (Universidade Federal Fluminense, Departamento de Biologia Marinha, Campus do Valonguinho, Niterói, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil); dos Santos, Cinthya Simone Gomes (Universidade Federal Fluminense, Departamento de Biologia Marinha, Campus do Valonguinho, Niterói, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil)","da Cunha Lana, Paulo (Federal University of Paraná)","da Cunha Lana, Paulo (Federal University of Paraná); Christofoletti, Ronaldo (Federal University of São Paulo); Gusmão Jr, João Bosco (Catholic University of the North); Barros, Thayanne Lima (Federal University of Paraná); Spier, Daphne (Federal University of Paraná); Costa, Tânia Marcia (São Paulo State University); Gomes, Abílio Soares (Fluminense Federal University); dos Santos, Cinthya Simone Gomes (Fluminense Federal University)",19,10,,2.69,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1105439750,41 Environmental Sciences; 4104 Environmental Management,14 Life Below Water

I link this to a discussion of the USA-commissioned Belmont report (1979). This report offers guidelines for the practice of ethics in biomedical and behavioral research, which have been highly influential in the way in which Institutional Review Boards (or ethics review committees) worldwide review/regulate the work of researchers proposing to conduct any kind of research involving human participants. The Belmont research delineates three principles and translates these into suggested applications in the realm of research ethics. The principles are “respect for persons”, “beneficence”, and “justice”. In this chapter—with reference to various authors’ engagement with this report and with reference to the illustrations which I extrapolate from Chaps. 10.1007/978-3-319-74386-8_2 to 10.1007/978-3-319-74386-8_6—I suggest ways in which these principles can be reconfigured. The reconfigurations are an attempt to make provision for alternative understandings (other than those encapsulated in the Belmont report) of how social research can be responsibly exercised.

In the process, the book shows that the forms of mystery, mythmaking and ritual now common in restructured institutions of higher education stem from their new power structures and procedures and the economic and socio-political factors that have generated them. Wood argues that universities have acquired occult aspects, as the beliefs and practices underpinning present-day market-driven academic discourse and practice weave spells of corporate potency, invoking the bewildering magic of the market and the arcane mysteries of capitalism, thriving on equivocation and evasion. Making particular reference to South African universities, the book demonstrates the ways in which apparently rational features of contemporary Western and Westernised societies have acquired occult aspects. It also includes discussion of higher education institutions in other countries where neoliberal economic agendas are influential, such as the UK, the US, the eurozone states and Australia. Providing a unique and thought-provoking look at the impact of the marketisation of higher education, this book will be essential reading for academics, researchers and postgraduate students engaged in the study of higher education, educational policy and neoliberalism.

Based on field research in a South African township, including qualitative interviews and focus group discussions, the study explores the context of African Pentecostalism as a whole and how it interacts with the concepts of ancestors, divination, and various types of spirit. Themes discussed include the reasons for the popularity of healing, exorcism, the “prosperity gospel,” the experience of the Holy Spirit, Spirit manifestations and practices resembling both traditional and biblical precedents, as well as scholarly discussions on African Pentecostalism from theological and social scientific disciplines.

For these to be formed, pollination must first take place. This process is the transfer of pollen grains from the anther, which is the male structure of the flower, to the sigma on the female structure of the flower. The transfer process requires agents to be carried out. The agents can be either biotic or abiotic. Nature perfected this arrangement between the pollination agents and the plants. As ecosystems and agricultural systems are changing, this balanced arrangement becomes disturbed. This makes it necessary that pollination systems be studied so that necessary measures can be undertaken to ensure productivity. The chapters of this book present results in research undertaken to improve productivity in crops such as Actinidia chinensis (the kiwifruit), Theobroma cacao (cocoa), and Manicaria saccifera (a tropical forest palm). Some results are presented on tests to check the viability of pollen grains and the delivery of sperm cells through pollen tubes to the embryo sac. These results can serve as guidelines to any person seeking to improve pollination and productivity or to check the efficiency on pollination in ecosystems or agricultural production systems.",,,,,Phatlane William Mokwala,,2018-06-06,2018,,,,,,Closed,Edited Book,,,,,3,1,,0.53,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1109460127,"30 Agricultural, Veterinary and Food Sciences; 3004 Crop and Pasture Production; 31 Biological Sciences; 3108 Plant Biology",2 Zero Hunger

The term “musicking” has gained currency in music studies, and refers to the diverse ways in which people engage with music, regardless of the nature of this engagement. By linking musicking to the local, this book highlights the ways in which musical practices and discourses interact with people’s everyday experiences and understandings of their immediate environment, their connections and commitment to that locality, and the people who exist within it. It explores what makes local musicking “local.” By viewing musicking from the perspective of where it takes place, the contributions in this collection engage with debates on the processes of musicking, identity construction, community-building and network formation, competitions and rivalries, place and space making, and local-global dynamics. The chapter is historical, and it focuses on the challenges that various forms of local musicking have faced from social and economic shifts, commercial manipulations, and changes (often hostile) within the networks in which they have felt safe. The traditional forms of music making that have thrived in local communities have often been thought to be most threatened by the rise of alternative forms of entertainment that compete for the leisure time of their participants. Often, the major challenges have been of a different order and frequently occasioned by events rather than processes.

This collection of essays offers a groundbreaking study of the complex links between politics and African Pentecostalism. Situated at the intersection between the political, the postcolonial, and global neoliberal capitalism, contributors examine the roots of the Pentecostal movement’s extraordinary growth; how Pentecostalism intervenes in key social and political issues, such as citizenship, party politics, development challenges, and identity; and conversely, how politics in Africa modulate the Pentecostal movement. Pentecostalism and Politics in Africa offers a wide-ranging picture of a central dimension of postcolonial African life, opening up new directions for future research.",,,African Histories and Modernities,,"Adeshina Afolayan, Olajumoke Yacob-Haliso, Toyin Falola",,2018,2018,,2018,,,,Closed,Edited Book,,,,,13,5,,13.78,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1108933659,44 Human Society; 4408 Political Science; 50 Philosophy and Religious Studies; 5005 Theology,

It reflects on the theory and practice of the archaeology of the contemporary past from epistemological, political, ethical and aesthetic viewpoints, and characterises the present based on archaeological traces from the spatial, temporal and material excesses that define it. The materiality of our era, the book argues, and particularly its ruins and rubbish, reveals something profound, original and disturbing about humanity. This is the first attempt at describing the contemporary era from an archaeological point of view. Global in scope, the book brings together case studies from every continent and considers sources from peripheral and rarely considered traditions, meanwhile engaging in an interdisciplinary dialogue with philosophy, anthropology, history and geography.

Starting with the nineteenth century, it analyzes the state's various strategies to establish its rule over populations highly resilient to change imposed from outside, who frequently resorted to arms to resist interference in their religious practices and beliefs, traditional customs, and ways of life. Jeronim Perović offers a major contribution to our knowledge of the early Soviet era, a crucial yet overlooked period in this region's troubled history. During the 1920s and 1930s, the various peoples of this predominantly Muslim region came into contact for the first time with a modernizing state, demanding not only unconditional loyalty but active participation in the project of “socialist transformation.” Drawing on unpublished documents from Russian archives, Perović investigates the changes wrought by Russian policy and explains why, from Moscow's perspective, these modernization attempts failed, ultimately prompting the Stalinist leadership to forcefully exile the Chechens and other North Caucasians to Central Asia in 1943-4.",,,,,,,2018-06-01,2018,2019-01-24,2018-06-01,,,,Closed,Edited Book,,,,,5,2,,8.6,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1111724732,"43 History, Heritage and Archaeology; 4303 Historical Studies; 50 Philosophy and Religious Studies",

Besides important themes such as gender, ethnicity, and healthcare, contributions from leading historians also address why the ANC decided to engage in armed struggle; what role the South African Communist Party played in making this decision; how the ANC External Mission contributed to the upsurge of mass protest in South Africa in the 1970s and 1980s; and the ANC’s contribution, relative to the other components of the liberation struggle, in ensuring the eventual demise of the old racial order.

Many Northern states, international agencies and NGOs are promoting South–South partnerships as a means of ‘sharing the burden’ in funding and undertaking development, assistance and protection activities, often in response to increased political and financial pressures on their own aid budgets. However, the mainstreaming of Southern-led initiatives by UN agencies and Northern states is paradoxical in many ways, especially because the development of a South–South cooperation paradigm was originally conceptualised as a necessary way to overcome the exploitative nature of North–South relations in the era of decolonisation. This handbook critically explores diverse ways of defining ‘the South’ and of conceptualising and engaging with ‘South–South relations’. Through 30 state-of-the art reviews of key academic and policy debates, the handbook evaluates past, present and future opportunities and challenges of South–South cooperation, and lays out research agendas for the next 5–10 years. The book covers key models of cooperation (including internationalism, pan-Arabism and pan-Africanism), diverse modes of South–South connection, exchange and support (including South–South aid, transnational activism, and migration), and responses to displacement, violence and conflict (including Southern-led humanitarianism, peace-building and conflict resolution). In so doing, the handbook reflects on decolonial, postcolonial and anticolonial theories and methodologies, exploring urgent questions regarding the nature and implications of conducting research in and about the global South, and of applying a ‘Southern lens’ to a wide range of encounters, processes and dynamics across the global South and global North alike. This handbook will be of great interest to scholars and post-graduate students in Anthropology, Area Studies, Cultural Studies, Development Studies, History, Geography, International Relations, Politics, Postcolonial Studies and Sociology.",,,,,"Elena Fiddian-Qasmiyeh, Patricia Daley",,2018-12-07,2018,2018-12-07,,,,,Closed,Edited Book,,,,,53,29,,29.92,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1117908739,44 Human Society; 4404 Development Studies,"16 Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions; 17 Partnerships for the Goals"

15,pub.1103504799,10.1007/978-3-319-74386-8,,,"Responsible Research Practice, Revisiting Transformative Paradigm in Social Research","This book explores ways in which creative research practice can be explicitly and mindfully geared to make a difference to the quality of social and ecological existence. It offers a range of examples of how different research methods can be employed (and re-tuned) with this intention. The book suggests that what Romm names ""active"" research involves using the research space responsibly to open up new avenues for thinking and acting on the part of those involved in the inquiry and wider stakeholders. The book includes a discussion of a range of epistemological, ontological, methodological and axiological positions (or paradigms) that can be embraced by inquirers implicitly or explicitly. It details the contours of an epistemology where knowing is recognized to be grounded in social relations, as a matter of ethics. While focusing on discussing the “transformative paradigm” and attendant view of research ethics, it considers to what extent the borders between paradigms can be treated as being permeable in creative and active inquiries. Apart from considering options for enhancing responsible research practice during the process of inquiry (and reconsidering mixed-research designs) the book also considers options for responsible theorizing that is inspirational for pursuing goals of social and ecological justice.",,,,,,,2018,2018,,2018,,,,Closed,Edited Book,,,,,50,7,,23.53,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1103504799,50 Philosophy and Religious Studies; 5001 Applied Ethics,

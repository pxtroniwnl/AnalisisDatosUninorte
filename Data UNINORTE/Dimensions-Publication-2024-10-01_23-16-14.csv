DR17 contains the complete release of the Mapping Nearby Galaxies at Apache Point Observatory (MaNGA) survey, which reached its goal of surveying over 10,000 nearby galaxies. The complete release of the MaNGA Stellar Library accompanies this data, providing observations of almost 30,000 stars through the MaNGA instrument during bright time. DR17 also contains the complete release of the Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment 2 survey that publicly releases infrared spectra of over 650,000 stars. The main sample from the Extended Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (eBOSS), as well as the subsurvey Time Domain Spectroscopic Survey data were fully released in DR16. New single-fiber optical spectroscopy released in DR17 is from the SPectroscipic IDentification of ERosita Survey subsurvey and the eBOSS-RM program. Along with the primary data sets, DR17 includes 25 new or updated value-added catalogs. This paper concludes the release of SDSS-IV survey data. SDSS continues into its fifth phase with observations already underway for the Milky Way Mapper, Local Volume Mapper, and Black Hole Mapper surveys.","Funding for the Sloan Digital Sky Survey IV has been provided by the Alfred P.

The effects rely on a conserved spin current passing between a reference and a sensing ferromagnetic electrode in a multilayer structure. Recently, we have proposed that these fundamental spintronic effects can be realized in unconventional collinear antiferromagnets with nonrelativistic alternating spin-momentum coupling. Here, we elaborate on the proposal by presenting archetype model mechanisms for the giant and tunneling magnetoresistance effects in multilayers composed of these unconventional collinear antiferromagnets. The models are based, respectively, on anisotropic and valley-dependent forms of the alternating spin-momentum coupling. Using first-principles calculations, we link these model mechanisms to real materials and predict an approximately 100% scale for the effects. We point out that, besides the giant or tunneling magnetoresistance detection, the alternating spin-momentum coupling can allow for magnetic excitation by the spin-transfer torque.","We acknowledge funding from the Czech Science Foundation Grants No. 19-18623X and No. 21-28876J, the Ministry of Education of the Czech Republic Grant No. LM2018110, LNSM-LNSpin, the EU FET Open RIA Grant No. 766566, Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft Grant No. TRR 173 268565370 (Project No. A03), and Johannes Gutenberg University Grant TopDyn, the computing time granted on the supercomputer Mogon at Johannes Gutenberg University Mainz.",,Physical Review X,,,,2022-01-01,2022,2022-02-10,2022-01-01,12,1,011028,All OA; Gold,Article,"Šmejkal, Libor; Hellenes, Anna Birk; González-Hernández, Rafael; Sinova, Jairo; Jungwirth, Tomas","Šmejkal, Libor (Institut für Physik, Johannes Gutenberg Universität Mainz, D-55099 Mainz, Germany; Institute of Physics, Czech Academy of Sciences, Cukrovarnická 10, 162 00 Praha 6, Czech Republic); Hellenes, Anna Birk (Institut für Physik, Johannes Gutenberg Universität Mainz, D-55099 Mainz, Germany); González-Hernández, Rafael (Grup de Investigación en Física Aplicada, Departamento de Física, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); Sinova, Jairo (Institut für Physik, Johannes Gutenberg Universität Mainz, D-55099 Mainz, Germany; Institute of Physics, Czech Academy of Sciences, Cukrovarnická 10, 162 00 Praha 6, Czech Republic); Jungwirth, Tomas (Institute of Physics, Czech Academy of Sciences, Cukrovarnická 10, 162 00 Praha 6, Czech Republic; School of Physics and Astronomy, University of Nottingham, Nottingham NG7 2RD, United Kingdom)",,"Šmejkal, Libor (Johannes Gutenberg University Mainz; Institute of Physics); Hellenes, Anna Birk (Johannes Gutenberg University Mainz); González-Hernández, Rafael (Universidad del Norte); Sinova, Jairo (Johannes Gutenberg University Mainz; Institute of Physics); Jungwirth, Tomas (Institute of Physics; University of Nottingham)",118,108,,54.07,http://link.aps.org/pdf/10.1103/PhysRevX.12.011028,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1145438376,51 Physical Sciences; 5104 Condensed Matter Physics,

To do this, it must promote competence-based learning through active teaching methodologies. This study will analyse the use of Project-Based Learning (PBL) methodologies in the context of transversal subjects, as an efficient technique to develop interpersonal communication and teamworking skills. This research is quasi-experimental, with a pre-test/post-test design with an equivalent control group. The sample consists of 610 university students from the Community of Madrid, of whom 387 participated in the PBL (Experimental Group: EG) and 223 did not (Control Group: CG). A reliable and validated questionnaire on personal competences was used as a measurement instrument. The hypotheses on the effectiveness of PBL as a technique for the development of interpersonal communication and teamworking skills in the context of transversal subjects are confirmed. The results suggest that greater use of active methodologies to promote the development of transversal or generic competences is highly recommended and that the insertion of transversal subjects into university curricula may be highly beneficial.",,,Journal of New Approaches in Educational Research,,,,2022-07-15,2022,2022-07-15,2022-07,11,2,259-276,All OA; Gold,Article,"Crespí, Paula; García-Ramos, José Manuel; Queiruga-Dios, Marián","Crespí, Paula (Facultad de Educación, Instituto de Acompañamiento, Universidad Francisco de Vitoria, 28223, Pozuelo de Alarcón, Madrid, Spain); García-Ramos, José Manuel (Departamento de Investigación y Psicología en la Educación, Universidad Complutense de Madrid, Spain); Queiruga-Dios, Marián (Instituto de Acompañamiento, Universidad Francisco de Vitoria, Spain)","Crespí, Paula (Francisco de Vitoria University)","Crespí, Paula (Francisco de Vitoria University); García-Ramos, José Manuel (Complutense University of Madrid); Queiruga-Dios, Marián (Francisco de Vitoria University)",35,33,,47.43,https://naerjournal.ua.es/article/download/v11n2-6/915,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1149495070,39 Education; 3903 Education Systems,4 Quality Education

Therefore, administrators need to establish procedures to facilitate and ensure the quality of teaching during this process. The purpose of this article is to describe the strengths and challenges of implementing Blended Learning (BL). The design used is consistent with a secondary investigation of a narrative review. As a result, several recommendations are presented for building institutional frameworks that enable the implementation of high-quality BL models in the context of a gradual return to face-to-face courses in higher education. From a theoretical and contextual perspective, considerations for transitioning to this model are discussed, based on lessons learned from emergency remote education.

Legionellosis is becoming increasingly important as a public health problem throughout the world; although it is an underreported disease, studies have consistently documented a high incidence. In addition, health costs associated with the disease are high. Diagnosis of Legionnaires’ disease is based mainly on the detection of Legionella pneumophila serogroup 1 antigen in urine. However, there have been advances in detection tests for patients with legionellosis. New methodologies show greater sensitivity and specificity, detect more species and serogroups of Legionella spp., and have the potential for use in epidemiological studies. Testing for Legionella spp. is recommended at hospital admission for severe community-acquired pneumonia, and antibiotics directed against Legionella spp. should be included early as empirical therapy. Inadequate or delayed antibiotic treatment in Legionella pneumonia has been associated with a worse prognosis. Either a fluoroquinolone (levofloxacin or moxifloxacin) or a macrolide (azithromycin preferred) is the recommended first-line therapy for Legionnaires’ disease; however, little information is available regarding adverse events or complications, or about the duration of antibiotic therapy and its association with clinical outcomes. Most published studies evaluating antibiotic treatment for Legionnaires’ disease are observational and consequently susceptible to bias and confounding. Well-designed studies are needed to assess the usefulness of diagnostic tests regarding clinical outcomes, as well as randomized trials comparing fluoroquinolones and macrolides or combination therapy that evaluate outcomes and adverse events.","Acknowledgements

1645,pub.1148888485,10.3390/math10132181,,,Forecasting Selected Colombian Shares Using a Hybrid ARIMA-SVR Model,"Forecasting future values of Colombian companies traded on the New York Stock Exchange is a daily challenge for investors, due to these stocks’ high volatility. There are several forecasting models for forecasting time series data, such as the autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model, which has been considered the most-used regression model in time series prediction for the last four decades, although the ARIMA model cannot estimate non-linear regression behavior caused by high volatility in the time series. In addition, the support vector regression (SVR) model is a pioneering machine learning approach for solving nonlinear regression estimation procedures. For this reason, this paper proposes using a hybrid model benefiting from ARIMA and support vector regression (SVR) models to forecast daily and cumulative returns of selected Colombian companies. For testing purposes, close prices of Bancolombia, Ecopetrol, Tecnoglass, and Grupo Aval were used; these are relevant Colombian organizations quoted on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE).",,L.R. is supported by Universidad del Norte.

The PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) statement process was followed and Scopus and Web of Science (WoS) sources were used for the document search. A total of 248 documents were found (Scopus = 110; WoS = 138), and the final selection was 34 papers. The GM practices found were placed in five categories: (a) Green products and services; (b) Green business image; (c) Green advertising; (d) Green purchasing experience; (e) Green marketing mix. The key variables of purchasing behavior that were found are: Environmental awareness, Green satisfaction, Green attitude, Green purchasing intention, Green purchasing preference, Word of mouth, Perceived value, Green experiential value, Responsible consumption, Green engagement, Green trust, Green loyalty, and Green purchasing decision. Finally, a sustainable value generation model called “Green consumption cycle for sustainable value” was presented.",,This research has received funding from the Universidad Privada del Norte.,Sustainability,,,,2022-07-11,2022,2022-07-11,,14,14,8499,All OA; Gold,Article,"García-Salirrosas, Elizabeth Emperatriz; Rondon-Eusebio, Rafael Fernando","García-Salirrosas, Elizabeth Emperatriz (Faculty of Business Studies, Universidad Privada del Norte, Lima 15314, Peru); Rondon-Eusebio, Rafael Fernando (Department of Humanities, Universidad Privada del Norte, Lima 15314, Peru;, rafael.rondon@upn.edu.pe)","García-Salirrosas, Elizabeth Emperatriz (Private University of the North)","García-Salirrosas, Elizabeth Emperatriz (Private University of the North); Rondon-Eusebio, Rafael Fernando (Private University of the North)",36,33,,29.29,https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/14/14/8499/pdf?version=1657545621,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1149428659,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3506 Marketing; 3507 Strategy, Management and Organisational Behaviour",12 Responsible Consumption and Production
89,pub.1153667567,10.3847/1538-4365/ac9838,,,CCAT-prime Collaboration: Science Goals and Forecasts with Prime-Cam on the Fred Young Submillimeter Telescope,"We present a detailed overview of the science goals and predictions for the Prime-Cam direct-detection camera–spectrometer being constructed by the CCAT-prime collaboration for dedicated use on the Fred Young Submillimeter Telescope (FYST). The FYST is a wide-field, 6 m aperture submillimeter telescope being built (first light in late 2023) by an international consortium of institutions led by Cornell University and sited at more than 5600 m on Cerro Chajnantor in northern Chile. Prime-Cam is one of two instruments planned for FYST and will provide unprecedented spectroscopic and broadband measurement capabilities to address important astrophysical questions ranging from Big Bang cosmology through reionization and the formation of the first galaxies to star formation within our own Milky Way. Prime-Cam on the FYST will have a mapping speed that is over 10 times greater than existing and near-term facilities for high-redshift science and broadband polarimetric imaging at frequencies above 300 GHz. We describe details of the science program enabled by this system and our preliminary survey strategies.","We thank an anonymous referee for the very complete comments, criticisms, and requests for clarifications of earlier drafts of this manuscript.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of vaccines against COVID-19 in real-world conditions in adults aged 60 years and older in Colombia.
Methods: In this retrospective, population-based, matched cohort study, we evaluated the effectiveness of vaccines against COVID-19-related hospitalisation and death in people aged 60 years and older. The full cohort consisted of every person who was eligible to receive a COVID-19 vaccine in Colombia (the ESPERANZA cohort). The exposed cohort consisted of older adults who were fully vaccinated with Ad26.COV2-S, BNT162b2, ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, or CoronaVac, and who did not have a history of confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. The unexposed cohort were people aged 60 years and older who had not received any dose of a COVID-19 vaccine during the study period. Participant follow-up was done between March 11, 2021, and Oct 26, 2021. Vaccine effectiveness was estimated as 1- hazard ratio from cause-specific proportional hazards models in the presence of competing risks. We estimated the overall effectiveness of being fully vaccinated, as well as effectiveness for each vaccine, adjusting by main potential confounders. The effectiveness of each vaccine was also assessed by age groups (ages 60-69 years, 70-79 years, and ≥80 years).
Findings: 2 828 294 participants were assessed between March 11 and Oct 26, 2021. For all ages, the overall effectiveness across all assessed COVID-19 vaccines at preventing hospitalisation without subsequent death was 61·6% (95% CI 58·0-65·0, p<0·0001), 79·8% (78·5-81·1, p<0·0001) for preventing death after hospitalisation with COVID-19, and 72·8% (70·1-75·3, p<0·0001) for preventing death without previous COVID-19 hospitalisation. The effectiveness of all vaccines analysed at preventing death after hospitalisation for COVID-19 was 22·6% lower in adults who were aged 80 and older (68·4% [65·7-70·9], p<0·0001) compared with adults aged between 60 and 69 years (91·0% [89·0-92·6], p<0·0001).
Interpretation: All vaccines analysed in this study were effective at preventing hospitalisation and death from COVID-19 in fully vaccinated older adults, which is a promising result for the national vaccination programme against COVID-19 in Colombia and in countries where these biologics have been applied. Efforts should be improved to increase coverage among older adults. In addition, given that we observed that the effectiveness of vaccines declined with increasing age, a booster dose is also justified, which should be prioritised for older adults.

For experimental purposes, different concrete series are considered varying aggregate sizes ranging from 0 to 25 mm. To supplement concrete, bottom ash is put to use in conjunction with material from 0–5 mm in size aggregate particles as replacement for fine aggregates with ratios of 25%, 50%, 75%, and 100%. Experiments were done to investigate the behavior of the beams and how flexural and fracture behaviors are represented. 75% BARs gave optimum results in terms of displacement capacity. Increasing BAR to 100% decrease deflection capacity of the beam. Also, ANSYS software is used to build 3D finite element models (FEMs) of beams to compare with experiment data. Experimental and 3D numerical tests show exceptionally tight flexural and fracture behaviors. Following this, a computer-generated structure is made by running SAP 2000, and the strength of the beams is then utilised in an RC structural model. Every stage of the building’s construction is thoroughly assessed utilizing multiple types of seismic testing, employing the SAP2000 program, with the resulting analysis providing significant findings on how the seismic force of 75% BAR affects horizontal displacement of each floor. The results showed that the weight of the structure dramatically decreases as the number of columns and RCBs are raised while also increasing the number of BARs. Moreover, the magnitude of earthquake and BAR have a significant effect on the horizontal displacement behavior of reinforced concrete structures. The strength of the concrete structure varies between close- and far-fault earthquakes, and for close-fault earthquakes, concrete strength is stronger than for far-fault earthquakes. This brings us to the second disadvantage of BAR which is the 75% strain produces a severe displacement of reinforced concrete structures. Besides, it was seen that the simulations and experiments yield tiny cracks with very identical configurations.",,The research is partially funded by the Ministry of Science and Higher Education of the Russian Federation under the strategic academic leadership program 'Priority 2030' (Agreement 075-15-2021-1333 dated 30.09.2021).,Frontiers in Materials,,,,2022-11-22,2022,2022-11-22,,9,,1064604,All OA; Gold,Article,"Karalar, Memduh; Bilir, Turhan; Çavuşlu, Murat; Özkiliç, Yasin Onuralp; Sabri, Mohanad Muayad Sabri","Karalar, Memduh (Department of Civil Engineering, Zonguldak Bulent Ecevit University, Zonguldak, Turkey); Bilir, Turhan (Department of Civil Engineering, Istanbul-Cerrahpasa University, Istanbul, Turkey); Çavuşlu, Murat (Department of Civil Engineering, Zonguldak Bulent Ecevit University, Zonguldak, Turkey); Özkiliç, Yasin Onuralp (Department of Civil Engineering, Necmettin Erbakan University, Konya, Turkey); Sabri, Mohanad Muayad Sabri (Peter the Great St. Petersburg Polytechnic University, St. Petersburg, Russia)","Özkiliç, Yasin Onuralp (Necmettin Erbakan University)","Karalar, Memduh (Zonguldak Bülent Ecevit University); Bilir, Turhan (Istanbul University Cerrahpaşa); Çavuşlu, Murat (Zonguldak Bülent Ecevit University); Özkiliç, Yasin Onuralp (Necmettin Erbakan University); Sabri, Mohanad Muayad Sabri (Peter the Great St. Petersburg Polytechnic University)",62,52,,27.11,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmats.2022.1064604/pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1152946054,40 Engineering; 4005 Civil Engineering,

Whereas individuals have little direct influence on the former, they can play a key role on the latter. This paper describes the subject matter of sustainable consumption and outlines its key features. It also describes some international initiatives in this field.ResultsBy means of an international survey, the study explores the emphasis given to sustainable consumption during the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the degree of preparedness in individuals to engage in the purchase of green and sustainably manufactured products. The main results indicate that the pandemic offered an opportunity to promote sustainable consumption; nevertheless, the pandemic alone cannot be regarded as a ‘game changer’ in this topic.ConclusionsApart from an online survey with responses from 31 countries, which makes it one of the most representative studies on the topic, a logit model was used to analyse the main variables that affect the probability of pro-environmental consumption behaviour because of the COVID-19 pandemic. The paper lists some of the technological and social innovations that may be needed, so as to guide more sustainable consumption patterns in a post-pandemic world.",Not applicable.,Not applicable.,Environmental Sciences Europe,,,,2022-06-20,2022,2022-06-20,2022-12,34,1,54,All OA; Gold,Article,"Leal Filho, Walter; Salvia, Amanda Lange; Paço, Arminda; Dinis, Maria Alzira Pimenta; Vidal, Diogo Guedes; Da Cunha, Dênis Antônio; de Vasconcelos, Claudio Ruy; Baumgartner, Rupert J.; Rampasso, Izabela; Anholon, Rosley; Doni, Federica; Sonetti, Giulia; Azeiteiro, Ulisses; Carvalho, Sara; Ríos, Francisco Javier Montoro","Leal Filho, Walter (European School of Sustainability Science and Research, Hamburg University of Applied Sciences, Hamburg, Germany; Department of Natural Sciences, Manchester Metropolitan University, Manchester, UK); Salvia, Amanda Lange (Graduate Program in Civil and Environmental Engineering, University of Passo Fundo, Passo Fundo, Brazil); Paço, Arminda (Universidade da Beira Interior, NECE-UBI (Research Centre for Business Sciences), Covilhã, Portugal); Dinis, Maria Alzira Pimenta (UFP Energy, Environment and Health Research Unit (FP-ENAS), University Fernando Pessoa (UFP), Porto, Portugal); Vidal, Diogo Guedes (Centre for Functional Ecology, TERRA Associate Laboratory, Department of Life Sciences, University of Coimbra, Coimbra, Portugal; Faculty of Science and Technology, University Fernando Pessoa, Porto, Portugal); Da Cunha, Dênis Antônio (Departamento de Economia Rural, Universidade Federal de Viçosa, Viçosa, Brazil); de Vasconcelos, Claudio Ruy (Laboratory of Sustainability Engineering and Consumption, Federal University of Paraíba, João Pessoa, Brazil; Algoritmi Research Centre, School of Engineering, University of Minho, Braga, Portugal); Baumgartner, Rupert J.

However, the literature on pesticide-related health effects in the Latin American and the Caribbean (LAC) region, an area of intensive agricultural and residential pesticide use, is sparse. We conducted a scoping review to describe the current state of research on the health effects of pesticide exposure in LAC populations with the goal of identifying knowledge gaps and research capacity building needs.
METHODS: We searched PubMed and SciELO for epidemiological studies on pesticide exposure and human health in LAC populations published between January 2007 and December 2021. We identified 233 publications from 16 countries that met our inclusion criteria and grouped them by health outcome (genotoxicity, neurobehavioral outcomes, placental outcomes and teratogenicity, cancer, thyroid function, reproductive outcomes, birth outcomes and child growth, and others).
RESULTS: Most published studies were conducted in Brazil (37%, n=88) and Mexico (20%, n=46), were cross-sectional in design (72%, n=167), and focused on farmworkers (45%, n=105) or children (21%, n=48). The most frequently studied health effects included genotoxicity (24%, n=62) and neurobehavioral outcomes (21%, n=54), and organophosphate (OP) pesticides were the most frequently examined (26%, n=81). Forty-seven percent (n=112) of the studies relied only on indirect pesticide exposure assessment methods. Exposure to OP pesticides, carbamates, or to multiple pesticide classes was consistently associated with markers of genotoxicity and adverse neurobehavioral outcomes, particularly among children and farmworkers.
DISCUSSION: Our scoping review provides some evidence that exposure to pesticides may adversely impact the health of LAC populations, but methodological limitations and inconsistencies undermine the strength of the conclusions. It is critical to increase capacity building, integrate research initiatives, and conduct more rigorous epidemiological studies in the region to address these limitations, better inform public health surveillance systems, and maximize the impact of research on public policies. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP9934.","We acknowledge the leadership of the Latin American and the Caribbean (LAC) Chapter of the International Society of Environmental Epidemiology (ISEE) for their support of this article.

Among these, of special interest is the recently discovered ModMax electrodynamics, which is a unique 1-parametric generalization of Maxwell's theory that possesses the conformal invariance as well as the electromagnetic duality. In this paper we construct the asymptotically AdS accelerated black holes in this theory and study their thermodynamics – providing thus a first example of accelerated solutions coupled to non-linear electrodynamics. Our study opens a window towards studying radiative spacetimes in non-linear electromagnetic regime as well as raises new challenges for their corresponding holographic interpretation.","We would like to thank Jiří Bičák for motivating one of the authors (D.K.) to search for accelerating solutions in NLE – a task that took almost 20 years to complete.

When ultrasound is applied to a product with solid or fluid characteristics, the passage of acoustic waves and acoustic cavitation generates different mechanisms responsible for modifications in the original matrix of the sample. These effects of ultrasound can also be used to take advantage of by-products, for example by extracting compounds of interest, including natural pigments. Natural pigments or colorants are being highly demanded by different industries not only for color purposes but also due to their healthy properties, the greater demands in regulations and new consumer preferences. This review presents an updated critical analysis of the application of ultrasound-assisted extraction (UAE) to obtain natural pigments from food processing by-products. Initially, the ultrasound effects and mechanisms that improve the extraction of natural pigments in a fluid medium, as well as the factors that influence the extraction and the energy consumption of UAE are analyzed and described. Subsequently, the UAE application to obtain pigments belonging to the groups of carotenoids, chlorophyll, anthocyanins and betalains is evaluated. These sections detail the processing conditions, positive and negative effects, as well as possible applications of the extracted pigments. This review presents relevant information that may be useful to expand and explore new applications of ultrasound technology as well as promote the revaluation of by-products to obtain pigments that can be used in food, pharmaceutical or cosmetic industries.",,MR was grateful to the project no. 20201005 funded by the Universidad Privada del Norte.,Frontiers in Nutrition,,,,2022-05-24,2022,2022-05-24,,9,,891462,All OA; Gold,Article,"Linares, Guillermo; Rojas, Meliza Lindsay","Linares, Guillermo (Departamento de Ciencias Agroindustriales, Universidad Nacional de Trujillo, Trujillo, Peru); Rojas, Meliza Lindsay (Dirección de Investigación, Innovación y Responsabilidad Social, Universidad Privada del Norte (UPN), Trujillo, Peru)","Rojas, Meliza Lindsay (Private University of the North)","Linares, Guillermo (National University of Trujillo); Rojas, Meliza Lindsay (Private University of the North)",42,40,5.94,19.39,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnut.2022.891462/pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1148113057,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3210 Nutrition and Dietetics,

Nonetheless, CR decreases the workability of mixes by increasing the viscosity of the binder, leading to an increase in the production temperatures of asphalt mixes. However, warm mix technologies can reduce the temperature demand associated with these processes. The preceding explains the growing interest in producing rubberised asphalt binders incorporating warm mix asphalt (WMA) additives. In this research, the mechanical and rheological properties of a 60/70 penetration grade asphalt binder modified with CR (at a dosage of 15, 18 and 21% by the wet process) and WMA chemical additives (Evotherm M1 and Iterlow T) were investigated. Laboratory tests included penetration, softening point, rotational viscosity, frequency sweep through dynamic shear rheometer (DSR), and multiple stress creep recovery (MSCR) tests. The results indicate that CR increases the stiffness of the asphalt binder, which is reflected in a lower penetration grade and improved softening point. It also improves its rutting resistance but decreases fatigue performance. Furthermore, it has been shown that under the conditions studied, the higher the CR content, the more elevated the degree of stiffness and performance of the asphalt binder. On the other hand, WMA technology decreases asphalt stiffness and performance at high temperatures.",,"The authors express their sincere gratitude to the Universidad del Norte and the Department of Science, Technology, and Innovation (COLCIENCIAS) for financing this investigation effort via “Research Project 745/2016, Contract 037-2017, No. 1215-745-59105 “, and the company Humberto Quintero O.

Building on recent work, we fit median abundance ratio trends [X/Mg] versus [Mg/H] with a 2-process model, which decomposes abundance patterns into a “prompt” component tracing core-collapse supernovae and a “delayed” component tracing Type Ia supernovae. For each sample star, we fit the amplitudes of these two components, then compute the residuals Δ[X/H] from this two-parameter fit. The rms residuals range from ∼0.01–0.03 dex for the most precisely measured APOGEE abundances to ∼0.1 dex for Na, V, and Ce. The correlations of residuals reveal a complex underlying structure, including a correlated element group comprised of Ca, Na, Al, K, Cr, and Ce and a separate group comprised of Ni, V, Mn, and Co. Selecting stars poorly fit by the 2-process model reveals a rich variety of physical outliers and sometimes subtle measurement errors. Residual abundances allow for the comparison of populations controlled for differences in metallicity and [α/Fe]. Relative to the main disk (R = 3–13 kpc), we find nearly identical abundance patterns in the outer disk (R = 15–17 kpc), 0.05–0.2 dex depressions of multiple elements in LMC and Gaia Sausage/Enceladus stars, and wild deviations (0.4–1 dex) of multiple elements in ω Cen. The residual abundance analysis opens new opportunities for discovering chemically distinctive stars and stellar populations, for empirically constraining nucleosynthetic yields, and for testing chemical evolution models that include stochasticity in the production and redistribution of elements.","D.H.W. gratefully acknowledges the hospitality of the IAS and financial support of the W.M.

A quantitative research methodology was used, with a sample of 817 students, the data were collected through the DIGCOMP-PED evaluation instrument, which evaluates DC development using the DIGCOMP framework. The results were analyzed at the general and socioeconomic level on the variables of the educational establishment where they attended high school and the territorial area of the university they attended. The main results indicate that the level of DC achievement is intermediate, the areas with the highest levels of achievement were “network security” and “online communication and collaboration.” On the other hand, the lowest levels of achievement were reached in the areas “information and digital literacy,” “digital content creation,” and “problem solving.” The level of DC is higher among students of private establishments and those who attend universities located in the central area.",We would like to thank Verónica Yañez for the translation of this article into English.,"This work has been funded by Universidad de Santiago de Chile, USACH.

211,pub.1149518983,10.3846/tede.2022.17152,,,Evaluating economic freedom via a multi-criteria MEREC-DNMA model-based composite system: case of OPEC countries,"Economic freedom indicators create a beneficial and suitable guide and a crucial reference for investors, policymakers, lenders, and market researchers worldwide. In light of these indicators, the economic freedom performances of countries can be determined. The Heritage Foundation annually releases a ranked list of the country based on their performance in terms of fourteen economic freedom criteria with equal weights through a simple aggregation approach. According to an average-based aggregator, equal weight of economic freedom criteria and calculating rank of countries cannot be a completely reliable approach. Thus, this work establishes a composite index system in the form of a decision support system that employs the method based on the removal effects of criteria (MEREC) and the double normalization-based multi-aggregation (DNMA) to specify the economic freedom levels of the OPEC countries. MEREC obtains the importance weights of indicators without the interference of any stakeholder or decision-makers. Afterward, DNMA, as a novel ranking multi-criteria method, is applied to sort countries based on their performance against all economic freedom criteria.

Impact on Linguistic and Mathematical Competences in a Disadvantaged Context,"This research has studied the impact of the use of STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Art, and Mathematics) in education, specifically in the development of linguistic and mathematical skills. The instruments used to extract the learning results were the external evaluation tests carried out by the National Institute of Educational Evaluation INEE over a period of 4 years. The study included 242 third-level primary school students from an educational center in the city of Ceuta (Spain) located in a disadvantaged area. The objectives of the study were to describe the learning results obtained in the respective competencies according to the sex and the migratory history of the students’ parents, to compare the results obtained before and during the use of STEAM and to determine if there is a correlation between the understanding of writing and problem solving. The research method was quantitative descriptive, cross-sectional and correlational. The results of the study showed that the transversal and coordinated use of STEAM improves the learning outcomes of linguistic and mathematical competence of students of the third year of Primary Education, especially speaking, oral comprehension and calculation. The results were, in general, more positive in the case of girls and students whose parents were born in Spain. The study also revealed that there is a positive correlation between reading comprehension and problem solving.",This research corresponds to a study as part of a doctoral thesis at the University of Granada.,,Frontiers in Education,,,,2022-06-16,2022,2022-06-16,,7,,792656,All OA; Gold,Article,"Duo-Terron, Pablo; Hinojo-Lucena, Francisco-Javier; Moreno-Guerrero, Antonio-José; López-Núñez, Juan-Antonio","Duo-Terron, Pablo (Departamento de Didáctica y Organización Escolar, University of Granada, Granada, Spain); Hinojo-Lucena, Francisco-Javier (Departamento de Didáctica y Organización Escolar, University of Granada, Granada, Spain); Moreno-Guerrero, Antonio-José (Departamento de Didáctica y Organización Escolar, University of Granada, Granada, Spain); López-Núñez, Juan-Antonio (Departamento de Didáctica y Organización Escolar, University of Granada, Granada, Spain)","Duo-Terron, Pablo (University of Granada)","Duo-Terron, Pablo (University of Granada); Hinojo-Lucena, Francisco-Javier (University of Granada); Moreno-Guerrero, Antonio-José (University of Granada); López-Núñez, Juan-Antonio (University of Granada)",12,9,,17.18,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/feduc.2022.792656/pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1148725153,39 Education; 3901 Curriculum and Pedagogy; 3903 Education Systems,4 Quality Education

Therefore, the objective of this study was to evaluate the antimicrobial activity of oregano essential oil (Origanum vulgare L.) (OEO) against bacteria (Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus) and filamentous fungi on cheeses during ripening. For this purpose, Minas cheeses were produced and artificially contaminated with strains of enteropathogenic E. coli, multidrug-resistant S. aureus, and the fungi Aspergillus flavus, Fusarium oxysporum, and Penicillium citrinum. The experiments were performed with Minas cheeses containing OEO, natamycin and nisin, in challenge tests against bacteria and fungi. OEO at a concentration of 0.02% (v/v) demonstrated antibacterial and antifungal activity, with total elimination of all the tested strains until the sixth day of ripening, besides inhibiting the germination of fungal spores. The pH and moisture of the samples were not significantly affected by the addition of OEO at the tested concentration. Thus, OEO at a concentration of 0.02% (v/v) used in the production of Minas cheese was efficient in controlling pathogenic and multidrug-resistant microorganisms and toxigenic fungi during ripening, and its use presents a potential alternative for microbial control.","This work was supported by the State University of Londrina, the State University of North of Paraná, the Fundação Araucária and Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior (CAPES) for the use of financial facilities.",,LWT,,,,2022-03,2022,,2022-03,157,,113063,All OA; Gold,Article,"de Campos, Anna Carolina Leonelli Pires; Nandi, Renata Daniela Saldanha; Scandorieiro, Sara; Gonçalves, Marcelly Chue; Reis, Guilherme Fonseca; Dibo, Miriam; Medeiros, Leonardo Pinto; Panagio, Luciano Aparecido; Fagan, Eder Paulo; Kobayashi, Renata Katsuko Takayama; Nakazato, Gerson","de Campos, Anna Carolina Leonelli Pires (Department of Microbiology, State University of Londrina – Biological Sciences Center.

METHODS: Cross-sectional study in a voluntary sample of 469 university students (22.4 ± 0.19 years; 66% women). According to students' self-reports of physical activity and sedentary time, four behavioral profiles were created to investigate their association with subjective well-being and mental health using one-factor ANOVA that was adjusted to a multifactorial model.
RESULTS: The physically inactive and sedentary behavior profile presents the lowest levels of subjective well-being (p < 0.001), positive affective experiences (p < 0.001) and general mental health (p = 0.001). When adjusting for confounding variables, it was observed that the physically active and non-sedentary profile was associated with better general mental health (p < 0.01) in contrast to those who are physically active and sedentary.
CONCLUSIONS: Chilean university students with a physically inactive and sedentary profile during the pandemic presented worse well-being and mental health, with a sedentary lifestyle being one of the variables that most affects the mental health of these students. Therefore, measures should be implemented to encourage this population to maintain adequate levels of physical activity and reduce sedentary times.",,This research received no external funding.,International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health,,Jennifer L.

In this way, PPs are more cost-effective than conventional rigid pavements (CRPs) and conventional flexible pavements (CFPs). Nonetheless, even though the economic and mechanical aspects of PPs have been widely studied and well documented, the literature is limited regarding the environmental assessment of PPs. Consequently, this research estimated the environmental burden associated with five pavement structures (one CRP, one CFP, and three PP structures) through the life-cycle assessment (LCA) methodology. Notably, the PaLATE computational tool was used to carry out the LCAs. The results indicated that for CFP, most of the environmental impacts are generated by the M&R activities. Otherwise, for CRP and PP structures, the most impact occurred during the initial construction stage. The study results also revealed that materials production is the sub-stage that most contributed to the generation of environmental detriments. Overall, this comparative case study concluded that the pavement alternative with the slightest environmental damage is the PP structure.","The authors thank the Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT) and the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) for their invaluable support, in particular for providing the Texas PP database, which served as the primary data source to carry out this research effort.",This research received no external funding.,Sustainability,,,,2022-08-12,2022,2022-08-12,,14,16,9983,All OA; Gold,Article,"Walubita, Lubinda F.; Martinez-Arguelles, Gilberto; Polo-Mendoza, Rodrigo; Ick-Lee, Sang; Fuentes, Luis","Walubita, Lubinda F.

This initiative, known as Novus, and carried out at Tecnologico de Monterrey, encourages professors to present educational innovation proposals by funding and monitoring research projects that promote student learning and competencies. These projects are based on digital technologies and pedagogies developed on the 26 campuses distributed throughout the country. This article presents a case study in which the historical data of Novus projects from 2012 to 2021 are reviewed. The results show that using digital technologies in these projects has favored more than 65,000 students on more than 1700 courses and the 1000 professors who teach these formative experiences. In addition, there are similar initiatives, especially in Latin America; however, they are still too few to contribute to improving student learning in an unprecedented time. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the digital transformation of educational institutions has been accelerated, with many challenges and obstacles. Therefore, showing the result of initiatives that favor the professionalization of teachers through technological projects based on evidence will illustrate the possibilities for higher education to develop these experiences. This study aims to communicate the main ideas and findings that originated in the projects created with this initiative and to show how these experiences have impacted the teaching-learning processes of university students through the innovation proposed by teachers. The dissemination of these results can generate interest so that other institutions understand the benefits of this initiative and can continue to generate new opportunities for these contexts.","The authors would like to acknowledge the group of professors and teachers that with their Novus project, have contributed to the institution and to the educational innovation field.

A Systematic Review through the Topic Modelling Approach,"Small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) play a fundamental role in the global economy. However, SMEs usually have different characteristics from larger enterprises, e.g., essential resource restrictions, lower performance, and higher environmental impacts. This requires them to search for strategies to be more competitive and sustainable. A possible solution relies on introducing Lean-Green practices. Previous research indicated that digitalization could be an enabler of Lean. Lean can also help to achieve increased environmental performance using the Lean-Green approach. In this study, this important yet under-studied area is investigated as we consider digitalization as an enabler for implementing lean in SMEs, with a focus on Lean-Green practices. A systematic literature review is executed, following a new framework based on topic modelling for extracting the papers. The topic modelling is executed through latent dirichlet allocation (LDA) which is a machine learning technique. In methodological means, this paper represents an example of the frontier of digitalization for research activities. Regarding the investigated focus, the main findings revealed that digitalization is an enabler to Lean and to Lean-Green.

For this, first, we conducted a bibliometric analysis to evaluate the relationships between business model innovation and SBMI literature. After this, we performed a systematic literature review to create a comprehensive framework for managing SBMI. The bibliometric analysis showed that the SBMI stream grew quickly and significantly in recent years, evolving into a separated new research stream, which does not leverage recent business model innovation advancements. Through the performed analyses, we were able to discuss critical gaps in the SBMI literature and shed light on possible pathways to solve these gaps through lessons learned from business model innovation. We depicted five critical gaps for managing SBMI; (1) the need to understand the sustainable business model as a wicked problem, in which SBMI leads to “better than before” solutions calling for systematic SBMI, (2) the poor definition of distinctive dimensions of dynamic capabilities for SBMI, (3) the lack of studies exploring the role of open innovation for improving the SBMI process, (4) the lack of tools supporting SBMI implementation and (5) the need to explore game-changing, competitive advantages of SBMI.

Nowadays, developing products for new business models based on renting and servitization practices is of paramount importance. Furthermore, durability enables the application of circularity strategies for product lifespan extension, including reuse, repair, refurbish, and remanufacture. However, despite the growing trend around durability, there is no precise tracing of its evolution, implementation, and potential benefits from the product design stage. Therefore, this article aims to analyze the existing literature about durability and its relationship with the circular economy concept starting from the product design process, uncovering potential research directions, challenges, and trends for its application. A total of 147 articles were selected and analyzed from 40 years of research using two main approaches. First, a keyword-based analysis was used to identify trending topics around the concept of durability. Second, a content-based analysis was used, encompassing four main aspects: objectives and methodology; actors involved and lifecycle phases; circular economy strategies; and design phase, design attributes, and type of products involved. The analysis identified how the concept has evolved during the last four decades, indicating that future trends envisage methodologies, assessment tools, and guidelines to support product life extension.",,"This work was supported by Vicerrectoría de Investigación, Creación e Innovación Universidad del Norte.",Heliyon,,,,2022-09-22,2022,2022-09-22,2022-09,8,9,e10734,All OA; Gold,Article,"Mesa, Jaime A.; Gonzalez-Quiroga, Arturo; Aguiar, Marina Fernandes; Jugend, Daniel","Mesa, Jaime A.

It is in the Late Preclassic that the image and the text with 4 glyphic signs allude to the ruler represented there. It is in the early part of the Late Preclassic that stelae at Tak’alik Ab’aj and other early cities represent their rulers, still without a long count date. This was implemented in the second part of the Late Preclassic, of which a good example is Stela 5 (126 ad). For this reason, the iconography and writing of Estela 87 adds another exponent and opportunity, particularly for the Pacific Coast region, to the study of the still small universe of early texts, and more precisely, of the first part of the Late Preclassic (100 BC-50 ad) (Schieber de Lavarreda, 2020a).

In all cases, the identified red chromophore is hematite, accompanied by different types of clay and varying amounts of organic matter. The results obtained suggest diverse origins and / or technical manipulation. The contrast with the documentary evidence of this area, and others nearby, shows that these funeral practices reflect the relationship of the individual and his landscape, through elements exogenous as the sea.

Cerium abundances were derived from measurements of Ce ii lines in the APOGEE spectra using the Brussels Automatic Code for Characterizing High Accuracy Spectra in 218 stars belonging to 42 open clusters. Our results indicate that, in general, for ages < 4 Gyr, younger open clusters have higher [Ce/Fe] and [Ce/α-element] ratios than older clusters. In addition, metallicity segregates open clusters in the [Ce/X]–age plane (where X can be H, Fe, or the α-elements O, Mg, Si, or Ca). These metallicity-dependent relations result in [Ce/Fe] and [Ce/α] ratios with ages that are not universal clocks. Radial gradients of [Ce/H] and [Ce/Fe] ratios in open clusters, binned by age, were derived for the first time, with d[Ce/H]/d R GC being negative, while d[Ce/Fe]/d R GC is positive. [Ce/H] and [Ce/Fe] gradients are approximately constant over time, with the [Ce/Fe] gradient becoming slightly steeper, changing by ∼+0.009 dex kpc−1 Gyr−1. Both the [Ce/H] and [Ce/Fe] gradients are shifted to lower values of [Ce/H] and [Ce/Fe] for older open clusters. The chemical pattern of Ce in open clusters across the Galactic disk is discussed within the context of s-process yields from asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars, gigayear time delays in Ce enrichment of the interstellar medium, and the strong dependence of Ce nucleosynthesis on the metallicity of its AGB stellar sources.","J.V.S.S. acknowledges the PCI/CNPQ program under the grant 301863/2021-0.

A total of 569 college students (61.9% female), with a mean age of 21.73 years (standard deviation = 4.95), responded to the following questionnaires: Academic Self-Efficacy Scale, Single Item Self-Esteem Scale, Brief Scale of Satisfaction with Studies, Scale of Use of Virtual Media, Patient Health Questionnarie-2, and Single Item of Academic Emotional Exhaustion. Correlation statistics, regression models, and structural equation modeling (SEM) were used for data analysis. The results demonstrated a direct and significant correlation between virtual media use, academic self-efficacy, self-esteem, depression, and emotional exhaustion (p < .01). In addition, satisfaction with studies (β = -0.13), academic self-efficacy (β = -0.19), self-esteem (β = -0.14), and emotional exhaustion (β = 0.19) predicted depression significantly, whereas virtual media use (β = 0.17), study satisfaction (β = 0.09), and depression (β = 0.20) predicted emotional exhaustion associated with academics. The SEM model indicated that self-esteem, satisfaction with studies, and academic self-efficacy negatively predict depression, whereas academic self-efficacy positively predicts virtual media use. Finally, both virtual media use and depression positively predict emotional exhaustion.

For this paper we evaluated over 200 peer-reviewed articles and grey literature documents published since 2012. We found that climate change in Central and South America during the 21st century may increase the risk to severe levels for the following topical risk clusters: (a) Food insecurity; (b) Floods and landslides; (c) Water scarcity; (d) Epidemics of vector-borne diseases; (e) Amazon Forest biome shift; (f). Coral bleaching; (g) Coastal risks of sea level rise, storm surges and erosion; (h) Systemic failure due to cascading impacts of hazards and epidemics. Our synthesis also identified feasible adaptation measures for each risk. The impacts of the risks will be heterogeneous throughout the region, with rural communities, Indigenous peoples, Afro-Latin Americans, women, disabled people, and migrants identified as being the most severely affected. We refer to a number of adaptation options for each risk. However, unabated climate change together with low adaptive capacity will strictly limit adaptation options.

Here, we provide geoarchaeological evidence revealing a major tsunamigenic earthquake that severely affected prehistoric hunter-gatherer-fisher communities ~3800 years ago, causing an exceptional social disruption reflected in contemporary changes in archaeological sites and triggering resilient strategies along these coasts. Together with tsunami modeling results, we suggest that this event resulted from a ~1000-km-long megathrust rupture along the subduction contact of the Nazca and South American plates, highlighting the possibility of Mw ~9.5 tsunamigenic earthquakes in northern Chile, one of the major seismic gaps of the planet. This emphasizes the necessity to account for long temporal scales to better understand the variability, social effects, and human responses favoring resilience to socionatural disasters.","While this paper was on the final stages of the review process, and just before it was accepted for publication, our colleague and friend J.L.G. sadly passed away.

352,pub.1145372541,10.1109/access.2022.3150101,,,Exploiting Arduino Features to Develop Programming Competencies,"Developing programming competencies is essential for systems, information science, computer science, and electrical engineering students. Engineering students usually face the complexity of working with programming languages that demand compliance with syntactic and semantic rules, which typically represent a daunting task for novice students. Watching textual messages on the screen only, like the classic “hello world,” is no longer attractive in the current information society, a missing motivation and possible obstacle to developing programming competencies. Students would like to interact with hardware and appreciate environmental reactions. Arduino board permits developing solutions like that. This article presents the academic experience of first-year students of Ingeniería de Sistemas e Informática at the Universidad Continental (ISI-UC) of Huancayo, Perú, using the Arduino microcontroller board for the teaching-learning process to develop programming competencies. The results obtained show a positive impact regarding the experience of previous using traditional text-based programming languages. Using Arduino, students create digital circuits and computational electronics competencies, another significant benefit. This experience used an online simulator, and the results obtained permit us to plan future online education strategies for this major. The next step will be the application of Arduino and the online simulator to deepen programming skills, including recursivity, real-time constraints, multitasking features, data structure, data-oriented programming, and object-oriented programming. The primary limitations encountered in this experiment were the students’ lack of experience with electronics concepts to build circuits and, in some cases, the low internet speeds to assist in the programming process of online education. Realizing simulated experiences in classroom experiences was not a significant challenge for teachers and most students. However, problems could arise when students perform practical experiences using real Arduino boards in traditional classes for the availability requirement of Arduino and other electronic components.","The authors are currently living in a difficult time, plagued by a pandemic.

However, few population-based seroprevalence surveys have been conducted to quantify attack rates and characterize drivers of transmission.
METHODS: We conducted a population-based cross-sectional study to assess the seroprevalence of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in ten cities in Colombia between September and December 2020. The study involved multi-stage cluster sampling at each city. Participants provided a serum sample and answered a demographic and risk factor questionnaire. Prior infection by SARS-CoV-2 was ascertained using the ""SARS-CoV-2 Total (COV2T) Advia Centaur - Siemens"" chemiluminescence assay.
FINDINGS: A total of 17863 participants from 7320 households participated in the study. Seroprevalence varied substantially between cities, ranging from 26% (95%CI 23-29 %) in Medellín to 68% (95%CI 62-74 %) in Guapi. There were no differences in seroprevalence by sex, but seropositivity was higher in certain ethnic groups. There was substantial heterogeneity in seroprevalence within cities, driven to a large extent by a strong association between socioeconomic stratum and seropositivity.
INTERPRETATION: Colombia has been one of the Latin American countries most affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. This study documented very high attack rates in several Colombian cities by the end of 2020 and identified key drivers of heterogeneities including ethnicity and socioeconomic stratum. Few studies of seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 have been conducted in Latin America, and therefore this study contributes to the fundamental understanding of the pandemic in the region.

The presence of this pathology in children leads to the appearance of different alterations (physical, psychological, social, etc.). Due to their high influence, the aim of this study is to understand these psychological and sociocultural determinants and their impact on the quality of life of asthmatic children. In order to determine the influence of these determinants on quality of life, a narrative review of 48 articles collected in different databases was carried out. Emotions are the most powerful precursor to producing an asthmatic attack. Anxiety and depression are the pathologies that appear frequently associated with childhood asthma, together with Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder. In addition, the personality of these children seems to be characterized by shyness and impulsivity, although exceptionally it has been associated with psychopathic behaviors, aggressiveness, and cases of psychosis. School performance is impaired and bullying occurs more frequently. Likewise, dysfunctional family relationships and lower socioeconomic status have a negative impact on the severity and management of asthma. In short, the quality of life of asthmatic children is lower due to the presence of the aforementioned psychological and sociocultural determinants.",,This research received no external funding.,International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health,,Paul B.

In the education sector, thousands of teachers were affected by the change to a new online work modality and the acquisition of new work tools. The aim of this study was to determine whether social support and general self-efficacy (GSE) significantly predict the quality of life at work in a group of Ecuadorian teachers. A total of 300 teachers of both genders, whose ages ranged between 21 and 64 years, participated in the study. For measurements, the Duke-UNK-11 General Sale Scale and the Scale of Quality of Life in the CVT-Gohisalo Work were used. The predictive analysis was performed through linear regression. The results show a moderately significant relationship between social support, GSE, and quality of life at work. Similarly, the multiple regression analysis confirms that social support and self-efficacy are variables that significantly predict the quality of life at work. The findings of this research also confirm that teachers with higher levels of GSE report higher levels of quality of life at work. In conclusion, the prediction of the variables social support and GSE in the quality of life at work of Ecuadorian teachers is confirmed.

In this article, different documentation and studies on mental health were analyzed, with the aim of identifying the various problems detected during the pandemic. Methodologically, a narrative and integrative review of the scientific literature was carried out. In Latin America, the most recent studies have documented and made patent effects on the various vulnerized populations such as migrants, women, children, the elderly, people living with significant disabilities, people experiencing marked housing and food insecurity, and temporary workers laboring in what has been referred to as the informal economy. In light of this, it is proposed that addressing these issues should involve the coordination of transnational policies and the definition of an agenda of critical priorities to focus and address. For this to come about, it is important that the empirical evidence generated by regional epidemiological studies contribute to the design of public policies on mental health of the Latin American population, so that they reduce the negative effects as well as prevent the future consequences of a pandemic that is not yet over.",,,Fractal Revista de Psicologia,,,,2022-01-08,2022,2022-01-08,,33,3,226-232,All OA; Gold,Article,"Gallegos, Miguel; Consoli, Andrés J.; Ferrari, Ilka Franco; Cervigni, Mauricio; de Castro Pecanha, Viviane; Martino, Pablo; Caycho-Rodríguez, Tomás; Razumovskiy, Anastasia","Gallegos, Miguel (Pontifícia Universidade Católica de Minas Gerais, Belo Horizonte, MG, Brasil ; Universidad Nacional de Rosario, Santa Fe); Consoli, Andrés J.

The university of the 21st century must promote the implementation of pedagogical guidelines aimed at facilitating the acquisition of intercultural and digital competences, with the aim of empowering students through ICT, favouring their integral development and the autonomous construction of their identity. The aim of this study is to find out teachers' evaluations of the potential of ICT to favour the acquisition of intercultural competences in their students. The methodology is qualitative through focus groups in which 14 teachers from the University of Malaga (Spain) participated. The content analysis followed a deductive category development model. The results reveal that the participating teachers use digital tools as a means of acquiring knowledge rather than to promote cultural interaction.

They also provide information on the uneven impact of the pandemic, pointing out vulnerable groups to prioritize which is particularly relevant in unequal societies. However, due to their high cost, they provide limited evidence of spatial spread of the pandemic specially in unequal societies. Our objective was to estimate the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in Chile and model its spatial risk distribution.MethodsDuring Oct–Nov 2020, we conducted a population-based serosurvey in Santiago, Talca, and Coquimbo–La Serena (2493 individuals). We explored the individual association between positive results and socio-economic and health-related variables by logistic regression for complex surveys. Then, using an Empirical Bayesian Kriging model, we estimated the infection risk spatial distribution using individual and census information, and compared these results with official records.ResultsSeroprevalence was 10.4% (95% CI 7.8–13.7%), ranging from 2% (Talca) to 11% (Santiago), almost three times the number officially reported. Approximately 36% of these were asymptomatic, reaching 82% below 15 years old. Seroprevalence was associated with the city of residence, previous COVID-19 diagnosis, contact with confirmed cases (especially at household), and foreign nationality. The spatial model accurately interpolated the distribution of disease risk within the cities finding significant differences in the predicted probabilities of SARS-CoV-2 infection by census zone (IQR 2.5–15.0%), related to population density and education.ConclusionsOur results underscore the transmission heterogeneity of SARS-CoV-2 within and across three urban centers of Chile. Socio-economic factors and the outcomes of this seroprevalence study enable us to identify priority areas for intervention. Our methodological approach and results can help guide the design of interdisciplinary strategies for urban contexts, not only for SARS-CoV-2 but also for other communicable diseases.","The study team acknowledges the support of the participants who opened their doors to this survey–also, the revision and thoughtful comments made by Drs.

1493,pub.1148577000,10.1016/j.cscm.2022.e01228,,,Study of nonlinear relationships between dosage mixture design and the compressive strength of UHPC,"With advances in building materials research, new materials more suitable for specific applications due to their superior durability and mechanical properties are emerging to meet the requirements of infrastructure construction and maintenance. In this sense, ultra-high-performance concrete (UHPC) is considered one of the most promising materials for concrete construction. However, a traditional UHPC mixture contains large amounts of cement, silica fume, superplasticizer, and other expensive and high carbon footprint components. Hence, several researchers have focused on developing alternative UHPC dosages using locally available materials, including several mineral admixtures, to obtain a more affordable and sustainable UHPC. Therefore, deep knowledge about the relationships between the UHPC dosage and its resulting properties could help to improve these developments. However, these relationships are nonlinear and complex. This paper aims to address this gap by using a random forest model trained with a 931 UHPC mixture collection with 17 input variables and a unique response, namely the UHPC compressive strength. After adjusting a regression model, different tools, such as input variable importance analysis and partial dependence plots, were used to assess the nonlinear relationships between the dosage of UHPC and its resulting compressive strength. In most cases, a proper alignment was observed when the findings provided by these analyses were contrasted with the results provided by other researchers. The results indicated that the inputs with the highest significance on UHPC compressive strength are those related to water content, the packing density, and the quartz powder and superplasticizer dosages, followed by the cement content. Furthermore, mineral admixtures with high amorphous SiO2 content, such as RHA and SF, presented a relevant contribution to the compressive strength, while the other admixtures would seem to have a more modest contribution to it. Finally, it is also worth noting that the machine learning model created might help to create novel UHPC dosages by decreasing the duration and expenses of the experimental campaign by permitting the pre-selection of those components with a superior model response.","The authors of this article would like to thank the support of the Research, Development, and Innovation Directorate of the Universidad del Norte through the “Research Agenda” Code 2021-007.",,Case Studies in Construction Materials,,,,2022-12,2022,,2022-12,17,,e01228,All OA; Gold,Article,"Abellán-García, Joaquín","Abellán-García, Joaquín (Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia)",,"Abellán-García, Joaquín (Universidad del Norte)",25,23,,10.93,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cscm.2022.e01228,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1148577000,40 Engineering; 4005 Civil Engineering,

Policy makers concur that the increased use and production of carbon-intensive technologies has intensified the detrimental consequences of carbon dioxide emissions. In response, a number of nations have reacted by enacting stringent regulations and encouraging green technology innovations across corporate and governmental organizations. Evidence that already exists suggests that research and development is a cyclical process; nevertheless, the non-linear influence of shocks in research and development and innovation in green technologies on CO2 emissions in the Nordic nations has not been well investigated. Using panel data from 1995 to 2019, this research explores the asymmetric link between innovation in green technologies and CO2 emissions. The cointegration link between the chosen variables was validated using the Westerlund cointegration test and the Johansen–Fisher panel cointegration test. The findings of both tests confirm the presence of cointegration association between dependent and independent variables. The outcomes of CS-ARDL revealed that negative shocks in creating green technologies contribute to carbon dioxide emissions during recessions. Second, the findings supported the notion that innovation in green technology may reduce carbon dioxide emissions during times of economic expansion. Thirdly, the GDP increases the CO2 emissions, but the usage of renewable energy decreases CO2 emissions. In addition, the robustness analysis validated the consistency and precision of the existing findings. In summary, the findings suggest that the link between advances in environmentally friendly technologies and levels of carbon dioxide emissions were inversely proportional.",,This research received no external funding.,Sustainability,,,,2022-09-19,2022,2022-09-19,,14,18,11768,All OA; Gold,Article,"Ahmed, Nihal; Areche, Franklin Ore; Nieto, Dante Daniel Cruz; Borda, Ricardo Fernando Cosio; Gonzales, Berenice Cajavilca; Senkus, Piotr; Siemiński, Paweł; Skrzypek, Adam","Ahmed, Nihal (College of Economics & Management, Northwest Agricultural & Forestry University, Xianyang 712100, China); Areche, Franklin Ore (Professional School of Agroindustrial Engineering, National University of Huancavelica, Huancavelica 09001, Peru); Nieto, Dante Daniel Cruz (School of Agricultural Engineering, José Faustino Sánchez Carrión National University, Huacho 15137, Peru); Borda, Ricardo Fernando Cosio (Faculty of Management Sciences, Universidad Privada del Norte, Lima 15314, Peru); Gonzales, Berenice Cajavilca (Faculty of Management Sciences, Universidad Privada del Norte, Lima 15314, Peru); Senkus, Piotr (Institute of Social Sciences, SWPS University of Social Sciences and Humanities, 03-815 Warsaw, Poland); Siemiński, Paweł (Department of Economics and Economic Polity in Agribusiness, Poznań University of Life Sciences, Wojska Polskiego 28, 60-637 Poznań, Poland); Skrzypek, Adam (Institute of Journalism and Management, Faculty of Social Sciences, The John Paul II Catholic University of Lublin, 20-950 Lublin, Poland)","Senkus, Piotr (University of Social Sciences and Humanities)","Ahmed, Nihal (College of Economics & Management, Northwest Agricultural & Forestry University, Xianyang 712100, China); Areche, Franklin Ore (Professional School of Agroindustrial Engineering, National University of Huancavelica, Huancavelica 09001, Peru); Nieto, Dante Daniel Cruz (School of Agricultural Engineering, José Faustino Sánchez Carrión National University, Huacho 15137, Peru); Borda, Ricardo Fernando Cosio (Private University of the North); Gonzales, Berenice Cajavilca (Private University of the North); Senkus, Piotr (University of Social Sciences and Humanities); Siemiński, Paweł (University of Life Sciences in Poznań); Skrzypek, Adam (John Paul II Catholic University of Lublin)",16,15,,10.86,https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/14/18/11768/pdf?version=1663729120,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1151211040,38 Economics; 3802 Econometrics,13 Climate Action; 7 Affordable and Clean Energy

148,pub.1148618279,10.3389/feart.2022.897267,,,The Helium and Carbon Isotope Characteristics of the Andean Convergent Margin,"Subduction zones represent the interface between Earth’s interior (crust and mantle) and exterior (atmosphere and oceans), where carbon and other volatile elements are actively cycled between Earth reservoirs by plate tectonics. Helium is a sensitive tracer of volatile sources and can be used to deconvolute mantle and crustal sources in arcs; however it is not thought to be recycled into the mantle by subduction processes. In contrast, carbon is readily recycled, mostly in the form of carbon-rich sediments, and can thus be used to understand volatile delivery via subduction. Further, carbon is chemically-reactive and isotope fractionation can be used to determine the main processes controlling volatile movements within arc systems. Here, we report helium isotope and abundance data for 42 deeply-sourced fluid and gas samples from the Central Volcanic Zone (CVZ) and Southern Volcanic Zone (SVZ) of the Andean Convergent Margin (ACM). Data are used to assess the influence of subduction parameters (e.g., crustal thickness, subduction inputs, and convergence rate) on the composition of volatiles in surface volcanic fluid and gas emissions. He isotopes from the CVZ backarc range from 0.1 to 2.6 RA (n = 23), with the highest values in the Puna and the lowest in the Sub-Andean foreland fold-and-thrust belt. Atmosphere-corrected He isotopes from the SVZ range from 0.7 to 5.0 RA (n = 19). Taken together, these data reveal a clear southeastward increase in 3He/4He, with the highest values (in the SVZ) falling below the nominal range associated with pure upper mantle helium (8 ± 1 RA), approaching the mean He isotope value for arc gases of (5.4 ± 1.9 RA). Notably, the lowest values are found in the CVZ, suggesting more significant crustal inputs (i.e., assimilation of 4He) to the helium budget. The crustal thickness in the CVZ (up to 70 km) is significantly larger than in the SVZ, where it is just ∼40 km. We suggest that crustal thickness exerts a primary control on the extent of fluid-crust interaction, as helium and other volatiles rise through the upper plate in the ACM. We also report carbon isotopes from (n = 11) sites in the CVZ, where δ13C varies between −15.3‰ and −1.2‰ [vs. Vienna Pee Dee Belemnite (VPDB)] and CO2/3He values that vary by over two orders of magnitude (6.9 × 108–1.7 × 1011). In the SVZ, carbon isotope ratios are also reported from (n = 13) sites and vary between −17.2‰ and −4.1‰. CO2/3He values vary by over four orders of magnitude (4.7 × 107–1.7 × 1012). Low δ13C and CO2/3He values are consistent with CO2 removal (e.g., calcite precipitation and gas dissolution) in shallow hydrothermal systems. Carbon isotope fractionation modeling suggests that calcite precipitation occurs at temperatures coincident with the upper temperature limit for life (122°C), suggesting that biology may play a role in C-He systematics of arc-related volcanic fluid and gas emissions.",We also acknowledge M.

In a previous study, we demonstrated the antimicrobial activity of synthetic hepcidin (hep20) from rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss), and its protective effect in European sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax) challenged with Vibrio anguillarum. Additionally, we described the uptake and distribution of hep20 in different tissues and leukocyte cells. Interestingly, various AMPs characterized in high vertebrates, called host defense peptides (HDPs), also possess immunomodulation activity. For that reason, the present study explores the immunomodulatory abilities of hep20 through in vitro and in vivo studies. First, a monocyte/macrophage RTS-11 cell line from rainbow trout was used to evaluate hep20 effects on pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines in fish leukocyte cells. Next, the European sea bass juveniles were used to determine if hep20 can regulate the expression of cytokines in fish immune tissues. The results show that hep20 was uptake inner to RTS-11 cells and was able to induce the expression of IL-10, IL-1β, and TNFα at transcriptional and protein levels. Then, the European sea bass juveniles were given intraperitoneal injections of the peptide. At 1, 3, 7, 14, and 21 days post-injection (dpi), IL-10, IL -1β, and TNFα mRNA were quantified in the anterior gut, spleen, and head kidney. The hep20 was able to up-regulate cytokine gene expression in these tissues, mainly in the head kidney. Furthermore, the evaluated cytokines showed a cyclical tendency of higher to lesser expression. Finally, a bioinformatics analysis showed that the structure adopted by hep20 is similar to the γ-core domain described for cysteine-stabilized AMP, defined as immunomodulatory and antimicrobial, which could explain the ability of hep20 to regulate the cytokine expression. This study provides new insights into immunomodulatory function complementary to the previously established antimicrobial activity of hep20, suggesting a role as an HDP in teleost fish. These facts are likely to be associated with molecular functions underpinning the protective effect of fish hepcidin against pathogens.",,"This research was funded by ANID-Chile Grants FONDEF VIU15E0024 and FONDECYT 11180042 to C.A.Á.; FONDECYT 1210056 to F.G.; REDES Chile-Perú REDBIO0009 to P.A.S.; and FONDECYT 1191763 and Program for Sanitary Management in Aquaculture of the Ministry of Economy, Development, and Tourism of Chile (FIE-2015-V014 201708070149) to L.M.",Animals,,"Francisco A.

Self-administered survey questionnaires and face-to-face interviews were chosen as qualitative methods for data collection. From a dialectal point of view, this study indicated that all official standard languages were dialects before. However, these dialects were considered superior and elevated to the status of official languages because of socio-economic power and political influence. This article further recorded that the status type of language planning in the South African context is quite political in nature, not less linguistic.

Eight hundred two university students aged 17-54 years (Mean 21.83; SD = 5.31); 658 females (82%) and 144 males (18%); who completed the Patient Health Questionnaire-2, Coronavirus Anxiety Scale, Subjective Well-being Scale (SWB), and Self-reporting of Academic Performance participated. A partial unregularized network was estimated using the ggmModSelect function. Expected influence (EI) values were calculated to identify the central nodes and a two-tailed permutation test for the difference between the two groups (COVID-19 infected and uninfected). The results reveal that a depression and well-being node (PHQ1-SWB3) presents the highest relationship. The most central nodes belonged to COVID-19 anxiety, and there are no global differences between the comparison networks; but at the local level, there are connections in the network of COVID-19-infected students that are not in the group that did not present this diagnosis. It is concluded that anxious-depressive symptomatology and its relationship with well-being and evaluation of academic performance should be considered in order to understand the impact that COVID-19 had on health sciences students.",,This work was supported by Universidad Privada del Norte.,Frontiers in Psychology,,,,2022-02-10,2022,2022-02-10,,13,,837606,All OA; Gold,Article,"Ventura-León, José; Caycho-Rodríguez, Tomás; Talledo-Sánchez, Karim; Casiano-Valdivieso, Kenia","Ventura-León, José (Department of Health Sciences, Universidad Privada del Norte (UPN), Lima, Peru); Caycho-Rodríguez, Tomás (Department of Health Sciences, Universidad Privada del Norte (UPN), Lima, Peru); Talledo-Sánchez, Karim (Department of Health Sciences, Universidad Privada del Norte (UPN), Lima, Peru); Casiano-Valdivieso, Kenia (Department of Health Sciences, Universidad Privada del Norte (UPN), Lima, Peru)","Ventura-León, José (Private University of the North)","Ventura-León, José (Private University of the North); Caycho-Rodríguez, Tomás (Private University of the North); Talledo-Sánchez, Karim (Private University of the North); Casiano-Valdivieso, Kenia (Private University of the North)",16,13,2.46,10.13,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.837606/pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1145448955,52 Psychology; 5203 Clinical and Health Psychology,3 Good Health and Well Being

To achieve this, teachers must display high levels of socioemotional skills that ensure their own personal, social, and career well-being and, as a result, that of their students. This study seeks to gain an insight into the levels of socioemotional skills of emotional perception, emotional understanding, and emotional regulation and how these are linked to the sociodemographic and career profile of teachers in infant and primary education. For this, we surveyed 351 teachers-310 female and 41 male-aged between 20 and 69. We used the Trait Meta-Mood Scale-24 (TMMS-24) together with a questionnaire (ad hoc) to determine the sociodemographic and career profile of participating teachers. Statistical analysis of the data showed that gender impacts on emotional regulation and emotional perception, while age and number of the children were also seen to have significant difference on emotional regulation and emotional perception. In contrast, professional qualifications were only seen to affect emotional perception. The variable reflecting the level at which staff teach showed significant difference on emotional perception and emotional understanding, while administrative posts held by teachers also demonstrated significant difference on their emotional understanding. The results confirm that sociodemographic and work-related variables impact the level of socioemotional skills of infant and primary education teachers. These aspects should be taken into account in the structure and planning of training aimed at developing socioemotional skills in order to ensure their success.",,This research received no external funding.,International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health,,Carlos Salavera,Achievement; Adult; Aged; Child; Emotional Intelligence; Emotions; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; School Teachers; Students; Surveys and Questionnaires; Young Adult,2022-08-11,2022,2022-08-11,,19,16,9882,All OA; Gold,Article,"Arteaga-Cedeño, Wendy L; Carbonero-Martín, Miguel Á; Martín-Antón, Luis J; Molinero-González, Paula","Arteaga-Cedeño, Wendy L (Grupo de Investigación de Excelencia GIE-179, Departamento de Psicología, Facultad de Educación, Universidad de Valladolid, Paseo Belén N 1, 47011 Valladolid, Spain.); Carbonero-Martín, Miguel Á (Grupo de Investigación de Excelencia GIE-179, Departamento de Psicología, Facultad de Educación, Universidad de Valladolid, Paseo Belén N 1, 47011 Valladolid, Spain.); Martín-Antón, Luis J (Grupo de Investigación de Excelencia GIE-179, Departamento de Psicología, Facultad de Educación, Universidad de Valladolid, Paseo Belén N 1, 47011 Valladolid, Spain.); Molinero-González, Paula (Grupo de Investigación de Excelencia GIE-179, Departamento de Psicología, Facultad de Educación, Universidad de Valladolid, Paseo Belén N 1, 47011 Valladolid, Spain.)","Carbonero-Martín, Miguel Á (University of Valladolid)","Arteaga-Cedeño, Wendy L (University of Valladolid); Carbonero-Martín, Miguel Á (University of Valladolid); Martín-Antón, Luis J (University of Valladolid); Molinero-González, Paula (University of Valladolid)",7,5,1.09,10.02,https://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/19/16/9882/pdf?version=1660197267,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1150177667,39 Education; 3901 Curriculum and Pedagogy; 3903 Education Systems,4 Quality Education

ProtoDUNE Dual Phase (DP) is a 6 ×$$\times $$ 6 ×$$\times $$ 6 m3$$^3$$ liquid argon time-projection-chamber (LArTPC) that recorded cosmic-muon data at the CERN Neutrino Platform in 2019–2020 as a prototype of the DUNE Far Detector. Charged particles propagating through the LArTPC produce ionization and scintillation light. The scintillation light signal in these detectors can provide the trigger for non-beam events. In addition, it adds precise timing capabilities and improves the calorimetry measurements. In ProtoDUNE-DP, scintillation and electroluminescence light produced by cosmic muons in the LArTPC is collected by photomultiplier tubes placed up to 7 m away from the ionizing track. In this paper, the ProtoDUNE-DP photon detection system performance is evaluated with a particular focus on the different wavelength shifters, such as PEN and TPB, and the use of Xe-doped LAr, considering its future use in giant LArTPCs. The scintillation light production and propagation processes are analyzed and a comparison of simulation to data is performed, improving understanding of the liquid argon properties.","The ProtoDUNE-DP detector was constructed and operated on the CERN Neutrino Platform.

This review aimed to synthesize evidence of the association between AIP values and CAD. A literature search was carried out on four databases, namely, PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Ovid-Medline. A handsearch was performed on preprint repositories (MedRxiv and Research Square). The effect measurements were expressed as odds ratios (OR) with their corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI). For the quantitative synthesis, we employed a random-effects model. We analyzed 14 articles (with 40,902 participants) from seven different countries. The quantitative analysis revealed that an increase in one unit of AIP was associated with higher odds of developing CAD (OR 2.11; 95% CI 1.65-2.69; P < 0.001; I 2 = 98%). We conducted subgroup analyses of Chinese (OR 1.89; 95% CI 1.40-2.56; P < 0.001) and non-Chinese studies (OR 2.51; 95% CI 1.42-4.42; P < 0.001). The sensitivity analysis by risk of bias continued to demonstrate an association, and the heterogeneity remained unchanged (OR 1.75; 95% CI 1.33-2.31; P < 0.001; I 2 = 98%).

This study aimed to evaluate the psychometric property of the GDS-15 and a simplified version among a large representative longevous population in China.MethodsA total of 1624 individuals (786 oldest-old persons aged from 80 to 99 years; 838 centenarians aged 100+ years) participated in this study. Home interviews with structured questionnaires were conducted to collect sociodemographic data. Depressive symptoms were measured using the Chinese GDS-15 version. We implemented mixed methods for the psychometric evaluation of the GDS-15. Cronbach’s α coefficient and item-total correlation coefficients were used to evaluate the internal consistency. A standard expert consultation was conducted to test the content validity of each item. Multiple factor analyses were used to explore the optimal factor structure and measurement invariance.ResultsThe α coefficient of the GDS-15 was 0.745, while two items impaired the overall consistency reliability. Nineteen experts rated the applicability for each item and provided removal suggestion. Five items with less validity were removed, and a simplified 10-item GDS model with three-factor structure was proposed as an optimal solution. The GDS-10 model showed factorial equivalence across age, sex, residence, and education in multi-group confirmatory factor analyses.ConclusionsThe original GDS-15 has acceptable internal reliability, known-group validity, and concurrent validity among Chinese community-dwelling oldest-old and centenarians; however we provided preliminary evidence indicating that individual items related to somatic function or social activities may not be applicable for this population. The modified GDS-10 can be proposed as a potentially more practical and comprehensible instrument for depression screening.","We thank all the staff of the China Hainan Centenarian Cohort Study for their joint efforts and cooperation. We also appreciate the 16 external experts for their professional suggestions on the applicability and modification of the Chinese version of GDS-15.

However, they have to meet strict synchronization requirements before their use is generalized. When clock or local oscillator signals are generated locally at each of the distributed nodes, achieving exact synchronization in absolute phase, frequency, and time is a complex problem. In addition, satellite systems have significant resource constraints, especially for small satellites, which are envisioned to be part of the future CDSSs. Thus, the development of precise, robust, and resource-efficient synchronization techniques is essential for the advancement of future CDSSs. In this context, this survey aims to summarize and categorize the most relevant results on synchronization techniques for Distributed Satellite Systems (DSSs). First, some important architecture and system concepts are defined. Then, the synchronization methods reported in the literature are reviewed and categorized. This article also provides an extensive list of applications and examples of synchronization techniques for DSSs in addition to the most significant advances in other operations closely related to synchronization, such as inter-satellite ranging and relative position. The survey also provides a discussion on emerging data-driven synchronization techniques based on Machine Learning (ML). Finally, a compilation of current research activities and potential research topics is proposed, identifying problems and open challenges that can be useful for researchers in the field.","For the purpose of open access, the author has applied a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International (CCBY4.0) license to any Author Accepted Manuscript version arising from this submission.","This work was supported by the Luxembourg National Research Fund (FNR), through the CORE Project COHEsive SATellite (COHESAT): Cognitive Cohesive Networks of Distributed Units for Active and Passive Space Applications, under Grant FNR11689919.",IEEE Access,,,,2022-01-01,2022,2022-04-22,2022-01-01,10,,45375-45409,All OA; Gold,Article,"Marrero, Liz Martinez; Merlano-Duncan, Juan Carlos; Querol, Jorge; Kumar, Sumit; Krivochiza, Jevgenij; Sharma, Shree Krishna; Chatzinotas, Symeon; Camps, Adriano; Ottersten, Björn","Marrero, Liz Martinez (Interdisciplinary Centre for Security, Reliability and Trust (SnT), University of Luxembourg, 1855, Luxembourg, Luxembourg); Merlano-Duncan, Juan Carlos (Interdisciplinary Centre for Security, Reliability and Trust (SnT), University of Luxembourg, 1855, Luxembourg, Luxembourg); Querol, Jorge (Interdisciplinary Centre for Security, Reliability and Trust (SnT), University of Luxembourg, 1855, Luxembourg, Luxembourg); Kumar, Sumit (Interdisciplinary Centre for Security, Reliability and Trust (SnT), University of Luxembourg, 1855, Luxembourg, Luxembourg); Krivochiza, Jevgenij (Interdisciplinary Centre for Security, Reliability and Trust (SnT), University of Luxembourg, 1855, Luxembourg, Luxembourg); Sharma, Shree Krishna (Interdisciplinary Centre for Security, Reliability and Trust (SnT), University of Luxembourg, 1855, Luxembourg, Luxembourg); Chatzinotas, Symeon (Interdisciplinary Centre for Security, Reliability and Trust (SnT), University of Luxembourg, 1855, Luxembourg, Luxembourg); Camps, Adriano (Department of Signal Theory and Communications, Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya, 08034, Barcelona, Spain; Institut d’Estudis Espacials de Catalunya, 08034, Barcelona, Spain); Ottersten, Björn (Interdisciplinary Centre for Security, Reliability and Trust (SnT), University of Luxembourg, 1855, Luxembourg, Luxembourg)","Marrero, Liz Martinez (University of Luxembourg)","Marrero, Liz Martinez (University of Luxembourg); Merlano-Duncan, Juan Carlos (University of Luxembourg); Querol, Jorge (University of Luxembourg); Kumar, Sumit (University of Luxembourg); Krivochiza, Jevgenij (University of Luxembourg); Sharma, Shree Krishna (University of Luxembourg); Chatzinotas, Symeon (University of Luxembourg); Camps, Adriano (Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya; Institut d'Estudis Espacials de Catalunya); Ottersten, Björn (University of Luxembourg)",18,18,,9.02,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/ielx7/6287639/9668973/09761868.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1147324263,46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4606 Distributed Computing and Systems Software,

The teaching profession requires programmes that are geared towards emotional education that will enable teachers to develop emotional intelligence in order to foster their general well-being. The aims of this paper were: firstly, to test the effectiveness of the programme in emotional education implemented through group segmentation based on teachers' sociodemographic and work profile factors, and secondly, to ascertain whether there were any significant differences in the factors that make up the model of emotional intelligence with regard to the sociodemographic and work variables of teachers in the experimental group in a pre-post analysis study. The design of the research was experimental. The sample was made up of 351 infant and primary education teachers, 190 in the experimental group and 161 in the control group. We used the Trait Meta-Mood Scale-24 together with a questionnaire to define teachers' sociodemographic and work profiles. Implementing the emotional education programme led to significant differences in the three factors of emotional intelligence (perception, understanding and emotional regulation) depending on the sociodemographic and work profile of the teachers in the experimental group. Applying segmentation allows us to conclude that intervention programmes should be adapted to the sociodemographic and work profile of the participant group. When designing programmes, the method considered should be active, participative, flexible and focused on the teachers' own experience.",,This research received no external funding.,International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health,,Carlos Salavera,Humans; Infant; Emotional Intelligence; Social Skills; Behavior Therapy; Surveys and Questionnaires; Emotional Regulation; School Teachers,2022-11-25,2022,2022-11-25,,19,23,15702,All OA; Gold,Article,"Carbonero-Martín, Miguel Á; Arteaga-Cedeño, Wendy L; Martín-Antón, Luis J; Molinero-González, Paula","Carbonero-Martín, Miguel Á (Grupo de Investigación de Excelencia GIE-179, Departamento de Psicología, Facultad de Educación, Universidad de Valladolid, Paseo Belén N 1, 47011 Valladolid, Spain.); Arteaga-Cedeño, Wendy L (Grupo de Investigación de Excelencia GIE-179, Departamento de Psicología, Facultad de Educación, Universidad de Valladolid, Paseo Belén N 1, 47011 Valladolid, Spain.); Martín-Antón, Luis J (Grupo de Investigación de Excelencia GIE-179, Departamento de Psicología, Facultad de Educación, Universidad de Valladolid, Paseo Belén N 1, 47011 Valladolid, Spain.); Molinero-González, Paula (Grupo de Investigación de Excelencia GIE-179, Departamento de Psicología, Facultad de Educación, Universidad de Valladolid, Paseo Belén N 1, 47011 Valladolid, Spain.)","Carbonero-Martín, Miguel Á (University of Valladolid)","Carbonero-Martín, Miguel Á (University of Valladolid); Arteaga-Cedeño, Wendy L (University of Valladolid); Martín-Antón, Luis J (University of Valladolid); Molinero-González, Paula (University of Valladolid)",6,6,0.88,8.59,https://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/19/23/15702/pdf?version=1669378861,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1153264454,39 Education; 3901 Curriculum and Pedagogy; 3903 Education Systems,4 Quality Education

En este contexto, el profesorado ha tenido que hacer frente, en tiempo récord, al desarrollo de las competencias necesarias para poder continuar enseñando. En este marco, se presenta un estudio sobre la autopercepción que un grupo de profesorado en formación inicial de Galicia (España) tiene sobre su nivel de competencia digital docente, en general, y sobre sus conocimientos como profesionales capaces de crear contenido digital didáctico, en particular. Para ello, se ha elaborado un cuestionario ad hoc, partiendo del Marco común de competencia digital docente y de los marcos internacionales de International Society for Technology Education (ISTE) y Organización de las Naciones Unidas para la Educación, la Ciencia y la Cultura (Unesco), en el que ha participado el estudiantado vinculado a materias didáctico-científicas de los grados de Educación infantil y de Educación primaria de la Universidad de Vigo, durante el curso 2019-2020. Los resultados del estudio muestran un nivel medio-bajo en “competencia digital” y en la subcompetencia de “creación de contenidos”. Frente a esto, se aprecia una actitud muy positiva ante el uso educativo de las tecnologías de la información y comunicación (TIC). Además, los resultados indican que existen circunstancias personales como el sexo, la edad y los estudios de la madre que pueden influir en la percepción que el futuro profesorado tiene sobre sus conocimientos, habilidades y actitudes frente a las TIC y para la creación de contenido digital.
Abstract The current health emergency, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, has presented teachers at all levels of education with the challenge of online education, which, in many cases, has meant redesigning the teaching and learning process. In this context, teachers have had to develop, in record time, the necessary skills to continue teaching. Within this framework, a study has been presented on the self-perception a group of teachers in initial training in Galicia (Spain) have about their level of digital teaching competence, in general, and about their knowledge as professionals capable of creating educational digital content. For this purpose, an ad hoc questionnaire was developed, based on the Common Framework for Digital Competence in Teaching and the international frameworks of the International Society for Technology Education (ISTE) and the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), with the participation of students linked to educational-scientific subjects in the Early Childhood Education and Primary Education degrees at the University of Vigo during the academic year 2019-2020. The results of the study show a medium-low level in “digital competence” and in the sub-competence of “content creation”. In contrast, there is a very positive attitude towards the educational use of information and communication technologies (ICT). Furthermore, the results indicate that personal circumstances such as gender, age and the educational level of the subject’s mother may influence the future teachers’ perception of their knowledge, skills and attitudes towards ICT and the creation of digital content.",,"1- Investigación financiada por el Ministerio de Ciencia, Innovación y Universidades de España (EDU2017-82915-R) y el Fondo Europeo de Desarrollo Regional (FEDER/ Proyecto ESPIGA “Promoviendo el desarrollo del pensamiento crítico y de las dimensiones de implicación cognitiva y emocional de los desempeños epistémicos en las clases de ciencias en la era de la posverdad” —PGC2018-096581-B-C22). 1 - Investigación financiada por el Ministerio de Ciencia, Innovación y Universidades de España (EDU2017-82915-R) y el Fondo Europeo de Desarrollo Regional (FEDER/ Proyecto ESPIGA “Promoviendo el desarrollo del pensamiento crítico y de las dimensiones de implicación cognitiva y emocional de los desempeños epistémicos en las clases de ciencias en la era de la posverdad” —PGC2018-096581-B-C22).",Educação e Pesquisa,,,,2022,2022,2022,,48,,e243510,All OA; Gold,Article,"Rodríguez, Nuria Castiñeira; Lorenzo-Rial, María-Asunción; Rodríguez, Uxío Pérez","Rodríguez, Nuria Castiñeira (Universidad de Vigo, Galicia, España, ncastineirarodriguez@gmail.com, marialorenzo@uvigo.es, uxio.perez@uvigo.es, - Universidad de Vigo, Galicia, España.

269,pub.1149272771,10.1016/j.egyr.2022.06.116,,,Battery energy storage performance in microgrids: A scientific mapping perspective,"Microgrids integrate various renewable resources, such as photovoltaic and wind energy, and battery energy storage systems. The latter is an important component of a modern energy system, as it allows the seamless integration of renewable energy sources in the grid. The research here presented aimed to develop an integrated review using a systematic and bibliometric approach to evaluate the performance and challenges in applying battery energy storage systems in microgrids. Search protocols based on a literature review were used; this included thematic visualization and performance analysis using the scientific mapping software SciMAT (Science Mapping Analysis Software Tool). The results show that optimization methods in battery energy storage systems are important for this research field. In research works, they are interested in applying methods to reduce costs; this includes considering the state of charge, the degradation rate, and battery life. Developing an optimal battery energy storage system must consider various factors including reliability, battery technology, power quality, frequency variations, and environmental conditions. Economic factors are the most common challenges for developing a battery energy storage system, as researchers have focused on cost–benefit analysis.",This research did not receive any specific grant from funding agencies.,,Energy Reports,,,,2022-11,2022,,2022-11,8,,259-268,All OA; Gold,Article,"Zarate-Perez, Eliseo; Rosales-Asensio, Enrique; González-Martínez, Alberto; de Simón-Martín, Miguel; Colmenar-Santos, Antonio","Zarate-Perez, Eliseo (Department of Engineering, Universidad Privada del Norte – UPN, Av.

Until now, the microbial communities that inhabit or have inhabited soils of hyperarid environments at greater depths have been poorly studied. We analyzed for the first time the variation in microbial communities down to a depth of 3.4 m in one of the driest places of the world, the hyperarid Yungay region in the Atacama Desert, and we related it to changes in soil physico-chemical characteristics. We found that the moisture content changed from 2 to 11% with depth and enabled the differentiation of three depth intervals: (i) surface zone A (0-60 cm), (ii) intermediate zone B (60-220 cm), and (iii) deep zone C (220-340 cm). Each zone showed further specific physicochemical and mineralogical features. Likewise, some bacterial phyla were unique in each zone, i.e., members of the taxa Deinococcota, Halobacterota, and Latescibacterota in zone A; Crenarchaeota, Fusobacteriota, and Deltaproteobacterium Sva0485 in zone B; and Fervidibacteria and Campilobacterota in zone C, which indicates taxon-specific preferences in deep soil habitats. Differences in the microbiota between the zones were rather abrupt, which is concomitant with abrupt changes in the physical-chemical parameters. Overall, moisture content, total carbon (TC), pH, and electric conductivity (EC) were most predictive of microbial richness and diversity, while total sulfur (TS) and total phosphorous (TP) contents were additionally predictive of community composition. We also found statistically significant associations between taxa and soil properties, most of which involved moisture and TC contents. Our findings show that under-explored habitats for microbial survival and existence may prevail at greater soil depths near water or within water-bearing layers, a valuable substantiation also for the ongoing search for biosignatures on other planets, such as Mars.",We want to thank the technician team at beamline 8 of the SLRI for assistance during the P XANES measurements.,,Frontiers in Microbiology,,,,2022-02-07,2022,2022-02-07,,12,,794743,All OA; Gold,Article,"Fuentes, Bárbara; Choque, Alessandra; Gómez, Francisco; Alarcón, Jaime; Castro-Nallar, Eduardo; Arenas, Franko; Contreras, Daniel; Mörchen, Ramona; Amelung, Wulf; Knief, Claudia; Moradi, Ghazal; Klumpp, Erwin; Saavedra, Claudia P.; Prietzel, Jörg; Klysubun, Wantana; Remonsellez, Francisco; Bol, Roland","Fuentes, Bárbara (Departamento de Ingeniería Química, Universidad Católica del Norte, Antofagasta, Chile); Choque, Alessandra (Departamento de Ingeniería Química, Universidad Católica del Norte, Antofagasta, Chile; Programa de Doctorado en Ciencias Mención Geología, Universidad Católica del Norte, Antofagasta, Chile); Gómez, Francisco (Departamento de Ingeniería Química, Universidad Católica del Norte, Antofagasta, Chile); Alarcón, Jaime (Center for Bioinformatics and Integrative Biology, Universidad Andres Bello, Santiago, Chile); Castro-Nallar, Eduardo (Center for Bioinformatics and Integrative Biology, Universidad Andres Bello, Santiago, Chile); Arenas, Franko (Programa de Doctorado en Ciencias Mención Geología, Universidad Católica del Norte, Antofagasta, Chile); Contreras, Daniel (Programa de Doctorado en Ciencias Mención Geología, Universidad Católica del Norte, Antofagasta, Chile); Mörchen, Ramona (Institute of Crop Science and Resource Conservation, Soil Science and Soil Ecology, University of Bonn, Bonn, Germany); Amelung, Wulf (Institute of Crop Science and Resource Conservation, Soil Science and Soil Ecology, University of Bonn, Bonn, Germany); Knief, Claudia (Institute of Crop Science and Resource Conservation, Molecular Biology of the Rhizosphere, University of Bonn, Bonn, Germany); Moradi, Ghazal (Institute of Bio and Geosciences, Agrosphere (IBG-3), Forschungszentrum Jülich GmbH, Jülich, Germany); Klumpp, Erwin (Institute of Bio and Geosciences, Agrosphere (IBG-3), Forschungszentrum Jülich GmbH, Jülich, Germany); Saavedra, Claudia P.

In the present research, we aimed to determine the internal consistency and validity of the Stress Factors and Manifestations Scale for in-hospital and out-of-hospital emergency workers. Methods: A quantitative, prospective, cross-sectional, and observational study including 269 emergency service professionals. Results: The scale was composed of 21 items, with a Cronbach’s α value of 0.908. The hospital workers (38.4 ± 10.8 vs. 35.1 ± 9.9, p = 0.014) and women (39.3 ± 11.4 vs. 34.2 ± 8.6, p < 0.001) had higher levels of stress. The sensitivity, specificity, and predictive values of the scale were adequate. Conclusion: In the present study, including in-hospital and out-of-hospital emergency workers, the Stress Factors and Manifestations Scale presented appropriate usefulness, internal consistency, and validity, with optimal predictive ability. Higher levels of anxiety, female gender, being less optimistic, and working in hospital emergency departments were related to increased stress levels.

Therefore, a review is needed to contribute to the understanding of this term, which is under constant debate. This article aims to analyze scientific articles from qualitative and quantitative research approaches on the circular economy. The methodology used was a systematic review of scientific literature from Scopus and Web of Science; 67 scientific articles were systematized under inclusion and exclusion criteria related to the specific objectives sought. The results showed that there is still a long way to go in developing a theoretical framework that can be put into practice due to the divergence of existing perspectives or approaches, although its application to different fields of study is being considered. Likewise, its complex character is highlighted, while driving or limiting factors are observed. This research provides a theoretical contribution aimed at elucidating which implications of the circular economy need to be addressed in order to build a universal or flexible theory to understand what it means to plan for the implementation of the circular economy. In this way, it hopes to strengthen its practical application, which implies the need to create an overarching framework that can be adapted to different contexts and provide clear guidance on how to be part of the circular economy.",The support of the Universidad Privada del Norte is gratefully acknowledged.,This research received no external funding.,Sustainability,,,,2022-11-08,2022,2022-11-08,,14,22,14682,All OA; Gold,Article,"Vargas-Merino, Jorge Alberto; Rios-Lama, Cristian Armando; Panez-Bendezú, Miguel Humberto","Vargas-Merino, Jorge Alberto (Faculty of Business, School of Management, Universidad Privada del Norte, San Juan de Lurigancho, Lima 15434, Peru); Rios-Lama, Cristian Armando (Faculty of Business, School of Marketing and Management, Universidad César Vallejo, Los Olivos 15314, Peru); Panez-Bendezú, Miguel Humberto (Department of Research, Innovation and Social Responsibility, Universidad Privada del Norte, Breña 15083, Peru)","Vargas-Merino, Jorge Alberto (Private University of the North)","Vargas-Merino, Jorge Alberto (Private University of the North); Rios-Lama, Cristian Armando (Universidad César Vallejo); Panez-Bendezú, Miguel Humberto (Private University of the North)",6,5,,8.38,https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/14/22/14682/pdf?version=1667903566,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1152597338,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4610 Library and Information Studies",12 Responsible Consumption and Production

Among the FAs, docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) has been widely recognized as a key molecule for neuronal function and cell signaling. Despite its relevance, the molecular pathways underlying the beneficial effects of DHA on the cells of the CNS are still unclear. Here, we summarize and discuss the molecular mechanisms underlying the actions of DHA in neural cells with a special focus on processes of survival, morphological development, and synaptic maturation. In addition, we examine the evidence supporting a potential therapeutic role of DHA against CNS tumor diseases and tumorigenesis. The current results suggest that DHA exerts its actions on neural cells mainly through the modulation of signaling cascades involving the activation of diverse types of receptors. In addition, we found evidence connecting brain DHA and ω-3 PUFA levels with CNS diseases, such as depression, autism spectrum disorders, obesity, and neurodegenerative diseases. In the context of cancer, the existing data have shown that DHA exerts positive actions as a coadjuvant in antitumoral therapy. Although many questions in the field remain only partially resolved, we hope that future research may soon define specific pathways and receptor systems involved in the beneficial effects of DHA in cells of the CNS, opening new avenues for innovative therapeutic strategies for CNS diseases.","We thank Felipe Serrano (www.illustrative-science.com, accessed on 7 February 2022) for figure design, and Katterine Salazar (Universidad de Concepcion, Chile) for helpful criticisms.","This research was funded by ANID-FONDECYT 1211082 (G.E.Y.), Núcleo para el estudio del cancer a nivel básico, aplicado y clínico, VRIDT UCN 20210401007 (C.C.), and by the Millennium Nucleus for the Study of Pain (MiNuSPain).

The first section starts examining Émile Durkheim's classical conception on CE, and then, the integrative one proposed by the sociologist Randall Collins, leading to a multi-faceted experience of synchronization. Then, we analyze the construct as a process emerging in collective encounters when individuals contact with social ideal and values, referring to the classical work of Serge Moscovici as well as those more recent empirical approaches. Third, we consider CE as a set of intense positive emotions linked to processes of group identification, as proposed by authors of the Social Identity Theory tradition. Finally, we describe CE from the perspective of self-transcendence (e.g., emotions, experiences), and propose a unified description of this construct. The second section shows the results of a meta-analytical integration (k = 50, N = 182,738) aimed at analyzing CE's proximal effects or construct validity (i.e., Individual Emotions and Communal Sharing) as well as its association with more distal variables, such as Collective Emotions, Social Integration, Social Values and Beliefs and Empowerment. Results indicate that CE strongly associates with Individual Emotions -in particular, Self-Transcendent Emotions- and Communal Sharing constructs (e.g., Group Identity, Fusion of Identity), providing construct validity. Among the distal effects of CE, it is associated with Collective Positive Emotions, long-term Social Integration (e.g., Ingroup Commitment), Social Values and Beliefs and Empowerment-related variables (e.g., Wellbeing, Collective Efficacy, Collective Self-Esteem). Among the moderation analyses carried out (e.g., study design, CE scale, type of collective gathering), the effects of CE in demonstrations are noticeable, where this variable is a factor that favors other variables that make collective action possible, such as Group Identity (r pooled = 0.52), Collective Efficacy (r pooled = 0.37), Negative and Self-Transcendent Emotions (r pooled = 0.14 and 0.58), and Morality-related beliefs (r pooled = 0.43).","We would like to express our sincere thanks to all the people who have made this work possible, to members of the Culture, Cognition and Emotion group (University of the Basque Country UPV/EHU), and the valuable criticisms and comments received from the Kama Muta Lab and participants of the ISPP 2021 conference on an early version of this article.","This research was supported by grants given to the research team Culture, Cognition and Emotion (Psicología Social CCE), the Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness ([Ref.: PSI2017-84145-P and Ref.: PID2020-115738GB-I00), the Basque Government (Ref.: GIC12/91 IT-666-13, IT1187-19, and IT1598-22]), and a post-doc grant from the UPV/EHU to JP (DOCBERRI 20/23).",Frontiers in Psychology,,,,2022-08-31,2022,2022-08-31,,13,,974683,All OA; Gold,Article,"Pizarro, José J.; Zumeta, Larraitz N.; Bouchat, Pierre; Włodarczyk, Anna; Rimé, Bernard; Basabe, Nekane; Amutio, Alberto; Páez, Darío","Pizarro, José J.

Their negative impacts on human health and shellfish exploitation are determined by toxic potential of the local strains and toxin biotransformations by exploited bivalve species. Chile has become, in a decade, the world's major exporter of mussels (Mytilus chilensis) and scallops (Argopecten purpuratus) and has implemented toxin testing according to importing countries' demands. Species of the Dinophysis acuminata complex and Protoceratium reticulatum are the most widespread and abundant LT producers in Chile. Dominant D. acuminata strains, notwithstanding, unlike most strains in Europe rich in okadaic acid (OA), produce only pectenotoxins, with no impact on human health. Dinophysis acuta, suspected to be the main cause of diarrhetic shellfish poisoning outbreaks, is found in the two southernmost regions of Chile, and has apparently shifted poleward. Mouse bioassay (MBA) is the official method to control shellfish safety for the national market.

262,pub.1146317664,10.1080/23311886.2022.2047259,,,An analysis of the causes and contributing factors to human trafficking: A South African perspective,"Trafficking in human beings, especially women and girls, is not new. Historically, it has taken many forms, but in the context of globalization, has acquired shocking new dimensions. It is a complex, multi-faceted phenomenon involving multiple stakeholders at the institutional and commercial level. This article attempts to explore and analysis the causes and contributing factors to human trafficking. This research was carried out utilising a qualitative approach. Forty interviews were carried out among officials deployed in the Directorate for Priority Crime Investigation (DPCI), the South African Police Service (SAPS), the Department of Home Affairs (DHA), the Department of Social Development (DSD), the Gauteng Provincial Office, as well as with the victims regarding their views and experiences on the stakeholder’s involved in combating and investigating human trafficking. The interviews were analysed according to the phenomenographic approach to identify the participants’ responses. The reason for this choice was to identify key or knowledgeable participants about human trafficking in three selected areas of Gauteng Province. The key findings indicated that the growing demand for foreign workers for domestic and care-giving roles, and lack of adequate corresponding regulations contribute immensely on human trafficking. The findings further indicated that lack of legitimate and fulfilling employment opportunities, particularly in rural communities contribute to human trafficking. The findings further indicated that demand for women’s sexual services and the growth of the billion-rand sex entertainment industry contribute to human trafficking. Based on the findings, the authors provided with the recommendations such as: improved awareness in social media platforms, multi-disciplinary unit dealing with human trafficking within the DPCI, and tougher laws and legislations on prostitution, women’s sexual services and sex entertainment industry.",,The authors received no direct funding for this research.,Cogent Social Sciences,,,,2022-03-16,2022,2022-03-16,2022-12-31,8,1,2047259,All OA; Gold,Article,"Motseki, Moses Morero; Mofokeng, Jacob Tseko","Motseki, Moses Morero (Department of Safety and Security management, Tshwane University of Technology, staatsartillerie Rd, Pretoria, 0183, Pretoria, South Africa); Mofokeng, Jacob Tseko (Department of Safety and Security management, Tshwane University of Technology, staatsartillerie Rd, Pretoria, 0183, Pretoria, South Africa)","Motseki, Moses Morero (Tshwane University of Technology)","Motseki, Moses Morero (Tshwane University of Technology); Mofokeng, Jacob Tseko (Tshwane University of Technology)",7,6,,8.26,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/23311886.2022.2047259?needAccess=true,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1146317664,44 Human Society; 4402 Criminology; 4410 Sociology,"16 Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions; 8 Decent Work and Economic Growth"

The Intention to Become a Successor of Latin American Students with Entrepreneur Parents,"The article presents an extension of the theory of planned behaviour (TPB) to identify, in a Latin American university, the students who are children of entrepreneurial parents and the determinants of their willingness to succeed them. The TPB is used as a basis to analyse the intention to be a successor, and three constructs are added: affective commitment, normative commitment and parental role model. The analysis is carried out using structural equations via the partial least squares (PLS) method, which allows for the study of multiple relationships between construct-type variables. The sample includes 16,185 Latin American university students from the Global University Entrepreneurial Spirit Students’ Survey 2018 database. The results show that, in Latin American students, the determining factors in the intention to be a successor are attitude, the affective and normative commitment and the parental role model. The latter has a negative and significant effect on the intention to be a successor in the family business. One of the practical implications of this study has to do with the development of an affective feeling of the offspring towards the family business. Generating this kind of attachment since childhood could lead to achieving a greater relevance of the parental role model and a stronger interest in the succession of the business.",,This research received no external funding.,Sustainability,,,,2022-01-21,2022,2022-01-21,,14,3,1193,All OA; Gold,Article,"Romaní, Gianni; Soria-Barreto, Karla; Honores-Marín, Guillermo; Escorcia, Rafael Ruiz; Rueda, Javier","Romaní, Gianni (Centro de Emprendimiento y de la Pyme, Núcleo de Investigación en Emprendimiento y Alternativas de Financiamiento, Facultad de Economía y Administración, Universidad Católica del Norte, Antofagasta 1240000, Chile); Soria-Barreto, Karla (Escuela de Ciencias Empresariales, Núcleo de Investigación en Emprendimiento y Alternativas de Financiamiento, Universidad Católica del Norte, Coquimbo 1780000, Chile;, ksoria@ucn.cl, (K.S.-B.);, guillermo.honores@ucn.cl, (G.H.-M.)); Honores-Marín, Guillermo (Escuela de Ciencias Empresariales, Núcleo de Investigación en Emprendimiento y Alternativas de Financiamiento, Universidad Católica del Norte, Coquimbo 1780000, Chile;, ksoria@ucn.cl, (K.S.-B.);, guillermo.honores@ucn.cl, (G.H.-M.)); Escorcia, Rafael Ruiz (Facultad de Ciencias Básicas, Ingenierías y Arquitectura—Corporación Universitaria del Caribe CECAR, Sincelejo 700001, Colombia;, rafael.ruize@cecar.edu.co); Rueda, Javier (Facultad de Administración de Empresas, Universidad de Investigación y Desarrollo UDI, Bucaramanga 680004, Colombia;, jrueda31@udi.edu.co)","Romaní, Gianni (Catholic University of the North)","Romaní, Gianni (Catholic University of the North); Soria-Barreto, Karla (Catholic University of the North); Honores-Marín, Guillermo (Catholic University of the North); Escorcia, Rafael Ruiz (Corporación Universitaria del Caribe); Rueda, Javier (Universitaria de Investigación y Desarrollo)",10,10,,8.12,https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/14/3/1193/pdf?version=1642748786,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1144934074,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3507 Strategy, Management and Organisational Behaviour",

The objective of the present study is to measure brand loyalty to healthy foods in Peru, not only in a pandemic context, but also in a natural context based on the dimensions of the PERVAL value scale. Data were collected through an online survey and processed using partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM). The results of the model among 396 consumers revealed that qualitative value and emotional value have the highest contribution to brand loyalty, followed by economic value and social value. These findings suggest that product quality should be taken as a priority and, although social value does not contribute much to health food brand loyalty, it is a trend sought after by consumers.",,This research is funded by the researchers.,Sustainability,,,,2022-08-24,2022,2022-08-24,,14,17,10529,All OA; Gold,Article,"García-Salirrosas, Elizabeth Emperatriz; Millones-Liza, Dany Yudet; Esponda-Pérez, Jorge Alberto; Acevedo-Duque, Ángel; Müller-Pérez, Jessica; Díaz, Lisette C.

In particular, we consider metrics of the Eguchi-Hanson and Taub-NUT families to solve the field equations analytically. The solutions have nontrivial topology labeled by the Hirzebruch signature and Euler characteristic that we compute explicitly. We find that, although the solutions are locally inequivalent with the original (anti-)self-dual Eguchi-Hanson metric, they have the same global properties in the flat limit. We revisit the Taub-NUT solution previously found in the literature, analyze their nuts and bolts structure, and obtain the renormalized Euclidean on-shell action as well as their topological invariants. Additionally, we discuss how the solutions get modified in presence of higher-curvature corrections that respect conformal invariance. In the conformally invariant case, we obtain novel Eguchi-Hanson and Taub-NUT solutions and demonstrate that both Euclidean on-shell action and Noether-Wald charges are finite without any reference to intrinsic boundary counterterms.",,,Journal of High Energy Physics,,,,2022-05-17,2022,2022-05-17,,2022,5,110,All OA; Gold,Article,"Barrientos, José; Cisterna, Adolfo; Corral, Cristóbal; Oyarzo, Marcelo","Barrientos, José (Institute of Mathematics of the Czech Academy of Sciences, Žitná 25, 11567, Praha 1, Czech Republic; Departamento de Enseñanza de las Ciencias Básicas, Universidad Católica del Norte, Larrondo, 1281, Coquimbo, Chile); Cisterna, Adolfo (Sede Esmeralda, Universidad de Tarapacá, Av.

This shows that the molecular ring, forming the waist of the bipolar nebula, expands with a velocity of 1–1.9 km s−1. We also observe an increased line width in the ring, indicating that turbulence is driven by energy injection from the stellar feedback. The bipolar cavity hosts blueshifted expanding [C ii] shells at 5.2 ± 0.5 ± 0.5 km s−1 (statistical and systematic uncertainty), which indicates that expansion out of the dense gas happens nonuniformly and that the observed bipolar phase might be relatively short (∼0.2 Myr). The X-ray observations show diffuse emission that traces a hot plasma, created by stellar winds, in and around RCW 36. At least 50% of the stellar wind energy is missing in RCW 36. This is likely due to leakage that is clearing even larger cavities around the bipolar RCW 36 region. Lastly, the cavities host high-velocity wings in [C ii], which indicates relatively high mass ejection rates (∼5 × 10−4 M ⊙ yr−1). This could be driven by stellar winds and/or radiation but remains difficult to constrain. This local mass ejection, which can remove all mass within 1 pc of RCW 36 in 1–2 Myr, and the large-scale clearing of ambient gas in the Vela C cloud indicate that stellar feedback plays a significant role in suppressing the star formation efficiency.","We thank the anonymous referee for detailed and very insightful comments that significantly improved the quality of this paper.

The research was carried out using an explanatory cross-sectional design, with the participation of 1011 pre-professional interns of 13 health networks from the department of Puno (Peru). Data were collected using the Satisfaction with Life Scale, Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale-2, Patient Health Questionnaire 2, and the Psychological Wellbeing Scale. The main data analysis was carried out using the R statistical software, and implementing the confirmatory factor analysis technique, which evidenced that the explanatory model provides an acceptable value. Based on the above, a negative relationship between depression and life satisfaction, (β = -.60, p < .001) and a positive relationship between anxiety and life satisfaction (β = .28, p < .001) was shown, in addition to a mediating effect of the psychological wellbeing related to depression and life satisfaction (p < .001). In conclusion, life satisfaction is explained concerning the degree of depression and anxiety, as well as the moderating effect of psychological well-being. Despite that, there is an urgent need to take preventive actions to strengthen the mental health of the pre-professional health interns, who have also been providing support during the COVID-19 pandemic.",,"This research did not receive any specific grant from funding agencies in the public, commercial, or not-for-profit sectors.",Heliyon,,,,2022-10-13,2022,2022-10-13,2022-10,8,10,e11025,All OA; Gold,Article,"Mamani-Benito, Oscar; Esteban, Renzo Felipe Carranza; Castillo-Blanco, Ronald; Caycho-Rodriguez, Tomás; Tito-Betancur, Madona; Farfán-Solís, Rosa","Mamani-Benito, Oscar (Facultad de Derecho y Humanidades, Universidad Señor de Sipán, Chiclayo, Peru); Esteban, Renzo Felipe Carranza (Grupo de Investigación Avances en Investigación Psicológica, Facultad de Ciencias de la Salud, Universidad San Ignacio de Loyola, Lima, Peru); Castillo-Blanco, Ronald (Departamento de Gestión del Aprendizaje, Universidad del Pacífico, Lima, Peru); Caycho-Rodriguez, Tomás (Facultad de Ciencias de la Salud, Universidad Privada del Norte, Lima, Peru); Tito-Betancur, Madona (Facultad de Derecho, Universidad Tecnologica del Perú, Arequipa, Peru); Farfán-Solís, Rosa (Dirección Regional de Salud, Puno, Peru)","Mamani-Benito, Oscar (Universidad Señor de Sipán)","Mamani-Benito, Oscar (Universidad Señor de Sipán); Esteban, Renzo Felipe Carranza (Universidad San Ignacio de Loyola); Castillo-Blanco, Ronald (University of the Pacific); Caycho-Rodriguez, Tomás (Private University of the North); Tito-Betancur, Madona (Universidad Tecnológica del Perú); Farfán-Solís, Rosa (Dirección Regional de Salud, Puno, Peru)",12,12,2.81,7.98,http://www.cell.com/article/S2405844022023131/pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1151852530,42 Health Sciences; 4203 Health Services and Systems; 52 Psychology; 5203 Clinical and Health Psychology,3 Good Health and Well Being

This research provides important information regarding the influence of the type of solvent used in extracting organic reducing agents from E. globulus on the FeO NPs green synthesis protocol. A broad approach to characterization is presented, where UV-vis spectrophotometry suggests the presence of this type of nanoparticulate material. Likewise, the reduction mechanism was evaluated by FT-IR and the magnetic properties were evaluated by PPSM. In addition, characterizations were linked via elemental analysis (EDX), crystallographic characterization (XRD), electron microscopy (SEM/STEM), and Z potential to evaluate colloidal stability.

Here we describe the first empirical testing of a drone-mounted thermal infrared sensor for nocturnal sea turtle monitoring; on the Osa peninsula in Costa Rica. Preliminary flights verified that the drone could detect similar sea turtle activities as identified by on-the-ground human patrollers – such as turtles, nests and tracks. Drone observers could even differentiate tracks of different sea turtle species, detect sea turtle hatchlings, other wildlife, and potential poachers. We carried out pilot flights to determine optimal parameters for detection by testing different thermal visualization modes, drone heights, and gimbal angles. Then, over seven nights, we set up a trial to compare the thermal drone and operators’ detections with those observed by traditional patrollers. Our trials showed that thermal drones can record more information than traditional sea turtle monitoring methods. The drone and observer detected 20% more sea turtles or tracks than traditional ground-based patrolling (flights and patrols carried out across the same nights at the same time and beach). In addition, the drone operator detected 39 other animals/predators and three potential poachers that patrollers failed to detect. Although the technology holds great promise in being able to enhance detection rates of nesting turtles and other beach activity, and in helping to keep observers safer, we detail challenges and limiting factors; in drone imagery, current cost barriers, and technological advances that need to be assessed and developed before standardized methodologies can be adopted. We suggest potential ways to overcome these challenges and recommend how further studies can help to optimize thermal drones to enhance sea turtle monitoring efforts worldwide.",,"This work was supported by the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation, and the International Conservation Fund for Canada.",Frontiers in Conservation Science,,,,2022-07-28,2022,2022-07-28,,3,,954791,All OA; Gold,Article,"Sellés-Ríos, Bárbara; Flatt, Eleanor; Ortiz-García, Johan; García-Colomé, Júlia; Latour, Orane; Whitworth, Andrew","Sellés-Ríos, Bárbara (Science Department, Osa Conservation, Washington D.C., WA, United States); Flatt, Eleanor (Science Department, Osa Conservation, Washington D.C., WA, United States; Deanery of Biomedical Sciences, College of Medicine and Veterinary Medicine, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, United Kingdom); Ortiz-García, Johan (Science Department, Osa Conservation, Washington D.C., WA, United States); García-Colomé, Júlia (Science Department, Osa Conservation, Washington D.C., WA, United States); Latour, Orane (Science Department, Osa Conservation, Washington D.C., WA, United States); Whitworth, Andrew (Science Department, Osa Conservation, Washington D.C., WA, United States; Institute of Biodiversity, Animal Health and Comparative Medicine, College of Medical, Veterinary and Life Sciences, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, United Kingdom; Department of Biology, Center for Energy, Environment, and Sustainability, Wake Forest University, Winston-Salem, NC, United States)","Sellés-Ríos, Bárbara (Science Department, Osa Conservation, Washington D.C., WA, United States); Whitworth, Andrew (Science Department, Osa Conservation, Washington D.C., WA, United States; University of Glasgow; Wake Forest University)","Sellés-Ríos, Bárbara (Science Department, Osa Conservation, Washington D.C., WA, United States); Flatt, Eleanor (Science Department, Osa Conservation, Washington D.C., WA, United States; University of Edinburgh); Ortiz-García, Johan (Science Department, Osa Conservation, Washington D.C., WA, United States); García-Colomé, Júlia (Science Department, Osa Conservation, Washington D.C., WA, United States); Latour, Orane (Science Department, Osa Conservation, Washington D.C., WA, United States); Whitworth, Andrew (Science Department, Osa Conservation, Washington D.C., WA, United States; University of Glasgow; Wake Forest University)",10,9,,7.86,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fcosc.2022.954791/pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1149817979,"33 Built Environment and Design; 3301 Architecture; 41 Environmental Sciences; 4104 Environmental Management; 43 History, Heritage and Archaeology; 4302 Heritage, Archive and Museum Studies",

The nonlinearity and spatiotemporal variability of the interactions between different flow phases makes the multi-phase flow measurement a challenging task. Two Sliding Mode Observer (SMO) schemes are proposed in this study for the state estimation of a decentralized multi-phase flow measurement system. The developed observers are shown to be theoretically valid and numerically applicable for a real-life case study data. The multi-phase flow system considered in this paper can be described as two interconnected sub-systems including fluid and gas sub-systems, and two scenarios are considered in the design of the observers. The first scenario considers the interconnections as bounded disturbance (SMOD), while the second scenario considers the interconnections as an uncertainty (SMOU). Hence, the Sliding Mode Observers are adopted to mitigate the effects of disturbance in the system and uncertainties in the parameters. Numerical simulations are conducted using MATLAB and dynamic HYSYS simultaneously, using the data obtained from field-based multi-phase flow measurements. The results demonstrate the appropriateness and robustness of the proposed Sliding Mode Observer (SMO) for estimation of the multi-phase fluid specifications including the density, velocity, and the volume phases fraction in each subsystem. The analysis of the results highlights that the proposed model is computationally efficient with fast transient response, accurate tracking capability of the real process data, and very low steady-state error. This study shows that choosing an appropriate Lyapunov-Krasovsky function results in the asymptotic stability of the decentralized system and improves the performance of the proposed observers. Uncertainty analysis is conducted on the velocity estimation results obtained from the Sliding Observers. Overall, SMOU method shown better performance with RMSE of 0.24%, while RMSE of 0.46% was achieved for the SMOD. Comparison of the numerical results with the field-based flow measurement, as a benchmark, shows that although uncertainty in SMOU is approximately half of the uncertainty in SMOD, state estimation for both schemes was achieved in a finite time with high order of precision. It was shown that both observers developed in this study are well capable of estimating the multi-phase flow variables and states.",,"This research did not receive any specific grant from funding agencies in the public, commercial, or not-for-profit sectors.",Heliyon,,,,2022-01-19,2022,2022-01-19,2022-02,8,2,e08768,All OA; Gold,Article,"Farahani, Abolfazl Varvani; Abolfathi, Soroush","Farahani, Abolfazl Varvani (Faculty of Engineering, Shahid Beheshti University, Tehran, Iran); Abolfathi, Soroush (School of Engineering, University of Warwick, Coventry, UK)","Farahani, Abolfazl Varvani (Shahid Beheshti University)","Farahani, Abolfazl Varvani (Shahid Beheshti University); Abolfathi, Soroush (University of Warwick)",14,10,0.68,7.73,https://wrap.warwick.ac.uk/162034/13/WRAP-Sliding-mode-observer-design-decentralized-multi-phase-flow-estimation-2022.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1144778627,"40 Engineering; 4007 Control Engineering, Mechatronics and Robotics; 4010 Engineering Practice and Education",7 Affordable and Clean Energy

Thus, the BR signaling regulators have the potential to be targeted for gene editing to optimize the architecture of plants and make them more resilient to environmental stress. Our understanding of the BR signaling mechanism in monocot crop species is limited compared to our knowledge of this process accumulated in the model dicot species - Arabidopsis thaliana. A deeper understanding of the BR signaling and response during plant growth and adaptation to continually changing environmental conditions will provide insight into mechanisms that govern the coordinated expression of the BR signaling genes in rice (Oryza sativa) which is a model for cereal crops. Therefore, in this study a comprehensive and detailed in silico analysis of promoter sequences of rice BR signaling genes was performed. Moreover, expression profiles of these genes during various developmental stages and reactions to several stress conditions were analyzed. Additionally, a model of interactions between the encoded proteins was also established. The obtained results revealed that promoters of the 39 BR signaling genes are involved in various regulatory mechanisms and interdependent processes that influence growth, development, and stress response in rice. Different transcription factor-binding sites and cis-regulatory elements in the gene promoters were identified which are involved in regulation of the genes' expression during plant development and reactions to stress conditions. The in-silico analysis of BR signaling genes in O. sativa provides information about mechanisms which regulate the coordinated expression of these genes during rice development and in response to other phytohormones and environmental factors. Since rice is both an important crop and the model species for other cereals, this information may be important for understanding the regulatory mechanisms that modulate the BR signaling in monocot species. It can also provide new ways for the plant genetic engineering technology by providing novel potential targets, either cis-elements or transcriptional factors, to create elite genotypes with desirable traits.","The authors gratefully acknowledge financial support of publication of this article by the National Science Centre, Poland (Grant No. 2019/35/B/NZ2/00382).",,Frontiers in Genetics,,,,2022-07-06,2022,2022-07-06,,13,,953458,All OA; Gold,Article,"Ahmar, Sunny; Gruszka, Damian","Ahmar, Sunny (Institute of Biology, Biotechnology and Environmental Protection, Faculty of Natural Sciences, University of Silesia, Katowice, Poland); Gruszka, Damian (Institute of Biology, Biotechnology and Environmental Protection, Faculty of Natural Sciences, University of Silesia, Katowice, Poland)","Gruszka, Damian (University of Silesia)","Ahmar, Sunny (University of Silesia); Gruszka, Damian (University of Silesia)",20,17,2.74,7.72,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fgene.2022.953458/pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1149247785,31 Biological Sciences; 3108 Plant Biology,

The present study used quantitative (survey) and qualitative methods in the framework of the exploratory paradigm to achieve key driving variables affecting the competitiveness of Kermanshah. The present study was applied in terms of its purpose and descriptive–analytical nature and research method. The study’s statistical population consisted of experts related to the Kermanshah competitiveness index, which studied 30 experts using the snowball method.

Employment centers and commuting inequalities in Bogotá,"Accessibility and equality evaluations have been primarily focused on residential location. However, workplace location might be an equivalent contributor to inequalities in the travel experience and accessibility. Traditionally, transport planning connects high-demand areas with the best-quality and capacity transport infrastructures. Literature supports that employment centers (EC) receive mainly workers in certain middle-to high-income occupations. This condition results in a type of segregation pattern associated with trip destinations and modal choice similar to those reported for the household location. This paper investigates commuting from a different standpoint, emphasizing the need to consider workplace location and employment distribution within cities. We identify five main EC in Bogotá, Colombia, and explore their association with the commuting mode choice of three population groups using mixed logit models. Results indicate that people who work in any EC tend to use more public transport (PT). Nevertheless, the probability of selecting PT differs among groups. Specifically, for low-income commuters, PT represents lower utility than that for middle-income commuters if their job is located in an EC. The fact that the population most likely to be public transport captive does not find this alternative as attractive as the middle-income segment needs further investigation for better policymaking.",,,Journal of Transport and Land Use,,,,2022-01-24,2022,2022-01-24,,15,1,17-34,All OA; Gold,Article,"Peña, Javier; A, Guzman Luis; Arellana, Julian","Peña, Javier (Universidad de los Andes); A, Guzman Luis (Universidad de los Andes); Arellana, Julian (Universidad del Norte)",,"Peña, Javier (Universidad de Los Andes); A, Guzman Luis (Universidad de Los Andes); Arellana, Julian (Universidad del Norte)",12,10,,7.63,https://www.jtlu.org/index.php/jtlu/article/download/2100/1624,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1144964278,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3509 Transportation, Logistics and Supply Chains; 44 Human Society; 4406 Human Geography",10 Reduced Inequalities

Accelerated shifts in the functioning of the Earth System are mainly driven by the production and consumption of wealthy economies. Social, environmental and health costs of such industrialization, however, bear on low‐income communities inhabiting severely degraded territories by polluting activities (i.e., sacrifice zones). How global, national and local socio‐economic and governance processes have interacted in perpetuating socio‐environmental inequalities in these territories has been rarely explored. Here, we develop an historical quantitative approach integrating a novel chemostratigraphic record, data on policy making, and socio‐economic trends to evaluate the feedback relationship between environmental injustice and Anthropocene in sacrifice zones. We specifically outline a case study for the Puchuncaví valley ‐one of the most emblematic sacrifice zones from Chile‐. We verify an ever‐growing burden of heavy metals and metalloids over the past five decades paced by the staggering expansion of local industrial activities, which has ultimately been spurred by national and transnational market forces. Local poverty levels have declined concomitantly, but this path toward social equality is marginal as costs of pollution have grown through time. Indeed, national and international pollution control actions appear insufficient in mitigating the cumulative impact brought by highly toxic elements. Thus, our sub‐decadal reconstruction for pollution trends over the past 136 years from a sediment record, emerges as a science‐based tool for informing the discussion on Anthropocene governance. Furthermore, it helps to advance in the assessment of environmental inequality in societal models that prioritize economic growth to the detriment of socio‐environmental security.
Plain Language Summary Costs of the sustained industrialization growth typically bear on low‐income communities (i.e., sacrifice zones). In this work, we designed a case study for the Puchuncaví sacrifice zone (Chile) to understand how socio‐economic and policymaking processes interact in perpetuating environmental inequality in these territories. Specifically, we integrate data obtained from a new sediment archive for historical pollution, socio‐economic trends and environmental policies to evaluate the relationship between environmental injustice and Anthropocene. We observe an ever‐growing load of heavy metals and metalloids over the past five decades paced by the staggering growth of local industrial activities, which has ultimately been spurred by national and transnational industrial and economic demands. Poverty levels in local communities declined concomitantly, but such reduction in social inequality is marginal and deceiving as effects of pollution have grown through time. Pollution control actions appear insufficient in mitigating cumulative and emergent impacts of highly toxic elements. Thus, our 136‐year reconstruction of the local pollution trajectory serves as a science‐based tool for informing the discussion on governance in the Anthropocene. Particularly, it helps to advance in the assessment of environmental inequality in societal models that prioritize economic growth to the detriment of the ecosystem and social security.
Key Points    Geochemical data provide a science‐based tool to inform the discussion on Anthropocene governance in severely degraded territories   In our case study, socio‐environmental inequalities are linked to economic and governance processes operating from local to global scales   Policies embracing local environmental rehabilitation are required as a just transition is not granted under a decarbonization scenario","Acknowledgments Funding for this work was provided by ANID/FONDAP/15110009, ANID‐Millennium Science Initiative Program ‐ NCN19_153, Grant ANID PIA/BASAL FB210006, Fondecyt projects #11150210, #11170566, #1201714, ESR UCV2095, PUCV DI 39.431/2020.

One of the most used indices to evaluate the drought is the standardized precipitation index (SPI) due to its practicality and evaluation in a variety of time scales, however, this uses precipitation as the only variable, depending on the deviations in the precipitation values. This is important when evaluating the SPI, because in some ecosystems close to the equatorial zone, there are very warm periods with low rainfall, in which a large proportion of the data collected by the meteorological stations corresponds to zero. In this research, the SPI was calculated in the Pechelín basin located in Colombia, in which there is zero precipitation in a large proportion of the data, registering zero precipitation in the month of January and February in 67% and 70% respectively. As a result, the SPI values increased to “wet” ranges, only when the amount of data with zero precipitation exceeded half of the total data; this means that the SPI determines wrong values when it is calculated with zero-precipitation data in large proportions. Based on this finding, this study aims to modify the index by typing the distribution (using a correction factor K), finally correcting the SPI values, this correction was called SPI-C. The results indicate that the SPI-C improved the identification of drought, obtaining corresponding values that better represent the high frequency of zero precipitation existing in the study area.","The first author is grateful to the Universidad del Norte, Colombia for allowing me to study for a PhD in Engineering.

This article fills this gap by assessing the motivational factors of choice for the public sector in the health field, and the conceptual and methodological trends of this research stream. (2) Methods: This study follows the PRISMA protocol to ascertain patterns in past research and inform researchers, practitioners, and policymakers. Eighty-nine documents published between 1998 and 2021 were retained after selecting them according to their theme and outlined goals. (3) Results: Common motivational determinants are remuneration, available resources, work conditions, and frequency of contact and interaction with patients. The PSM construct and scale are often employed as main frameworks, but there is also a concern in assessing motivation drawing on psychological constructs that reflect the challenging line of work and environment that is health care, such as presenteeism, stress, and perception of hindrances. (4) Conclusions: By focusing on health professionals' motivation, this study contributes to a timely systematization in challenging times for health institutions and their human resources.","Gonçalo Santinha and Alexandre Fernandes would like to acknowledge the contribution of the research unit on Governance, Competitiveness, and Public Policy (UIDB/04058/2020), funded by national funds through FCT—Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology.","This research was funded by Fundação para a Ciência e Tecnologia, grant number 020.05144.BD, and partially funded by Programa Operacional Centro 2020, through Fundo Social Europeu.",Behavioral Sciences,,,,2022-03-29,2022,2022-03-29,,12,4,95,All OA; Gold,Article,"Fernandes, Alexandre; Santinha, Gonçalo; Forte, Teresa","Fernandes, Alexandre (Governance, Competitiveness and Public Policies (GOVCOPP), Department of Social, Political and Territorial Sciences, University of Aveiro, 3810-193 Aveiro, Portugal.); Santinha, Gonçalo (Governance, Competitiveness and Public Policies (GOVCOPP), Department of Social, Political and Territorial Sciences, University of Aveiro, 3810-193 Aveiro, Portugal.); Forte, Teresa (Governance, Competitiveness and Public Policies (GOVCOPP), Department of Social, Political and Territorial Sciences, University of Aveiro, 3810-193 Aveiro, Portugal.)","Fernandes, Alexandre (University of Aveiro)","Fernandes, Alexandre (University of Aveiro); Santinha, Gonçalo (University of Aveiro); Forte, Teresa (University of Aveiro)",12,10,1.45,7.18,https://www.mdpi.com/2076-328X/12/4/95/pdf?version=1650035815,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1146702847,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3202 Clinical Sciences; 52 Psychology; 5202 Biological Psychology; 5203 Clinical and Health Psychology,3 Good Health and Well Being
225,pub.1147333229,10.3390/agronomy12051000,,,Hardening Blueberry Plants to Face Drought and Cold Events by the Application of Fungal Endophytes,"Harsh environmental conditions derived from current climate change trends are among the main challenges for agricultural production worldwide. In the Mediterranean climatic region of central Chile, sudden occurrence of spring cold temperatures in combination with water shortage for irrigation (drought) constitutes a major limitation to highbush blueberry (Vaccinium corymbosum) plantations, as flowering and fruiting stages are highly sensitive. Hardening crops may be achievable by boosting beneficial interactions of plants with microorganisms. Inoculation with symbiotic fungi isolated from plants adapted to extreme environments could be a good strategy, if they are able to maintain functional roles with non-original hosts. Here, we evaluated the effect of two Antarctic fungal endophytes (AFE), Penicillium rubens and P. bialowienzense, on the tolerance of V. corymbosum plants to cold events in combination with drought under controlled conditions. Inoculated and uninoculated plants were exposed for a month to one event of a cold temperature (2 °C/8 h) per week with or without drought and were evaluated in physiological, biochemical, and molecular variables. A complementary set of plants was kept under the same environmental conditions for two additional months to evaluate survival as well as fruit weight and size. There was an overall positive effect of AFE on plant performance in both environmental conditions. Endophyte-inoculated plants exhibited higher gene expression of the Late Embryogenesis Abundant protein (LEA1), higher photochemical efficiency (Fv/Fm), and low oxidative stress (TBARS) than uninoculated counterparts. On the other hand, plant survival was positively affected by the presence of fungal endophytes. Similarly, fruit diameter and fruit fresh weight were improved by fungal inoculation, being this difference higher under well-watered condition. Inoculating plants with fungal endophytes isolated from extreme environments represents a promising alternative for hardening crops. This is especially relevant nowadays since agriculture is confronting great environmental uncertainties and difficulties which could became worse in the near future due to climate change.",We are grateful to the Instituto Antártico Chileno (INACH) for providing the logistics during the Expedición Chilena Antartica n° 53 (growing season 2016–2017) and to the “Henryk Arctowski” Polish Antarctic Station crew for their field support and assistance in their facilities.,"This study was funded by FONDECYT 1181034, ANID-PIA-Anillo INACH ACT192057 and NSFC190013.",Agronomy,,,,2022-04-21,2022,2022-04-21,,12,5,1000,All OA; Gold,Article,"Acuña-Rodríguez, Ian S.; Ballesteros, Gabriel I.; Atala, Cristian; Gundel, Pedro E.; Molina-Montenegro, Marco A.","Acuña-Rodríguez, Ian S.

Infrared-transparent membrane films emerged as a viable alternative to improve hybrid radiant cooling by preventing moisture condensation. This case study assesses the potential of membrane-assisted radiant cooling in a rural school building in Santa Lucia, Atlántico (Colombia), a location with a hot and humid tropical climate throughout the year. The study evaluates different cooling strategies, including natural ventilation, mechanical ventilation, hybrid radiant cooling, and membrane-assisted radiant cooling using EnergyPlus® software. Results for a radiant surface temperature of 4 °C below the dew point show that membrane-assisted radiant cooling could reduce annual discomfort hours by 3–6% compared to conventional radiant cooling. Further experimental and modeling studies should focus on the lowest achievable temperature below the dew point without condensation. Our results suggest that radiant cooling with infrared-transparent membranes is a potentially cost-effective alternative for improving thermal comfort in rural school buildings in hot and humid climates.","The authors would like to thank Universidad del Norte and Minciencias through Convocatoria Doctorados Nacionales 727 of Fondo Nacional de Financiamiento para la Ciencia, la Tecnología e Innovación FCTeI, by Sistema General de Regalías SGR for supporting this research.",,International Journal of Thermofluids,,,,2022-11,2022,,2022-11,16,,100214,All OA; Gold,Article,"Albuja, Rafael; Foliaco, Blanca; Bula, Antonio; Gonzalez-Quiroga, Arturo","Albuja, Rafael (Department of Mechanical Engineering, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, 080001, Colombia); Foliaco, Blanca (Department of Mechanical Engineering, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, 080001, Colombia); Bula, Antonio (UREMA Research Unit, Department of Mechanical Engineering, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, 080001, Colombia); Gonzalez-Quiroga, Arturo (UREMA Research Unit, Department of Mechanical Engineering, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, 080001, Colombia)","Gonzalez-Quiroga, Arturo (Universidad del Norte)","Albuja, Rafael (Universidad del Norte); Foliaco, Blanca (Universidad del Norte); Bula, Antonio (Universidad del Norte); Gonzalez-Quiroga, Arturo (Universidad del Norte)",7,7,,7.15,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijft.2022.100214,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1151034805,33 Built Environment and Design; 3301 Architecture,

One of the novel solutions is the use of organic waste for electricity generation through the use of microbial fuel cell technology. In this research, low-cost, laboratory-scale, double-chamber microbial fuel cells were fabricated using zinc and copper as electrodes and avocado waste as fuel. Current and voltage values of 3.7326 ± 0.05568 mA and 0.74 ± 0.02121 V were achieved on the seventh day, with an optimum operating pH of 5.98 ± 0.16 and a maximum electrical conductivity of 94.46 ± 5.12 mS/cm. The cells showed a very low operating resistance of 71.480 Ω , indicating the good electrical conductivity of the electrodes. Likewise, a power density of 566.80 ± 13.48 mW/cm2 at a current density of 5.165 A/cm2 was generated. This research provides an eco-friendly solution to farmers and companies dedicated to the export and import of this fruit because it shows the benefits of using their own waste for the generation of electricity, reducing costs.","Declaration of Competing Interest The authors declare the following financial interests/personal relationships which may be considered as potential competing interests: Rojas-Flores S. reports article publishing charges was provided by Vicerrectorado de InvestigaciónUniversidad Autónoma del Perú, Lima 15842, Peru.

This systematic review updates information on the causative agents of VAP and resistance to antibiotics in COVID-19 patients. We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), PubMed/MEDLINE, and LILACS databases from December 2019 to December 2021. Studies that described the frequency of causative pathogens associated with VAP and their antibiotic resistance patterns in critically ill COVID-19 adult patients were included. The Newcastle-Ottawa Quality Assessment Scale was used for critical appraisal. The data are presented according to the number or proportions reported in the studies. A total of 25 articles were included, involving 2766 VAP cases in COVID-19 patients (range 5-550 VAP cases). Most of the studies included were carried out in France (32%), Italy (20%), Spain (12%) and the United States (8%). Gram-negative bacteria were the most frequent causative pathogens of VAP (range of incidences in studies: P. aeruginosa 7.5-72.5%, K. pneumoniae 6.9-43.7%, E. cloacae 1.6-20% and A. baumannii 1.2-20%). S. aureus was the most frequent Gram-positive pathogen, with a range of incidence of 3.3-57.9%. The median incidence of Aspergillus spp. was 6.4%. Few studies have recorded susceptibility patterns among Gram-negative causative pathogens and have mainly reported extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL), AmpC, and carbapenem resistance. The median frequency of methicillin resistance among S. aureus isolates was 44.4%. Our study provides the first comprehensive description of the causative agents and antibiotic resistance in COVID-19 patients with VAP. Gram-negative bacteria were the most common pathogens causing VAP. Data on antibiotic resistance patterns in the published medical literature are limited, as well as information about VAP from low- and middle-income countries.",,"CIBERINFEC (CB21/13/00009), Instituto de Salud Carlos III, Madrid, Spain.

DESIGN: A cross-sectional study reported in line with the STROBE guidelines.
METHODS: Nursing students were invited to complete an online questionnaire at the end of the 2019-2020 academic year using convenience sampling. The questionnaire collected data on sociodemographic factors, work, and life experiences in relation to COVID-19, habits and lifestyle using the World Health Organization Five Well-Being Index (WHO-5) and the Generalized Anxiety disorder-7 scale. Variables related to anxiety were analysed using multiple lineal regression analysis, RESULTS: The prevalence of low psychological well-being in the 203 students was 44.3% and of anxiety 55.7%. In the multivariate analysis the variables associated with anxiety were having worked in the pandemic, having had symptoms of COVID-19 and having been afraid of getting infected.
CONCLUSIONS: The levels of anxiety due to the COVID-19 pandemic in nursing students have been high, and levels of psychological well-being have been low. The fact of having worked during the pandemic, having had symptoms compatible with COVID-19 or being afraid of getting infected are associated with the highest scores for anxiety.
RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: This study gives more evidence on the psychological impact on nursing students during the first wave of the pandemic in Spain. This can be used to design anxiety management programmes for inclusion into teaching syllabuses. It also gives arguments for the setting up of psychological and emotional support services for these students and other healthcare professionals working during the pandemic.","ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS The authors would like to thank the staff and students of the Sant Joan de Déu Teaching Campus University Nursing School who participated voluntarily in this study and the Information Technology Department for their help in administrating it.

The main objective of this study is to provide new empirical evidence about the validity and reliability of the CERQ via a sample of 271 Spanish adolescents (136 female, 135 male) aged from 15 to 18 years (M = 15.7, SD = 0.76). The analytical process was carried out in two phases. A confirmatory factor analysis was performed on the polychoric correlation matrix between items. Four possible alternative models were contrasted: two models with nine factors and two models with two second-order factors and nine first-order factors, with 36 and 27 items, respectively. The model with nine correlated factors and 27 items obtained the best indices of overall fit. Subsequently, the reliability of the measurements was estimated on this model. The results reaffirm the validity of the 27-item version of the CERQ over the original 36-item structure. The findings also confirm that the CERQ is a reliable instrument for the evaluation of emotion regulation strategies in adolescents.","This research has been supported by the Spanish Government (Ministry of Education and Vocational Training) and by a doctoral grant (Formación de Profesorado Universitario, FPU 17/01994) awarded to the first author (E.B.).",This research has received no external funding.,International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health,,,Adolescent; Cognition; Emotional Regulation; Female; Humans; Male; Psychometrics; Reproducibility of Results; Surveys and Questionnaires,2022-03-18,2022,2022-03-18,,19,6,3602,All OA; Gold,Article,"Betegón, Elena; Rodríguez-Medina, Jairo; del-Valle, Macarena; Irurtia, María Jesús","Betegón, Elena (Department of Psychology, Faculty of Education and Social Work, University of Valladolid (UVa), Recognized Research Group (GIR) Psychology and Health, 47011 Valladolid, Spain;, mjirurtia@uva.es); Rodríguez-Medina, Jairo (Department of Pedagogy, Faculty of Education and Social Work, University of Valladolid (UVa), Recognized Research Group (GIR) Psychology and Health, 47011 Valladolid, Spain;, jairo.rodriguez.medina@uva.es); del-Valle, Macarena (Institute of Basic and Applied Psychology and Technology (IPSIBAT), National Scientific and Technical Research Council (CONICET), National University of Mar del Plata (UNMDP), Recognized Research Group (GIR) Psychology and Health, Mar del Plata 7600, Argentina;, mdelvalle1989@gmail.com); Irurtia, María Jesús (Department of Psychology, Faculty of Education and Social Work, University of Valladolid (UVa), Recognized Research Group (GIR) Psychology and Health, 47011 Valladolid, Spain;, mjirurtia@uva.es)","Betegón, Elena (University of Valladolid)","Betegón, Elena (University of Valladolid); Rodríguez-Medina, Jairo (University of Valladolid); del-Valle, Macarena (National University of Mar del Plata); Irurtia, María Jesús (University of Valladolid)",11,10,2.46,6.97,https://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/19/6/3602/pdf?version=1647588000,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1146439261,52 Psychology; 5203 Clinical and Health Psychology,

This paper analyses the effects of environmental, economic, and scientific–technological factors. The influence of each factor on scallop production in Chile was reviewed for the period between the 1980s and 2020. The evaluation of the effects allows the visualisation of the industry’s productive evolution and reveals the current challenges. The occurrence of abrupt environmental disturbances, commercialisation under imperfect market configurations, and public and private efforts in scientific and technological advances have acted favourably on scallop production. However, an industry mainly focused on prices and high production volumes did not devote much effort to develop low-cost climate-resilient technologies. Today, economic challenges must be addressed by helping to reduce production costs and add economic value to products and by-products. Our results show that the industry must focus on low-cost technologies, the use of renewable energy, and the circularity of its processes.

This study aimed to determine the relationship between omega-3 fatty acid status and the severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Methods: Using a case−control design, we compared hospitalized patients with severe SARS-CoV-2 infection (cases, n = 73) with a group of ambulatory patients with mild SARS-CoV-2 infection (controls, n = 71). No patients were vaccinated against SARS-CoV-2. Results: The cases were older (p = 0.003), less educated (p = 0.001), had larger neck and smaller waist circumferences (p = 0.035 and p = 0.003, respectively), more frequently had diabetes (p < 0.001), consumed less fish (p < 0.001), consumed higher proportions of fried fish (p = 0.001), and had lower Omega-3 Index (O3I) values (p = 0.001) than controls. Cases had significantly lower rates of upper airway symptoms than controls. Lower O3I was associated with an increased likelihood of developing severe COVID-19 after adjusting for potential confounders (OR: 0.52; CI 0.32−0.86). Diabetes (OR: 4.41; CI 1.60−12.12), neck circumference (OR: 1.12; CI 1.03−1.21), and older age (OR: 1.03; CI 1.002−1.062) were also linked to COVID-19 severity. Fried fish consumption and low educational level were independent risk factors for severe COVID-19. Conclusions: This study suggests incorporating nutritional interventions to improve omega-3 status within nonpharmacological measures may help to reduce the severity of COVID-19.",The authors appreciate the contribution of the fourth year 2021 nutrition students of the Universidad Católica del Norte.,This research received no external funding.,International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health,,Paul B.

TTD has been applied considering site specific conditions of Chile and Peru, such as extreme climatic conditions, seismic risks, water scarcity, community demands, and environmental constraints. This review highlights the contribution of several experiences in Chile and Peru, which have chosen TTD technology for reduction of negative environmental impacts, mainly focusing on the following issues: (i) increase of tailings water recovery, (ii) reduction of TSFs footprint (impacted areas), (iii) decrease the risk of physical instability, avoiding the construction of high dams, and (iv) decrease of TSFs seepages. Finally, the article describes the advantages (benefits) and disadvantages (aspects to improve) of TTD, where nowadays a high degree of dewatering of tailings is seen as a safe option, considering the occurrence of some TSF dam failures recently worldwide, which has resulted in severe environmental pollution. A better environmental perception about TTD of authorities and communities, considering that this technology allows to satisfy the needs of stable and safe TSFs, make the TTD be more acceptable, popular and one of the best available technologies (BATs) for operations with mine tailings.",,"The research is funded by the Research Department of Catholic University of Temuco, Chile.",Sustainability,,,,2022-08-31,2022,2022-08-31,,14,17,10901,All OA; Gold,Article,"Vargas, Carlos Cacciuttolo; Pulido, Alex Marinovic","Vargas, Carlos Cacciuttolo (Civil Works and Geology Department, Catholic University of Temuco, Temuco 4780000, Chile); Pulido, Alex Marinovic (Facultad de Ingeniería, Universidad Privada del Norte, Cajamarca 06001, Peru)","Vargas, Carlos Cacciuttolo (Temuco Catholic University)","Vargas, Carlos Cacciuttolo (Temuco Catholic University); Pulido, Alex Marinovic (Private University of the North)",19,16,,6.89,https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/14/17/10901/pdf?version=1662367197,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1150713530,40 Engineering; 41 Environmental Sciences; 4104 Environmental Management,6 Clean Water and Sanitation

Microbial fuel cells provide a novel solution for the use of waste as fuel for electricity generation. In this investigation, onion waste was used, and managed to generate maximum peaks of 4.459 ± 0.0608 mA and 0.991 ± 0.02 V of current and voltage, respectively. The conductivity values increased rapidly to 179,987 ± 2859 mS/cm, while the optimal pH in which the most significant current was generated was 6968 ± 0.286, and the ° Brix values decreased rapidly due to the degradation of organic matter. The microbial fuel cells showed a low internal resistance (154,389 ± 5228 Ω), with a power density of 595.69 ± 15.05 mW/cm2 at a current density of 6.02 A/cm2; these values are higher than those reported by other authors in the literature. The diffractogram spectra of the onion debris from FTIR show a decrease in the most intense peaks, compared to the initial ones with the final ones. It was possible to identify the species Pseudomona eruginosa, Acinetobacter bereziniae, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, and Yarrowia lipolytica adhered to the anode electrode at the end of the monitoring using the molecular technique.","The authors thank Juan Pastrana, for the help provided in the grammar of the English language.","This research was funded by Consejo Nacional de Ciencia, Tecnología e Innovación Tecnológica—CONCYTEC/PROCIENCIA according to Project agreement 370-2019.",Molecules,,"Mohamad Nasir Mohamad Ibrahim, Patricia Graciela Vázquez, Mohd Hazwan Hussin",Bioelectric Energy Sources; Electricity; Electrodes; Onions; Wastewater,2022-01-19,2022,2022-01-19,,27,3,625,All OA; Gold,Article,"Segundo, Rojas-Flores; De La Cruz-Noriega, Magaly; Otiniano, Nélida Milly; Benites, Santiago M.; Esparza, Mario; Nazario-Naveda, Renny","Segundo, Rojas-Flores (Instituto de Investigación en Ciencias y Tecnología de la Universidad Cesar Vallejo, Trujillo 13001, Peru;, mdelacruzn@ucv.edu.pe, (M.D.L.C.-N.);, notiniano@ucv.edu.pe, (N.M.O.)); De La Cruz-Noriega, Magaly (Instituto de Investigación en Ciencias y Tecnología de la Universidad Cesar Vallejo, Trujillo 13001, Peru;, mdelacruzn@ucv.edu.pe, (M.D.L.C.-N.);, notiniano@ucv.edu.pe, (N.M.O.)); Otiniano, Nélida Milly (Instituto de Investigación en Ciencias y Tecnología de la Universidad Cesar Vallejo, Trujillo 13001, Peru;, mdelacruzn@ucv.edu.pe, (M.D.L.C.-N.);, notiniano@ucv.edu.pe, (N.M.O.)); Benites, Santiago M.

These factors may be altered either positively or negatively as a result of an implementation experience of online learning. This risk is even more evident in scenarios such as the sanitary emergency resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, when instructors suddenly had to adjust their learning environments into an online modality without enough time for preparation. This study aims at exploring how university faculty beliefs and their conceptions about en online teaching change after implementing a remote learning experience in the context of the sanitary emergency in a Colombian higher education institution. For this purpose, a pretest - posttest survey design was used to identify how instructors’ self-efficacy, their attitudes towards a reflective practice, their perceptions of institutional support, and their conceptions about online learning changed after completed the academic semester in remote modality; and the extent to which the instructors’ experience affects these changes.

High levels of poverty afflict rural areas in developing countries, and sustainable tourism based on renewable energy is an ideal approach to generate local development. Our objectives are thus to gauge sustainable tourism’s influence on local development in the community of La Florida, Huaral, Peru and to evaluate the potential of renewable energy (solar and wind power) to propose an eco-efficient business alternative. A non-experimental, quantitative approach was used, in which 265 local residents completed a survey to ascertain their perspectives on the proposal. Moreover, the potential for solar and wind energy was measured to identify sustainable alternatives that residents might incorporate into local ventures. The results demonstrate a relationship between sustainable tourism and local development, as tourism activity enables community members to improve their quality of life and offers them the opportunity to generate new enterprises. Likewise, the assessment of renewable energy potential confirms its feasibility in this area.",The authors would like to thank the Dirección de Investigación e Innovación of the Universidad Privada del Norte (Perú) for their constant support and management.,This research received no external funding.,Economies,,,,2022-02-09,2022,2022-02-09,,10,2,47,All OA; Gold,Article,"Riojas-Díaz, Kiara; Jaramillo-Romero, Ricardo; Calderón-Vargas, Fátima; Asmat-Campos, David","Riojas-Díaz, Kiara (Carrera de Administración, Facultad de Negocios, Universidad Privada del Norte, Lima 15301, Peru;, N00132804@upn.pe, (K.R.-D.);, N00096312@upn.pe, (R.J.-R.)); Jaramillo-Romero, Ricardo (Carrera de Administración, Facultad de Negocios, Universidad Privada del Norte, Lima 15301, Peru;, N00132804@upn.pe, (K.R.-D.);, N00096312@upn.pe, (R.J.-R.)); Calderón-Vargas, Fátima (Carrera de Administración, Facultad de Negocios, Universidad Privada del Norte, Lima 15301, Peru;, N00132804@upn.pe, (K.R.-D.);, N00096312@upn.pe, (R.J.-R.)); Asmat-Campos, David (Dirección de Investigación, Innovación & Responsabilidad Social, Universidad Privada del Norte, Trujillo 13011, Peru)","Calderón-Vargas, Fátima (Carrera de Administración, Facultad de Negocios, Universidad Privada del Norte, Lima 15301, Peru;, N00132804@upn.pe, (K.R.-D.);, N00096312@upn.pe, (R.J.-R.)); Asmat-Campos, David (Private University of the North)","Riojas-Díaz, Kiara (Carrera de Administración, Facultad de Negocios, Universidad Privada del Norte, Lima 15301, Peru;, N00132804@upn.pe, (K.R.-D.);, N00096312@upn.pe, (R.J.-R.)); Jaramillo-Romero, Ricardo (Carrera de Administración, Facultad de Negocios, Universidad Privada del Norte, Lima 15301, Peru;, N00132804@upn.pe, (K.R.-D.);, N00096312@upn.pe, (R.J.-R.)); Calderón-Vargas, Fátima (Carrera de Administración, Facultad de Negocios, Universidad Privada del Norte, Lima 15301, Peru;, N00132804@upn.pe, (K.R.-D.);, N00096312@upn.pe, (R.J.-R.)); Asmat-Campos, David (Private University of the North)",8,7,,6.76,https://www.mdpi.com/2227-7099/10/2/47/pdf?version=1644408964,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1145420094,38 Economics; 3801 Applied Economics; 3803 Economic Theory,13 Climate Action; 7 Affordable and Clean Energy
162,pub.1150577341,10.1109/access.2022.3202896,,,Machine Learning and Marketing: A Systematic Literature Review,"Even though machine learning (ML) applications are not novel, they have gained popularity partly due to the advance in computing processing. This study explores the adoption of ML methods in marketing applications through a bibliographic review of the period 2008–2022. In this period, the adoption of ML in marketing has grown significantly. This growth has been quite heterogeneous, varying from the use of classical methods such as artificial neural networks to hybrid methods that combine different techniques to improve results. Generally, maturity in the use of ML in marketing and increasing specialization in the type of problems that are solved were observed. Strikingly, the types of ML methods used to solve marketing problems vary wildly, including deep learning, supervised learning, reinforcement learning, unsupervised learning, and hybrid methods. Finally, we found that the main marketing problems solved with machine learning were related to consumer behavior, recommender systems, forecasting, marketing segmentation, and text analysis—content analysis.",,,IEEE Access,,,,2022-01-01,2022,2022-08-29,2022-01-01,10,,93273-93288,All OA; Gold,Article,"Duarte, Vannessa; Zuniga-Jara, Sergio; Contreras, Sergio","Duarte, Vannessa (Escuela de Ciencias Empresariales, Universidad Catolica del Norte, Larrondo, Coquimbo, 1281, Chile); Zuniga-Jara, Sergio (Escuela de Ciencias Empresariales, Universidad Catolica del Norte, Larrondo, Coquimbo, 1281, Chile); Contreras, Sergio (Escuela de Ciencias Empresariales, Universidad Catolica del Norte, Larrondo, Coquimbo, 1281, Chile)","Duarte, Vannessa (Catholic University of the North)","Duarte, Vannessa (Catholic University of the North); Zuniga-Jara, Sergio (Catholic University of the North); Contreras, Sergio (Catholic University of the North)",12,12,,6.72,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/ielx7/6287639/6514899/09869838.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1150577341,46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4611 Machine Learning,

The bacterial microbiota associated with mother plant's foliar tissues is one of the main sources of bacteria for seeds. Therefore, any ecological factor influencing the mother plant's microbiota may also affect the diversity of the seed's bacterial community. Grasses form associations with beneficial vertically transmitted fungal endophytes of genus Epichloë. The interaction of plants with Epichloë endophytes and insect herbivores can influence the plant foliar microbiota. However, it is unknown whether these interactions (alone or in concert) can affect the assembly of bacterial communities in the produced seed. We subjected Lolium multiflorum plants with and without its common endophyte Epichloë occultans (E+, E-, respectively) to an herbivory treatment with Rhopalosiphum padi aphids and assessed the diversity and composition of the bacterial communities in the produced seed. The presence of Epichloë endophytes influenced the seed bacterial microbiota by increasing the diversity and affecting the composition of the communities. The relative abundances of the bacterial taxa were more similarly distributed in communities associated with E+ than E- seeds with the latter being dominated by just a few bacterial groups. Contrary to our expectations, seed bacterial communities were not affected by the aphid herbivory experienced by mother plants. We speculate that the enhanced seed/seedling performance documented for Epichloë-host associations may be explained, at least in part, by the Epichloë-mediated increment in the seed-bacterial diversity, and that this phenomenon may be applicable to other plant-endophyte associations.",We would like to thank Richard D.

Using H2 and diesel in a dual-fuel compression ignition engine appears as a more feasible approach. Here we report an experimental assessment of performance and emissions for a single-cylinder, four-stroke, air-cooled compression ignition engine operating with neat diesel and H2-diesel dual-fuel. Previous studies typically show the performance and emissions for a specific operation condition (i.e. a fixed engine speed and torque) or a limited operating range. Our experiments covered engine speeds of 3000 and 3600 rpm and torque levels of 3 and 7 Nm. An in-house designed and built alkaline cell generated the H2 used for the partial substitution of diesel. Compared with neat diesel, the results indicate that adding H2 decreased the air-fuel equivalence ratio and the Brake Specific Diesel Fuel Consumption Efficiency by around 14-29 % and 4-31 %. In contrast, adding H2 increased the Brake Fuel Conversion Efficiency by around 3-36 %. In addition, the Brake Thermal Efficiency increased in the presence of H2 in the range of 3-37 % for the lower engine speed and 27-43 % for the higher engine speed compared with neat diesel. The dual-fuel mode resulted in lower CO and CO2 emissions for the same power output. The emissions of hydrocarbons decreased with H2 addition, except for the lower engine speed and the higher torque. However, the dual-fuel operation resulted in higher NOx emissions than neat diesel, with 2-6 % and 19-48 % increments for the lower and higher engine speeds. H2 emerges as a versatile energy carrier with the potential to tackle current energy and emissions challenges; however, the dual-fuel strategy requires careful management of NOx emissions.",The authors want to acknowledge the support of the UNIVERSIDAD DEL ATLÁNTICO through the project ING81- CII2019 “Estudio experimental de la sustitución parcial de combustible con HIDROXY (HHO) en motores térmicos de encendido por compresión y la influencia sobre sus prestaciones” and SPHERE ENERGY COMPANY - Colombia on the development of this research by providing access to their facility.,"This research did not receive any specific grant from funding agencies in the public, commercial, or not-for-profit sectors.",Heliyon,,,,2022-04-16,2022,2022-04-16,2022-04,8,4,e09285,All OA; Gold,Article,"Estrada, L.; Moreno, E.; Gonzalez-Quiroga, A.; Bula, A.; Duarte-Forero, J.","Estrada, L.

The focus was made on investigating the suitability of this material for the seismic retrofitting application. The commercially available in the Colombian market fibers assessed involved five steel plus three synthetic ones. The series analyzed encompassed mono-fiber and binary multi-scale fiber-reinforcement systems. Experimental results of mono-fiber-reinforced UHPC with a fiber volume fraction of 2.0% of high-strength smooth steel fibers with a slenderness of 65 showed strain values at peak stress in tension (εpc) similar to those from other researchers, notwithstanding the reduction in cement and silica fume by 35% and 50%, respectively, of the low-cost and sustainable cementitious matrix used. Nonetheless, a significant drop in the energy absorption capacity (g) values are observed, which can be explained by the decrease in cement and silica fume. Outcomes also pointed out the relevant synergy between the hooked end fibers and the high-strength smooth ones. The results indicated that only the hybrid blend of high-strength smooth fibers (l f /d f =65) and hooked end fibers achieved the required ductility parameters (g≥50 kJ/m3 and ε pc ≥0.3%) for seismic retrofitting applications.","The author of this article would like to thank the support of the Research, Development, and Innovation Directorate of the Universidad del Norte through the &quot;research agenda&quot; code 2021-007.

We control for systematic errors in M h by employing a new group catalog from Tinker and the widely used Yang et al. catalog. At fixed M *, the strengths of several stellar absorption features vary systematically with M h . Completely model-free, this is one of the first indications that the stellar populations of centrals with identical M * are affected by the properties of their host halos. To interpret these variations, we applied full spectral fitting with the code alf. At fixed M *, centrals in more massive halos are older, show lower [Fe/H], and have higher [Mg/Fe] with 3.5σ confidence. We conclude that halos not only dictate how much M * galaxies assemble but also modulate their chemical enrichment histories. Turning to our analysis at fixed M h , high-M * centrals are older, show lower [Fe/H], and have higher [Mg/Fe] for M h > 1012 h −1 M ⊙ with confidence >4σ. While massive passive galaxies are thought to form early and rapidly, our results are among the first to distinguish these trends at fixed M h . They suggest that high-M * centrals experienced unique early formation histories, either through enhanced collapse and gas fueling or because their halos were early forming and highly concentrated, a possible signal of galaxy assembly bias.","We would like to thank the referee and statistics editor for the helpful comments and suggestions.

A cross-sectional and predictive design was used, in which 582 Peruvian university students participated, 243 men and 339 women, between the ages of 16 and 41. Student's t-statistics were used to analyze the differences in scores of psychological distress, anxiety, academic self-efficacy, and satisfaction with studies based on the sex of the participants, Pearson's R was used for the analysis of correlations between variables, and multiple linear regressions were used to evaluate the predictive model. In the analyses, the significance level was set at 0.05. The results show that men have higher levels of psychological distress, anxiety, and academic self-efficacy than women do (p < 0.01); high levels of psychological distress correlate with high levels of anxiety (r = 0.580, p < 0.01) and low levels of satisfaction with studies (r = -0.178, p < 0.01) and academic self-efficacy (r = -0.348, p < 0.01); high levels of anxiety correlate with low levels of satisfaction with studies (r = -0.122, p < 0.01) and academic self-efficacy (r = -0.192, p < 0.01); and high levels of academic self-efficacy correlate with high levels of satisfaction with studies (r = 0.429, p < 0.01). Academic self-efficacy was also found to predict satisfaction with studies (β = 0.429, p < 0.01). This concludes that, although there are significant correlations between psychological distress, anxiety, academic self-efficacy, and satisfaction with studies, academic self-efficacy is the variable that most predicts satisfaction with studies in Peruvian university students.",,,Frontiers in Psychology,,,,2022-04-25,2022,2022-04-25,,13,,809230,All OA; Gold,Article,"Esteban, Renzo Felipe Carranza; Mamani-Benito, Oscar; Caycho-Rodriguez, Tomás; Lingán-Huamán, Susana K.; Mamani, Percy G.

In this regard, continuous innovation is a pillar for guaranteeing SMEs’ survival worldwide. In Brazil, the ALI Program (Portuguese acronym for Local Innovation Agent) trains groups of SMEs to implement a continuous innovation process based on agile methodologies. This paper applied focus group methodology to investigate whether, after participating in the program, SMEs practice some innovation processes in their business and the difficulties perceived by entrepreneurs in incorporating innovation processes into their ventures. Based on the extant literature and on the focus group, it was observed that SMEs see innovation as a risk, fear innovating because of tradition, family, and/or generational context, and do not see innovation as a process suitable to be systematized with agile tools. In addition, factors such as the age of the SMEs’ leaders, the age of the SMEs, the gender of the SMEs’ leaders, and the nature of the SMEs (family business or not) may affect their openness to innovation. Recommendations are stated for practitioners (such as ALIs) to improve their training quality, policymakers to improve and create similar programs, and researchers interested in future research directions.",,The Universidad Católica del Norte (UCN) partially supported the payment of the Article Processing Charge (APC) with the regular grant of the Escuela de Ingeniería de Coquimbo (EIC).

If untreated, the complications of PKU lead to significant neucognitive and neuropsychiatric impairments, placing a burden on both the individual’s quality of life and on the healthcare system. We conducted a systematic literature review to characterize the impact of PKU on affected individuals and on healthcare resources in Latin American (LATAM) countries.MethodsSearches of the global medical literature as well as regional and local medical literature up to September 2021. Observational studies on patients with PKU from any LATAM country. Pairs of reviewers independently screened eligible articles, extracted data from included studies, and assessed their risk of bias.Results79 unique studies (47 cross-sectional studies, 18 case series, 12 case reports, and two cohort studies) with a total of 4090 patients were eligible. Of these studies, 20 had data available evaluating early-diagnosed PKU patients for meta-analysis of burden outcomes. Intellectual disability in the pooled studies was 18% [95% Confidence Interval (CI) 0.04–0.38; I2 = 83.7%, p = 0.0133; two studies; n = 114]. Motor delay was 15% [95% CI 0.04–0.30; I2 = 74.5%, p = 0.0083; four studies; n = 132]. Speech deficit was 35% [95% CI 0.08–0.68; I2 = 93.9%, p < 0.0001; five studies; n = 162].ConclusionsThere is currently evidence of high clinical burden in PKU patients in LATAM countries.

The special conditions of the sewer environment bring special challenges for the design of an IoT system and of its real-time algorithm for anomaly detection and localization in wastewater networks. The proposed design fulfills these requirements by using a new IoT architecture pattern, which we generalize and name Hop-by-hop Anomaly Detection and Actuation (HADA). The distributed anomaly detection and localization algorithm makes predictions over previous sensor measurements, while taking into account seasonality effects of wastewater and noise of the sensors. Based on simulations in a large network with three common illegal industrial wastewater pollutants, the advantages and limitations of the proposed wastewater anomaly localization system are discussed. The IoT system, including its anomaly detection and localization algorithm, was implemented using in a low-power microcontroller and tested in flowing wastewater with different harsh industrial waste.","This work was supported in part by the European Union’s Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Program through the H2020 Micromole and H2020 SYSTEM Projects under Grant 653626 and Grant 787128.

A total of 3888 papers published between January 2000 and June 2021, distributed in four clusters—RTA + HA + SA (SA, n = 399); RTA + HA + ML (ML, n = 858); RTA + HA + SC (TESC, n = 2327); and RTA + HA + GIS (GIS, n = 304)—were analyzed. We identified Accident Analysis and Prevention as the most important journal, Fred Mannering as the main author, and The Statistical Analysis of Crash-Frequency Data: A Review and Assessment of Methodological Alternatives as the most cited publication. Although the negative binomial regression method was used for several years, we noticed that other regression models as well as methods based on deep learning, convolutional neural networks, transfer learning, 5G technology, Internet of Things, and intelligent transport systems have recently emerged as suitable alternatives for RTA analysis. By introducing a new approach based on computational algorithms and data visualization, this SLR fills a gap in the area of RTA analysis and provides a clear picture of the current scientific production in the field. This information is crucial for projecting further research on RTA analysis and developing computational and data visualization tools oriented to the automation of RTA predictions based on intelligent systems.","CMFV was supported by COLCIENCIAS, project “Design of a framework for Integral Road Traffic Accident Management in Smart Cities,” project # 785 of 2017, contract 84-091-894.",,Journal of Advanced Transportation,,Elżbieta Macioszek,,2022-07-08,2022,,2022-07-08,2022,,1-17,All OA; Gold,Article,"Ferreira-Vanegas, Carlos M.; Vélez, Jorge I.; García-Llinás, Guisselle A.","Ferreira-Vanegas, Carlos M.

The article employs a qualitative research approach where text analysis is used, focusing on constitutional documentation, legislative frameworks on language-related matters and higher education policy documentations, as well as language policy documentation from the selected 10 South African universities that offered Sepedi as a first language or conversational module. It is found that there is a constitutional disregard by competent organisations such as universities, financial institutions, Google and language authorities (such as Pan South African Language Board, Sesotho sa Leboa National Language Body and Sesotho sa Leboa National Lexicography Unit), since most of the policies are inconsistent with Section 6 (1) of the South African Constitution, 1996.

211,pub.1149391511,10.3390/su14148383,,,Assessing Durability Properties and Economic Potential of Shellfish Aquaculture Waste in the Construction Industry: A Circular Economy Perspective,"The construction industry’s high demand for natural resources, combined with the waste generated by agriculture, creates an opportunity for the circular economy. This experiment used the CaCO3 found in scallop shells as an ingredient for the manufacture of fire-resistant materials, replacing gypsum in compositions of 40% and 50% by weight. The mechanical compressive strength was estimated for both freeze-thaw cycles and acid and sulfate attacks. The cost of disposing of scallop shell waste in landfills, savings from substitution, and the payback period relative to the amount of production were determined. The compressive strength of the materials decreased by 80% when subjected to freeze-thaw cycles and sulfate attack. In response to acid attack, they showed a 100% increase in strength during the first three weeks and a decrease thereafter. The savings amounted to $46.36 (22.4%) for 40% replacement and $58.93 (28.4%) for 50%. Respectively, return on investment is achieved at 800- and 630-per-metric ton produced. The difference between the costs of waste disposal (in aquaculture) and the potential savings from using CaCO3 as a raw material (in construction) creates an opportunity for commercialization between the two industries, serves as a reference for decision-makers, and complies with circular economy principles, reducing both inputs of raw materials and outputs of waste.","The authors would like to thank Ostimar S.A., Caleta San Pedro-La Serena, Cooperativa M31, MÁSMAR Transforma, Transforma Mejillón de Chile, and Cámara Chilena de la Construcción-La Serena for their collaboration and provision of industry data.

201,pub.1148169488,10.3390/su14116388,,,Comparison between Synthetic and Biodegradable Polymer Matrices on the Development of Quartzite Waste-Based Artificial Stone,"The development of artificial stone from the agglutination of polymeric resin using industrial wastes can be a viable alternative from a technical, economic, and sustainable point of view. The main objective of the present work was to evaluate the physical, mechanical, and structural properties of artificial stones based on quartzite waste added into a synthetic, epoxy, or biodegradable polyurethane polymer matrix. Artificial stone plates were produced through the vacuum vibration and compression method, using 85 wt% of quartzite waste. The material was manufactured under the following conditions: 3 MPa compaction pressure and 90 and 80 °C curing temperature. The samples were characterized to evaluate physical and mechanical parameters and microstructure properties. As a result, the artificial stone plates developed obtained ≤0.16% water absorption, ≤0.38% porosity, and 26.96 and 10.7 MPa flexural strength (epoxy and polyurethane resin, respectively). A wear test established both artificial quartzite stone with epoxy resin (AS-EP) and vegetable polyurethane resin (AS-PU) high traffic materials. Hard body impact resistance classified AS-EP as a low height material and AS-PU as a very high height material. The petrographic slides analysis revealed that AS-EP has the best load distribution. We concluded the feasibility of manufacturing artificial stone, which would minimize the environmental impacts that would be caused by this waste disposal. We concluded that the production of artificial rock shows the potential and that it also helps to reduce environmental impacts.","This work was made possible with the assistance of the Foundation of Support for Research in the State of Rio de Janeiro (E-26/200.847/2021) and (E-26/202.387/2021).

The effects of these BSC at the micro-site scale have been related to the development of diverse plant species that, otherwise, might be strongly limited by the harsh abiotic conditions found in environments with low water availability. Here, we describe for the first time the bacterial composition of BSCs found in the proximities of Admiralty Bay (Maritime Antarctica) through 16S metabarcoding. In addition, we evaluated their effect on soils (nutrient levels, enzymatic activity, and water retention), and on the fitness and performance of Colobanthus quitensis, one of the two native Antarctic vascular plants. This was achieved by comparing the photochemical performance, foliar nutrient, biomass, and reproductive investment between C. quitensis plants growing with or without the influence of BSC. Our results revealed a high diversity of prokaryotes present in these soil communities, although we found differences in terms of their abundances. We also found that the presence of BSCs is linked to a significant increase in soils' water retention, nutrient levels, and enzymatic activity when comparing with control soils (without BSCs). In the case of C. quitensis, we found that measured ecophysiological performance parameters were significantly higher on plants growing in association with BSCs. Taken together, our results suggest that BSCs in Antarctic soils are playing a key role in various biochemical processes involved in soil development, while also having a positive effect on the accompanying vascular flora. Therefore, BSCs would be effectively acting as ecosystem engineers for the terrestrial Antarctic ecosystem.",We thank Maria Jose Romero Urrutia for her field assistance.

214,pub.1150989997,10.3389/fmars.2022.980384,,,Quantifying spatial extents of artificial versus natural reefs in the seascape,"With increasing human uses of the ocean, existing seascapes containing natural habitats, such as biogenic reefs or plant-dominated systems, are supplemented by novel, human-made habitats ranging from artificial reefs to energy extraction infrastructure and shoreline installments. Despite the mixture of natural and artificial habitats across seascapes, the distribution and extent of these two types of structured habitats are not well understood but are necessary pieces of information for ocean planning and resource management decisions. Through a case study, we quantified the amount of seafloor in the southeastern US (SEUS; 103,220 km2 in the Atlantic Ocean; 10 – 200 m depth) covered by artificial reefs and natural reefs. We developed multiple data-driven approaches to quantify the extent of artificial reefs within state-managed artificial reef programs, and then drew from seafloor maps and published geological and predictive seafloor habitat models to develop three estimates of natural reef extent. Comparisons of the extent of natural and artificial reefs revealed that artificial reefs account for substantially less habitat (average of two estimates 3 km2; <0.01% of SEUS) in the region than natural reefs (average of three estimates 2,654 km2; 2.57% of SEUS) and that this pattern holds across finer regional groupings (e.g., states, depth bins). Our overall estimates suggest that artificial reef coverage is several orders of magnitude less than natural reef coverage. While expansive seafloor mapping and characterization efforts are still needed in SEUS waters, our results fill information gaps regarding the extent of artificial and natural reef habitats in the region, providing support for ecosystem-based management, and demonstrating an approach applicable to other regions.",,"CSS-Inc was not involved in the study design, collection, analysis, interpretation of data, the writing of this article or the decision to submit it for publication.",Frontiers in Marine Science,,,,2022-09-14,2022,2022-09-14,,9,,980384,All OA; Gold,Article,"Steward, D’amy N.; Paxton, Avery B.; Bacheler, Nathan M.; Schobernd, Christina M.; Mille, Keith; Renchen, Jeffrey; Harrison, Zach; Byrum, Jordan; Martore, Robert; Brinton, Cameron; Riley, Kenneth L.; Taylor, J.

We use this photometry, together with the Third Gaia Early Data Release parallaxes, to determine for the first time period–luminosity relations (PLRs) for type II Cepheids from field representatives of these old pulsating stars in the near-infrared regime. We found PLRs to be very narrow for BL Herculis stars, which makes them candidates for precision distance indicators. We then use archival photometry and the most accurate distance obtained from eclipsing binaries to recalibrate PLRs for type II Cepheids in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). Slopes of our PLRs in the Milky Way and in the LMC differ by slightly more than 2σ and are in a good agreement with previous studies of the LMC, Galactic bulge, and Galactic globular cluster type II Cepheids samples. We use PLRs of Milky Way type II Cepheids to measure the distance to the LMC, and we obtain a distance modulus of 18.540 ± 0.026(stat.) ± 0.034(syst.) mag in the W JK Wesenheit index. We also investigate the metallicity effect within our Milky Way sample, and we find a rather significant value of about −0.2 mag dex−1 in each band meaning that more metal-rich type II Cepheids are intrinsically brighter than their more metal-poor counterparts, in agreement with the value obtained from type II Cepheids in Galactic globular clusters. The main source of systematic error on our Milky Way PLRs calibration, and the LMC distance, is the current uncertainty of the Gaia parallax zero-point.","We thank the referee for very valuable comments and suggestions, which helped us to improve the manuscript.

Currently, the use of plant growth promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) to mitigate abiotic stress in crops is of increasing interest. The most analyzed mechanism is based on ACC deaminase activity, an enzyme that decreases the ethylene synthesis, an important phytohormone in plant stress response. We aimed to identify other PGPR mediated mechanisms involved in the regulation of salt stress in plant. We used three PGPR strains (ESL001, ESL007, SH31), of which only ESL007 demonstrated ACC deaminase activity, to evaluate their effect on lettuce plants under salt stress (100 mM NaCl). We measured growth and biochemical parameters (e.g., proline content, lipid peroxidation and ROS degradation), as well as expression levels of genes involved in ethylene signaling (CTR1, EBF1) and transcription factors induced by ethylene (ERF5, ERF13). All bacterial strains enhanced growth on salt-stressed lettuce plants and modulated the proline levels. Strains ESL007 and SH31 triggered a higher catalase and ascorbate-peroxidase activity, compared to non-stressed plants. Differential expression of ethylene-related genes in inoculated plants subjected to salinity was observed. We gained consistent evidence for the existence of alternative mechanisms to ethylene modulation, which probably rely on bacterial IAA production and other chemical signals. These mechanisms modify the expression of genes associated with ethylene signaling and regulation, complementarily to the ACC deaminase model to diminish abiotic stress responses.","The authors thank Williams Arancibia, Jennifer Tapia, Carolayn Barraza, Carolina Nuñez, Eduardo Muñoz and Stefanie Maldonado.

Firstly, detailed information on research articles on this topic was obtained from the Scopus database. Secondly, the information was analyzed using Excel through the direct comparison and analysis of graphs with references and theories related to intellectual capital. Finally, the results exposed that Colombian scientific production is associated with 32 public universities, representing 45,029 elaborate documents by 9,758 authors on three relevant topics: physics and astronomy, agricultural and biological science, and medicine. Also, the data obtained exposed that 56.61% of the institutions are above the average considering the overall public institutions. However, this behavior depends on the institution’s number of researchers and full-time teachers related to intellectual capital. Finally, the hypotheses agree with the results obtained, considering that the quantity and quantity of intellectual capital significantly influence scientific production, the size and location of the public universities of Colombia, and the national and international scientific collaboration.","This work was supported by the research entitled “Influence of Intellectual Capital in the Dissemination of Knowledge and Scientific Production in the Public Institutions of Higher Education in Colombia,” Doctorate in Administration Simón Bolívar University, Barranquilla, Colombia.",,Education Research International,,Shi Yin,,2022-09-05,2022,,2022-09-05,2022,,1-16,All OA; Gold,Article,"Quintero-Quintero, W.; Blanco-Ariza, A.

Additionally, these patients suffer hormonal alterations that are associated with psychological symptoms (e.g., changes in mood, emotional instability, and memory loss). This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of a psycho-oncological intervention based on counseling to reduce anxiety and depression related to the treatment in patients with DTC.
Methods: A non-randomized controlled study, with two groups [experimental group (EG), n = 37, and control group (CG), n = 38] and baseline and posttreatment measures, was designed. Patients in the EG received a psycho-oncological intervention based on counseling in addition to the standard treatment. The independent variable was the assigned group and the dependent one was the evolution of anxiety and depression, which were analyzed separately, and both were evaluated using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. Other relevant covariables related to the quality of life (QoL) were also analyzed using Short Form-36 Health Survey and Psychological General Wellbeing Index scales.
Results: The difference of the posttreatment-baseline variation showed a statistically significant reduction in anxiety and depression in the EG in relation to the CG (p < 0.001). The mean of the Psychological General Wellbeing Index scales score increased significantly in the EG (p < 0.001) and decreased significantly in the CG (p < 0.001). All the baseline and the posttreatment scores of the variables evaluated showed a statistically significant improvement in the EG vs. the CG.

IS seeks to generate environmental sustainability, maximize resources, and generate social, environmental, and economic benefits based on the physical exchanges of waste, residues, and materials, which generate various advantages for companies and environmental benefits for society. Over the years, research has been conducted worldwide on the implementation of IS in business settings and case studies related to IS in countries with strong economies; however, no papers mapping studies on IS that are focused on emerging and frontier market countries have been identified, and academic literature on research in these countries is also scarce. In this research, an in-depth review of the literature on IS cases in emerging and frontier market countries was conducted to provide future researchers with information on the similarities, weaknesses, strengths, and elements to consider in addressing the topic and closing research gaps in the area. In addition, a mapping was made of the evolution of studies on IS according to country, economic activity, distribution by journal, year of publication, methods used, barriers and drivers in the case studies, and the importance of this topic in the current academic context. In Asian and developing countries, the integration of companies and economic activities takes place in industrial parks, and they have legislation and government regulations that support IS. On the other hand, in the United States and Africa, integrating various sources such as energy, water, coal, and waste in industrial environments is at an early stage of development, and opportunities are being identified to promote IS between companies. This research interests a broad audience, including investors, regulators, policymakers, and researchers interested in fostering IS in emerging and frontier market countries as a mechanism for industrial and economic development.",,This research received no external funding.,Sustainability,,,,2022-04-02,2022,2022-04-02,,14,7,4223,All OA; Gold,Article,"Boom-Cárcamo, Efrain; Peñabaena-Niebles, Rita","Boom-Cárcamo, Efrain (Department of Industrial Engineering, Universidad del Norte, Km 5 Vía Puerto Colombia, Barranquilla 081007, Colombia;, eboom@uninorte.edu.co; Faculty of Basic and Applied Sciences, Universidad de La Guajira, Km 5 Vía Maicao, Riohacha 440007, Colombia); Peñabaena-Niebles, Rita (Department of Industrial Engineering, Universidad del Norte, Km 5 Vía Puerto Colombia, Barranquilla 081007, Colombia;, eboom@uninorte.edu.co)","Peñabaena-Niebles, Rita (Universidad del Norte)","Boom-Cárcamo, Efrain (Universidad del Norte; University of La Guajira); Peñabaena-Niebles, Rita (Universidad del Norte)",7,3,,5.69,https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/14/7/4223/pdf?version=1648864022,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1146850984,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3507 Strategy, Management and Organisational Behaviour",

In this context, this study aimed to uncover the consequences of conflict on victims' health and on health service provision, and their perceived health status during the post-accord stage in the Meta region, located in the country's eastern plains. Historically, this region has been one of the territories most affected by the presence of conflict-related groups and armed confrontations. Through focus groups, this research explored the health perceptions and experiences of victims of armed conflict. Ten focus groups were conducted with men and women, victims of the armed-conflict, in four municipalities with different degrees of armed conflict intensity. The focus group transcripts were coded using NVivo. The results show that the way women have experienced conflict and the effects of conflict on mental health in general for men, women, and children were recurrent themes in the dialogue of victims. Likewise, it highlights the need to understand the barriers that the current health model imposes on the right to health itself. From the victim's perspective, they experience stigmatization, discrimination, and revictimization when accessing health services. These barriers co-occur along with structural limitations of the health system that affect the general population.","We would like to thank the participants, the victims’ organizations, the public officers from the department of Meta Governor’s Office, and the Secretary of Health, partners that facilitated and supported data collection in the territory.","This paper is a result of a project that was funded by the UK Medical Research Council, Economic and Social Research Council, DFID and Wellcome Trust (Joint Health Systems Research Initiative).

The research objective was to evaluate the accuracy of the Serion IgM ELISA EST125M against the Microscopic Agglutination Test (MAT = imperfect reference test); to assess its ability to diagnose acute leptospirosis infections and to detect previous exposure to leptospires in an endemic setting. In addition, to estimate the overall Leptospira spp. seroprevalence in the Wiwa indigenous population in North-East Colombia. We analysed serum samples from confirmed leptospirosis patients from the Netherlands (N = 14), blood donor sera from Switzerland (N = 20), and sera from a cross-sectional study in Colombia (N = 321). All leptospirosis ELISA-positive, and a random of negative samples from Colombia were tested by the MAT for confirmation. The ELISA performed with a sensitivity of 100% (95% CI 77% - 100%) and a specificity of 100% (95% CI 83% - 100%) based on MAT confirmed Leptospira spp. positive and negative samples. In the cross-sectional study in Colombia, the ELISA performed with a sensitivity of 100% (95% CI 2-100%) and a specificity of 21% (95% CI 15-28%). Assuming a 5% Leptospira spp. seroprevalence in this population, the positive predictive value was 6% and the negative predictive value 100%. The Leptospira spp. seroprevalence in the Wiwas tested by the ELISA was 39%; however, by MAT only 0.3%. The ELISA is suitable to diagnose leptospirosis in acutely ill patients in Europe several days after onset of disease. For cross-sectional studies it is not recommended due to its low specificity. Despite the evidence of a high leptospirosis prevalence in other study areas and populations in Colombia, the Wiwa do not seem to be highly exposed to Leptospira spp.. Nevertheless, leptospirosis should be considered and tested in patients presenting with febrile illness.","We would like to thank Dr. Klaus Reither for his constant support, Dr. Tracy Glass for statistical advice (both Swiss TPH) and Dr. Alba Luz-Luque Lommel for her support in Colombia.

As future health professionals, medical students will be a relevant generating opinion group and will have an important role in the organ requesting process. The goals of this meta-analysis were to obtain polled rates of medical students who are in favor, against, or indecisive toward cadaveric organ donation in the studies conducted around the world, and to explore sociocultural variables influencing the willingness to donate. Electronic search and revision of references from previous literature allowed us to locate 57 studies fulfilling the inclusion criteria. Data extraction and risk of bias assessment were performed by two independent investigators. Pooled estimations were computed assuming a random-effects model. Despite the fact that willingness to donate was elevated in medical students, estimated rates in studies from different geographical areas and sociocultural backgrounds exhibited significant differences. The age and the grade of the students also influenced the rate of students in favor. Donation campaigns should take into account cultural factors, especially in countries where certain beliefs and values could hamper organ donation.

The first part of this review summarizes some studies, mostly at the preclinical level, on the mechanisms by which phenolic compounds act in the human organism, taking advantage of their antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antitumor, antithrombotic, antiatherogenic, antimicrobial, antiviral, and other activities. Although the migration of grape components into the must/wine occurs during the winemaking process, the application of new technologies may contribute to increasing the content of phenolic compounds in the finished wine. Some of these technologies have been evaluated on an industrial scale, and in some cases, they have been included in the International Code of Oenological Practice by the International Organization of Vine and Wine (OIV). In this sense, the second part of this review deals with the use of these novel technologies that can increase, or at least maintain, the polyphenol content. For example, in the pre-fermentative stage, phenolic extraction can be increased by treating the berries or must with high pressures, pulsed electric fields (PEF), ultrasound (US), e-beam radiation or ozone. At fermentative level, yeasts with high production of pyranoanthocyanins and/or their precursor molecules, low polyphenol absorption, and low anthocyanin-β-glucosidase activity can be used. Whereas, at the post-fermentative level, aging-on-lees (AOL) can contribute to maintaining polyphenol levels, and therefore transmitting health benefits to the consumer.",,,Frontiers in Nutrition,,,,2022-05-25,2022,2022-05-25,,9,,890066,All OA; Gold,Article,"Vejarano, Ricardo; Luján-Corro, Mariano","Vejarano, Ricardo (Department of Research, Innovation and Social Responsibility, Universidad Privada del Norte (UPN), Trujillo, Peru); Luján-Corro, Mariano (School of Agroindustrial Engineering, Universidad Nacional de Trujillo (UNT), Trujillo, Peru)","Vejarano, Ricardo (Private University of the North)","Vejarano, Ricardo (Private University of the North); Luján-Corro, Mariano (National University of Trujillo)",12,10,1.67,5.54,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnut.2022.890066/pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1148149096,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3210 Nutrition and Dietetics,

Understanding macro visions such as the desirable size of our economies remains essential, but concrete ways of being in the world which unite such aspects of our existence as the self, being with others (humans and non-humans) and being in and with nature deserve a much closer attention. Hence, I propose focusing our attention on being once again. But rather than contemplating being as an abstract philosophical category, this paper looks at being in the world in this dual sense: we are part of the cosmos, of the web of existence and at the same time we are in the world locally, in concrete places and locations characterized by particular cultural attributes, political-economic systems, climate and landscape. This nature of being applies to individual humans and human organizations. This paper focuses specifically on business as one type of organizations. I employ the concept of degrowth business, the philosophy of critical realism and humanistic geography as lenses to enhance and deepen our understanding of what it could mean and look like for a business to be in the world locally and more sustainably. To understand what it could mean and look like in reality, I offer a case of a firm from Northern Sweden specializing in vertical hydroponic agriculture.",,,Frontiers in Sustainability,,,,2022-04-27,2022,2022-04-27,,3,,829848,All OA; Gold,Article,"Nesterova, Iana","Nesterova, Iana (Department of Geography, Umeå University, Umeå, Sweden)","Nesterova, Iana (Umeå University)","Nesterova, Iana (Umeå University)",6,4,,5.46,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/frsus.2022.829848/pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1147381027,33 Built Environment and Design; 3301 Architecture; 3302 Building; 3303 Design,

In this sense, the present study aims to develop and validate a measurement instrument for academic inspiration (AIS).Method.  A total of 7,871 university students from different careers from a private university in Lima, Peru participated. Statistical techniques were used for latent variables and the recommendations of the standards for educational and psychological tests proposed by APA, AERA and NCME (2014) were followed for their construction.Results.  The AIS is representative and relevant in the content of its items (Aiken's V> .70). In relation to its internal structure, it is organized into three factors, which are consistent with the theoretical proposal, and it was verified by Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) with excellent adjustment benefits (CFI = 0.98, RMSEA = 0.08, WRMR = 2.44). Furthermore, this structure is invariant according to gender and is conceptually related to variables such as satisfaction (r ≥ .80) and academic commitment (r ≥ 60).Discussion and Conclusion.  The AIS is a measurement instrument that has evidence of validity, factorial invariance, and good reliability of its scores.

The application of physically-based models is an effective method to predict landslide susceptibility, which is of great importance in hazard assessments and urban-planning studies. Thus, the objective of this study is to compare landslide susceptibility scenarios created with SHALSTAB and SINMAP at two large watersheds (Mogi and Perequê) in Cubatão, Latin America’s largest petrochemical site. Model calibration is based on the landslide scars inventory of the 1985 event, the geotechnical parameters derived from soil samples and the topography sourced from a 5 m resolution DEM. Using the Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) analysis to assess model performance, SHALSTAB emerges as the best-fit model for both watersheds due to higher concentration of landslide scars in unstable areas (true positive results) and higher global accuracy. Even though SINMAP had similar degree of success, it was slightly less accurate and failed more often in the identification of potentially unstable areas. Comparative performance studies of physically-based models are fundamental to support effective and reliable hazard assessments in mountain regions, providing an outlook in how to proceed with more detailed studies.",,,Revista Brasileira de Geomorfologia,,,,2022-04-06,2022,2022-04-06,,23,2,1394-1419,All OA; Gold,Article,"Cabral, Victor Carvalho; Reis, Fábio Augusto Gomes Vieira; Mendoza, Carolina Martinez; Oliveira, Alan","Cabral, Victor Carvalho (Eberhard Karls Universität Tübingen / Universidade Estadual Paulista ""Júlio de Mesquita Filho""); Reis, Fábio Augusto Gomes Vieira (Universidade Estadual Paulista - UNESP); Mendoza, Carolina Martinez (Universidad del Norte - Uninorte); Oliveira, Alan (Universidade Estadual Paulista - UNESP)",,"Cabral, Victor Carvalho (Eberhard Karls Universität Tübingen / Universidade Estadual Paulista ""Júlio de Mesquita Filho""); Reis, Fábio Augusto Gomes Vieira (São Paulo State University); Mendoza, Carolina Martinez (Universidad del Norte - Uninorte); Oliveira, Alan (São Paulo State University)",8,8,,5.39,https://rbgeomorfologia.org.br/rbg/article/download/2084/386386729,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1146924817,37 Earth Sciences; 3704 Geoinformatics,15 Life on Land

However, uncertainty in the staff demand challenges the accomplishment of that objective. This research studies the personnel assignment problem considering uncertain demand and multiskilled workforce configured through a 2-chaining strategy. We develop a two-stage stochastic optimization (TSSO) approach to calculate the multiskilling requirements that minimize the training costs and the expected costs of staff surplus/shortage. Later, we evaluate and compare the performance of the TSSO approach solutions with the solutions of two alternative optimization approaches under uncertainty - robust optimization (RO) and closed-form equation (CF). These two alternative approaches were published in Henao et al. [1] and Henao et al. [2], respectively. In addition, we compare the performance of the TSSO approach solutions with the solution of the deterministic (DT) approach and the solutions of myopic multiskilling approaches. To make performance comparisons between the different approaches, we used both real and simulated data derived from a retail store operating in Chile. The results show that, for different demand variability levels, TSSO, RO, and CF always belong to the set of approaches with the lowest average total cost. That is, in this group, there are no statistical differences from one approach to another, so these approaches are the most cost-effective. We also provide insights to retail decision-makers for addressing two key aspects. First, the methodology allows to address two fundamental multiskilling issues: how much multiskilling to add and how it should be added. Second, it is provided understanding on how to select the most suitable approach according to the balance between the conservatism and the reliability associated with the solutions delivered by each approach.

This paper proposes a market-based methodology for introducing flexible demand in the energy dispatch, optimizing the scheduling of electricity system operation in the short-term, and considers the challenge of implementing an incentive scheme for participants in demand-response programs. The scheme includes the criteria of the elasticity of substitution and a renewable energy quota. This methodology is focused on a strategic demand shift to minimize the cost of supply; increase the dispatch of renewable energy; control CO2 emissions; and satisfy the generation, demand, and transmission operating constraints. These conditions encourage the development of a simulation tool that allows a sensitivity analysis to aid decision-making by operators and agents. The proposed methodology optimizes the operational cost of generation supply and specific performance indicators to determine the percentages of demand shift, the amount of CO2 emissions, the ratio of unserved power, the demand benefits obtained from an incentive scheme, and the natural market behavior.","The authors would like to acknowledge OC (Organismo Coordinador del Sistema Eléctrico Nacional Interconectado), a nonprofit organization which plays the role of the operator of the wholesale electricity market in the Dominican Republic.

1492,pub.1145338239,10.1016/j.esr.2022.100816,,,Are the current incentives sufficient to drive the use of solar PV in the Colombian residential sector? - An analysis from the perspective of the game theory,"It is necessary to increase the use of renewable energy sources to supply the world's energy demand to mitigate the harmful effects of climate change. Many countries have incorporated the use of solar energy on a large scale. However, the use of photovoltaic (PV) systems at the residential level has been rather limited because many barriers to their implementation persist (e.g., high investment costs, insufficient government policies and incentives, and lack of knowledge in the implementation and operation of these systems). This paper aims to investigate how the interaction between prosumers and consumers can drive the use of PV systems at the residential level. The interaction is analyzed from the field of game theory. The payoffs of the players' strategies determine not only the Nash equilibrium but also the desirability of the interaction for both investment in the case of prosumer and consumption costs in the case of the consumer. Prosumer strategies consisted of selling power to the grid and to the consumer; selling only to the consumer; selling only to the grid; selling to the grid and giving to the consumer; and only giving to the consumer. The consumer strategies were to buy only from the grid or to buy from both the grid and the prosumer. The prosumer's investment in three sizes of PV systems (2.3, 2.7 and 3.6 kW) were analyzed; the amount of electricity produced was estimated using PVWatts and data from a Typical Meteorological Year in the city of Barranquilla, Colombia. The Net Present Value of each investment was calculated considering the prosumer's strategies and this indicator was taken to an equivalent annual cost to represent the prosumer's payment in the Nash equilibrium. On the other hand, for the consumer's payments, the annual energy purchase costs to supply their demand were used, according to the consumer's strategies. Analysis found that PV systems that can produce surpluses can be attractive to the prosumer if the tax on revenues received from the sale of energy to the grid is eliminated. Profitability is further improved if the prosumer is allowed to sell their surplus to other consumers, with the purchase price to the grid being the maximum price at which they can sell to other consumers. In turn, the cost savings for consumers will be greater to the extent that they can buy cheaper energy from prosumers. Based on these findings, countries such as Colombia, where there has not been a massive use of solar photovoltaic energy at the residential level, can stimulate investments in this sector by eliminating the income tax on the sales of surplus energy of small prosumers, without representing a loss of income for these countries.",Declaration of competing interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.,"This work was supported by Universidad del Norte, Colombia.",Energy Strategy Reviews,,,,2022-03,2022,,2022-03,40,,100816,All OA; Gold,Article,"Guzman, Luceny; Henao, Alvin","Guzman, Luceny (Industrial Engineering Department, Universidad del Norte, Km 5 Via Antigua a Puerto Colombia, Area Metropolitana de Barrranquilla, Colombia); Henao, Alvin (Industrial Engineering Department, Universidad del Norte, Km 5 Via Antigua a Puerto Colombia, Area Metropolitana de Barrranquilla, Colombia)","Henao, Alvin (Universidad del Norte)","Guzman, Luceny (Universidad del Norte); Henao, Alvin (Universidad del Norte)",8,5,,5.18,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.esr.2022.100816,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1145338239,38 Economics; 3801 Applied Economics; 40 Engineering; 4008 Electrical Engineering,13 Climate Action; 7 Affordable and Clean Energy

Students share an interest in issues related to rights and politics, both locally and globally. Colombia arrived at a historical juncture with the signing of the peace accords between the government and FARC guerrillas in 2016. However, this coincided with an extreme polarisation of political discourse. This polarisation was evident throughout the 2016 plebiscite on the peace agreements and further intensified in the build-up to the 2018 presidential elections. In response, teachers and students created a web series where students outlined the candidates’ critical proposals without revealing the candidates’ identities. Students researched the proposals and worked with a teacher to prepare English transcripts of the proposals. Eight videos were created, shared via social media, and made available to local English teachers at secondary and university levels. The project’s purpose was to encourage active citizenship and foment a more critical analysis of the candidates’ proposals. To achieve this, students utilised the anonymity of the candidates and English as the chief medium of communication. This project allowed teachers to use authentic and relevant student-generated materials to encourage more critical discussion. The students involved in the project reported feelings of political efficacy and civic engagement. Teachers expressed satisfaction at having contextually rich language materials.

Source Leaf Adaptation to Shading Stress Affects Not Only Photosynthetic Physiology Metabolism but Also Control of Key Gene Expression,"Shading stress strongly limits the effective growth of plants. Understanding how plant morphogenesis and physiological adaptation are generated in response to the reduced low light conditions is important for food crop development. In this study, two mung bean (Vigna radiata L.) cultivars, namely, Xilv 1 and Yulv 1, were grown in the field to explore the effects of shading stress on their growth. The results of morphology, physiology, and biochemistry analyses showed that the shading stress significantly weakened the leaf photosynthetic capacity as measured by the decreased net photosynthetic rate, stomatal conductance, and transpiration rate and increased intercellular CO2 concentration. These responses resulted in plant morphological characteristics that increased the light energy absorption in low light conditions. Such variations occurred due to the leaf anatomical structure with destroyed palisade tissues and spongy tissues. Under shading stress, Yulv 1 showed higher physiological metabolic intensity than Xilv 1, which was related to changes in chlorophyll (Chl), such as Chl a and b, and Chl a/b ratio. Compared with normal light conditions, the Chl fluorescence values, photosynthetic assimilation substances, and enzyme activities in mung bean plants under shading stress were reduced to different extent. In addition, the relative expression levels of VrGA2ox, VrGA20ox1, VrGA3ox1, VrROT3, and VrBZR1, which are related to endogenous hormone in mung bean leaves, were upregulated by shading stress, further leading to the improvements in the concentrations of auxin, gibberellins (GAs), and brassinolide (BR). Combined with the morphological, physiological, and molecular responses, Yulv 1 has stronger tolerance and ecological adaptability to shading stress than Xilv 1. Therefore, our study provides insights into the agronomic traits and gene expressions of mung bean cultivars to enhance their adaptability to the shading stress.",,,Frontiers in Plant Science,,,,2022-02-04,2022,2022-02-04,,13,,753264,All OA; Gold,Article,"Gong, Xiangwei; Liu, Chunjuan; Dang, Ke; Wang, Honglu; Du, Wanli; Qi, Hua; Jiang, Ying; Feng, Baili","Gong, Xiangwei (College of Agronomy, Shenyang Agricultural University, Shenyang, China; State Key Laboratory of Crop Stress Biology in Arid Areas, College of Agronomy, Northwest A&F University, Yangling, China); Liu, Chunjuan (College of Agronomy, Shenyang Agricultural University, Shenyang, China); Dang, Ke (State Key Laboratory of Crop Stress Biology in Arid Areas, College of Agronomy, Northwest A&F University, Yangling, China); Wang, Honglu (State Key Laboratory of Crop Stress Biology in Arid Areas, College of Agronomy, Northwest A&F University, Yangling, China); Du, Wanli (College of Agronomy, Shenyang Agricultural University, Shenyang, China); Qi, Hua (College of Agronomy, Shenyang Agricultural University, Shenyang, China); Jiang, Ying (College of Agronomy, Shenyang Agricultural University, Shenyang, China); Feng, Baili (State Key Laboratory of Crop Stress Biology in Arid Areas, College of Agronomy, Northwest A&F University, Yangling, China)","Jiang, Ying (Shenyang Agricultural University); Feng, Baili (North West Agriculture and Forestry University)","Gong, Xiangwei (Shenyang Agricultural University; North West Agriculture and Forestry University); Liu, Chunjuan (Shenyang Agricultural University); Dang, Ke (North West Agriculture and Forestry University); Wang, Honglu (North West Agriculture and Forestry University); Du, Wanli (Shenyang Agricultural University); Qi, Hua (Shenyang Agricultural University); Jiang, Ying (Shenyang Agricultural University); Feng, Baili (North West Agriculture and Forestry University)",10,6,1.09,5.03,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpls.2022.753264/pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1145289983,"30 Agricultural, Veterinary and Food Sciences; 3004 Crop and Pasture Production; 31 Biological Sciences; 3103 Ecology; 3108 Plant Biology",
238,pub.1147921852,10.3390/rel13050442,,,Religion Involvement and Substance Use Problems in Schoolchildren in Northern Chile,"(1) Background: Religious involvement and spirituality have proven to be sources of well-being for individuals at different moments in life and are also associated with a decrease in depression, anxiety, and substance use. Therefore, these could be protective factors against stressful conditions and contribute to mental health. The aim of the present study was to analyze the relationship between religious involvement and substance use among students in northern Chile. (2) Methods: The design is retrospective ex post facto with only one group, and the sample included 2313 adolescents between 12 and 18 years of age from public and private schools. A subscale of the Child and Adolescent Assessment System was used to assess substance use and Universal Age I-E-12 to measure religious involvement. (3) Results: The findings suggest that the intrinsic orientation of religiousness (β = −0.048, p < 0.014), age (β = 0.374, p < 0.000), gender (β = 0.039, p < 0.040), and ethnic identity (β = 0.051, p < 0.008) have significant correlations with substance use. (4) Conclusions: The intrinsic orientation of religion is a relevant variable associated with consumption due to its non-instrumental characteristics of religion and practices aimed at self-exploration and self-knowledge that favor the subjective well-being of individuals, which could prevent drug use from becoming an alternative for dealing with conflicts in the children and young population of this region of Latin America.",,"This research was funded by Agencia Nacional de Investigación y Desarrollo de Chile (ANID), grant ANID PIA CIE 160007.",Religions,,,,2022-05-16,2022,2022-05-16,,13,5,442,All OA; Gold,Article,"Caqueo-Urízar, Alejandra; Peroza, Erika; Escobar-Soler, Carolang; Flores, Jerome; Urzúa, Alfonso; Irarrázaval, Matías; Reygadas, Karina; Zegarra, Gustavo","Caqueo-Urízar, Alejandra (Instituto de Alta Investigación, Universidad de Tarapacá, Arica 1000000, Chile); Peroza, Erika (Hospital Regional Dr. Hernán Henríquez Aravena, Manuel Montt 115, Universidad de la Frontera, Temuco 4780000, Chile;, egpm1902@gmail.com); Escobar-Soler, Carolang (Escuela de Psicología y Filosofía, Facultad de Ciencias Sociales y Jurídicas, Universidad de Tarapacá, Arica 1000000, Chile;, cescobars@uta.cl, (C.E.-S.);, jflores@uta.cl, (J.F.);, kari_reygadas@hotmail.com, (K.R.);, gustavozegarrarios@gmail.com, (G.Z.)); Flores, Jerome (Escuela de Psicología y Filosofía, Facultad de Ciencias Sociales y Jurídicas, Universidad de Tarapacá, Arica 1000000, Chile;, cescobars@uta.cl, (C.E.-S.);, jflores@uta.cl, (J.F.);, kari_reygadas@hotmail.com, (K.R.);, gustavozegarrarios@gmail.com, (G.Z.); Centro de Justicia Educacional CJE, Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile, Santiago 8380453, Chile); Urzúa, Alfonso (Escuela de Psicología, Universidad Católica del Norte, Antofagasta 1270709, Chile;, alurzua@ucn.cl); Irarrázaval, Matías (Departamento de Psiquiatría, Facultad de Medicina, Hospital Clínico de la Universidad de Chile, Santiago 8380453, Chile;, mirarrazavald@uchile.cl; Institute for Depression and Personality Research MIDAP, Santiago 8380453, Chile); Reygadas, Karina (Escuela de Psicología y Filosofía, Facultad de Ciencias Sociales y Jurídicas, Universidad de Tarapacá, Arica 1000000, Chile;, cescobars@uta.cl, (C.E.-S.);, jflores@uta.cl, (J.F.);, kari_reygadas@hotmail.com, (K.R.);, gustavozegarrarios@gmail.com, (G.Z.)); Zegarra, Gustavo (Escuela de Psicología y Filosofía, Facultad de Ciencias Sociales y Jurídicas, Universidad de Tarapacá, Arica 1000000, Chile;, cescobars@uta.cl, (C.E.-S.);, jflores@uta.cl, (J.F.);, kari_reygadas@hotmail.com, (K.R.);, gustavozegarrarios@gmail.com, (G.Z.))","Caqueo-Urízar, Alejandra (University of Tarapacá)","Caqueo-Urízar, Alejandra (University of Tarapacá); Peroza, Erika (University of La Frontera); Escobar-Soler, Carolang (University of Tarapacá; Escuela de Psicología y Filosofía, Facultad de Ciencias Sociales y Jurídicas, Universidad de Tarapacá, Arica 1000000, Chile;, cescobars@uta.cl, (C.E.-S.);, jflores@uta.cl, (J.F.);, kari_reygadas@hotmail.com, (K.R.);, gustavozegarrarios@gmail.com, (G.Z.)); Flores, Jerome (University of Tarapacá; Escuela de Psicología y Filosofía, Facultad de Ciencias Sociales y Jurídicas, Universidad de Tarapacá, Arica 1000000, Chile;, cescobars@uta.cl, (C.E.-S.);, jflores@uta.cl, (J.F.);, kari_reygadas@hotmail.com, (K.R.);, gustavozegarrarios@gmail.com, (G.Z.); Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile); Urzúa, Alfonso (Catholic University of the North); Irarrázaval, Matías (Hospital Clínico de la Universidad de Chile; Millennium Institute for Research in Depression and Personality); Reygadas, Karina (University of Tarapacá; Escuela de Psicología y Filosofía, Facultad de Ciencias Sociales y Jurídicas, Universidad de Tarapacá, Arica 1000000, Chile;, cescobars@uta.cl, (C.E.-S.);, jflores@uta.cl, (J.F.);, kari_reygadas@hotmail.com, (K.R.);, gustavozegarrarios@gmail.com, (G.Z.)); Zegarra, Gustavo (University of Tarapacá; Escuela de Psicología y Filosofía, Facultad de Ciencias Sociales y Jurídicas, Universidad de Tarapacá, Arica 1000000, Chile;, cescobars@uta.cl, (C.E.-S.);, jflores@uta.cl, (J.F.);, kari_reygadas@hotmail.com, (K.R.);, gustavozegarrarios@gmail.com, (G.Z.))",1,1,,5.02,https://www.mdpi.com/2077-1444/13/5/442/pdf?version=1652689669,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1147921852,50 Philosophy and Religious Studies; 5004 Religious Studies; 5005 Theology,3 Good Health and Well Being

The classifying network traffic method using machine learning shows to perform well in detecting malware. In the literature, it is reported that this good performance can depend on a reduced set of network features. This study presents an empirical evaluation of two statistical methods of reduction and selection of features in an Android network traffic dataset using six supervised algorithms: Naïve Bayes, support vector machine, multilayer perceptron neural network, decision tree, random forest, and K‐nearest neighbors. The principal component analysis (PCA) and logistic regression (LR) methods with p value were applied to select the most representative features related to the time properties of flows and features of bidirectional packets. The selected features were used to train the algorithms using binary and multiclass classification. For performance evaluation and comparison metrics, precision, recall, F‐measure, accuracy, and area under the curve (AUC‐ROC) were used. The empirical results show that random forest obtains an average accuracy of 96% and an AUC‐ROC of 0.98 in binary classification. For the case of multiclass classification, again random forest achieves an average accuracy of 87% and an AUC‐ROC over 95%, exhibiting better performance than the other machine learning algorithms. In both experiments, the 13 most representative features of a mixed set of flow time properties and bidirectional network packets selected by LR were used. In the case of the other five classifiers, their results in terms of precision, recall, and accuracy, are competitive with those obtained in related works, which used a greater number of input features. Therefore, it is empirically evidenced that the proposed method for the selection of features, based on statistical techniques of reduction and extraction of attributes, allows improving the identification performance of malware traffic, discriminating it from the benign traffic of Android applications.",,,Complexity,,Giacomo Fiumara,,2022-01,2022,2022-04-07,2022-01,2022,1,,All OA; Gold,Article,"Manzano, C.; Meneses, C.; Leger, P.; Fukuda, H.","Manzano, C.

It gave priority to older adults, who constituted 77.7% of deaths from this illness in the year 2020. The main goal of the plan is to decrease specific mortality and the number of serious COVID-19 cases, however, the number of deaths avoided by this strategy is unknown. The objective of this study was to estimate the number of avoided deaths in Colombia by fully vaccinating older adults against COVID-19, during the first year of the implementation of the national vaccination plan. Methods: This study took on the design of an ecological, longitudinal study. Full vaccination coverage for older adults was calculated for each epidemiological week and age group from March to December 2021, based on which the number of avoided COVID-19 deaths was estimated. A sensitivity analysis was performed taking into account variations in the vaccines' effectiveness by age group. Results: In Colombia, over 5.3 million adults 60 years of age and older received full COVID-19 vaccinations between March and December 2021. During that same period, nearly 46,000 deaths of older adults from this cause were registered. We estimated that vaccination has avoided around 22,000 more older adults from dying from COVID-19 in Colombia, that is, 32.4% of expected deaths in 2021. According to the sensitivity analysis, the number of lives saved ranged from 19,597 to 36,507. Conclusions: Colombia's strategy to vaccinate older adults against COVID-19 has avoided mortality for this age group from being 48.0% higher than what was observed during the study period. Even more lives have been saved when taking into account the parameters that were defined and the omission of the contribution from partial vaccinations.",,The author(s) declared that no grants were involved in supporting this work.,F1000Research,,,Aged; COVID-19; COVID-19 Vaccines; Colombia; Humans; Longitudinal Studies; Vaccination,2022-07-07,2022,2022-07-07,,11,,198,All OA; Gold,Article,"Rojas-Botero, Maylen Liseth; Fernández-Niño, Julián Alfredo; Arregocés-Castillo, Leonardo; Ruiz-Gómez, Fernando","Rojas-Botero, Maylen Liseth (Ministerio de Salud y Protección Social, Bogota, Bogota, 110311, Colombia); Fernández-Niño, Julián Alfredo (Ministerio de Salud y Protección Social, Bogota, Bogota, 110311, Colombia; Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); Arregocés-Castillo, Leonardo (Ministerio de Salud y Protección Social, Bogota, Bogota, 110311, Colombia); Ruiz-Gómez, Fernando (Ministerio de Salud y Protección Social, Bogota, Bogota, 110311, Colombia)","Fernández-Niño, Julián Alfredo (Ministry of Health and Social Protection; Universidad del Norte)","Rojas-Botero, Maylen Liseth (Ministry of Health and Social Protection); Fernández-Niño, Julián Alfredo (Ministry of Health and Social Protection; Universidad del Norte); Arregocés-Castillo, Leonardo (Ministry of Health and Social Protection); Ruiz-Gómez, Fernando (Ministry of Health and Social Protection)",7,5,0.53,4.86,https://f1000research.com/articles/11-198/v3/pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1149313267,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3202 Clinical Sciences; 42 Health Sciences,3 Good Health and Well Being

The article was the foundation stone of a theoretical current that would dominate Pampean Archaeology for the next thirty years. This essay summarizes and discusses the findings and interpretations of Menghin and Bórmida on the materials of the Gruta del Oro and analyzes the theoretical and political context to explain why the model proposed by Menghin and Bórmida was dominant until the 1980s.",,,RUNA archivo para las ciencias del hombre,,,,2022-08-10,2022,2022-08-10,,43,3,431-448,All OA; Gold,Article,"Politis, Gustavo","Politis, Gustavo (Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Científicas y Técnicas (CONICET) – INCUAPA.

Of 74,270 papers found on 13 search engines between 12 August 2020, and 2 November 2021, we identified six studies (n = 1392 and 1097 were women). We found several results on the perception of both variables during the pandemic. First, physical activity tended to decrease or have negative changes, either because they dedicated less time to it, decreased the type of intensity or because they dedicated more time to sedentary activities. In addition, women were more physically active than men, since men perceived a decrease in their levels of physical activity. Secondly, there were also slight changes in the perception of body image; several students perceived that they gained weight and others had an increase in their BMI. It is even noted that those who were physically active or who were older in the population studied had a better perception of their actual physical condition. Similarly, we found that a concern for body image and even negative changes in the perception of appearance during confinement were reported. In conclusion, we found changes in the perception of physical activity and body image in college students during the COVID-19 pandemic.",The authors acknowledge the support of the Nesh Hubbs Qualitative Unit team.,This research received no external funding.,International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health,,Paul B.

Su importancia surge cuando se analizan las conductas de los seres humanos en el mbito de la interaccin social y se trata de comprender y dar significados a sus actos, guindonos para la interpretacin y comprensin de sus actuaciones en el marco de lo social. As conductas de tipo conflictivas, cooperativas y competitivas nos muestran diversos modos de comportamientos, pero tambin diversas formas a travs de los cuales las personas solucionan sus conflictos, los cuales finalmente derivan en la mayora de los casos, del sistema jurdico propio de cada pas, que se caracterizan por la intervencin o no, de terceros que actan como facilitadores o decisores del conflicto. El presente artculo, resultado de una investigacin doctoral, tiene como objetivo analizar cmo el Derecho define el conflicto y al mismo tiempo cmo lo regula, con el propsito de analizar la importancia de los desarrollos legales que vienen dando sobre formas diferentes al proceso judicial pero que tienen los mismos efectos jurdicos en relacin a la solucin del conflicto, y que en pases como Colombia, resultan ser formas de administracin de justicia, diferentes al proceso judicial, operadas por particulares que tienen facultad para administrar justicia de manera ocasional y transitoria. De ese modo, el Estado tiene el deber de garantizar, siempre que exista un conflicto, el que las partes pueden acceder a la justicia ordinaria pero tambin a los mecanismos alternativos, para solucionarlos.

Abstract Alternative dispute resolution mechanisms demand an analysis of the relationship between conflict and the Law. Its importance arises when the behaviors of human beings in the field of social interaction are analyzed and the meaning of their actions discovered, guiding us to interpret and understand their actions within the social framework. Thus, behaviors of a conflictive, cooperative and competitive type show us not only different modes of behavior but also different ways through which people solve their conflicts, in accord and framed by the legal system of each country. Different conflict styles are characterized by the intervention or not of third parties who act as facilitators or decision makers of the conflict solving. This paper aims to analyze how the Law defines the conflict while at the same time regulates it, using data from my doctoral research. It analyzes legal developments differing from the judicial process but having the same legal effects in relation to the resolution of the conflict, and in countries like Colombia, they turn out to be forms of administration of justice, separated and different from the judicial process, operated by individuals who have the power to administer justice occasionally and temporarily. In this way, the State has the duty to guarantee, whenever there is a conflict, that the parties can access both ordinary justice but also alternative mechanisms to solve them. Hence, the Law performs one of its most important functions, promoting the resolution of conflicts.",,,Ius et Praxis,,,,2022-04,2022,2022-04,,28,1,236-253,All OA; Gold,Article,"de Jess Illera Santos, Mara","de Jess Illera Santos, Mara ()",,"de Jess Illera Santos, Mara ()",4,3,,4.71,http://www.scielo.cl/pdf/iusetp/v28n1/0718-0012-iusetp-28-01-236.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1147981882,44 Human Society; 4404 Development Studies; 48 Law and Legal Studies,"16 Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions"

In contrast to patient-specific sources of information, mass media may potentially reach healthy people, thus preventing them from becoming part of the diabetes statistics. Articles published within a selected corpus from the years 2013 to 2018 and related to awareness regarding diabetes were sampled, and their readability was scored using Flesch Kinkaid Reading Ease (FKRE). Features of three articles ranked as the best and worst for readability were qualitatively analyzed. The average readability for the materials is low at 49.6 FKRE, which may impede the uptake of information contained in the articles. Feature analysis of articles with the best and worst readability indicates that medical practitioners may not be the best spokesperson to reach the public. It also indicates that simple sentence structures could help improve readability. There is still much room for improvement in attaining good public health literacy through mass media communication.

The urgent need for novel agents able to inhibit the function of both pumps, led us to evaluate this property in 137 extracts obtained from Argentinian plants.MethodsThe ability of the extracts to reverse efflux pump-mediated MDR was determined with an agar chemosensitization assay using fluconazole (FCZ) resistant Mdr1- and Cdr1-overexpressing clinical isolates of Candida albicans and Candida glabrata as well as Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains selectively expressing Mdr1 (AD/CaMDR1) or Cdr1 (AD/CaCDR1). The resistance-reversing activity of the most potent extracts was further confirmed using a Nile Red accumulation assay.ResultsFifteen plant extracts overcame the FCZ resistance of Candida albicans 1114, which overexpresses CaMdr1 and CaCdr1, and AD/CaMDR1, with those from Acalypha communis and Solanum atriplicifolium being the most effective showing 4- to 16-fold reversal of resistance at concentrations ≥ 25 µg/mL. Both extracts, and to a lesser extent that from Pterocaulon alopecuroides, also restored FCZ sensitivity in CgCdr1-overexpressing C. glabrata 109 and in AD/CaCDR1 with fold reversal values ranging from 4 to 32 and therefore demonstrating a dual effect against Mdr1 and Cdr1. Both, A. communis and S. atriplicifolium extracts at concentrations ≥ 12.5 and ≥ 25 µg/mL, respectively, increased the intracellular Nile Red accumulation in all yeast strains overexpressing efflux pumps.ConclusionsThe non-toxic and highly active extracts from A. communis and S. atripicifolium, provide promising sources of compounds for potentiating the antifungal effect of FCZ by blocking the efflux function of Mdr1 and Cdr1 transporters.",F.

Para ello, en primer lugar analizaremos la consideración de la neutralidad y la dispersión en Sein und Zeit en el marco de sus especificaciones respecto del Dasein cotidiano. Luego, distinguiremos las especificaciones y reelaboraciones en su curso de Marburg (1928), respecto del estatuto ontológico que le confiere a la neutralidad en sus relaciones con la concreción fáctica y la libertad. Finalmente dedicaremos el último apartado al análisis e interpretación del sentido de la neutralidad y la dispersión que articula de modo diferencial en su curso de Freiburg (1928-1929).

ABSTRACT In this work we will analyze the considerations about Dasein´s neutrality and sexuality in their articulations with the factual dispersion and freedom in Heidegger’s elaborations between 1927 and 1929. In this framework we propose to argue that such considerations have the function of highlighting the primary character of the ontological structure of Being-with and the original horizon of temporality, from which it circumscribes the thrust of the respective dynamics. To do this, we will first analyze the consideration of neutrality and dispersion in Sein und Zeit within the framework of its specifications regarding everyday Dasein. Then, we will distinguish the specifications and reworkings in his course from Marburg (1928), regarding the ontological status that he confers on neutrality in its relations with factual concretion and freedom. Finally, we will dedicate the last section to the analysis and interpretation of the meaning of neutrality and dispersion that he articulates in a differential way in his Freiburg course (1928-1929). Next to it, we seek to contribute with the clarification of the place occupied by the considerations of physical corporeality in this period, in dialogue with relevant interpretations of his work.",,,Kriterion Revista de Filosofia,,,,2022-01,2022,2022-01,,63,151,31-53,All OA; Gold,Article,"Butierrez, Luis Fernando","Butierrez, Luis Fernando (Universidad Nacional de La Plata, La Plata, Buenos Aires, luisbutierrez@yahoo.com.ar, Universidad Nacional de La Plata (UNLP); Universidad de Ciencias empresariales (UCES) La Plata, Buenos Aires, Argentina; Universidad de Ciencias empresariales, La Plata, Buenos Aires)",,"Butierrez, Luis Fernando (National University of La Plata; Universidad de Ciencias empresariales, La Plata, Buenos Aires)",2,2,,4.6,https://www.scielo.br/j/kr/a/3dMXGvPSqjxyJkSTvzQQKjx/?lang=es&format=pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1147551475,50 Philosophy and Religious Studies; 5003 Philosophy,

This discrete group accounts for the observed pattern of fermion masses and mixing angles after spontaneous symmetry breaking. In this scenario only the third generation of fermions get their masses as in the Standard Model (SM). The masses of the remaining fermions are generated through a seesaw-like mechanism. To that end, the matter content of the model is enlarged by introducing electrically charged vector-like fermions (VLFs), right handed Majorana neutrinos and several SM scalar singlets. Here we study the processes involving VLFs that are within the reach of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). We perform collider studies for vector-like leptons (VLLs) and vector-like quarks (VLQs), focusing on double production channels for both cases, while for VLLs single production topologies are also included. Utilizing genetic algorithms for neural network optimization, we determine the statistical significance for a hypothetical discovery at future LHC runs. In particular, we show that we can not safely exclude VLLs for masses greater than 200 GeV. For VLQ’s in our model, we show that we can probe their masses up to 3.8 TeV, if we take only into account the high-luminosity phase of the LHC. Considering Run-III luminosities, we can also exclude VLQs for masses up to 3.4 TeV. We also show how the model with predicted VLL masses accommodates the muon anomalous magnetic moment.",,,Journal of High Energy Physics,,,,2022-01-26,2022,2022-01-26,2022-01,2022,1,154,All OA; Gold,Article,"Bonilla, Cesar; Hernández, A.

Therefore, the aim of this study was to develop and validate a scale that assesses monkeypox fear, the Monkeypox Fear Scale (MFS).MethodsA total of 451 Peruvians participated (61% women and 39% men), with a mean age of 28.31 years (SD = 9.72). based on procedures from classical test theory (CTT) and item response theory (IRT). Classical Test Theory (CTT) and Item Response Theory (IRT) procedures were used.ResultsThe results showed that MFS has a two-factor structure related to emotional and physiological fear factors (χ2 = 41.87; df = 12; p < .001; CFI = .99; TLI = .99; RMSEA = .074 [IC90% .051–.100]). In addition, the physiological and emotional factors showed good reliability. Measurement invariance analysis showed that the factor structure of the MFS is strictly invariant between male and female groups. Finally, the discrimination and difficulty parameters of the items show adequacy. In addition, the scale seems to be more accurate in measuring high levels of fear of monkeypox.ConclusionThe MFS has adequate psychometric evidence to assess fear of monkeypox in the Peruvian population. These findings may guide future studies related to the consequences of monkeypox on mental health.",Not applicable.,No funding received.,BMC Psychology,,,Female; Humans; Male; Adult; Mpox (monkeypox); Peru; Reproducibility of Results; Emotions; Mental Health,2022-11-28,2022,2022-11-28,,10,1,280,All OA; Gold,Article,"Caycho-Rodríguez, Tomás; Vilca, Lindsey W.; Carbajal-León, Carlos; Gallegos, Miguel; Reyes-Bossio, Mario; Noe-Grijalva, Martin; Delgado-Campusano, Mariel; Muñoz-del-Carpio-Toia, Águeda","Caycho-Rodríguez, Tomás (Facultad de Ciencias de la Salud, Universidad Privada del Norte, Av.

This work focuses on an industrial-scale rotary kiln for Ferronickel production via the Rotary Kiln-Electric Furnace (RKEF) process. Rotary kilns are prone to mechanical failure exacerbated by thermal effects, mainly during transient operation, such as preheating and cooling. However, few studies have tackled the impact of the transient operation on the stress state in the rotary kiln wall. Therefore, we evaluate the thermal and mechanical behavior of the rotary kiln wall during preheating. Actual operation data and a thermal model enable to obtain the temperature distribution along the kiln length. This temperature distribution is the starting point for calculating the stress state of the shell and refractory. The maximal thermal gradient occurs at 10 m from the hot end, with temperatures at the outer and inner surfaces of 200 °C and 820 °C, respectively. The von Mises stress shows a maximum of 121 MPa at the wheel position in the hot region of the refractory and a range of 30–60 MPa in the shell. In addition, the compressive stress is higher than the ultimate compressive strength of the refractory. However, it does not necessarily represent refractory detachment due to the plastic deformation undergone by the refractory under high temperatures. This work paves the way towards developing a tool for accurately predicting rotary kiln mechanical failure, which can help optimize operating conditions and assist in programming maintenance.",The research leading to these results has received funding from MINCIENCIAS under the project “Incremento en la Capacidad Operativa y Eficiencia de Producción de CERRO MATOSO S.A&quot; with contract number 4684-786-66497.,,Results in Engineering,,,,2022-06,2022,,2022-06,14,,100396,All OA; Gold,Article,"Guillin-Estrada, Wilson D.; Albuja, Rafael; Dávila, Ivan B.; Rueda, Bernardo S.; Corredor, Lesme; Gonzalez-Quiroga, Arturo; Maury, Heriberto","Guillin-Estrada, Wilson D.

These workers are exposed to chronic intermittent hypobaric hypoxia (CIHH), which reduces their sleep quality and increases the risk of accidents and long-term illnesses. Melatonin, a hormone produced by the pineal gland, is a sleep inducer that regulates the circadian cycle and may be altered in populations subjected to CIHH. This work aimed to assess the relationship between altitude, sleep quality, and plasma melatonin concentrations in miners with CIHH exposure. 288 volunteers were recruited from five altitudes (0, 1,600, 2,500, 3,500, and 4,500 m). All volunteers worked for 7 days at altitude, followed by 7 days of rest at sea level. We performed anthropometric assessments, nocturnal oximetry, sleep quality and sleepiness surveys, and serum melatonin levels upon awakening. Although oxygen saturation progressively decreased and heart rate increased at higher altitudes, subjective perception of sleep quality was not significantly different, and sleepiness increased in all groups compared to population at sea level. Similarly, melatonin levels increased at all assessed altitudes compared to the population at sea level. These data confirm that sleep disturbances associated with CIHH increase morning melatonin levels. Therefore, this hormone and could potentially serve as a biomarker of sleep quality.","This work was funded by the Innova-Corfo Project 07CN13ISM-152 “Producción, Aplicación y Validación de Biomarcadores de Exposición Laboral en Trabajadores de Empresas Mineras del Norte de Chile,” executed at the Facultad de Medicina of Universidad Católica del Norte.

We used the significant improvement in the accuracy of protein structure prediction recently implemented in AlphaFold that incorporates novel neural network architectures and training procedures based on the evolutionary, physical, and geometric constraints of protein structures. The wild-type (WT) sequence and the mutated sequence, missing the Phe233, were reconstructed. The predicted local Distance Difference Test (lDDT) for the PURAwt and the PURA-Phe233del showed that the occurrence of the Phe233del affects between 220-320 amino acids. The distortion in the PURA structural conformation in the ~5 Å surrounding area after the p.Phe233del produces a conspicuous disruption of the repeat III, where the DNA and RNA helix unwinding capability occurs. PURA Protein-DNA docking corroborated these results in an in silico analysis that showed a loss of the contact of the PURA-Phe233del III repeat domain model with the DNA. Together, (i) the energetic and stereochemical, (ii) the hydropathic indexes and polarity surfaces, and (iii) the hybrid Quantum Mechanics-Molecular Mechanics (QM-MM) analyses of the PURA molecular models demarcate, at the atomic resolution, the specific surrounding region affected by these mutations and pave the way for future cell-based functional analysis.

It affects 5% of the adult population in the world and is the leading cause of disability, with an annual cost of USD one trillion. In Spain, its prevalence is 13.4%, costing EUR 6000 million a year. Physical inactivity has been linked to an increase in depressive symptoms, with physical activity associated with an improvement in health-related quality of life. Objective: To calculate the odds ratio (OR) and relative risk (RR) of suffering from depression and taking antidepressants in the inactive Spanish population compared to groups with a higher level of physical activity. Method: 17,141 individuals aged 18−69 years residing in Spain and interviewed in the 2017 Spanish National Health Survey were included in this cross-sectional investigation. Results: Dependence relationships were found between the level of physical activity and the prevalence of depression and taking antidepressants (p < 0.001). We found elevated ORs and RRs for depression and antidepressant use in inactive people compared to those with a high/very high level of physical activity (Depression: OR: 4.32. CI95%: 3.35−5.57. RR: 1.59. 95% CI: 1.51−1.68; Antidepressants: OR: 4.95. CI95%: 3.59−6.82. RR: 1.61. CI95%: 1.52−1.71).

In addition to the negative environmental impacts of food waste, the effect of the amount of food that is wasted when it is not handled properly is even more alarming. This is particularly when we witness the millions of people who suffer from lack of food and malnutrition. The objective of this research is to examine the situation of organic waste management in food services in the cities of Lima and Tacna in Peru. Using a quantitative methodological approach to waste management, a questionnaire was administered to a sample of 67 restaurants in both cities. The survey results suggest that the restaurants do not carry out the separation or reuse of organic waste. Furthermore, the main methods of disposal include providing surpluses to the staff and sending organic waste to the sanitary landfill and slaughterhouses. There is also a lack of awareness and training about the importance of organic waste management. From the restaurants interviewed, although around 60% claimed to segregate them, only 28% measured organic waste using a manual control and 18% indicated that they weighed the waste for management purposes. As a corrective measure for this deficiency, the production of an awareness video was created to improve decision-making and support change.",,"This research was carried out as part of the Manchester Metropolitan University Grant: QR Global Challenges Research Fund 2021: Project/“Strengthening Collaborative Food Waste Prevention in Colombia and Peru: Towards Responsible Production and Consumption”.

Adaptación de la escala de necesidades psicológicas básicas a futuros docentes,"There are still few studies that address the importance of knowing the psychological needs and frustrations of teachers at the basic levels of education when they are in the training period. The aim of this study was to revalidate the scale of basic psychological needs (S-PNTS) in order to recognize whether it is sufficiently adequate to apply and obtain results with guaranteed success in trainee teachers and to study the inference of socio-demographic and personal variables in frustration and psychological needs. A quantitative methodology has been used following a survey method with a non-experimental design, applied to a sample of 598 university students of the degrees of Teacher in Early Childhood Education and Primary Education, and of the Master’s Degree in Teacher Training in Compulsory Secondary Education of two Spanish universities (one in the north and one in the south) and of equivalent degrees in a Chilean university, with an age range between 18 and 54 years old. The programs used were SPSS.24, Factor.10, MPlus.7 and G*Power 3. After carrying out the factor analyses, the result was that the scale was configured with one less item than the original one but maintaining the three-dimensional scale. The results also reveal that trainee teachers in Primary Education show a greater approximation to frustration than those in Early Childhood and Secondary Education. On the other hand, students from the south of Spain feel less competent, more autonomous and perceive a better relationship in the teaching environment than the rest. Likewise, men perceive themselves as more competent than women.",,,Educación XX1,,,,2022-06-29,2022,2022-06-29,,25,2,89-105,All OA; Gold,Article,"Zagalaz, Javier Cachón; San Pedro Veledo, María Belén; Sánchez, Amador Lara; Sánchez, Maria Luisa Zagalaz; de Mesa, Carmen González González","Zagalaz, Javier Cachón (Universidad de Jaén, Spain); San Pedro Veledo, María Belén (Universidad de Oviedo, Spain); Sánchez, Amador Lara (Universidad de Jaén, Spain); Sánchez, Maria Luisa Zagalaz (Universidad de Jaén, Spain); de Mesa, Carmen González González (Universidad de Oviedo, Spain)",,"Zagalaz, Javier Cachón (University of Jaén); San Pedro Veledo, María Belén (University of Oviedo); Sánchez, Amador Lara (University of Jaén); Sánchez, Maria Luisa Zagalaz (University of Jaén); de Mesa, Carmen González González (University of Oviedo)",3,3,,4.3,https://revistas.uned.es/index.php/educacionXX1/article/download/30442/25439,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1149095220,39 Education; 3901 Curriculum and Pedagogy; 3903 Education Systems,4 Quality Education

In this paper, we report the detection of a possible ongoing gas accretion event in a blue compact dwarf (BCD) galaxy, MaNGA 8313-1901, observed by the Mapping Nearby Galaxies and Apache Point Observatory (MaNGA) program. This galaxy has a distinct off-centered blue clump to the northeast (the NE clump) that shows low metallicity and enhanced star formation. The kinematics of the gas in the NE clump also seems to be detached from the host BCD galaxy. Together with the metallicity drop of the NE clump, it suggests that the NE clump likely has an external origin, such as gas accretion or galaxy interaction, rather than an internal origin, such as an H II complex in the disk. After removing the underlying host component, we find that the spectrum of the “pure” clump can match very well with a modeled spectrum containing a stellar population of the young stars (≤7 Myr) only. This may imply that the galaxy is experiencing an accretion of cold gas, instead of a merger event involving galaxies with significant preexisting old stars. We also find signs of another clump (the SW clump) at the southwest corner of the host galaxy, and the two clumps may share the same origin of gas accretion.","We thank the anonymous referee for the constructive comments, which significantly improved the manuscript.

We prove that two hyperbolic inflationary stages are stable solutions that can solve the flatness problem and describe acceleration for both open and closed models, and additionally, we obtain a Milne-like attractor solution for the open model.

The purpose of this study is to develop a methodology for predicting the trend of stock value based on the relationship between the fluctuation of Tobin's Q by sector as a trend index and the stock price variation of the Columbia stock market. To this end, a quantitative quasi-experimental survey will be conducted on shares traded by December 30, 2019. This is at least 90% of the time we have traded in the last 5 years. From the average Q value of the relevant economic sector, the value of each company's stock is adjusted to calculate the estimated price of the company's stock. If there is a disparity between the estimated value of the stock and the value at time t, you can forecast the stock price transition. If the computation yields a more significant result than what is now witnessed in the market, the next period's development will be positive; if it yields a lower result, its development will be negative. The results allow us to establish a significant influence of industry results on the performance of corporate Tobin's Q at the individual level. The significance level is greater than 50% in all cases, and profitability does not go below 30% in any sector, even reaching 100%.

Due to the impact of university rankings on assessing the performance of universities, this research aims to explore university rankings in depth. University rankings are considered contributors to assessing university performance. Previous literature showed different types of goals, such as output and support goals, where the literature advised to align between these two types of goals. Universities have different goals, but still, university rankings measure all universities on the same criteria. Subsequently, this research has used the most used university rankings in the literature, QS world ranking dataset. Then unsupervised machine learning was performed to cluster the universities. The results divided universities among four clusters. This study helps in allocating the university in the adequate cluster. This study helps university managers define the goals of their universities. The study recommends universities align their support goals with their output goals. The study recommends universities to develop international goals and strategies, and support the research in the universities by supporting the scholars.

The Effect of Delivery Mode on Team-Based Learning of Clinical Reasoning in a Family Medicine Clerkship,"In health professions education, team-based learning (TBL) has been used to help learners develop clinical reasoning and decision-making skills. The COVID-19 pandemic has challenged institutions to move curriculum delivery from largely in-person to online. With the anticipated return to in-person instruction and arguments made in favor of online instruction in certain circumstances, evidence is needed to support decision making in curriculum planning. The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of delivery mode (in-person vs. online) on student learning of clinical reasoning and clinical decision-making (CR/CDM) in the family medicine clerkship. Data from three cohorts of third-year medical students were included in the study: 2018/2019 cohort, in-person; 2019/2020 cohort, half of the cohort in-person, half of the cohort online; 2020/2021 cohort, online. Students' performance data-individual readiness assurance test (IRAT) and group readiness assurance test (GRAT) scores-were used. The Generalized Estimating Equations (GEE) analysis was performed. As expected, students scored higher in GRAT than IRAT across the three cohorts. No significant IRAT-GRAT differences were observed between in-person and online delivery of TBL sessions. Student learning of CR/CDM in TBL is comparable between the two modes of delivery in the family medicine clerkship. Future research in other clerkships, years of medical education, and professional programs is needed to inform decision making regarding the TBL delivery mode.",,This research was funded by the Northern Alberta Academic Family Physician Fund.,Medical Sciences,,Antoni Torres,"COVID-19; Clinical Reasoning; Educational Measurement; Family Practice; Humans; Pandemics; Problem-Based Learning; Students, Medical",2022-08-08,2022,2022-08-08,,10,3,41,All OA; Gold,Article,"Babenko, Oksana; Ding, Mao; Lee, Ann S","Babenko, Oksana (Department of Family Medicine, Faculty of Medicine & Dentistry, University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB T6G 2R3, Canada.); Ding, Mao (Department of Family Medicine, Faculty of Medicine & Dentistry, University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB T6G 2R3, Canada.); Lee, Ann S (Department of Family Medicine, Faculty of Medicine & Dentistry, University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB T6G 2R3, Canada.)","Babenko, Oksana (University of Alberta)","Babenko, Oksana (University of Alberta); Ding, Mao (University of Alberta); Lee, Ann S (University of Alberta)",6,6,2.69,4.2,https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3271/10/3/41/pdf?version=1660028161,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1150086380,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 42 Health Sciences; 4203 Health Services and Systems,4 Quality Education

In its sowing, the use of seed is the most accessible propagation mechanism for farmers. However, the induction to germination and emergence is often limited in the absence of stimulants that promote the development and growth of the seedling, added to the interference of infectious agents that notoriously reduce the vitality and viability of the seed. Given this, it was proposed as a research objective to determine the effect of zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZnO NPs) mediated by a green route on the germinative characteristics of Lycopersicon esculentum Mill. 1768 ""tomato"". The experimental phase consisted of the synthesis of ZnO NPs and its subsequent characterization. After its synthesis, its inoculation was conducted during the germination of seeds of L. esculentum, considering six sample groups for the treatment with zinc nanoparticles (T1: Control; T2: 21.31 ppm; T3: 33.58 ppm; T4: 49.15 ppm; T5: 63.59 and T6: 99.076 ppm). The results indicate that concentrations close to 100 ppm of ZnO NPs are ideal in the treatment of L. esculentum seeds, due to the promotion of enzymatic and metabolic activity to achieve cell elongation; likewise, the biosynthesized nanoparticles showed no phytotoxicity, due to the fact that, in all the treatments, there were processes of germination and emergence. This was linked to the generation of a Zn0-phenolate complex through a chelating effect, which generates compatibility with the seed and, compared to classic inorganic synthesis, usually shows phytotoxicity. In this sense, green synthesis is presented as a great alternative in this type of application.",The authors thank LANOTEC-CeNAT for contributing to the characterization of nanoparticles by TEM and FTIR.,"Universidad Privada del Norte, Dirección de Investigación, Innovación & Responsabilidad Social—Concession number: 20201001.",Molecules,,Artur M.

The aim of this study is to analyze the human anatomy learning applications market in order to characterize it and facilitate its dissemination in the academic field. Methods A scoping review has been carried out on the Google Play marketplace following the PRISMA guidelines and looking for all existing applications aimed at academic learning of gross human anatomy. Results 325 applications from 231 developers were found and classified into 8 categories, the most frequent being 3D Atlas. 76.6% of the applications addressed anatomy in general and 23.4% some of its parts. 91.1% were free, 24.9% had in-app purchases, 70.2% had advertisements, and half had not been updated for over a year. The 15 most popular applications were free and from 3D Atlas category. Leading the ranking was “Anatomy Learning-Atlas” and “Órganos 3D (anatomía)”. Conclusion There is a wide, varied and inexpensive market for human anatomy apps that can serve to supplement student education. However, in-app purchases, advertisements, and outdated applications can hinder the learning experience.

Traditionally, this assessment was entrusted to peers with a recognized track record, eligibility and prestige. However, bibliometric indicators have been used for several years to eliminate subjectivity, which aim at a measurable, objective and multi-dimensional qualification (1,3).  Bibliometric indicators (BI) can be defined as quantifiers of the bibliographic information available in scientific and academic documents susceptible to being analyzed in terms of production and consumption (1,2). There is a typological variety of BI (1,2) based on the object to be examined (researcher, journal or research group) and, in some cases, they are cross-sectional to it. In this way, personal indicators (age, gender and background of the authors) only apply to researchers or groups, while productivity and impact also apply to journals. For journals, the productivity (quantity) and, more so, impact (“quality”) indicators, are routinely used to classify journals and compare them, with the increasingly controversial purpose of measuring their academic and/or social pertinence and relevance (4).",,,Medunab,,,,2022-05-10,2022,2022-05-10,,25,1,5-8,All OA; Gold,Article,"Wilches-Visbal, Jorge Homero; Castillo-Pedraza, Midian Clara","Wilches-Visbal, Jorge Homero (Universidad del Magdalena); Castillo-Pedraza, Midian Clara (Universidad del Magdalena)",,"Wilches-Visbal, Jorge Homero (University of Magdalena); Castillo-Pedraza, Midian Clara (University of Magdalena)",3,3,,4.19,https://revistas.unab.edu.co/index.php/medunab/article/download/4363/3582,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1147976578,46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4610 Library and Information Studies,

212,pub.1147357244,10.3390/su14095101,,,Feasibility Analysis of Mortar Development with Ornamental Rock Waste for Coating Application by Mechanized Projection,"The industrial production of lime generates greenhouse gases, which contributes to increase the global warming. Therefore, the present study evaluated the feasibility of replacing lime by ornamental rock waste (ORW) as a by-product of the related stone industry, and developed a cost-effective mortars. These new low-costing mortars are intended as fresh fluid paste coatings to be applied on walls by the mechanized projection technique. The ornamental rock waste was collected from a marble and granite industry as ground stone. It was finely crushed before mixing with cement, sand, water and superplasticizer in amounts of 1.0% (R01), 1.2% (R02) and 1.3% (R03), to prepare the mortars, which had the mixture, cement: ORW: sand, 1:1:4 in wt.%. These novel mortars were characterized in both fresh, for well projection, and hardened state, to evaluate the properties after curing performance. The results showed that mortar R03, achieved the best results and did not present cracks in the hardened state. Its water retention was found above 30%. Both tensile strength of 0.312 MPa and compressive strength 7.88 MPa, which are above the corresponding minimum required by the standard for external coating. Water absorption by immersion of 19.37% and void content of 20.23% were close to the corresponding values for hydrated lime mortar. Dry shrinkage showed that the new R03 mortar reached more than 90% of their total retraction at 7 days of cure without sign of cracking. These findings revealed the R03/ornamental rock waste -based mortar applied by mechanized projection as a promising sustainable substitute for common lime-based mortar.","The authors acknowledge the Brazilian governmental research agencies CAPES (Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior), CNPq (Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico), and FAPERJ (Fundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estadodo Rio de Janeiro).","This research was funded by State University of the Northern Fluminense (UENF), partial financed by CAPES (Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior—Brazil) and provided additional financial CNPq (Coordenação Nacional de Pesquisa) Code 309428/2020-3.

This study sought to (i) determine whether the implementation of a culturally-adapted low-intensity psychological intervention – Problem Management Plus or PM+ – is associated with improved mental health among a sample of 72 Venezuelan migrants and refugees and Colombian returnees and, (ii) to identify context-specific factors determining its implementation. A randomised wait-list control trial was conducted to ascertain whether PM+ was associated with improved subjective wellbeing, as assessed by the World Health Organization-Five Wellbeing Index (WHO-5); quality of life, as assessed by the WHO Quality of Life – BREF; and self-identified problems, as assessed by the PSYCHLOPS. Three focus group discussions and eight semi-structured interviews with participants, supervisors and providers were conducted to understand the factors influencing the implementation of PM+ in this context. A univariate analysis of co-variance of the PM ​+ ​group's (n ​= ​38) post-intervention scores and the waitlisted groups' scores (n ​= ​25), controlling for baseline scores, sex, age, level of education, indicated significant effects for the PM ​+ ​group across all outcome measures: WHO-5 η2 ​= ​0.75, p = <.001), WHOQOL-BREF Physical (η2 ​= ​0.6, p = <.001); WHOQOL-BREF Psychological (η2 ​= ​0.78, p = <.001); WHOQOL-BREF Social Relationships (η2 ​= ​0.64, p = <.001) and WHOQOL-BREF Environment (η2 ​= ​0.48, p = <.001). In addition to baseline scores, female sex had a significant effect on the WHO-5 scores (η2 ​= ​0.06, p ​= ​.05). Cohen's d and Hedge's g were above 2.5 across all study outcomes. The following factors were found to influence the implementation of PM+: trust, engagement, integrated approach, teamwork, autonomy, supervision, acceptability and inclusion. Findings suggest that PM+ is an acceptable approach, associated with improved subjective wellbeing and quality of life of displaced populations.","This study has been conducted as a part the CONTEXT programme.

3924,pub.1152936556,10.35833/mpce.2021.000444,,,Adaptive Fault Detection Based on Neural Networks and Multiple Sampling Points for Distribution Networks and Microgrids,"Smart networks such as active distribution network (ADN) and microgrid (MG) play an important role in power system operation. The design and implementation of appropriate protection systems for MG and ADN must be addressed, which imposes new technical challenges. This paper presents the implementation and validation aspects of an adaptive fault detection strategy based on neural networks (NNs) and multiple sampling points for ADN and MG. The solution is implemented on an edge device. NNs are used to derive a data-driven model that uses only local measurements to detect fault states of the network without the need for communication infrastructure. Multiple sampling points are used to derive a data-driven model, which allows the generalization considering the implementation in physical systems. The adaptive fault detector model is implemented on a Jetson Nano system, which is a single-board computer (SBC) with a small graphic processing unit (GPU) intended to run machine learning loads at the edge. The proposed method is tested in a physical, real-life, low-voltage network located at Universidad del Norte, Colombia. This testing network is based on the IEEE 13-node test feeder scaled down to 220 V. The validation in a simulation environment shows the accuracy and dependability above 99.6%, while the real-time tests show the accuracy and dependability of 95.5% and 100%, respectively. Without hard-to-derive parameters, the easy-to-implement embedded model highlights the potential for real-life applications.",,,Journal of Modern Power Systems and Clean Energy,,,,2022,2022,,2022,10,6,1648-1657,All OA; Gold,Article,"Marin-Quintero, J.; Orozco-Henao, C.; Bretas, A.

Because of this, the present research uses these wastes as fuel in low-cost, lab-scale, single-chamber microbial fuel cells. Zinc and copper electrodes were used as electrodes and 100 mL of molasse in the chamber as fuel, managing to generate current and voltage peaks of 1.73 ± 0.13 mA and 0.953 ± 0.142 V. In monitoring the conductivity of the substrate, a maximum peak of 111.156 ± 8.45 mS/cm was observed, and a slightly acidic pH was observed throughout the monitoring. It was possible to obtain a power density of 5.45 ± 0.31 W/cm2 for a current density of 308.06 mA/cm2, while the yeast count showed a logarithmic curve throughout the monitoring. Finally, the molecular technique identified 100% of the special C. boidinii present in the anodic electrode.

In this research, tomato waste with different percentages of sucrose (0-target, 5, 10, and 20%) was used in microbial fuel cells manufactured on a laboratory scale with zinc and copper electrodes, managing to generate maximum peaks of voltage and a current of 1.08 V and 6.67 mA in the cell with 20% sucrose, in which it was observed that the optimum operating pH was 5.29, while the MFC with 0% (target) sucrose generated 0.91 V and 3.12 A on day 13 with a similar pH, even though all the cells worked in an acidic pH. Likewise, the cell with 20% sucrose had the lowest internal resistance (0.148541 ± 0.012361 KΩ) and the highest power density (224.77 mW/cm2) at a current density of 4.43 mA/cm2, while the MFC with 0% sucrose generated 160.52 mW/cm2 and 4.38 mA/cm2 of power density and current density, respectively, with an internal resistance of 0.34116 ± 0.2914 KΩ. In this sense, the FTIR (Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy) of all the substrates used showed a high content of phenolic compounds and carboxylate acids. Finally, the MFCs were connected in a series and managed to generate a voltage of 3.43 V, enough to light an LED (green).

Previous studies suggested that the presence of “dark gaps,” or regions of a galaxy where the difference between the surface brightness along the bar major axis and that along the bar minor axis is maximal, can be attributed to the location of bar corotation. Here, using GALAKOS, a high-resolution N-body simulation of a barred galaxy, we test this photometric method’s ability to identify the bar corotation resonance. Contrary to previous work, our results indicate that “dark gaps” are a clear sign of the location of the 4:1 ultraharmonic resonance instead of bar corotation. Measurements of the bar corotation can indirectly be inferred using kinematic information, e.g., by measuring the shape of the rotation curve. We demonstrate our concept on a sample of 578 face-on barred galaxies with both imaging and integral field observations and find that the sample likely consists primarily of fast bars.","D.K. and Z.J.P. acknowledge support from the NSF CAREER award AST-1554877.

By 31 December 2021, 84.1% of the population was fully vaccinated, and 56.1% received booster doses using different COVID-19 vaccines. In this context, we aimed to estimate the prevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies following the infection and vaccination campaign. Using a three-stage stratified sampling, we performed a population-based cross-sectional serosurvey based on a representative sample of three Chilean cities. Selected participants were blood-sampled on-site and answered a short COVID-19 and vaccination history questionnaire using Wantai SARS-CoV-2 Ab ELISA to determine seroprevalence. We recruited 2198 individuals aged 7-93 between 5 October and 25 November 2021; 2132 individuals received COVID-19 vaccinations (97%), 67 (3.1%) received one dose, 2065 (93.9%) received two doses, and 936 received the booster jab (42.6%). Antibody seroprevalence reached 97.3%, ranging from 40.9% among those not vaccinated to 99.8% in those with booster doses (OR = 674.6, 154.8-2938.5). SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were associated with vaccination, previous COVID-19 diagnosis, age group, and city of residence. In contrast, we found no significant differences in the type of vaccine used, education, nationality, or type of health insurance. We found a seroprevalence close to 100%, primarily due to the successful vaccination program, which strongly emphasizes universal access.",The authors acknowledge the WHO for the donation of tests to measure SARS-CoV-2 antibodies.,"This research has been supported by WHO Unity Studies, a global seroepidemiological standardization initiative, with funding to the WHO by the COVID-19 Solidarity Response Fund and the German Federal Ministry of Health (BMG) COVID-19 Research and Development Fund.",Vaccines,,S.

This paper describes the development of a fully open-source, modular, wireless, battery-powered, smartphone-controlled, low-cost potentiostat capable of conducting electrochemical impedance spectroscopy for the electrochemical detection of the S100B protein captured in an ANTI-S100B functionalized thin-film gold interdigitated electrode platform to support traumatic brain injury diagnosis and treatment. EIS results from the developed potentiostat were validated with a commercial benchtop potentiostat by comparing impedance magnitude and phase values along the EIS frequency range. In addition, an experimental design was performed for detecting S100B in spiked human plasma samples with S100B concentrations of clinical utility, and a calibration curve was found for quantifying S100B detection. No statistically significant differences were found between EIS results from the developed potentiostat and the commercial potentiostat. Statistically significant differences in the changes in charge transfer resistance signal between each tested S100B concentration (p < 0.05) were found, with a limit of detection of 35.73 pg/mL. The modularity of the proposed potentiostat allows easier component changes according to the application demands in power, frequency excitation ranges, wireless communication protocol, signal amplification and transduction, precision, and sampling frequency of ADC, among others, when compared to state-of-the-art open-source EIS potentiostats. In addition, the use of minimal, easy acquirable open-source hardware and software, high-level filtering, accurate ADC, Fast Fourier Transform with low spectral leakage, wireless communication, and the simple user interface provides a framework for facilitating EIS analysis and developing new affordable instrumentation for POC biosensors integrated systems.",,"This work was funded by Departamento Administrativo de Ciencia, Tecnología e Innovación (COLCIENCIAS) grant number 757–2016 (FB) and by Gobernación del Atlántico call number 809–2018 (AR).

Quinolones are bactericidal antimicrobials extensively used in both human and animal medicine. Some of the quinolone-resistance mechanisms are encoded by different bacterial genes, whereas others are the result of mutations in the enzymes on which those antibiotics act. The worldwide occurrence of quinolone resistance genes in aquatic environments has been widely reported, particularly in areas impacted by urban discharges. The most commonly reported quinolone resistance gene, qnr, encodes for the Qnr proteins that protect DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV from quinolone activity. It is important to note that low-level resistance usually constitutes the first step in the development of high-level resistance, because bacteria carrying these genes have an adaptive advantage compared to the highly susceptible bacterial population in environments with low concentrations of this antimicrobial group. In addition, these genes can act additively with chromosomal mutations in the sequences of the target proteins of quinolones leading to high-level quinolone resistance. The occurrence of qnr genes in aquatic environments is most probably caused by the release of bacteria carrying these genes through anthropogenic pollution and maintained by the selective activity of antimicrobial residues discharged into these environments. This increase in the levels of quinolone resistance has consequences both in clinical settings and the wider aquatic environment, where there is an increased exposure risk to the general population, representing a significant threat to the efficacy of quinolone-based human and animal therapies. In this review the potential role of aquatic environments as reservoirs of the qnr genes, their activity in reducing the susceptibility to various quinolones, and the possible ways these genes contribute to the acquisition and spread of high-level resistance to quinolones will be discussed.",,"This research was funded by the Chilean National Research and Development Agency, (ANID), grant number 1211950.",Antibiotics,,Øivind Bergh,,2022-10-27,2022,2022-10-27,,11,11,1487,All OA; Gold,Article,"Miranda, Claudio D; Concha, Christopher; Godoy, Félix A; Lee, Matthew R","Miranda, Claudio D (Laboratorio de Patobiología Acuática, Departamento de Acuicultura, Universidad Católica del Norte, Coquimbo 1780000, Chile.); Concha, Christopher (Laboratorio de Patobiología Acuática, Departamento de Acuicultura, Universidad Católica del Norte, Coquimbo 1780000, Chile.); Godoy, Félix A (Centro i~mar, Universidad de Los Lagos, Puerto Montt 5480000, Chile.); Lee, Matthew R (Centro i~mar, Universidad de Los Lagos, Puerto Montt 5480000, Chile.)","Miranda, Claudio D (Catholic University of the North); Concha, Christopher (Catholic University of the North)","Miranda, Claudio D (Catholic University of the North); Concha, Christopher (Catholic University of the North); Godoy, Félix A (University of Los Lagos); Lee, Matthew R (University of Los Lagos)",9,9,1.99,4.1,https://www.mdpi.com/2079-6382/11/11/1487/pdf?version=1667398863,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1152272370,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3207 Medical Microbiology; 3211 Oncology and Carcinogenesis,

However, surviving university is often seen as a period in which students face a unique array of challenges. Many students begin their tertiary education as holistically-well individuals, but due to the stressors related to University, students often show incremental signs of psychological, physical and emotional distress. These often lead to a decrease in academic competence and severe professional ramifications. The aim of this study was to identify design principles and explore the perceptions of professionals concerning possible implementation strategies that could be suitable for Higher Educational Institutions, particularly Health Science and Medical School students. A qualitative, three-phase multi-approach design was used in this study. Phase one was conducted by means of an explorative desktop literature review, there after phase 2 included a self-management, self-coaching and appreciative coaching concept map, that was aligned to concepts within the current individual wellness literature and in phase 3, Appreciative Inquiry based focus group discussions were held with various professional in the field of coaching, education, and healthcare. Wellness programmes are impacted by the fact that Higher Education Institutions face unique challenges such as time, financial constraints, and an already overloaded curriculum. Five design principles were described, and various implementation strategies explored. There is a fundamental necessity to address the distortion of wellness within HE. A key finding in this study suggests that combining self-coaching, appreciative coaching and self-management principles could facilitate a successful individual wellness programme for higher educational students.",,,The Journal for Transdisciplinary Research in Southern Africa,,,,2022-01-31,2022,2022-01-31,,18,1,9,All OA; Gold,Article,"Henrico, Karien","Henrico, Karien (Department of Emergency Medical Care, Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Johannesburg, Johannesburg)",,"Henrico, Karien (University of Johannesburg)",3,2,,4.07,https://td-sa.net/index.php/td/article/download/1114/2033,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1145260546,39 Education; 3903 Education Systems; 42 Health Sciences,4 Quality Education

Here, we present the Science Clubs Colombia (Clubes de Ciencia Colombia-SCC) program, a pioneering STEAM capacity-building initiative led by volunteer scientists to engage youth and children from underserved communities in science. The program brings together researchers based in Colombia and abroad to lead intensive project-based learning workshops for young students in urban and rural areas. These projects focus on channeling the students' technical and cognitive scientific aptitudes to tackle challenges of both local and global relevance. The program provides high-quality STEAM education adapted to communities' needs and articulates long-lasting international collaborations using the mobility of the Colombian diaspora. The program's success is tangible via its sustained growth and adaptability. Since its first version in 2015, 722 volunteer scientists living abroad or in Colombia have collaborated to create 364 clubs with the participation of 9,295 students. We describe elements of the SCC program that lead to a scalable and reproducible outcome to engage science diasporas in STEAM education. Additionally, we discuss the involvement of multiple stakeholders and the generation of international networks as potential science diplomacy outcomes. The SCC program strengthens the involvement of Latin American youth in science, demonstrates the potential of engaging scientific diasporas in science education, and enriches connections between the Global South and the Global North.","The authors acknowledge that data collection and analysis from the program execution comes from different sources of the impact assessment reports, internal data collection for the execution of the program once instructors accept to participate, and other sources that allow authors to complement the data analysis presented.

269,pub.1149893649,10.1016/j.egyr.2022.07.085,,,Autonomy evaluation model for a photovoltaic residential microgrid with a battery storage system,"The dependence on fossil resources remains high, accounting for 80% of the total primary energy production worldwide. In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic has devastated several industries and electric power is no exception. Therefore, renewable energy sources have become an important aspect of the energy sector, contributing to solutions to environmental problems and the development of a sustainable future. Therefore, this study proposes a model to evaluate the energy autonomy of a photovoltaic microgrid (EA PV,MG ) using a battery energy storage system (BESS). To carry out the analysis, the energy consumption history of a residence and the solar irradiation data of the location were used. Thus, this study includes the evaluation of the energy compensation of a photovoltaic microgrid that directly injects energy into the residence, and the surplus is stored in a BESS for later use. The results show the relevance of EA PV,MG modeling for optimal system sizing. The model determines the autonomy of the microgrid without many power variations in the PV system for January, April, and October, corresponding to the summer, autumn, and spring seasons, respectively. However, in July (winter), the photovoltaic MG must increase the installation power considerably and the storage capacity of the BESS. Therefore, an optimal decision evaluating the EA PV,MG will allow broadening an overview to opt for a PV microgrid that injects the highest amount of energy based on the actual residential load profile and the optimal capacity of the BESS. Consequently, the analysis of the EA of a microgrid based on solar irradiation and actual load data is essential for developing an optimal and stable operation of the residential energy system.",Declaration of Competing Interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.,,Energy Reports,,,,2022-11,2022,,2022-11,8,,653-664,All OA; Gold,Article,"Zarate-Perez, Eliseo; Sebastián, Rafael","Zarate-Perez, Eliseo (Department of Engineering, Universidad Privada del Norte (UPN), Av.

184,pub.1144995750,10.3390/met12020225,,,Discrete Event Simulation for Machine-Learning Enabled Mine Production Control with Application to Gold Processing,"Interdisciplinary barriers separating data scientists and geometallurgists have complicated systematic attempts to incorporate machine-learning into mine production management; however, experiences in excavating a vein-hosted gold deposit within the Alhué region of Chile have led to methodological advances, which is the subject of the current paper. These deposits are subject to several challenges, from increasing orebody complexity and decreasing gold grades to the significant geological uncertainty that is intrinsic to these systems. These challenges then translate to mineral processing, which is already dealing with increased environmental and technological constraints. Geological uncertainty causes stockout risks that can be mitigated by the approach that is developed within this paper, which features alternate operational modes and related control strategies. A digital twin framework based on discrete event simulation (DES) and a customized machine-learning (ML) model is proposed to incorporate geological variation into decision-making processes, including the setting of trigger point that induces mode changes. Sample calculations that were based on a simulated processing plant that was subject to mineralogical feed changes demonstrated that the framework is a valuable tool to evaluate and mitigate the potential risks to gold mineral processing performance.","The authors thank the staff at the Florida Mine (Alhué, Chile) for their assistance and support in conceptualizing and describing their operational problems and providing preliminary data.

Based on interviews from samples of 384 and 383 elderly Chilean adults collected before and after confinement, the evolution of the effects (paths) was analysed using the TPB model applying the PLS-SEM technique. The intention to use social networks and its association with three factors were evaluated: attitude toward the behaviour, subjective norms, and perceived control over the behaviour. The model explains the intention to use social networks by 27% before confinement, increasing its magnitude to 50% after confinement. After the period of confinement, their attitudes become more significant, their perceptions of control become less important, and social pressures remain permanent in predicting the behaviour. In conclusion, better access and greater use of social networks by older people during the lockdown period increased the predictive strength of the attitude towards these technologies.",The authors acknowledge the support that students and interviewers gave to collect the information in the field.,This research was funded by ANID/FONDECYT Regular 1210130.,International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health,,"Daniel W.L.

160,pub.1150500933,10.3389/fmars.2022.960496,,,Habitat value of subsea wells and pipelines for fishery target species in Australia,"Subsea pipelines and wells installed to support the oil and gas industry represent some of the most extensive and numerous anthropogenic structures throughout global marine ecosystems. There remains a paucity of information on the habitat value of these structures for fishery target species and, as a result, little understanding of how decommissioning should be conducted to minimise impacts to populations of these economically and socially important species. We assess the diversity and abundance of species that are targets of recreational and commercial fisheries on 33 subsea wells and 17 pipelines across the tropical northwest and temperate southeast marine regions of Australia. We examine relationships between fish identity and abundance and a range of environmental (e.g., depth, location), infrastructure-specific (e.g., pipeline position, diameter, age, length of pipeline, height of well, position on well), and biological (% cover of epibiota) variables using video filmed by remotely operated vehicles during their routine offshore inspection and maintenance campaigns. A total of 100 fishery target species were observed across subsea well and pipeline infrastructure, 56 species uniquely observed on pipelines and nine unique to wells. The families Lutjanidae (snapper), Serranidae (rock cods, groupers, perch), and Carangidae (trevallies) were most common and abundant on both wells and pipelines. In the northwest, lutjanids were most abundant around the base of wells, in shallow depths, on shorter wells, and where pipelines spanned the seafloor. A greater number of fishery target species and abundance of ocean perch (Helicolenus spp.) were also associated with pipelines that spanned the seafloor in temperate southeast Australia. The combined biomass of three species of snapper on wells in the northwest was 1,270 kg, with production levels for these species on each well estimated to be 105.2 g m2 year-1. The present study serves as an important reference point for informing decommissioning decisions for pipeline and well infrastructure and demonstrates the utility of industry-held data for science. We suggest that key predictor variables identified here be incorporated into comprehensive before-after-control-impact scientific studies for specific fields/assets to enable the prediction of potential impacts of decommissioning scenarios on marine communities present and quantification of such impacts after the decommissioning activity has occurred.",,,Frontiers in Marine Science,,,,2022-08-26,2022,2022-08-26,,9,,960496,All OA; Gold,Article,"McLean, Dianne; Speed, Conrad W.; Birt, Matthew Jon; Colquhoun, Jamie; Case, Mark; Stowar, Marcus; Bond, Todd; Ierodiaconou, Daniel; Whitmarsh, Sasha K.; Taylor, Michael D.; Wines, Sam; Booth, David John; Fowler, Ashley M.; Vaughan, Brigit I.","McLean, Dianne (Australian Institute of Marine Science, Indian Ocean Marine Research Centre, Perth, WA, Australia; Oceans Institute, The University of Western Australia, Indian Ocean Marine Research Centre, Perth, WA, Australia); Speed, Conrad W.

214,pub.1151151905,10.3389/fmars.2022.993667,,,Metaomics unveils the contribution of Alteromonas bacteria to carbon cycling in marine oxygen minimum zones,"Gammaproteobacteria of the genus Alteromonas are prominent members of pelagic marine microbial communities, playing critical roles in the aerobic degradation of particulate organic matter. Comparative genomic studies of these microorganisms have mainly focused on the metabolic and genomic plasticity of strains isolated primarily from oxygenated environments. In this study, we show that Alteromonas significantly contribute to marine microbial communities from suboxic waters ([O2] < 5 uM) in both the free-living (FL) and particle-attached (PA) fractions, but considerably decrease in abundance in the anoxic waters. The highest proportion of Alteromonas transcripts was found within the secondary fluorescence maximum (SFM) of Oxygen Minimum Zones (OMZs). This metatranscriptomic information suggests an in situ coupling of Alteromonas iron (Fe) and carbon metabolisms, and a relevant role of the glyoxylate cycle across the different layers of the OMZs. This study demonstrates that Alteromonas is an abundant and active member of the OMZ microbial communities, with a potentially significant impact on the carbon cycling in these ecosystems. These results provide valuable environmental evidence to support previous culture-based studies assessing the physiology and ecology of these ubiquitous marine heterotrophs under low-oxygen conditions.",,This work was supported by the Chilean Agency for Research and Development (grant FONDECYT-POSTDOCTORADO 3180724 and ICN12_019-IMO).,Frontiers in Marine Science,,,,2022-09-20,2022,2022-09-20,,9,,993667,All OA; Gold,Article,"Henríquez-Castillo, Carlos; Plominsky, Alvaro M.; Ramírez-Flandes, Salvador; Bertagnolli, Anthony D.; Stewart, Frank J.; Ulloa, Osvaldo","Henríquez-Castillo, Carlos (Laboratorio de Fisiología y Genética Marina, Centro de Estudios Avanzados en Zonas Áridas, Coquimbo, Chile; Facultad de Ciencias del Mar, Universidad Católica del Norte, Coquimbo, Chile); Plominsky, Alvaro M.

MATERIALS AND METHODS.: Mixed method, explanatory study, with an initial quantitative and then qualitative sequence. The quantitative phase was carried out using validated instruments: characterization sheet of the person with chronic illness-family caregiver dyad; the Nkongho Caregiving Ability Inventory (CAI), and the Zarit burden scale. The qualitative phase was conducted with a hermeneutic phenomenological approach; the information was collected through in-depth interviews to understand the needs of the caregivers.
RESULTS.: The caregivers were mostly women, mainly mothers and daughters, home-occupied and self-employed, with basic primary education, low socioeconomic level and low caregiving skill level; a significant number of caregivers perceived some degree of overload. The themes identified in the analysis of the interviews were: feeling fear before the disease; the experience of caregiver fatigue; losing one's job: another cost of the disease; fear of delegating care; love: a support for the caregiver; needing support to care.

These problems have limited the generation of large datasets to develop accurate and applicable regression models. This study presents a QSPR approach developed on the KNIME analytical platform and based on a structurally diverse dataset of over 4900 molecules. Interpretable models were obtained using random forest supervised recursive algorithms for data cleaning and feature selection. The development of a conditional consensus model based on regional and global regression random forest produced models with RMSE values between 0.43-0.51 for all validation sets. The potential applicability of the model as a surrogate for the in vitro Caco-2 assay was demonstrated through blind prediction of 32 drugs recommended by the International Council for the Harmonization of Technical Requirements for Pharmaceuticals (ICH) for validation of in vitro permeability methods. The model was validated for the preliminary estimation of the BCS/BDDCS class. The KNIME workflow developed to automate new drug prediction is freely available. The results suggest that this automated prediction platform is a reliable tool for identifying the most promising compounds with high intestinal permeability during the early stages of drug discovery.,All the authors acknowledge KNIME and its many contributors for making the KNIME data-mining environment available free of charge.,This research received no external funding.,Pharmaceutics,,Gus R.

However, aDNA studies that examine environmental microbes routinely fail to authenticate aDNA, examine laboratory and environmental contamination, and control for biases introduced during sample processing. Here, we surveyed the available literature for environmental aDNA projects—from sample collection to data analysis—and assessed previous methodologies and approaches used in the published microbial aDNA studies. We then integrated these concepts into a case study, using shotgun metagenomics to examine methodological, technical, and analytical biases during an environmental aDNA study of soil microbes. Specifically, we compared the impact of five DNA extraction methods and eight bioinformatic pipelines on the recovery of microbial aDNA information in soil cores from extreme environments. Our results show that silica-based methods optimized for aDNA research recovered significantly more damaged and shorter reads (<100 bp) than a commercial kit or a phenol−chloroform method. Additionally, we described a stringent pipeline for data preprocessing, efficiently decreasing the representation of low-complexity and duplicated reads in our datasets and downstream analyses, reducing analytical biases in taxonomic classification.","We thank Alberto Ticuna and Roxana Herrera for their field assistance.

As a result, the technology has been used in a number of recent neutrino experiments, and is the technology of choice for the Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE). In order to perform high precision measurements of neutrinos in the detector, final state particles need to be effectively identified, and their energy accurately reconstructed. This article proposes an algorithm based on a convolutional neural network to perform the classification of energy deposits and reconstructed particles as track-like or arising from electromagnetic cascades. Results from testing the algorithm on experimental data from ProtoDUNE-SP, a prototype of the DUNE far detector, are presented. The network identifies track- and shower-like particles, as well as Michel electrons, with high efficiency. The performance of the algorithm is consistent between experimental data and simulation.","The ProtoDUNE-SP detector was constructed and operated on the CERN Neutrino Platform.

279,pub.1144699564,10.29333/ejgm/11550,,,Psychological Factors Related to Fear of COVID-19 in the General Salvadoran Population,"Introduction: The objective of this article is to determine the psychological factors which are associated with the fear toward COVID-19 as experienced by the Salvadoran population in general. Method: This study is exploratory, with a cross-sectional design. For data collection a digital survey in Google Forms was used. There was a non-probabilistic sample of 328 Salvadorans. The mean age in general was 27.90 years-old, with a standard deviation (SD) of 9.10; the mean age for men was 29.05 years-old (SD = 9.94), and the mean age for woman was 27.42 years-old (SD = 8.70). Results: The results reveal the existence of small and medium correlations between anxiety, depression, instrumental support and positive social interaction with the variables of fear to COVID-19; the regression model predicted that the fear to COVID-19 depends on anxiety and affective support, predicting a 23% of fear to COVID-19, with medium effect. Conclusion: This research suggests anxiety and affective support are explanation of the 23% of fear towards COVID-19 in Salvadoran population in general, findings provide useful information for future researches which perform a follow up or intervention in Salvadoran population in general.",,,Electronic Journal of General Medicine,,,,2022-01-14,2022,2022,2022-01-14,19,2,em351,All OA; Gold,Article,"Lobos-Rivera, Marlon Elías; Chacón-Andrade, Edgardo René; Cervigni, Mauricio; Gallegos, Miguel; Martino, Pablo; Caycho-Rodríguez, Tomás; Barés, Ignacio; Calandra, Manuel; Flores-Monterrosa, Angélica Nohemy; Ventura-Hernández, Víctor Manuel","Lobos-Rivera, Marlon Elías (Universidad Tecnológica de El Salvador, EL SALVADOR); Chacón-Andrade, Edgardo René (Universidad Tecnológica de El Salvador, EL SALVADOR); Cervigni, Mauricio (Facultad de Psicología, Universidad Nacional de Rosario, ARGENTINA; Centro de Investigación de Neurociencias de Rosario (CINR-UNR), Rosario, ARGENTINA; Centro interdisciplinario de investigaciones en ciencias de la salud y del comportamiento (CIISAC), Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Científicas y Técnicas, ARGENTINA); Gallegos, Miguel (Universidad Católica del Maule, CHILE; Pontificia Universidade Católica de Minas Gerais, BRAZIL; Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Científicas y Técnicas, ARGENTINA); Martino, Pablo (Facultad de Psicología, Universidad Nacional de Rosario, ARGENTINA; Centro de Investigación de Neurociencias de Rosario (CINR-UNR), Rosario, ARGENTINA; Centro interdisciplinario de investigaciones en ciencias de la salud y del comportamiento (CIISAC), Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Científicas y Técnicas, ARGENTINA); Caycho-Rodríguez, Tomás (Universidad Privada del Norte, PERU); Barés, Ignacio (Facultad de Psicología, Universidad Nacional de Rosario, ARGENTINA; Centro de Investigación en Neurociencias de Rosario, Facultad de Psicología, Universidad Nacional de Rosario, ARGENTINA; Laboratorio de Cognición y Emoción, Facultad de Psicología, Universidad Nacional de Rosario, ARGENTINA); Calandra, Manuel (Facultad de Psicología, Universidad Nacional de Rosario, ARGENTINA; Centro de Investigación en Neurociencias de Rosario, Facultad de Psicología, Universidad Nacional de Rosario, ARGENTINA; Laboratorio de Cognición y Emoción, Facultad de Psicología, Universidad Nacional de Rosario, ARGENTINA); Flores-Monterrosa, Angélica Nohemy (Universidad Tecnológica de El Salvador, EL SALVADOR); Ventura-Hernández, Víctor Manuel (Universidad Tecnológica de El Salvador, EL SALVADOR)",,"Lobos-Rivera, Marlon Elías (Universidad Tecnológica de El Salvador); Chacón-Andrade, Edgardo René (Universidad Tecnológica de El Salvador); Cervigni, Mauricio (National University of Rosario; Centro de Investigación de Neurociencias de Rosario (CINR-UNR), Rosario, ARGENTINA; National Scientific and Technical Research Council); Gallegos, Miguel (Catholic University of the Maule; Pontifícia Universidade Católica de Minas Gerais; National Scientific and Technical Research Council); Martino, Pablo (National University of Rosario; Centro de Investigación de Neurociencias de Rosario (CINR-UNR), Rosario, ARGENTINA; National Scientific and Technical Research Council); Caycho-Rodríguez, Tomás (Private University of the North); Barés, Ignacio (National University of Rosario; National University of Rosario; National University of Rosario); Calandra, Manuel (National University of Rosario; National University of Rosario; National University of Rosario); Flores-Monterrosa, Angélica Nohemy (Universidad Tecnológica de El Salvador); Ventura-Hernández, Víctor Manuel (Universidad Tecnológica de El Salvador)",6,4,,3.8,https://www.ejgm.co.uk/download/psychological-factors-related-to-fear-of-covid-19-in-the-general-salvadoran-population-11550.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1144699564,42 Health Sciences; 52 Psychology; 5203 Clinical and Health Psychology,3 Good Health and Well Being

Contracaecum larvae infecting farmed fish and fishery products are economically important causing market rejection in massive infection and may have zoonotic potential. In Israel, Contracaecum larvae have been described morphologically in several fish species; however, none of these descriptions were supported by molecular tools. In 2019-2020, hybrid tilapia (Oreochromis aureus x Oreochromis niloticus) and red drum (Sciaenops ocellatus), farmed in polyculture were found to be heavily infected with nematodes referable to Contracaecum larvae. Prevalence of infection in hybrid tilapia and red drum was 53.8% and 40.9%, respectively. A combined (morphological and molecular) approach revealed that both infected fish species were parasitized by the same species of Contracaecum, although larvae in hybrid tilapia were localized in the pericardial cavity whereas in red drum, they were observed in the abdominal cavity. Genetic analysis of internal transcribed spacer rDNA and cox2 mtDNA showed high similarity to unidentified Contracaecum larvae detected in several fish species in Ethiopia, Egypt and Kenya. In this study, molecular and morphological analyses place the possible new species in the C. multipapillatum complex and was provisionally named C. multipapillatum E. Further analyses combining morphological and molecular approaches are required on adult specimens collected from piscivorous birds living in the same area to support the identification of a potentially new species.","We thank Prof. Menachem Goren from the School of Zoology and The Steinhardt Museum of Natural History, Tel Aviv University for his kind advises regarding fish common and scientific names.

Valor simbólico de la revisión judicial de las reformas constitucionales para la construcción de paz en Colombia,"The legal implementation of the Final Peace Agreement (AFP) signed between the former guerrilla Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) and the government of former President Juan Manuel Santos generated the enforcement of exceptional constitutional norms on legislative and constitutional review processes. In this sense, the Colombian Constitutional Court carried out an exceptional, automatic, and unique review of five legislative acts (AL) that were issued to legally implement what was politically agreed. This article analyzes Sentence C-076/2018 with which the constitutional review of AL 05 of 2017 was made, this review being issued for the implementation of the AFP. Since AL 05 of 2017 amended Article 22 of the Constitution including an express prohibition for the creation, financing, and support for groups of armed civilians with illegal purposes, a question is raised: Is it possible to forbid the forbidden? Methodologically, we display the tensions between the derived constituent and the Court and the application of the constitutional substitution judgment. We conclude that the Court's review was particular not only because of the exceptional nature of the rules, but also because it issued a symbolic sentence. This sentence is worth acknowledging insofar as it highlights the importance of the construction of the transitional justice and peace model derived from the implementation of the AFP.",,,Estudios de derecho,,,,2022-01-03,2022,2022-01-03,,79,173,,All OA; Gold,Article,"Hassan, Viridiana Molinares","Hassan, Viridiana Molinares (Universidad del Norte)",,"Hassan, Viridiana Molinares (Universidad del Norte)",1,1,,3.77,https://revistas.udea.edu.co/index.php/red/article/download/348493/20807854,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1147369008,48 Law and Legal Studies; 4807 Public Law,"16 Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions"

This holistic approach is based on the adoption by different national legal systems of the rights of Nature, and on the recognized integral relationship between human rights and Nature. Second, the article proposes to apply this business due diligence to the energy transition, taking into account the role that companies play in the transformation process of the energy sector as a key strategy to face climate change. In this sense, the energy transition implemented under the standards of due diligence in human rights, proposed in this article, would respond to the maxim: the energy transition is not only about replacing fossil energy sources with renewable sources, but must be aligned with sustainable development, nature protection and respect for human rights.",,,Revista Derecho del Estado,,,,2022-11-28,2022,2022-11-28,,,54,307-344,All OA; Gold,Article,"Jiménez Guanipa, Henry; Tous Chimá, Javier","Jiménez Guanipa, Henry (); Tous Chimá, Javier ()",,"Jiménez Guanipa, Henry (); Tous Chimá, Javier ()",1,1,,3.77,https://revistas.uexternado.edu.co/index.php/derest/article/download/8370/13337,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1153184062,48 Law and Legal Studies; 4807 Public Law,13 Climate Action; 7 Affordable and Clean Energy

Five new series of chalcone-sulfonamide hybrids (16-20)a-f were prepared via Claisen-Schmidt condensation of the newly obtained sulfonamides with aromatic aldehydes 15a-f in basic medium. Chalcones substituted with chlorine at position 4 of each series were used as precursors for the generation of their five-membered heterocyclic pyrazoline (22-23)a-d, (24-25)a-b and carbothioamide 27a-f derivatives. The synthesized compounds were evaluated for their anticancer and antituberculosis activities. To determine their anticancer activity, compounds were screened against sixty human cancer cell lines at a single dose (10 μM). Compounds 17a-c were highly active against LOX IMVI (melanoma), with IC50 values of 0.34, 0.73 and 0.54 μM, respectively. Chalcone 18e showed remarkable results against the entire panel of leukemia cell lines with IC50 values between 0.99-2.52 μM. Moreover, compounds 20e and 20f displayed growth inhibition of Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv at concentrations below 10 μM. Although they showed low selectivity in cytotoxicity tests against the Vero cell line, further optimization could advance the potential biological activity of the selected compounds.",The authors thank the Developmental Therapeutics Program (DTP) of the National Cancer Institute of the United States for performing the anticancer screening of the compounds and Centro de Instrumentación Científico-Técnica of Universidad de Jaén for X-ray data collection.,"This work was financially supported by MINCIENCIAS (project No. 110680864255); Universidad del Valle (CI 71183) and Universidad del Norte (MINCIENCIAS-Project Number: 201477758055, contract.

The objective of this research was to observe the influence on the generation of bioelectricity of sucrose, with different percentages (0%, 5%, 10% and 20%), in papaya waste using microbial fuel cells (MFCs). It was possible to generate voltage and current peaks of 0.955 V and 5.079 mA for the cell with 20% sucrose, which operated at an optimal pH of 4.98 on day fifteen. In the same way, the internal resistance values of all the cells were influenced by the increase in sucrose, showing that the cell without sucrose was 0.1952 ± 0.00214 KΩ and with 20% it was 0.044306 ± 0.0014 KΩ. The maximum power density was 583.09 mW/cm2 at a current density of 407.13 A/cm2 and with a peak voltage of 910.94 mV, while phenolic compounds are the ones with the greatest presence in the FTIR (Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy) absorbance spectrum. We were able to molecularly identify the species Achromobacter xylosoxidans (99.32%), Acinetobacter bereziniae (99.93%) and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (100%) present in the anode electrode of the MFCs. This research gives a novel use for sucrose to increase the energy values in a microbial fuel cell, improving the existing ones and generating a novel way of generating electricity that is friendly to the environment.",,This research received no external funding.,Molecules,,,Bioelectric Energy Sources; Carica; Electricity; Electrodes; Humans; Sucrose,2022-08-15,2022,2022-08-15,,27,16,5198,All OA; Gold,Article,"Rojas-Flores, Segundo; De La Cruz-Noriega, Magaly; Benites, Santiago M.; Delfín-Narciso, Daniel; Luis, Angelats-Silva; Díaz, Felix; Luis, Cabanillas-Chirinos; Moises, Gallozzo Cardenas","Rojas-Flores, Segundo (Vicerrectorado de Investigación, Universidad Autónoma del Perú, Lima 15842, Peru); De La Cruz-Noriega, Magaly (Vicerrectorado de Investigación, Universidad Autónoma del Perú, Lima 15842, Peru); Benites, Santiago M.

Since this type of evaluation is functional and practical for managers and planners, ecological livability is studied from different aspects (ecological, physical-social, economic). With an emphasis on ecological-infrastructural potentials, the present paper studies the region’s capabilities in four activities: agriculture, pasture, forestry, residential, and tourism in northern Iran. Firstly, in the methodology and based on GIS, ecological-infrastructural indicators were investigated in the study area (Tonekabon City). Secondly, the four activities evaluated the ecological-infrastructural indicators according to the Delphi and ANP methods. Then they were combined with the Overlay function to prioritize the ecological-infrastructural potential of Tonekabon City for the activities. Findings from the study show that topographic and land capability indicators impact various activities concerning Tonekabon City’s characteristics. The results of the research for the four activities in Tonekabon indicate that 35% of lands have a high potential for agriculture and pasture, more than 70% for forestry, 35% for tourism activities, and more than 73% for settlement ones in the category 1 and 2 (suitable, moderately suitable). In addition, the most ecological infrastructure potential is for agricultural-pasture, residential, and tourism activities in the northern of Tonekabon and forestry ones for the southern part. However, the high potential and power are in other parts of Tonekabon, especially the central sections, to establish several activities that it is possible to improve livability in the light of sustainable development through the investment in activities.",,This research received no external funding.,Sustainability,,,,2022-10-05,2022,2022-10-05,,14,19,12638,All OA; Gold,Article,"Zolfani, Sarfaraz Hashemkhani; Kashi, Seyed Mostafa Hedayatnezhad; Baharvandi, Saba","Zolfani, Sarfaraz Hashemkhani (School of Engineering, Universidad Catolica del Norte, Larrondo 1281, Coquimbo 1780000, Chile); Kashi, Seyed Mostafa Hedayatnezhad (Faculty of Geography and Environmental Planning, University of Sistan and Baluchestan, Zahedan 9816745845, Iran); Baharvandi, Saba (Faculty of Geographical Sciences and Planning, University of Isfahan, Isfahan 8174673441, Iran)","Zolfani, Sarfaraz Hashemkhani (Catholic University of the North)","Zolfani, Sarfaraz Hashemkhani (Catholic University of the North); Kashi, Seyed Mostafa Hedayatnezhad (University of Sistan and Baluchestan); Baharvandi, Saba (University of Isfahan)",5,5,,3.66,https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/14/19/12638/pdf?version=1665373693,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1151809230,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3508 Tourism; 37 Earth Sciences; 3704 Geoinformatics; 44 Human Society; 4406 Human Geography",

Both foci add value, but the latter is critical for building receptivity for conservation efforts and more thoughtfully designing appropriate context-specific processes for stakeholder engagement and shared decision-making. A deeper analysis of the social conflict dynamics involving the human relationships among individuals and groups engaged in a conservation conflict is needed as a first step in paving the way for the long-term success of conservation projects. Using a “Levels of Conflict” model offers a starting place for the analysis of social conflict often underpinning conservation translocation efforts. Further, we recommend employing a Conservation Conflict Transformation approach when considering conservation translocations to ensure that stakeholder engagement processes sufficiently engage the system, reconcile deep-rooted conflict among those involved and offer the best chance for shared progress and conservation success.",,,Frontiers in Conservation Science,,,,2022-03-10,2022,2022-03-10,,3,,783709,All OA; Gold,Article,"Glikman, Jenny Anne; Frank, Beatrice; Bogardus, Michelle; Meysohn, Samantha; Sandström, Camilla; Zimmermann, Alexandra; Madden, Francine","Glikman, Jenny Anne (Instituto de Estudios Sociales Avanzados (IESA-CSIC), Plaza Campo Santo de los Martires, Córdoba, Spain); Frank, Beatrice (Capital Regional District-Regional Parks Canada, Victoria, BC, Canada); Bogardus, Michelle (Pacific Islands Fish and Wildlife Office, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Honolulu, HI, United States); Meysohn, Samantha (Kearns and West, Portland, OR, United States); Sandström, Camilla (Statsvetenskapliga institutionen, Umeå universitet, Umeå, Sweden); Zimmermann, Alexandra (Wildlife Conservation Research Unit, Zoology Department, University of Oxford, Abingdon, United Kingdom); Madden, Francine (Center for Conservation Peacebuilding (CPeace), Washington, DC, United States)","Glikman, Jenny Anne (Instituto de Estudios Sociales Avanzados); Madden, Francine (Center for Conservation Peacebuilding (CPeace), Washington, DC, United States)","Glikman, Jenny Anne (Instituto de Estudios Sociales Avanzados); Frank, Beatrice (Capital Regional District); Bogardus, Michelle (United States Fish and Wildlife Service); Meysohn, Samantha (Kearns and West, Portland, OR, United States); Sandström, Camilla (Umeå University); Zimmermann, Alexandra (University of Oxford); Madden, Francine (Center for Conservation Peacebuilding (CPeace), Washington, DC, United States)",10,8,,3.63,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fcosc.2022.783709/pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1146180136,41 Environmental Sciences; 4104 Environmental Management,"15 Life on Land; 16 Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions"

The vicuña (Vicugna vicugna) is a medium-sized South American wild camelid inhabiting Andean ecosystems, where several populations are live-sheared by Andean peasant communities as a way of providing an economic income to the people while promoting vicuña conservation. Institutions and scientists have shown concern for the impact and extent of sarcoptic mange in several vicuña populations across their range, as well as the lack of consistent knowledge about this disease in the species. Here, we perform a review about sarcoptic mange distribution throughout the vicuña's native range, evidence of effects of age and sex, the modes of transmission and the veterinary treatments employed. The review retrieved a few scientific papers, but found several reports and academic studies mostly considered as 'grey literature'. Mange was recorded across the entire native vicuña range (Argentina, Bolivia, Chile and Peru). Mange prevalence varied across vicuña studies (up to 60% prevalence in some populations) and severely affected a number of populations, being an important source of mortality. Mange was reported as more frequent in adults than in offspring. The modes of mange transmission remain unclear, although direct transmission between infected and healthy animals seems to be the most likely, including the transmission between domestic camelids and vicuñas. Regarding the treatments employed, ivermectin was the most frequently used. We further identified several gaps in knowledge and point to future research lines, which seek to promote both species conservation and the maintenance of live-shearing vicuñas under sustainable approaches in low-income Andean peasant communities.","ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS We would like to thank J.

However, the chronology of deglaciation onset, acceleration, and the subsequent thinning and recession of the different ice lobes as well as the timing and extension of large proglacial systems are still a matter of discussion. The maximum eastward extension the Lago Cochrane/Pueyrredón ice lobe was around ∼20,000–27,000 cal yrs BP; its associated proglacial lake drained toward the Pacific between 12,600 and 8,000 cal yrs BP. This study presents the first two pollen and charcoal records from the Lago Cochrane/Pueyrredón valley, spanning the last 11,650 cal yrs BP. The Laguna Maldonado record spans between 11,650 and 8,500 cal yrs BP, while the Laguna Anónima record the last 8,500 cal yrs BP, thereby overlapping chronologically. The lithological record of Laguna Maldonado shows that organic sedimentation began at the onset of the Holocene (11,650 cal yrs BP), once the site was free of glacio-lacustrine influence. Between 11,650 and 10,500 cal yrs BP, an open Nothofagus forest developed associated with high fire occurrence/frequency, followed by a transitional phase to a closer forest associated with a shift from low to high fire activity up to 9,400 cal yrs BP. Between 9,400 and 8,500 cal yrs BP, the Laguna Maldonado record suggests the development of an open forest or probably scattered patches of forest of variable size in a steppe matrix, probably related to geomorphological and paraglacial dynamics as well as climatic forcings, while the Laguna Anónima record indicates the development of a closed Nothofagus forest and high to low fire occurrence/frequency from 8,200 to 3,800 cal yrs BP. Since 3,800 cal yrs BP, a highly dynamic open forest or forest patches scattered in a grass/shrub–grass steppe matrix occurred around Laguna Anónima associated with high fire occurrence/frequency synchronous with an important increase in the presence of hunter-gatherers during the last 3,000 years. The results from the Lago Cochrane/Pueyrredón valley are integrated and discussed at the regional scale alongside other records from Central West Patagonia.","To Varyl Thorndycraft for Figure 1A, Dra.

METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The project is divided into three distinct phases aligned with community participatory action research cycles: diagnostic, intervention and evaluation. This allows us to use a participatory approach to design a community-led, bottom-up intervention for mental health systems strengthening and the promotion of mental health and well-being.The diagnostic phase explores local understandings of mental health, mental distress and access to mental health services from community members and health providers. The intervention stage will be guided by a participatory Theory of Change process. Community priorities will inform the development of a participatory, learning and action (PLA) informed group intervention, with a community linkage forum. The pilot of the PLA intervention will be evaluated using MRC process evaluation guidelines.
ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This project has received ethical approval from two sources. Universidad de Los Andes (2021-1393) and the University College London (16127/005). Dissemination of findings will include academic publications, community forums, policy briefs and visual media (cartoons, pod casts and short films).",,"This work is funded by an UKRI/ESRC Newton Award, grant number ES/V013211 and a MINCIENCIAS award, grant number 856-2020.",BMJ Open,,,Humans; Community Mental Health Services; Pilot Projects; Colombia; Research Design; Health Services Research; Polyesters,2022-12-22,2022,2022-12-22,2022-12,12,12,e069329,All OA; Gold,Article,"Burgess, Rochelle; Sanguineti, María Cecilia Dedios; Maldonado-Carrizosa, Darío; Fonseca, Laura; San Juan, Norha Vera; Lucumí, Diego; González-Gort, Mónica; Melgar, Mónica Carreño; Gaviria, María Fanny; Tovar, Diego Ferney; Jovchelovitch, Sandra","Burgess, Rochelle (UCL Institute for Global Health, London, UK); Sanguineti, María Cecilia Dedios (School of Government, Universidad de los Andes, Bogota, Colombia); Maldonado-Carrizosa, Darío (School of Government, Universidad de los Andes, Bogota, Colombia); Fonseca, Laura (Department of Psychological and Behavioural Science, London School of Economics and Political Science, London, UK); San Juan, Norha Vera (UCL Institute for Global Health, London, UK; Rapid Research Appraisal and Evaluation Lab, University College London, London, UK); Lucumí, Diego (School of Government, Universidad de los Andes, Bogota, Colombia); González-Gort, Mónica (School of Government, Universidad de los Andes, Bogota, Colombia); Melgar, Mónica Carreño (School of Government, Universidad de los Andes, Bogota, Colombia); Gaviria, María Fanny (Corporación Manigua, Florencia, Colombia); Tovar, Diego Ferney (Cooperativa Multiactiva Para El Buen Vivir Y La Paz Del Caquetá, Florencia, Colombia); Jovchelovitch, Sandra (Department of Psychological and Behavioural Science, London School of Economics and Political Science, London, UK)","Burgess, Rochelle (University College London)","Burgess, Rochelle (University College London); Sanguineti, María Cecilia Dedios (Universidad de Los Andes); Maldonado-Carrizosa, Darío (Universidad de Los Andes); Fonseca, Laura (London School of Economics and Political Science); San Juan, Norha Vera (University College London; University College London); Lucumí, Diego (Universidad de Los Andes); González-Gort, Mónica (Universidad de Los Andes); Melgar, Mónica Carreño (Universidad de Los Andes); Gaviria, María Fanny (Corporación Manigua, Florencia, Colombia); Tovar, Diego Ferney (Cooperativa Multiactiva Para El Buen Vivir Y La Paz Del Caquetá, Florencia, Colombia); Jovchelovitch, Sandra (London School of Economics and Political Science)",6,6,1.26,3.56,https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/bmjopen/12/12/e069329.full.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1153897247,42 Health Sciences; 4203 Health Services and Systems; 4206 Public Health,3 Good Health and Well Being

There were 854 participants aged 18 to 50 years (Mean = 36.54; SD = 9.23); 634 females (74.20%) and 220 males (25.80%), who completed the Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD-7), Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-10), Preoccupation with COVID-19 Contagion (PRE-COVID-19), Brief Scale of Fear of Loneliness (BSFL). A partial unregularized network was estimated through the ggmModSelect function. Expected influence (EI) and bridging EI values were calculated to identify central symptoms and bridging symptoms respectively. The results reveal those two symptoms of depression-stress and anxiety-were the most central symptoms in the network. Depressive symptoms are at the same time the most comorbid and it is shown that there are no differences in the network when compared between those who left home and those who did not leave home during lockdown. Depressive symptoms are concluded to be central and bridging in the network and interconnected with some symptoms of stress and anxiety.

These publications have assessed the determinants and outcomes of vaccine conspiracy beliefs using, in some cases, pooled data from different countries, and compared the results across these contexts. However, studies often do not consider measurement invariance as a necessary requirement for comparative analyses. Therefore, the aim of this study was to develop and evaluate the cross-cultural MI of the COVID-19 Vaccine Conspiracy Beliefs Scale (COVID-VCBS) in 12 Latin American countries.
Methods: Confirmatory factor analysis, item response theory analysis and alignment method were applied to test measurement invariance in a large number of groups.
Results: The COVID-VCBS showed robust psychometric properties and measurement invariance for both factor loadings and crosstabs. Also, a higher level of acceptance of conspiracy beliefs about vaccines is necessary to respond to higher response categories. Similarly, greater acceptance of conspiracy beliefs about COVID-19 vaccines was related to a lower intention to be vaccinated.
Conclusion: The results allow for improved understanding of conspiracy beliefs about COVID-19 vaccines in the countries assessed; furthermore, they provide researchers and practitioners with an invariant measure that they can use in cross-cultural studies in Latin America. However, further studies are needed to test invariance in other countries, with the goal of developing a truly international measure of conspiracy beliefs about COVID-19 vaccines.","The authors would like to thank the respondents, who kindly participated in this research study.",This research was funded by a COVID-19 crisis seed grant from the Universidad Privada del Norte to TC-R.,Frontiers in Public Health,,,COVID-19; COVID-19 Vaccines; Cross-Cultural Comparison; Humans; Latin America; Vaccines,2022-06-14,2022,2022-06-14,,10,,908720,All OA; Gold,Article,"Caycho-Rodríguez, Tomás; Valencia, Pablo D.; Ventura-León, José; Vilca, Lindsey W.; Carbajal-León, Carlos; Reyes-Bossio, Mario; White, Michael; Rojas-Jara, Claudio; Polanco-Carrasco, Roberto; Gallegos, Miguel; Cervigni, Mauricio; Martino, Pablo; Palacios, Diego Alejandro; Moreta-Herrera, Rodrigo; Samaniego-Pinho, Antonio; Lobos-Rivera, Marlon Elías; Figares, Andrés Buschiazzo; Puerta-Cortés, Diana Ximena; Corrales-Reyes, Ibraín Enrique; Calderón, Raymundo; Tapia, Bismarck Pinto; Gallegos, Walter L.

The dynamic characterization of civil structures adopting SHM systems provides, at a particular moment, accurate information about the current structural response. When considering a proper SHM strategy and affordable economic investment for the maintenance required by structures, it is possible to safeguard the original structural parameters and avoid potential failures. However, traditional SHM systems are not desirable due to the large economic investments involved and demand for exhausting fieldwork. This research presents the design, implementation, and validation of a low-cost SHM system composed of a Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) and a base station in order to identify dynamic properties from the measured structural response. A set of small- and full-scale experimental tests were conducted to validate the WSN system using a wired traditional SHM system. Vibration data recorded through the low-cost SHM system were processed and compared to determine the natural frequencies, mode shapes, and damping properties of different structures by computing modal identification techniques, frequency analysis, and logarithmic decrement. The obtained dynamic characterization results from small- and full-scale experimental testing conclude that the low-cost SHM system can reliably identify the dynamic properties of the tested structures. This proposal provides an inexpensive, functional, and innovative alternative for SHM regarding traditional monitoring systems.",The authors would like to thank Universidad del Norte for providing the National Instrument data acquisition system and PCB Piezotronics accelerometers for the instrumentation of large-scale civil structures.,This research received no external funding.,Applied Sciences,,,,2022-03-09,2022,2022-03-09,,12,6,2807,All OA; Gold,Article,"Caballero-Russi, David; Ortiz, Albert R.; Guzmán, Andrés; Canchila, Carlos","Caballero-Russi, David (Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, The Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA 16802, USA); Ortiz, Albert R.

Desde el primer reporte en la provincia de Wuhan (China) en el año 2019, el SARS-CoV-2 se ha diseminado por todo el mundo, provocando un enorme impacto en la salud pública. Para su diagnóstico, la Organización Mundial de la Salud ha incentivado el desarrollo de pruebas rápidas, de simple ejecución, sensibles y específicas, que complementan la RT-qPCR como prueba de referencia. La prueba RT-LAMP ha mostrado ser una excelente alternativa para la detección del SARS-CoV-2 en diferentes biofluidos.
OBJETIVO: Validar la técnica RT-LAMP colorimétrica en muestras de hisopado nasofaríngeo previamente confirmadas por RT-qPCR, usando el protocolo Charité, Berlín, Alemania. Materiales y métodos. Un total de 153 muestras de hisopado nasofaríngeo de individuos con sospecha de COVID-19 se sometieron a RT-qPCR y RT-LAMP, usando un estuche comercial colorimétrico (NEB, Germany). La RT-LAMP se practicó con las muestras de ARN extraídas del hisopado nasofaríngeo y con muestras crudas sin previa extracción de ARN. El resultado fue evaluado por un simple cambio de color en la reacción.
RESULTADOS: La sensibilidad y especificidad de la técnica RT-LAMP para detectar el gen N del SARS-CoV-2 mediante un set de cebadores previamente reportados (set de Broughton), arrojó valores de 0,97 (0,85-1,00) y 0,81 (0,65-0,92), respectivamente, con un intervalo de confianza del 95%. Otro set de cebadores dirigidos contra otra región del mismo gen (set de Lalli) arrojó valores de sensibilidad y especificidad de 0,96 (0,78-1,00) y 0,77 (0,55-0,92), respectivamente. Sin previa extracción de ARN, se encontró que la sensibilidad fue del 0,95 (0,74-1,00) y la especificidad del 0,88 (0,64-0,99).
CONCLUSIONES: Estos resultados evidencian que la técnica RT-LAMP podría considerarse una prueba diagnóstica rápida, de fácil ejecución, libre de equipos sofisticados, sensible y específica, para el diagnóstico del SARS-CoV-2 en muestras de hisopados nasofaríngeos.","Agradecemos a la Secretaría de Salud del Distrito de Barranquilla, a la Secretaría de Salud del Departamento del Atlántico y al Instituto Nacional de Salud, por el apoyo logístico en relación con las muestras clínicas y su remisión a la Unidad de Genética y Biología Molecular de la Universidad Simón Bolívar.

However, at the same time, it has also generated different types of problems, such as cyber addictions, computer crimes, the mediatization of sexuality, and problematic Internet use, among others. In spite of their reach and impact, the understanding of these problems is not broad and adequate enough to design of timely and effective intervention actions. This paper presents a systematic review of studies conducted in Latin America on these topics with the aim of contributing to their characterization and description and establishing reference points for studies and interventions. For this purpose, the problems were classified by type and class to later find articles on these issues published between 2010 and 2020 in journals indexed in Scopus. After analyzing 216 papers, it was concluded that these social problems associated with the use of ICTs are present in Latin America, however, research on these topics is scarce. Another important conclusion is that the existing studies are mostly focused on young people, disregarding the presence of these problems in other segments of the population. Finally, these problems should be further investigated to balance technological appropriation against the consequences of thoughtless, uncritical, and unlimited use of ICTs.",,,trilogía Ciencia Tecnología Sociedad,,,,2022-01-28,2022,2022-01-28,,14,26,e2020-e2020,All OA; Gold,Article,"Rojas-Díaz, Jhoeen Sneyder; Yepes-Londoño, John Jairo","Rojas-Díaz, Jhoeen Sneyder (Universidad Católica Luis Amigó); Yepes-Londoño, John Jairo (Universidad Católica Luis Amigó)",,"Rojas-Díaz, Jhoeen Sneyder (Universidad Católica Luis Amigó); Yepes-Londoño, John Jairo (Universidad Católica Luis Amigó)",3,3,,3.53,https://revistas.itm.edu.co/index.php/trilogia/article/download/2020/2317,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1147838433,44 Human Society; 4404 Development Studies; 46 Information and Computing Sciences,

The pandemic has negatively influenced various aspects of life and led to changes in various habits and behaviours, including consumption. However, the extent to which the pandemic has influenced households, and waste production, in particular, is not well known. In this context, this paper reports on a study aimed at identifying changes in waste production across households under the special conditions created by the pandemic in Hispanic America. The majority of the respondents stated that their level of satisfaction with waste management policies in their countries did not change much during the pandemic. Only a few stated that they were more satisfied than before. Overall, the results suggest that, like previous crises, the COVID-19 outbreak may generate changes regarding household consumption and waste management in Hispanic America. At the same time, these findings stress the need to improve waste management practices. Some measures that may be adopted to allow Hispanic American countries to better cope with increases in waste production in times of pandemics are listed.",This paper has been prepared as part of the &quot;100 papers to accelerate the implementation of the UN Sustainable Development Goals&quot; initiative.,We acknowledge support for the article processing charge by the Open Access Publication Fund of Hamburg University of Applied Sciences.,Sustainability,,,,2022-12-09,2022,2022-12-09,,14,24,16552,All OA; Gold,Article,"Filho, Walter Leal; Salvia, Amanda Lange; Sierra, Javier; Fletcher, Carly A.; Banks, Craig E.; Velazquez, Luis; Anholon, Rosley; Rampasso, Izabela Simon; Maclean, Claudia; Barbir, Jelena; Neiva, Samara","Filho, Walter Leal (Faculty of Life Sciences, Hamburg University of Applied Sciences, 21033 Hamburg, Germany); Salvia, Amanda Lange (Graduate Program in Civil and Environmental Engineering, University of Passo Fundo, Passo Fundo 99052-900, Brazil); Sierra, Javier (Faculty of Life Sciences, Hamburg University of Applied Sciences, 21033 Hamburg, Germany; Research Centre on Global Governance, Educational Research Institute, Department of Applied Economics, Faculty of Law, University of Salamanca, 37007 Salamanca, Spain); Fletcher, Carly A.

                  The Late Miocene and Pliocene Quillagua depocenter lake system existed in a forearc basin on the west side of the Andes Mountains in northern Chile, alternating between standing-water and salar conditions. Quaternary incision of the Loa River Canyon resulted in bypass of the prior depositional surface and drainage of groundwater from the abandoned depocenter. Systematic regional geological mapping, 32 new chronological constraints on the strata in the basin, outcrop-scale facies analyses, and geophysical data underpin a revised evaluation of the controls on the lake system. The progressive stages, ages, and causes of the Quaternary destruction of the lake system are reconstructed based on mapped distributions of superficial fluvial sediments, chronological studies of terrace deposits, and landform analysis. The lake system occurred at the junction of small catchments draining the slowly rising western Andean foothills and the large paleo-Loa River catchment draining the Andean volcanic arc, during a time span of intense caldera activity. Small magnitude climate variability affected both the hyperarid low elevation sectors and arid upper sectors of the catchments. By 10 Ma, the regional climate was extremely arid, limiting water and sediment to small amounts, and during the Late Miocene and Pliocene, there was no surface-water outlet to the Pacific. Hydrological variations from 9 to 2.6 Ma led to sediment accumulation in variable lake environments, alternating with long hiatuses. Minor deformation within the Quillagua depocenter shifted the topographic axis and groundwater outlets. Simultaneous headward erosion from the Pacific shore captured the Loa River, which triggered large-magnitude incision that persists today. The progression of surface water environmental change was accompanied by changing composition and amount of surface and groundwater, which determined deposition of primary evaporite minerals, extensive diagenesis, and eventually, complex patterns of dissolution expressed as karst.",,,Lithosphere,,Alexander R.

This paper describes the development of a BPS µPAD to detect and quantify the S100B biomarker from peripheral whole blood. The device uses NaCl functionalized VF2 filter paper as a sample collection pad, an MF1 filter paper for plasma retention, and an optimized microfluidic channel geometry. An inverted light microscope, scanning electron microscope (SEM), and image processing software were used for visualizing BPS efficiency. A design of experiments (DOE) assessed the device's efficacy using an S100B ELISA Kit to measure clinically relevant S100B concentrations in plasma. The BPS device obtained 50 μL of plasma from 300 μL of whole blood after 3.5 min. The statistical correlation of S100B concentrations obtained using plasma from standard centrifugation and the BPS device was 0.98. The BPS device provides a simple manufacturing protocol, short fabrication time, and is capable of S100B detection using ELISA, making one step towards the integration of technologies aimed at low-cost POC testing of clinically relevant biomarkers.",We thank Universidad del Norte for facilitating the materials and equipment for all the performed experiments and Universidad Simón Bolívar for the financial support.,"This research was funded by Departamento Administrativo de Ciencia, Tecnología e Innovación (COLCIENCIAS) grant number 757–2016 and by Gobernación del Atlántico call number 809-2018.

Manifest simultaneously as Poland-Möbius (Poland-Moebius) syndrome, debate continues as to whether this is a distinct nosological entity or represents phenotypic variation as part of a spectrum of disorders of rhomboencephalic development. Etiological hypotheses implicate both genetic and environmental factors. The PLXND1 gene codes for a protein expressed in the fetal central nervous system and vascular endothelium and is thus involved in embryonic neurogenesis and vasculogenesis. It is located at chromosome region 3q21-q22, a locus of interest for Möbius syndrome.Case presentationWe present the first report of a patient with Poland-Möbius syndrome and a mutation in the PLXND1 gene. A child with Poland-Möbius syndrome and a maternally inherited missense variant (NM_015103.2:ex14:c.2890G > Ap.V964M) in the PLXND1 gene is described. In order to contextualize these findings, the literature was examined to identify other confirmed cases of Poland-Möbius syndrome for which genetic data were available. Fourteen additional cases of Poland-Möbius syndrome with genetic studies are described in the literature. None implicated the PLXND1 gene which has previously been implicated in isolated Möbius syndrome.ConclusionsThis report provides further evidence in support of a role for PLXND1 mutations in Möbius syndrome and reasserts the nosological link between Möbius and Poland’s syndromes.Level of evidenceLevel V, Descriptive Study.","The authors would like to thank Ms Anushka Hardas, librarian at Sidra Medicine for help with the literature search and acquisition of the source papers, Mr Carl Sulit, photographer at Sidra Medicine for the clinical images and Ms Julie Melville and Ms Rebecca Watson-Brown for therapeutic evaluation of the patient from the point of view of facial palsy (JM) and Poland’s syndrome (RW-B).

Negative pulsed-pressure myofascial vacuum therapy (vacuum treatment (VT)) devices mobilize tissue according to previously programmed parameters of force, time and frequency. The purpose of this study was to compare the effects of VT combined with core therapeutic exercise versus a physical therapy program (PTP) based only on core therapeutic exercise. Fifty participants with chronic non-specific low back pain were randomly assigned to two treatment groups, the VT group (n = 25) or the PTP group (n = 25). Pain, pressure-pain threshold, range of motion, functionality and quality of life were measured before treatment, at the end of treatment, and at one-month and three-month follow-ups. Both groups received 15 therapy sessions over 5 weeks. Statistically significant differences in favor of the VT group were shown in the results. In conclusion, the intervention based on myofascial vacuum therapy improved pain, mobility, pressure pain threshold, functionality and quality of life.",,This research received no external funding.,Journal of Clinical Medicine,,Marco Alessandro Minetto,,2022-04-02,2022,2022-04-02,,11,7,1984,All OA; Gold,Article,"Rodríguez-Huguet, Manuel; Góngora-Rodríguez, Jorge; Vinolo-Gil, Maria Jesus; Martín-Vega, Francisco Javier; Martín-Valero, Rocío; Rodríguez-Almagro, Daniel","Rodríguez-Huguet, Manuel (Department of Nursing and Physiotherapy, University of Cádiz, 11009 Cádiz, Spain;, mariajesus.vinolo@uca.es, (M.J.V.-G.);, javier.martin@uca.es, (F.J.M.-V.); Clinical Management Unit Rehabilitation, University Hospital of Puerta del Mar, 11009 Cádiz, Spain); Góngora-Rodríguez, Jorge (Policlínica Santa María Clinic, 11008 Cádiz, Spain;, jorgem.gongora@gmail.com, or; University School of Osuna, University of Sevilla, 41640 Osuna, Spain); Vinolo-Gil, Maria Jesus (Department of Nursing and Physiotherapy, University of Cádiz, 11009 Cádiz, Spain;, mariajesus.vinolo@uca.es, (M.J.V.-G.);, javier.martin@uca.es, (F.J.M.-V.); Clinical Management Unit Rehabilitation, University Hospital of Puerta del Mar, 11009 Cádiz, Spain); Martín-Vega, Francisco Javier (Department of Nursing and Physiotherapy, University of Cádiz, 11009 Cádiz, Spain;, mariajesus.vinolo@uca.es, (M.J.V.-G.);, javier.martin@uca.es, (F.J.M.-V.)); Martín-Valero, Rocío (Department of Physiotherapy, Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Málaga, 29071 Málaga, Spain;, rovalemas@uma.es); Rodríguez-Almagro, Daniel (Department of Nursing, Physiotherapy and Medicine, University of Almería, 04120 Almería, Spain;, dra243@ual.es)","Rodríguez-Huguet, Manuel (University of Cádiz; Hospital Universitario Puerta del Mar)","Rodríguez-Huguet, Manuel (University of Cádiz; Hospital Universitario Puerta del Mar); Góngora-Rodríguez, Jorge (Policlínica Santa María Clinic, 11008 Cádiz, Spain;, jorgem.gongora@gmail.com, or; University of Seville); Vinolo-Gil, Maria Jesus (University of Cádiz; Hospital Universitario Puerta del Mar); Martín-Vega, Francisco Javier (University of Cádiz); Martín-Valero, Rocío (University of Malaga); Rodríguez-Almagro, Daniel (University of Almería)",5,4,1.66,3.47,https://www.mdpi.com/2077-0383/11/7/1984/pdf?version=1648879276,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1146850649,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3202 Clinical Sciences,

                    Colombia’s national COVID-19 vaccination plan began in February of 2021. It gave priority to older adults, who constituted 77.7% of deaths from this illness in the year 2020. The main goal of the plan is to decrease specific mortality and the number of serious COVID-19 cases, however, the number of deaths avoided by this strategy is unknown. The objective of this study was to estimate the number of avoided deaths in Colombia by fully vaccinating older adults against COVID-19, during the first year of the implementation of the national vaccination plan.
                  
                  
                    Methods:
                    This study took on the design of an ecological, longitudinal study. Full vaccination coverage for older adults was calculated for each epidemiological week and age group from March to December 2021, based on which the number of avoided COVID-19 deaths was estimated. A sensitivity analysis was performed taking into account variations in the vaccines’ effectiveness by age group.
                  
                  
                    Results:
                    In Colombia, over 5.3 million adults 60 years of age and older received full COVID-19 vaccinations between March and December 2021. During that same period, nearly 46,000 deaths of older adults from this cause were registered. We estimated that vaccination has avoided around 22,000 more older adults from dying from COVID-19 in Colombia, that is, 32.4% of expected deaths in 2021. According to the sensitivity analysis, the number of lives saved ranged from 19,597 to 36,507.
                  
                  
                    Conclusions:
                    Colombia’s strategy to vaccinate older adults against COVID-19 has avoided mortality for this age group from being 48.0% higher than what was observed during the study period. Even more lives have been saved when taking into account the parameters that were defined and the omission of the contribution from partial vaccinations.",,The author(s) declared that no grants were involved in supporting this work.,F1000Research,,,,2022-05-19,2022,2022-05-19,,11,,198,All OA; Gold,Article,"Rojas-Botero, Maylen Liseth; Fernández-Niño, Julián Alfredo; Arregocés-Castillo, Leonardo; Ruiz-Gómez, Fernando","Rojas-Botero, Maylen Liseth (Ministerio de Salud y Protección Social, Bogota, Bogota, 110311, Colombia); Fernández-Niño, Julián Alfredo (Ministerio de Salud y Protección Social, Bogota, Bogota, 110311, Colombia; Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); Arregocés-Castillo, Leonardo (Ministerio de Salud y Protección Social, Bogota, Bogota, 110311, Colombia); Ruiz-Gómez, Fernando (Ministerio de Salud y Protección Social, Bogota, Bogota, 110311, Colombia)","Fernández-Niño, Julián Alfredo (Ministry of Health and Social Protection; Universidad del Norte)","Rojas-Botero, Maylen Liseth (Ministry of Health and Social Protection); Fernández-Niño, Julián Alfredo (Ministry of Health and Social Protection; Universidad del Norte); Arregocés-Castillo, Leonardo (Ministry of Health and Social Protection); Ruiz-Gómez, Fernando (Ministry of Health and Social Protection)",5,3,,3.47,https://f1000research.com/articles/11-198/v2/pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1148009600,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3202 Clinical Sciences; 42 Health Sciences,3 Good Health and Well Being

However, for copper metallurgy activities higher copper ion concentrations cause the ureolytic bacteria to lose their activity, leading to some difficulty in forming carbonate precipitation for copper immobilization (referred to also as ""biomineralization""). A series test tube experiments were conducted in the present work to investigate the effects of bacterial inoculation and pH conditions on the copper immobilization efficiency. The numerical simulations mainly aimed to compare with the experimental results to verify its applicability. The copper immobilization efficiency was attained through azurite precipitation under pH in a 4-6 range, while due to Cu2+ migration and diffusion, it reduced to zero under pH below 4. In case pH fell within a 7-9 range, the immobilization efficiency was attained via malachite precipitation. The copper-ammonia complexes formation reduced the immobilization efficiency to zero. The reductions were attributed either to the low degree of urea hydrolysis or to inappropriate pH conditions. The findings shed light on the necessity of securing the urease activity and modifying pH conditions using the two-step biomineralization approach while applying the MICP technology to remedy copper-rich water bodies.",,This manuscript was based upon work supported by the Shaanxi Educational Department under Grant No. 2020TD-005 through the innovative ability support scheme.,Frontiers in Microbiology,,,,2022-09-16,2022,2022-09-16,,13,,1001464,All OA; Gold,Article,"Xue, Zhong-Fei; Cheng, Wen-Chieh; Wang, Lin; Xie, Yi-Xin","Xue, Zhong-Fei (School of Civil Engineering, Xi’an University of Architecture and Technology, Xi’an, China; Shaanxi Key Laboratory of Geotechnical and Underground Space Engineering (XAUAT), Xi’an, China); Cheng, Wen-Chieh (School of Civil Engineering, Xi’an University of Architecture and Technology, Xi’an, China; Shaanxi Key Laboratory of Geotechnical and Underground Space Engineering (XAUAT), Xi’an, China); Wang, Lin (School of Civil Engineering, Xi’an University of Architecture and Technology, Xi’an, China; Shaanxi Key Laboratory of Geotechnical and Underground Space Engineering (XAUAT), Xi’an, China); Xie, Yi-Xin (School of Civil Engineering, Xi’an University of Architecture and Technology, Xi’an, China; Shaanxi Key Laboratory of Geotechnical and Underground Space Engineering (XAUAT), Xi’an, China)","Cheng, Wen-Chieh (Xi'an University of Architecture and Technology; Xi'an University of Architecture and Technology)","Xue, Zhong-Fei (Xi'an University of Architecture and Technology; Xi'an University of Architecture and Technology); Cheng, Wen-Chieh (Xi'an University of Architecture and Technology; Xi'an University of Architecture and Technology); Wang, Lin (Xi'an University of Architecture and Technology; Xi'an University of Architecture and Technology); Xie, Yi-Xin (Xi'an University of Architecture and Technology; Xi'an University of Architecture and Technology)",11,9,0.79,3.45,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2022.1001464/pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1151067356,31 Biological Sciences; 3107 Microbiology,

Unexpected variants unrelated to referral are being increasingly detected in asymptomatic individuals through ECS. In this study, we reported an asymptomatic male with duplication of exons 56-61 in the DMD gene through ECS using whole-exome sequencing (WES), which was also detected in a male patient diagnosed with typical Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). Breakpoint analysis was then performed to explore the potential mechanisms of phenotypic differences using long-read sequencing (LRS), PacBio single-molecule real-time (PacBio SMRT) target sequencing, and Sanger sequencing. Complex structural variations (SVs) on chromosome X were identified in the asymptomatic male, which revealed that the duplication occurred outside the DMD gene; whereas, the duplication in the patient with DMD was a tandem repeat. The phenotypic differences between the two men could be explained by the different breakpoint junctions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of a breakpoint analysis of DMD duplication in two men with different phenotypes. Breakpoint analysis is necessary when the clinical phenotypes are inconsistent with genotypes, and it applies to prenatal testing.","The authors are very grateful to the families for participating in this study and appreciate Beijing GrandOmics Biosciences Biotechnology Co., Ltd., for the technical support in Nanopore LRS and PacBio SMRT target sequencing.",This work was supported by the National Key Research and Development Project of China (grant number 2018YFC1002203).,Frontiers in Genetics,,,,2022-05-09,2022,2022-05-09,,13,,878806,All OA; Gold,Article,"Bai, Ying; Liu, Ju; Xu, Jinghan; Sun, Yue; Li, Jingjing; Gao, Yong; Liu, Lina; Jia, Cangcang; Kong, Xiangdong; Wang, Li","Bai, Ying (Genetic and Prenatal Diagnosis Center, Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, China); Liu, Ju (Department of Neurology, First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, China); Xu, Jinghan (Genetic and Prenatal Diagnosis Center, Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, China); Sun, Yue (Genetic and Prenatal Diagnosis Center, Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, China); Li, Jingjing (Genetic and Prenatal Diagnosis Center, Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, China); Gao, Yong (GrandOmics Biosciences, Beijing, China); Liu, Lina (Genetic and Prenatal Diagnosis Center, Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, China); Jia, Cangcang (GrandOmics Biosciences, Beijing, China); Kong, Xiangdong (Genetic and Prenatal Diagnosis Center, Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, China); Wang, Li (Genetic and Prenatal Diagnosis Center, Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, China)","Kong, Xiangdong (First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University); Wang, Li (First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University)","Bai, Ying (First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University); Liu, Ju (First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University); Xu, Jinghan (First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University); Sun, Yue (First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University); Li, Jingjing (First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University); Gao, Yong (Grandomics (China)); Liu, Lina (First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University); Jia, Cangcang (Grandomics (China)); Kong, Xiangdong (First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University); Wang, Li (First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University)",8,7,1.36,3.4,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fgene.2022.878806/pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1147724769,31 Biological Sciences; 3105 Genetics,

Quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) studies were performed using quinolinone and thiosemicarbazide as pharmacophoric nuclei; the best model showed statistical parameters of R2 = 0.83; F = 47.96; s = 0.31, and was validated by several different methods. The van der Waals volume, electron density, and electronegativity model results suggested a pivotal role in antituberculosis (anti-TB) activity. Subsequently, from this model a new series of quinolinone-thiosemicarbazone 11a-e was designed and docked against two tuberculosis protein targets: enoyl-acyl carrier protein reductase (InhA) and decaprenylphosphoryl-β-D-ribose-2'-oxidase (DprE1). Molecular dynamics simulation over 200 ns showed a binding energy of -71.3 to -12.7 Kcal/mol, suggesting likely inhibition. In vitro antimycobacterial activity of quinolinone-thiosemicarbazone for 11a-e was evaluated against M. bovis, M. tuberculosis H37Rv, and six different strains of drug-resistant M. tuberculosis. All compounds exhibited good to excellent activity against all the families of M. tuberculosis. Several of the here synthesized compounds were more effective than the standard drugs (isoniazid, oxafloxacin), 11d and 11e being the most active products. The results suggest that these compounds may contribute as lead compounds in the research of new potential antimycobacterial agents.","The authors thank Universidad del Norte, Instituto Nacional de Salud, Bogotá 111321, Universidad del Valle and MINCIENCIAS-Project Number: 201477758055 (contract.

212,pub.1147855668,10.1111/ddi.13538,,,Freshwater macroinvertebrate traits assessment as complementary to taxonomic information for mining impact detection in the northern Peruvian Andes,"Abstract  Aim We studied the distribution of freshwater macroinvertebrate taxa and traits to distinguish ecological gradients among the mining‐controlled and natural headwaters, and rural and urban economic activity influences.   Location In 2016’s dry season, macroinvertebrate samples were collected at 40 locations in the Mashcon watershed, northern Peruvian Andes. Six locations were in the headwaters directly influenced by mining, eight near‐pristine tributary headwaters, 14 agricultural locations at midstream and 12 urban locations downstream.   Methods Eight traits (five biological and three ecological) were selected according to data availability, and modalities scores were assigned using the weighted and the dominant‐trait approaches. The traits relative abundances and abiotic conditions were compared among watershed sections. The ecological interpretability of the ungrouped data was verified with a distance‐based redundancy analysis.   Results The high‐altitude mining section had fewer taxa types and abundance, and distinct body forms distributions and prevalent body sizes in macroinvertebrate communities, relatable to the control of the mining headwaters. Physiological and ecological traits (respiration, mobility and attachment, food sources, feeding habits, saprobity and pH preferenda) differed among traits quantification approaches and were less informative at high altitudes. The ecological conditions from the near‐pristine tributaries recovered in the vegetated midstream section, to again be affected in the downstream urban section.   Main Conclusions Our results suggest the presence of ecological impairment despite the excellent physicochemical quality of the water discharged by the mine. The obtainment of autecological information at a higher taxonomic resolution, e.g. for ubiquitous taxa like Acari and Chironomidae, would be needed to advance the freshwater quality assessment of ecologically and hydrogeochemically complex Andean mining ecosystems.","ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS This work was supported by FONDECYT‐CONCYTEC (grant contract number 002‐2016‐FONDECYT) and a VLIR‐TEAM programme (ZEIN2013PR395: ‘Impact on surface water resources and aquatic biodiversity by opencast mining activities in Cajamarca, Peru’).

It has been detected in different water sources, including drinking water, which could be generating potential damage to human health. In the Metropolitan Area of Cúcuta, intensive rice cultivation is predominant, and as it grows in flooded areas, the use of herbicides has greater contact with water bodies, which are used as sources of supply. Based on this, the concentration of glyphosate was quantified in five sampling points of surface and drinking water of the Pamplonita and Zulia rivers, using UV-Vis spectrophotometry, establishing that the concentration found in drinking water (216 and 204.5 µg/L) was below the maximum allowable limits of countries such as the United States, Canada, and Australia and above those of the European Union and the United Kingdom. Once the occurrence was identified, the removal capacity of glyphosate was evaluated using membrane technology through reverse osmosis (RO) and nanofiltration (NF) in a pilot plant, for which response surface optimization models were implemented, and 100% removals were obtained, with repeatability close to 1% with respect to other reported investigations, highlighting that the NF process was more efficient even though the molecular weight of glyphosate was below the limit of the membrane. In contrast, it was determined that, according to the concentrations found in the drinking water supplied to the Metropolitan Area of Cúcuta, this has a low risk according to the guidelines for drinking water quality in Canada and a moderate risk according to the World Health Organization (WHO). The conventional systems currently used for water purification are insufficient to remove traces of contaminants such as herbicides. Therefore, it is necessary to implement new technologies.",,"The authors would like to give special thanks to Minciencias and Universidad del Norte for their support to the research from which this work was derived, by means of the funding granted through Call No. 753 for the Department of Norte de Santander.

Three well-studied ciliates include Oxytricha trifallax, Tetrahymena thermophila, and Paramecium tetraurelia, but only the Oxytricha lineage has a massively scrambled genome, whose assembly during development requires hundreds of thousands of precisely programmed DNA joining events, representing the most complex genome dynamics of any known organism. Here we study the emergence of such complex genomes by examining the origin and evolution of discontinuous and scrambled genes in the Oxytricha lineage. This study compares six genomes from three species, the germline and somatic genomes for Euplotes woodruffi, Tetmemena sp., and the model ciliate O. trifallax. We sequenced, assembled, and annotated the germline and somatic genomes of E. woodruffi, which provides an outgroup, and the germline genome of Tetmemena sp. We find that the germline genome of Tetmemena is as massively scrambled and interrupted as Oxytricha's: 13.6% of its gene loci require programmed translocations and/or inversions, with some genes requiring hundreds of precise gene editing events during development. This study revealed that the earlier diverged spirotrich, E. woodruffi, also has a scrambled genome, but only roughly half as many loci (7.3%) are scrambled. Furthermore, its scrambled genes are less complex, together supporting the position of Euplotes as a possible evolutionary intermediate in this lineage, in the process of accumulating complex evolutionary genome rearrangements, all of which require extensive repair to assemble functional coding regions. Comparative analysis also reveals that scrambled loci are often associated with local duplications, supporting a gradual model for the origin of complex, scrambled genomes via many small events of DNA duplication and decay.","We thank Toshinobu Suzaki (Kobe University) for the gift of E. woodruffi (strain Iz01 from Shizuoka Prefecture) and Chlorogonium capillatum.

A total of 21,906 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were detected in UTNGt21A, while 17,610 were disclosed in the UTNGt2 genome. The comparative genomic analysis revealed a greater number of deletions, transversions, and transitions within the UTNGt21A genome, while a small difference in the number of insertions was detected between the strains. A divergent number of types of variant annotations were detected in both strains, and categorized in terms of low, moderate, and high modifier impact on the protein effectiveness. Although both native strains shared common specific genes involved in the stress response to the gastrointestinal environment, which may qualify as a putative probiotic (bile salt, acid, temperature, osmotic stress), they were different in their antimicrobial gene cluster organization, with UTNGt21A displaying a complex bacteriocin gene arrangement and dissimilar gene variants that might alter their defense mechanisms and overall inhibitory capacity. The genome comparison revealed 34 and 9 genomic islands (GIs) in the UTNGt21A and UTNGt2 genomes, respectively, with the overrepresentation of genes involved in defense mechanisms and carbohydrate utilization. In addition, pan-genome analysis disclosed the presence of various strain-specific genes (shell genes), suggesting a high genome variation between strains. This genome analysis illustrates that the bacteriocin signature and gene variants reflect a niche-inherent pattern. These extensive genomic datasets will guide us to understand the potential benefits of the native strains and their utility in the food or pharmaceutical sectors.","The author acknowledges the Technical University of the North, Centre of Research (CUICYT), for funding this work, and expresses their sincere gratitude to D.

It has been associated with a high risk of contracting infectious diseases and with elevated mortality rates. Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is one of the most common infectious diseases worldwide and its prognosis is affected by a large number of recognizable risk factors. This narrative review updates the information on the impact of malnutrition, including both undernutrition and obesity, on the risk and prognosis of adults with CAP. Studies of CAP that have evaluated undernutrition have applied a variety of definitions when assessing the nutritional status of patients. Undernutrition has been associated with unfavorable clinical outcomes, such as prolonged hospital stay, need for intensive care unit admission, and mortality; in contrast, most published studies have found that increased body mass index is significantly associated with higher survival in patients with CAP. However, some authors have presented divergent results, mainly in relation to the etiology of CAP (bacterial versus viral). Influenza infection, caused by influenza A (H1N1) pdm09, has been associated with worse prognosis in obese patients. The current data underscore the need for larger studies to examine the physiological mechanisms that explain the differential impact of malnutrition on outcomes. Achieving a better understanding may help to guide the design of new interventions to improve prognosis.",,"Centro de Investigación Biomédica en Red de Enfermedades Infecciosas (CIBERINFEC; CB21/13/00009), Instituto de Salud Carlos III, 28029 Madrid, Spain.

This study aimed to select superior soybean genotypes for performance and yield stability, from data from multi-environment trials (METs), through GGE biplot analysis that combines the main effects of the genotype (G) plus the genotype-by-environment (G×E) interaction. As well as, through path analysis, determine the direct and indirect influences of yield components on soybean grain yield, as a genotype selection strategy. Eight soybean genotypes from the breeding program of Empresa Brasileira de Pesquisa Agropecuária (EMBRAPA) were evaluated in field trials using a randomized block experimental design, in an 8 x 8 factorial scheme with four replications in eight different environments of the Cerrado of Northeastern Brazil during two crop seasons. Phenotypic performance data were measured for the number of days to flowering (NDF), height of first pod insertion (HPI), final plant height (FPH), number of days to maturity (NDM), mass of 100 grains (M100) and grain yield (GY). The results revealed that the variance due to genotype, environment, and G×E interaction was highly significant (P < 0.001) for all traits. The ST820RR, BRS 333RR, BRS SambaíbaRR, M9144RR and M9056RR genotypes exhibited the greatest GY stability in the environments studied. However, only the BRS 333RR genotype, followed by the M9144RR, was able to combine good productive performance with high yield stability. The study also revealed that the HPI and the NDM are traits that should be prioritized in the selection of soybean genotypes due to the direct and indirect effects on the GY.",,"This study was financed in part by King Saud University, Ri-yadh, Saudi Arabia under Researchers Support Project number (RSP-2021/219) awarded to MKO, AAH, and HA, and by the Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior – Brasil (CAPES) – Finance Code 001 with one awarded for author WJSS.

The objective of the study was to analyze the processes of emotional self-regulation and self-care as protective factors against the presence of burnout in a group of Mexican psychologists. To this end, a cross-sectional quantitative design with explanatory scopes was used. An intentional sample of 226 female psychologists who were conducting clinical work was used. Data were collected by means of an electronic format. The Clinical Psychologist Self-Care Conduct Scale (EAP), the Emotional Regulation Questionnaire (ERQ) and the Burnout Maslach Inventory (MBI) were applied. Descriptive statistics were obtained for each of the scales and subscales; Pearson correlation coefficients were estimated, and single and multiple linear regression models were adjusted for the MBI subscales. A path analysis was later adjusted using the GLS method. The results indicated a low level of burnout, demonstrating self-care as a protective factor against emotional exhaustion; personal fulfillment and increased use of emotional suppression, as a self-regulation strategy, and cognitive reevaluation, as a protective factor against depersonalization.

In relation to chemotherapy treatment, the most used drug is 5-fluorouracil (5-FU); however, the use of this drug generates various toxic effects at the systemic level. For this reason, new therapeutic strategies are currently being sought that can be used as neoadjuvant or adjuvant treatments. Recent research has shown that natural compounds, such as genistein, have chemotherapeutic and anticancer effects, but the mechanisms of action of genistein and its molecular targets in human colon cells have not been fully elucidated. The results reported in relation to non-malignant cell lines are also unclear, which does not allow evidence of the selectivity that this compound may have. Therefore, in this work, genistein was evaluated in vitro in both cancer cell lines SW480 and SW620 and in the non-malignant cell line HaCaT. The results obtained show that genistein has selectivity for the SW480 and SW620 cell lines. In addition, it inhibits cell viability and has an antiproliferative effect in a dose-dependent manner. Increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) was also found, suggesting an association with the cell death process through various mechanisms. Finally, the encapsulation strategy that was proposed made it possible to demonstrate that bacterial nanocellulose (BNC) is capable of protecting genistein from the acidic conditions of gastric fluid and also allows the release of the compound in the colonic fluid. This would allow genistein to act locally in the mucosa of the colon where the first stages of CRC occur.","The authors thank Universidad Pontificia Bolivariana, MINCIENCIAS, MINEDUCACIÓN, MINCIT, ICETEX and Corporación para Investigaciones Biológicas for their support.","This research was funded by the Ministry of Sciences MINCIENCIAS, Ministry of Education MINEDUCATION, Ministry of Commerce, Industry and Tourism MINCIT and Colombian Institute of Educational Credit and Technical Studies Abroad ICETEX, through the Scientific Ecosystem component of the Colombia Científica Program (NanoBioCáncer alliance Cod FP44842-211-201-2018, project numbers 58478 and 58674).",Molecules,,Alejandro Baeza,"Humans; Genistein; Reactive Oxygen Species; Cell Line, Tumor; Fluorouracil; Colorectal Neoplasms; Apoptosis",2022-10-19,2022,2022-10-19,,27,20,7042,All OA; Gold,Article,"Rendón, Juan Pablo; Cañas, Ana Isabel; Correa, Elizabeth; Bedoya-Betancur, Vanesa; Osorio, Marlon; Castro, Cristina; Naranjo, Tonny W","Rendón, Juan Pablo (Medical and Experimental Mycology Group, CIB-UPB-UdeA-UDES, Corporación para Investigaciones Biológicas, Carrera 72 A # 78B-141, Medellin 050034, Colombia.); Cañas, Ana Isabel (School of Engineering, Universidad Pontificia Bolivariana, Circular 1 # 70-01, Medellin 050031, Colombia.); Correa, Elizabeth (Medical and Experimental Mycology Group, CIB-UPB-UdeA-UDES, Corporación para Investigaciones Biológicas, Carrera 72 A # 78B-141, Medellin 050034, Colombia.); Bedoya-Betancur, Vanesa (Medical and Experimental Mycology Group, CIB-UPB-UdeA-UDES, Corporación para Investigaciones Biológicas, Carrera 72 A # 78B-141, Medellin 050034, Colombia.); Osorio, Marlon (School of Engineering, Universidad Pontificia Bolivariana, Circular 1 # 70-01, Medellin 050031, Colombia.); Castro, Cristina (School of Engineering, Universidad Pontificia Bolivariana, Circular 1 # 70-01, Medellin 050031, Colombia.); Naranjo, Tonny W (Medical and Experimental Mycology Group, CIB-UPB-UdeA-UDES, Corporación para Investigaciones Biológicas, Carrera 72 A # 78B-141, Medellin 050034, Colombia.; School of Health Sciences, Universidad Pontificia Bolivariana, Calle 78 B # 72 A-109, Medellin 050034, Colombia.)","Rendón, Juan Pablo (Corporación para Investigaciones Biológicas); Naranjo, Tonny W (Corporación para Investigaciones Biológicas; Pontifical Bolivarian University)","Rendón, Juan Pablo (Corporación para Investigaciones Biológicas); Cañas, Ana Isabel (Pontifical Bolivarian University); Correa, Elizabeth (Corporación para Investigaciones Biológicas); Bedoya-Betancur, Vanesa (Corporación para Investigaciones Biológicas); Osorio, Marlon (Pontifical Bolivarian University); Castro, Cristina (Pontifical Bolivarian University); Naranjo, Tonny W (Corporación para Investigaciones Biológicas; Pontifical Bolivarian University)",12,12,1.82,3.15,https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/27/20/7042/pdf?version=1666576725,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1152069478,34 Chemical Sciences; 3404 Medicinal and Biomolecular Chemistry; 3405 Organic Chemistry,

To obtain a better understanding of the genetic consequences of the Quaternary glacial cycles in Galaxias maculatus, in this work we compared landlocked and migratory populations collected in areas that were differentially affected by ice advances and retreats. We included nine populations of G. maculatus, four collected from lakes (landlocked) and five from their associated estuaries/rivers (migratory) in three estuary-lake systems across southern Chile. Genetic analyses were performed using the mitochondrial control region and nine microsatellite loci. Genetic diversity measured with both markers was significantly higher in migratory than in landlocked populations across the study area. The levels of genetic differentiation showed higher differentiation among lakes than estuaries. Genetic diversity was higher in migratory populations located in areas that were less impacted by ice during Quaternary glacial processes. These results may be the consequence of recent recolonization of small freshwater bodies following the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM). Finally, the greatest differentiation was observed in populations that were exposed to continental ice advances and retreats during the LGM. Thus, in the present work we corroborate a pattern of differentiation between lakes and estuaries, using mtDNA sequences and microsatellite nuclear markers. This pattern may be due to a combination of biological factors, i.e., resident non-migratory behaviour or landlocking and natal homing-in, as well as geological factors, i.e., Expansion-Contraction Quaternary glacial biogeographic processes.",,"This study was supported by the postdoctorate 3120075 fellowship.

This pathogen activates multiple regulatory mechanisms in response to stress, and cobalamin biosynthesis might have a potential role in bacterial protection. Low temperature is a strategy used in the food industry to control bacteria proliferation; however, L. monocytogenes can grow in cold temperatures and overcome different stress conditions. In this study we selected L. monocytogenes List2-2, a strain with high tolerance to the combination of low temperature + copper, to understand whether the cobalamin biosynthesis pathway is part of the tolerance mechanism to this stress condition. For this, we characterized the transcription level of three cobalamin biosynthesis-related genes (cbiP, cbiB, and cysG) and the eutV gene, a transcriptional regulator encoding gene involved in ethanolamine metabolism, in L. monocytogenes strain List2-2 growing simultaneously under two environmental stressors: low temperature (8 °C) + copper (0.5 mM of CuSO4 × 5H2O). In addition, the gene cbiP, which encodes an essential cobyric acid synthase required in the cobalamin pathway, was deleted by homologous recombination to evaluate the impact of this gene in L. monocytogenes tolerance to a low temperature (8 °C) + different copper concentrations.ResultsBy analyzing the KEGG pathway database, twenty-two genes were involved in the cobalamin biosynthesis pathway in L. monocytogenes List2-2. The expression of genes cbiP, cbiB, and cysG, and eutV increased 6 h after the exposure to low temperature + copper. The cobalamin cbiP mutant strain List2-2ΔcbiP showed less tolerance to low temperature + copper (3 mM) than the wild-type L. monocytogenes List2-2. The addition of cyanocobalamin (5 nM) to the medium reverted the phenotype observed in List2-2ΔcbiP.ConclusionThese results indicate that cobalamin biosynthesis is necessary for L. monocytogenes growth under stress and that the cbiP gene may play a role in the survival and growth of L. monocytogenes List2-2 at low temperature + copper.",Not applicable.,"ENLACE ENL12/20.

This study compares the microbiota composition of the intestinal contents of wild and aquaculture fish to explore the microbial communities present and their potential contribution to the host. DNA was extracted from the intestinal content samples and the V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene was amplified and sequenced using the Ion Torrent platform. After the examination of the sequences, strong differences were found in the composition at the level of phylum, being Firmicutes and Tenericutes the most abundant in aquaculture and wild condition, respectively. At the genus level, the Vagococcus (54%) and Mycoplasma (97%) were the most prevalent in the microbial community of aquaculture and wild condition, respectively. The evaluation of predicted metabolic pathways in these metagenomes showed that in wild condition there is an important presence of lipid metabolism belonging to the unsaturated fatty acid synthesis. In the aquaculture condition, the metabolism of terpenoids and polyketides were relevant. To our knowledge, this is the first study to characterize and compare the intestinal microbiota of red cusk-eel (Genypterus chilensis) of wild and aquaculture origin using high-throughput sequencing.","The authors acknowledge Piero Magnolfi and all staff of the Colorado Chile S.A., for providing material and assisting during the red cusk-eel sampling.

Karst caves are widely distributed subsurface ecosystems, and cave microbes get more and more attention as they could drive cave evolution and biogeochemical cycling. Research have demonstrated the existence of diverse microbes and their participance in biogeochemical cycling of elements in cave environments. However, there are still gaps in how these microbes sustain in caves with limited nutrients and interact with cave environment. Cultivation of novel cave bacteria with certain functions is still a challenging assignment.

Despite the essential functions conferred by microbes, the source and acquisition of the rhizosphere are not entirely clear. Therefore, we investigated microbial community diversity and potential source using the only two native Antarctic plants, Deschampsia antarctica (Da) and Colobanthus quitensis (Cq), as models. We interrogated rhizosphere and bulk soil microbiomes at six locations in the Byers Peninsula, Livingston Island, Antarctica, both individual plant species and their association (Da.Cq). Our results show that host plant species influenced the richness and diversity of bacterial communities in the rhizosphere. Here, the Da rhizosphere showed the lowest richness and diversity of bacteria compared to Cq and Da.Cq rhizospheres. In contrast, for rhizosphere fungal communities, plant species only influenced diversity, whereas the rhizosphere of Da exhibited higher fungal diversity than the Cq rhizosphere. Also, we found that environmental geographic pressures (i.e., sampling site, latitude, and altitude) and, to a lesser extent, biotic factors (i.e., plant species) determined the species turnover between microbial communities. Moreover, our analysis shows that the sources of the bacterial communities in the rhizosphere were local soils that contributed to homogenizing the community composition of the different plant species growing in the same sampling site. In contrast, the sources of rhizosphere fungi were local (for Da and Da.Cq) and distant soils (for Cq). Here, the host plant species have a specific effect in acquiring fungal communities to the rhizosphere. However, the contribution of unknown sources to the fungal rhizosphere (especially in Da and Da.Cq) indicates the existence of relevant stochastic processes in acquiring these microbes. Our study shows that rhizosphere microbial communities differ in their composition and diversity. These differences are explained mainly by the microbial composition of the soils that harbor them, acting together with plant species-specific effects. Both plant species acquire bacteria from local soils to form part of their rhizosphere. Seemingly, the acquisition process is more complex for fungi. We identified a significant contribution from unknown fungal sources due to stochastic processes and known sources from soils across the Byers Peninsula.","We would like to thank George Washington University’s high-performance computing facility, Pegasus, for providing data storage, support, and computing power for genomic analyses (https://colonialone.gwu.edu/pegasus/).

Recent findings reveal that lncRNAs can code for micropeptides in various species. Micropeptides are generated from small open reading frames (smORFs) and have been discovered frequently in short mRNAs and non-coding RNAs, such as lncRNAs, circular RNAs, and pri-miRNAs. The most accepted definition of a smORF is an ORF containing fewer than 100 codons, and ribosome profiling and mass spectrometry are the most prevalent experimental techniques used to identify them. Although the majority of micropeptides perform critical roles throughout plant developmental processes and stress conditions, only a handful of their functions have been verified to date. Even though more research is being directed toward identifying micropeptides, there is still a dearth of information regarding these peptides in plants. This review outlines the lncRNA-encoded peptides, the evolutionary roles of such peptides in plants, and the techniques used to identify them.

WH16-1,"A ferredoxin protein (AAY72_06850, named FesR) was identified to associate with chromate [Cr(VI)] resistance in Alishewanella sp. WH16-1. FesR and its similar proteins were phylogenetically separated from other reductase families. Unlike the reported Cr(VI) and selenite [Se(IV)] reductases, two 4Fe-4S clusters and one flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) -binding domain were found in the FesR sequence. The experiment in vivo showed that the mutant strain ΔfesR had lost partial Cr(VI) and Se(IV) reduction capacities compared to the wild-type and complemented strains. Furthermore, overexpression in Escherichia coli and enzymatic tests in vitro showed FesR were involved in Cr(VI) and Se(IV) reduction. 4Fe-4S cluster in purified FesR was detected by ultraviolet-visible spectrum (UV-VIS) and Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR). The Km values of FesR for Cr(VI) and Se(IV) reduction were 1682.0 ± 126.2 and 1164.0 ± 89.4 μmol/L, and the Vmax values for Cr(VI) and Se(IV) reduction were 4.1 ± 0.1 and 9.4 ± 0.3 μmol min-1 mg-1, respectively. Additionally, site-directed mutagenesis and redox potential analyses showed that 4Fe-4S clusters were essential to FesR, and FAD could enhance the enzyme efficiencies of FesR as intracellular electron transporters.

Principally, it is necessary to first identify the geological domains through boreholes, model them at unsampled locations, and then evaluate the grade(s) of interest inside each built domain. The traditional determination of these categorical domains over the sampling points is suboptimal as it considers mostly-one or two variables from core logging. This leads to the neglect of the influence of other significant variables. To circumvent the problem of estimation domain identification, spatially dependent clustering machine learning algorithms can be of great help in detecting such domains. However, one problem that may appear when using these techniques is that the resulting geo-domains (geo-clusters) obtained by the clustering technique might be heterogeneous and show a non-stationary property. The reason is that the aim of these spatially dependent techniques is to produce compact and spatially contiguous clusters, which are well suited to establishing non-stationary geo-domains. This makes the procedure of modelling challenging as it necessitates the use of advanced geostatistical techniques to propagate the heterogeneous geo-clusters at unsampled locations. An algorithm is presented in this study that employs a non-stationary sequential indicator simulation paradigm to model such complex variability of heterogeneous geo-clusters. Since the spatial trends of underlying geo-clusters are required in this simulation method, in this study, we propose the use of multinomial logistic regression to infer these trends. The algorithm was tested using an actual case study from a porphyry copper deposit in Iran, where Cu, Mo, Au, Rock Quality Designation (RQD), mineralization zones, alteration types, and rock types were employed to identify and spatially model the heterogeneous geo-domains in the entire deposit. The results were compared with a conventional sequential indicator simulation where no trend was used. An examination of the resulting maps using several evaluation criteria including visual inspection of the realizations, probability maps, reproduction of proportion of each geo-cluster, connectivity measures, and trend analysis, showed that the findings of the proposed algorithm were superior in modelling heterogeneous geo-domains.","The first author is grateful to Nazarbayev University for funding this work via Faculty Development Competitive Research Grants for 2021–2023 under Contract No. 021220FD4951.

The present study aimed to determine the epidemiological pattern of trauma patients in a regional trauma center in the Midwest of Iran from 2014 to 2020.MethodsThis study was a retrospective study that was performed on 29,804 trauma patients admitted to Be′sat Hospital in Hamadan from January 2014 to December 2020. Data was collected using Health Information Management (HIM) Center of the Be′sat Hospital. For investigating the relationship of the characteristics of trauma patients and the mechanisms of trauma, Multiple Multinomial Logistic Regression (MMNLR) model was used. All statistical analyses were performed using the IBM SPSS Statistics version 24.ResultsThe mean age of all patients was 35.4 (SD = 21.9) years. Most of them were men (71.7%). The most common mechanism of trauma was road traffic accidents (RTAs) (39.6%) followed by falls (30.2%), other (19.7%), violence (6.2%), and burn (4.4%). 1.5% of the trauma patients expired. The results of multiple multinomial logistic regression indicated that significant affected factor on odds referring because of RTAs compared to other mechanism were: season and hospital length of stay (LOS); in falls and violence: age, sex, season, and LOS; and in burn: age, sex, season, evening time, and LOS (p < 0.05).ConclusionBased on the investigation of 29,804 trauma patients, in Iran as a developing country, RTAs and falls were two common mechanisms of trauma. It seems that as a short-term plan, it is possible to focus on road safety, to improve the quality of vehicles, to hold training courses for drivers.

However, vaccine trials and mother-to-child natural history cohort investigations indicate that antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC), not nAbs, correlate with prevention. The ADCC characteristics associated with lack of HIV-1 acquisition remain unclear. Here, we examine ADCC and nAb properties in pretransmission plasma from HIV-1-exposed infants and from the corresponding transmitting and nontransmitting mothers' breast milk and plasma. Breadth and potency (BP) were assessed against a panel of heterologous, nonmaternal variants. ADCC and neutralization sensitivity were estimated for the strains in the infected mothers. Infants who eventually acquired HIV-1 and those who remained uninfected had similar pretransmission ADCCBP. Viruses circulating in the transmitting and nontransmitting mothers had similar ADCC susceptibility. Infants with higher pretransmission ADCCBP and exposure to more ADCC-susceptible strains were less likely to acquire HIV-1. In contrast, higher preexisting infant neutralization BP and greater maternal virus neutralization sensitivity did not associate with transmission. Infants had higher ADCCBP closer to birth and in the presence of high plasma IgG relative to IgA levels. Mothers with potent humoral responses against their autologous viruses harbored more ADCC-sensitive strains. ADCC sensitivity of the exposure variants and preexisting ADCCBP influenced mother-to-child HIV-1 transmission during breastfeeding. Vaccination strategies that enhance ADCC are likely insufficient to prevent HIV-1 transmission because some strains may have low ADCC susceptibility.","We would like to thank the participants of the BAN study.

We evaluated the potential role of the uplift of the Eastern Cordillera (EC) of the Colombian Andes and the Mérida Andes (MA) of Venezuela as drivers of vicariance between lowland populations co-distributed on both flanks. We synthesized published geological data and provided a new reconstruction showing that the EC-MA grew from north to south, reaching significant heights and separating drainages and changing sediment composition by 38-33 million years ago (Ma). A few lowland passes across the EC-MA may have reached their current heights (~1,900 m a.s.l.) at 3-5 Ma. We created a comparative phylogeographic data set for 37 lineages of lowland tetrapods. Based on molecular phylogenetic analyses, most divergences between sister populations or species across the EC-MA occurred during Pliocene and the Quaternary and a few during the latest Miocene, and coalescent simulations rejected synchronous divergence for most groups. Divergence times were on average slightly but significantly more recent in homeotherms relative to poikilotherms. Because divergence ages are mostly too recent relative to the geological history and too asynchronous relative to each other, divergence across the northern Andes may be better explained by organism-environment interactions concomitant with climate oscillations during the Pleistocene, and/or dispersal across portals through the Andes.",We are grateful to Michael J.

In Colombia, online learning depends on academic and non-academic factors, and this dependence makes e-learning even more difficult. This paper aimed to study the students' viewpoint of Anatomy teaching at Universidad del Norte, Colombia, during the Covid-19 pandemic. One hundred sixteen students answered a questionnaire about their opinions on several topics related to online learning of Anatomy. The strongest correlation observed showed that the students agree that online anatomy classes make the subject more difficult to learn when compared to face-to-face lectures. Negative attitudes toward motivation, lack of personal contact with classmates, and complaints about being taught without laboratory sessions with cadavers were among the principal negative attitudes in students. After almost one year, motivation to participate in online classes went down; however, students improved their judgment about remote anatomy learning and their views about using authentic anatomy images during online sessions and substituting real anatomy images for apps. Anatomy sessions will have to adapt their learning tools to e-learning as time constraints allow, creating a new environment for students to participate, learn, and take advantage of this change.

The objective is to analyze how the use of didactic ICT-based strategies favor the development of digital citizenship skills in high school students. The research was approached from the perspective of the quantitative paradigm and as a space to determine the preconceptions in digital citizenship and the use of ICT in 138 high school students. A didactic sequence was implemented in order to favor the development of digital skills in students, determining the variables after its implementation, for which the SPSS® 21 statistical software was used. Main findings show that students recognize digital media as facilitators in effectively accessing information, social movements achieved in digital environments, current dangers in the digital community, citizen participation in social changes, and delivering relevant information for society using ICT. We can conclude from the findings that the use of ICT didactic strategies in the didactic sequence aided students' development of digital citizenship skills.

This study provides an insight into the needs of students in adjusting to online teaching. This study presents the methodological design of the course “Industrial Hygiene I,” part of a technology-based engineering bachelor’s degree from Universidad Católica del Norte (Chile). Once the theoretical framework was established, three surveys were designed throughout the course to measure students’ perceptions of the access, use, and utility of digital tools used in online teaching during the pandemic. Thirty-five students participated in this quantitative study. Following a data analysis, it was observed that 46% of students use their cell phones to access virtual classes and more than 50% are dissatisfied with the internet connection; therefore, it was necessary to adapt the learning methodology. After that, more than 50% of the students said that they preferred a flipped classroom over traditional methodology. In addition, the quality of the course was not affected by using the internet (60%), and the methodology generates advantages in terms of learning (72%). These findings have several implications in both the design of different subjects in the engineering degree and the practice of different learning methods.

We investigate the role of morphodynamic changes in the flooding of a micro-tidal dissipative beach for both current and sea level rise scenarios. By considering beach morphodynamics and flood processes associated with highly energetic waves, the study allows one to evaluate threats to coastal zones. Coupling of SWAN and XBeach models is employed to propagate offshore wave conditions to the swash zone, estimating morphological changes and flooding associated with wave conditions during cold fronts and hurricanes that affected Cartagena de Indias (Colombia). The numerical models were calibrated from previous research in the study area. The results indicate that numerical modeling of flooding on microtidal dissipative beaches under extreme wave conditions should be approached by considering beach morphodynamics, because ignoring them can underestimate flooding by ∼ 15 %. Moreover, model results suggest that beach erosion and flooding are intensified by sea level rise, resulting in the most unfavorable condition when extreme events are contemporaneous with high tides. In this case, the increase in erosion and flooding is ∼ 69 % and ∼ 65 %, respectively, when compared with the present conditions of sea level.","We thank the Colombian Ministry of Sciences, Technology, and Innovation – Minciencias for partially funding the study.

Therefore, we aimed to evaluate the best techniques for the removal of pharmaceuticals from municipal and hospital wastewater. For this, a non-experimental, descriptive, qualitative-quantitative design was used, corresponding to a systematic review without meta-analysis. Based on established inclusion and exclusion criteria, 31 open-access articles were selected from the Scopus, ProQuest, EBSCOhost, and ScienceDirect databases. The results showed that high concentrations of analgesics such as naproxen (1.37 mg/L) and antibiotics such as norfloxacin (0.561 mg/L) are frequently found in wastewater and that techniques such as reverse osmosis, ozonation, and activated sludge have the best removal efficiency, achieving values of 99%. It was concluded that reverse osmosis is one of the most efficient techniques for eliminating ofloxacin, sulfamethoxazole, carbamazepine, and diclofenac from municipal wastewater, with removal rates ranging from 96 to 99.9%, while for hospital wastewater the activated sludge technique proved to be efficient, eliminating analgesics and antibiotics in the range of 41-99%.",Not applicable.,This research received no external funding.,International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health,,"Hu Cheng, Hongjie Sheng, Jianming Xue","Wastewater; Sewage; Diclofenac; Naproxen; Norfloxacin; Water Pollutants, Chemical; Carbamazepine; Hospitals; Ozone; Sulfamethoxazole; Anti-Bacterial Agents; Ofloxacin; Pharmaceutical Preparations; Waste Disposal, Fluid",2022-10-12,2022,2022-10-12,,19,20,13105,All OA; Gold,Article,"Rodríguez-Serin, Henry; Gamez-Jara, Auria; De La Cruz-Noriega, Magaly; Rojas-Flores, Segundo; Rodriguez-Yupanqui, Magda; Cardenas, Moises Gallozzo; Cruz-Monzon, José","Rodríguez-Serin, Henry (Escuela de Ingeniería Ambiental, Facultad de Ingeniería, Universidad Cesar Vallejo, Trujillo 13007, Peru); Gamez-Jara, Auria (Escuela de Ingeniería Ambiental, Facultad de Ingeniería, Universidad Cesar Vallejo, Trujillo 13007, Peru); De La Cruz-Noriega, Magaly (Vicerrectorado de Investigación, Universidad Autónoma del Perú, Lima 15842, Peru); Rojas-Flores, Segundo (Departamento de Ciencias, Universidad Privada del Norte, Trujillo 13007, Peru); Rodriguez-Yupanqui, Magda (Escuela de Ingeniería Ambiental, Facultad de Ingeniería, Universidad Cesar Vallejo, Trujillo 13007, Peru); Cardenas, Moises Gallozzo (Universidad Tecnológica del Perú, Trujillo 13011, Peru); Cruz-Monzon, José (Facultad de Ingeniería Química, Universidad Nacional de Trujillo, Av.

To improve reliability in rural areas, microgrids (MGs) are being integrated into conventional power systems. This study evaluates the effect on the reliability of rural distribution systems when MGs are introduced considering different penetration levels for renewable and nonrenewable distributed generation, and under rated power of energy storage. Here, we first formulate a reliability model for a rural distribution system with MGs. Based on this model, an interactive method using a sequential Monte Carlo simulation method is proposed and applied to calculate different conventional reliability indices. We show that this approach facilitates the selection of the parameters of the different systems constituting the MGs in order to comply with a predefined reliability objective. For instance, by introducing only photovoltaic distributed generation systems to the rural distribution systems under study, achieving the reliability objective is next to impossible. However, when correctly dimensioned-hybrid MGs are introduced, such an objective is successfully achieved. In the future, our model and the results provided herein could be combined with technical and economic studies to obtain an optimal solution that meets a certain reliability objective.",,The work of Jose L.

It proposes a periodization that spans from 1962 to 1998 and includes the discovery of the deposit, exploration, mine construction and the initial production phase. Theoretically, the phenomenon is interpreted through the concepts of commons and extractivism. In methodological terms, a review of press archives, ethnography and secondary sources form the basis for this qualitative research.

The work of public health policies is aimed at reducing its prevalence as well as its pharmaceutical cost. Physical activity (PA) programs are interventions with a high potential for effectiveness.
OBJECTIVES: To establish the relationships between physical activity and the prevalence of depression and antidepressant intake in the Spanish population.
DESIGN: We performed a correlational study that was based on data from the European Health Survey Spain 2020 with 20,287 participants, aged 18-84 years, living in Spain.
RESULTS: Dependency relationships were found between the prevalence of depression, and: the frequency of PA, the number of days of PA per week, and the number of days of muscle strengthening in the population, in both sexes, and in all age groups (p < 0.001). Dependency relationships were found between the three PA variables and the prevalence of taking antidepressants (p < 0.001). An elevated prevalence of depression and antidepressant taking were found in the inactive groups compared to those who performed PA (p < 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: There is an inverse relationship between physical activity and the probability of suffering from depression and the intake of antidepressants. Performing PA 3-4 days/week, including 1-2 days of strength work, could be the best proposal to reduce the prevalence of depression in the Spanish population.",This article has been made possible thanks to the project “Observatorio El Ejercicio Te Cuida” signed between the Fundación Jóvenes y Deporte de la Junta de Extremadura and the University of Extremadura.,"Proyecto 4IE + (0499_4IE_PLUS_4_E); Programa Interreg VA España-Portugal (POCTEP) 2014–2020: 0499_4IE_PLUS_4_E; Desarrollo del Observatorio El Ejercicio Te Cuida (02/03/2021–01/03/2023); The author Á.D.-Z.

United Nations Children's Emergency Fund (UNICEF) partnered with the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) to address this important gap by investing in an advance purchase commitment (APC) mechanism to accelerate the development and evaluation of Zika rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) for case detection and surveillance. This paper describes the performance evaluation of five Zika RDTs eligible for procurement.
Methods: A network of European Union-funded ZikaPLAN sites in Africa, Asia, Latin America with access to relevant serum specimens were selected to evaluate RDTs developed for the UNICEF APC mechanism. A standardised protocol and evaluation panels were developed and a call for specimens for the evaluation panels issued to different sites. Each site contributed specimens to the evaluation from their biobank. Data were collated, analysed and presented to the UNICEF Procurement Review Group for review.
Findings: Three RDTs met the criteria for UNICEF procurement of sensitivity and specificity of 85% against a refence standard. The sensitivity/specificity of the ChemBio anti-Zika Virus (ZIKV) immunoglobulin M (IgM) test was 86.4 %/86.7% and the ChemBio ZCD system for anti-ZIKV IgM was 79.0%/97.1%, anti-dengue virus (DENV) IgM 90.0%/89.2%, anti-Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) IgM 90.6%/97.2%. The sensitivity/specificity of the SD Biosensor anti-ZIKV IgM was 96.8 %/90.8%, anti-DENV IgM 71.8%/83.5%, the DENV nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) glycoprotein 90.0%/90.2%, anti- yellow fever virus (YFV) IgM 84.6%/92.4%, anti-CHIKV IgM 86.3%/97.5%.
Interpretation: Three RDTs fulfilled the performance thresholds set by WHO and were eligible for UNICEF procurement. These tests will improve the diagnosis of ZIKV and other arboviral infections as well as providing countries with better tools for surveillance and response to future epidemics.

One of these alternatives is green hydrogen. In this context, Chile stands out for the exceptional climate that makes it a country with a lot of renewable resources. Such availability of resources gives the nation clear advantages for hydrogen production, strong gusts of wind throughout the country, the most increased solar radiation in the world, lower cost of production of electrical supplies, among others. Due to this, the nation would be between the lowest estimated cost for hydrogen production, i.e., 1.5 USD/kg H2 approximately, scenario that would place it as one of the cheapest green hydrogen producer in the world.",MS acknowledges the infrastructure and support of Doctorado en Ingeniería de Procesos de Minerales of the Universidad de Antofagasta.,,Frontiers in Environmental Science,,,,2022-07-12,2022,2022-07-12,,10,,890104,All OA; Gold,Article,"Acosta, Kevin; Salazar, Iván; Saldaña, Manuel; Ramos, Jahir; Navarra, Alessandro; Toro, Norman","Acosta, Kevin (Faculty of Engineering and Architecture, Universidad Arturo Prat, Iquique, Chile); Salazar, Iván (Departamento de Ingeniería Civil, Universidad Católica del Norte, Antofagasta, Chile); Saldaña, Manuel (Faculty of Engineering and Architecture, Universidad Arturo Prat, Iquique, Chile; Departamento de Ingeniería Química y Procesos de Minerales, Facultad de Ingeniería, Universidad de Antofagasta, Antofagasta, Chile); Ramos, Jahir (Departamento de Ingeniería Química y Procesos de Minerales, Facultad de Ingeniería, Universidad de Antofagasta, Antofagasta, Chile); Navarra, Alessandro (Department of Mining and Materials Engineering, McGill University, Montreal, QC, Canada); Toro, Norman (Faculty of Engineering and Architecture, Universidad Arturo Prat, Iquique, Chile)","Toro, Norman (Arturo Prat University)","Acosta, Kevin (Arturo Prat University); Salazar, Iván (Catholic University of the North); Saldaña, Manuel (Arturo Prat University; University of Antofagasta); Ramos, Jahir (University of Antofagasta); Navarra, Alessandro (McGill University); Toro, Norman (Arturo Prat University)",9,8,,2.95,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fenvs.2022.890104/pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1149407623,41 Environmental Sciences; 4104 Environmental Management; 4105 Pollution and Contamination,13 Climate Action; 7 Affordable and Clean Energy

This study evaluated the direct effects of consumer xenoncentrism on product attitude and purchase intention of imported products and analyzed the moderating impact of formal education on xenocentric consumer behavior considering groups with higher and low formal education levels. Structural equation modeling technique and multigroup analysis based on samples collected from Chilean consumers were used to analyze the research model. There were 295 effective online questionnaires (42.4% females and 57.6% males). This study’s findings suggest that consumer xenocentric effects are directly related to imported products’ product attitude (G: R2 = 0.254; L: R2 = 0.121; H: R2 = 0.327) and purchase intention (G: R2 = 0.454; L: R2 = 0.469; H: R2 = 0.365). In addition, findings exhibit that xenocentric consumer behaviors are more significant when associated with formal educational level (G: 0.575; L: 0.640; H: 0.443). Therefore, as education levels increase, the xenocentric effect also increases. An important application of these findings is that education in emerging countries and developing economies should strengthen local production valorization and promote marketing strategies that foster the sustainable consumption of products manufactured in their own countries.",,This research received no external funding.,Journal of Risk and Financial Management,,,,2022-04-06,2022,2022-04-06,,15,4,166,All OA; Gold,Article,"Camacho, Luis J.; Ramírez-Correa, Patricio; Salazar-Concha, Cristian","Camacho, Luis J.

It contains metals that are critical for a sustainable development of modern society. Due to a shortage of global resources of many metals, efficient large-scale processing of RM has been receiving increasing attention from both researchers and industry. This study investigated the solubilization of metals from RM, together with RM dealkalization, via sulfur (S0) oxidation catalyzed by the moderately thermophilic bacterium Sulfobacillus thermosulfidooxidans. Optimization of the bioleaching process was conducted in shake flasks and 5-L bioreactors, with varying S0:RM mass ratios and aeration rates. The ICP analysis was used to monitor the concentrations of dissolved elements from RM, and solid residues were analyzed for surface morphology, phase composition, and Na distribution using the SEM, XRD, and STXM techniques, respectively. The results show that highest metal recoveries (89% of Al, 84% of Ce, and 91% of Y) were achieved with the S0:RM mass ratio of 2:1 and aeration rate of 1 L/min. Additionally, effective dealkalization of RM was achieved under the above conditions, based on the high rates (>95%) of Na, K, and Ca dissolution. This study proves the feasibility of using bacterially catalyzed S0 oxidation to simultaneously dealkalize RM and efficiently extract valuable metals from the amassing industrial waste.","The authors would like to thank Zi-jian Xu, Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility, Shanghai Institute of Applied Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, for technical assistance and helpful discussions.",This work was supported by the Funds for International Cooperation and Exchange of the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 51861135305) and the Open Fund of Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility (2022-SSRF-PT-021591).,Frontiers in Microbiology,,,,2022-08-29,2022,2022-08-29,,13,,973568,All OA; Gold,Article,"Zhang, Duo-rui; Chen, Hong-rui; Xia, Jin-lan; Nie, Zhen-yuan; Zhang, Rui-Yong; Pakostova, Eva","Zhang, Duo-rui (School of Minerals Processing and Bioengineering, Central South University, Changsha, China; Key Lab of Biometallurgy of Ministry of Education of China, Central South University, Changsha, China); Chen, Hong-rui (School of Minerals Processing and Bioengineering, Central South University, Changsha, China; Key Lab of Biometallurgy of Ministry of Education of China, Central South University, Changsha, China); Xia, Jin-lan (School of Minerals Processing and Bioengineering, Central South University, Changsha, China; Key Lab of Biometallurgy of Ministry of Education of China, Central South University, Changsha, China); Nie, Zhen-yuan (School of Minerals Processing and Bioengineering, Central South University, Changsha, China; Key Lab of Biometallurgy of Ministry of Education of China, Central South University, Changsha, China); Zhang, Rui-Yong (School of Minerals Processing and Bioengineering, Central South University, Changsha, China; Key Lab of Biometallurgy of Ministry of Education of China, Central South University, Changsha, China; Key Laboratory of Marine Environmental Corrosion and Bio-fouling, Institute of Oceanology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Qingdao, China; Open Studio for Marine Corrosion and Protection, Pilot National Laboratory for Marine Science and Technology (Qingdao), Qingdao, China); Pakostova, Eva (Centre for Sport, Exercise and Life Sciences, Coventry University, Coventry, United Kingdom)","Xia, Jin-lan (Central South University; Central South University)","Zhang, Duo-rui (Central South University; Central South University); Chen, Hong-rui (Central South University; Central South University); Xia, Jin-lan (Central South University; Central South University); Nie, Zhen-yuan (Central South University; Central South University); Zhang, Rui-Yong (Central South University; Central South University; Institute of Oceanology; Qingdao National Laboratory for Marine Science and Technology); Pakostova, Eva (Coventry University)",8,8,0.8,2.9,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2022.973568/pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1150569566,31 Biological Sciences; 3107 Microbiology; 32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3207 Medical Microbiology,12 Responsible Consumption and Production

The tepary bean genotype PI 319443 displays high resistance to Xap, and the common bean genotypes HR45 and Bilu display high resistance and susceptibility to Xap, respectively. To identify candidate genes related to Xap resistance, transcriptomic analysis was performed to compare gene expression levels with Xap inoculation at 0, 24, and 48 h post inoculation (hpi) among the three genotypes. A total of 1,146,009,876 high-quality clean reads were obtained. Differentially expressed gene (DEG) analysis showed that 1,688 DEGs responded to pathogen infection in the three genotypes. Weighted gene coexpression network analysis (WGCNA) was also performed to identify three modules highly correlated with Xap resistance, in which 334 DEGs were likely involved in Xap resistance. By combining differential expression analysis and WGCNA, 139 DEGs were identified as core resistance-responsive genes, including 18 genes encoding resistance (R) proteins, 19 genes belonging to transcription factor families, 63 genes encoding proteins with oxidoreductase activity, and 33 plant hormone signal transduction-related genes, which play important roles in the resistance to pathogen infection.

The model heavy metal-resistant bacterium Cupriavidus metallidurans CH34 possesses cadmium and mercury resistance, as well as genes related to the catabolism of hazardous BTEX aromatic hydrocarbons. The aims of this study were to analyze the aromatic catabolic potential of C. metallidurans CH34 and to determine the functionality of the predicted benzene catabolic pathway and the influence of cadmium and mercury on benzene degradation. Three chromosome-encoded bacterial multicomponent monooxygenases (BMMs) are involved in benzene catabolic pathways. Growth assessment, intermediates identification, and gene expression analysis indicate the functionality of the benzene catabolic pathway. Strain CH34 degraded benzene via phenol and 2-hydroxymuconic semialdehyde. Transcriptional analyses revealed a transition from the expression of catechol 2,3-dioxygenase (tomB) in the early exponential phase to catechol 1,2-dioxygenase (catA1 and catA2) in the late exponential phase. The minimum inhibitory concentration to Hg (II) and Cd (II) was significantly lower in the presence of benzene, demonstrating the effect of co-contamination on bacterial growth. Notably, this study showed that C. metallidurans CH34 degraded benzene in the presence of Hg (II) or Cd (II).","The authors thank Danilo Pérez-Pantoja and Raúl Donoso for providing strain P. putida F1, vanillin, and L-phenylalanine.

Abstract: This article´s objective is to identify the obstacles faced by LGBT people in the exercise of parenting. We used the biographical method, from an intersectional approach, in a dialogical and recursive investigative process. Nine interviews were conducted with key informants from academia, psychotherapy, politics, and activism. We found obstacles at symbolic, institutional, and factual levels, which (re)produced and influence each other. We conclude obstacles related to the exercise of motherhood/fatherhood from LGBT people generates emotional self-limitations associated with the (im)possibility of thinking themselves as a potential mother/father based on the hostile social context they face.

204,pub.1147228271,10.3390/min12040487,,,A Sustainable Bioleaching of a Low-Grade Chalcopyrite Ore,"This paper reports on a study of column bioleaching of a low-grade chalcopyrite ore that is currently dump-leached under natural biological conditions without any control over microbial populations. The experimental methodology was focused on the effect of managing the bacterial populations in a raffinate solution sourced from a dump-leach operation. This study presents results from columns of two heights (0.45 and 1.0 m). We demonstrated that intermittent irrigation enhanced the chalcopyrite dissolution during column leaching, but excessively long rest periods negatively affected the chemical and bacterial activity due to the shortage of oxidizing agents and/or nutrients for microorganisms. The recovery of low-grade chalcopyrite ore was enhanced by increasing the microbial cell density. The addition of 1.5 × 108 cells/mL to the 0.45 m column and 5.0 × 107 cells/mL to the 1 m column resulted in increased extraction, with the copper dissolution increasing from 32% to 44% in the 0.45 m column and from 30% to 40% in the 1.0 m column over 70 days of leaching. Under these conditions, the pH level remained constant at ~1.8, and the redox potential was around 840 mV vs. the SHE throughout the experiment. These results provided useful insights for evaluating a sustainable controlled dump-based technology for mineral bioprocessing.",,This research received no external funding.,Minerals,,,,2022-04-16,2022,2022-04-16,,12,4,487,All OA; Gold,Article,"Velásquez-Yévenes, Lilian; Malverde, Sebastián; Quezada, Víctor","Velásquez-Yévenes, Lilian (Facultad de Ingeniería, Universidad de Santiago, Av.

Individuals with ULEDs require assistive robots to fulfill all their activities of daily living (ADLs). Thus, this research presents an objective function for base placement optimization of assistive robots to increase the workspace required to fulfill ADLs (workspace coverage). The workspace coverage was determined using the xArm 6 robot and experimenting with different ADLs. Also, an object collision algorithm is implemented to avoid collisions between the robot and the user within the workspace. Moreover, the algorithm determines the existence of singularities within the workspace by computing the manipulability index. However, since the manipulability index computation depends on the Jacobian matrix’s eigenvalues yielding incongruences in the units, we divided the Jacobian matrix into two parts; one for the angular and another for the linear velocity. Finally, using the objective function with a genetic algorithm (GA), the optimal base placement for the robot is obtained and validated experimentally.","The contents of this research do not necessarily represent the policy of NIDILRR, ACL, or HHS, and they should not assume endorsement by the Federal Government.","This work was supported in part by the National Institute on Disability, Independent Living, and Rehabilitation Research (NIDILRR) under Grant 90DPGE0018-01-00; and in part by the NIDILRR Center within the Administration for Community Living (ACL), Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).",IEEE Access,,,,2022-01-01,2022,2022-12-23,2022-01-01,10,,134536-134548,All OA; Gold,Article,"De, Javier Dario Sanjuan; Sunny, Samiul Haque; Montenegro, Elias Jose Muñoz; Ahmed, Helal Uddin; Rahman, Mohammad H.","De, Javier Dario Sanjuan (Department of Mechanical Engineering, University of Wisconsin–Milwaukee, Milwaukee, WI, 53212, USA; Department of Mechanical Engineering, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, 081007, Colombia); Sunny, Samiul Haque (Department of Computer Science, University of Wisconsin–Milwaukee, Milwaukee, WI, 53212, USA); Montenegro, Elias Jose Muñoz (Department of Mechanical Engineering, University of Wisconsin–Milwaukee, Milwaukee, WI, 53212, USA); Ahmed, Helal Uddin (Biorobotics Laboratory, University of Wisconsin–Milwaukee, Milwaukee, WI, 53212, USA); Rahman, Mohammad H.

This study contributes theoretical-practical elements for the training of teachers in the Basic Education with emphasis in Natural Sciences and Environmental Education program at the University of Antioquia, based on the singularities of science teaching in rural contexts. The methodological framework is based on a qualitative-interpretative paradigm with an instrumental case study approach, which seeks to identify, through narrative writings and semi-structured interviews, the experiences of three beginning rural schoolteachers regarding the knowledge they have acquired from their professional training. The role of initial training with respect to teaching in multigrade schools, project-based teaching, and the problematization of science education in rural areas were analyzed. It is concluded that teacher training programs should provide spaces for the recognition of rural contexts and multigrade classrooms and strengthen permanent contact with graduates to counteract the conditions of isolation and loneliness experienced by beginning teachers as they make their professional knowledge more dynamic in response to the needs of rurality.",,,Praxis & Saber,,,,2022-09-29,2022,2022-09-29,,13,34,e14162-e14162,All OA; Gold,Article,"González, Víctor; Quiceno, Yesenia; Correa, Daniela; Vélez, Yeraldin; Montoya, Luz","González, Víctor (Secretaria de Educación de Antioquia); Quiceno, Yesenia (Universidad de Antioquia); Correa, Daniela (Deutsche Schule Medellín); Vélez, Yeraldin (Universidad Católica del Norte); Montoya, Luz (Universidad de Antioquia)",,"González, Víctor (Secretaria de Educación de Antioquia); Quiceno, Yesenia (University of Antioquia); Correa, Daniela (Deutsche Schule Medellín); Vélez, Yeraldin (Catholic University of the North); Montoya, Luz (University of Antioquia)",2,2,,2.86,https://revistas.uptc.edu.co/index.php/praxis_saber/article/download/14162/12281,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1155695230,39 Education; 3901 Curriculum and Pedagogy; 3903 Education Systems,4 Quality Education

There is no disease control program and no official therapeutic protocol. This situation contributes to an unknown disease prevalence and unmet needs of people disabled by this disease who seek access to treatment. This review provides an update on the subject with an emphasis on therapeutic advances in humans. All relevant studies that addressed epidemiology, diagnosis, or therapeutics of lobomycosis were considered. Seventy-one articles published between 1931 and 2021 were included for a narrative literature review on the epidemiology and quest for a cure. An effective therapy for lobomycosis has been found following decades of research led by the State Dermatology Program of Acre in the Amazon rainforest, where the largest number of cases occur. This discovery opened new avenues for future studies. The main recommendations here, addressed to the Brazilian Ministry of Health, are for lobomycosis to become a reportable disease to ensure that disease prevalence is measured, and that it be prioritized such that affected individuals may access treatment free-of-charge.",,This work was supported by Brazilian National Council for Scientific and Technological Development [CNPq grant 307432/2019-0 to GZL].,Journal of Fungi,,"Alessandro C.

During its infective cycle, S. Typhimurium is phagocytized by macrophages and proliferates inside a Salmonella-containing vacuole where Salmonella is exposed and survives oxidative stress induced by H2O2 through modulation of gene expression. After exposure of Salmonella to H2O2, the expression of the porin-encoding gene ompX increases, as previously shown by microarray analysis. Expression of ompX mRNA is regulated at a post-transcriptional level by MicA and CyaR sRNAs in aerobiosis. In addition, sequence analysis predicts a site for OxyS sRNA in ompX mRNA.ResultsIn this work we sought to evaluate the transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation of ompX under H2O2 stress. We demonstrate that ompX expression is induced at the transcriptional level in S. Typhimurium under such conditions. Unexpectedly, an increase in ompX gene transcript and promoter activity after challenges with H2O2 does not translate into increased protein levels in the wild-type strain, suggesting that ompX mRNA is also regulated at a post-transcriptional level, at least under oxidative stress. In silico gene sequence analysis predicted that sRNAs CyaR, MicA, and OxyS could regulate ompX mRNA levels. Using rifampicin to inhibit mRNA expression, we show that the sRNAs (MicA, CyaR and OxyS) and the sRNA:mRNA chaperone Hfq positively modulate ompX mRNA levels under H2O2-induced stress in Salmonella during the exponential growth phase in Lennox broth.ConclusionsOur results demonstrate that ompX mRNA is regulated in response to H2O2 by the sRNAs CyaR, MicA and OxyS is Salmonella Typhimurium.",We would like to thank Miguel Valvano and Linda Kenney for special contributions during manuscript revision.

A qualitative research method was employed in this study that used semi-structured interviews to collect data. Participants were sourced from three key stakeholder groups: (1) the SAPS (Headquarters), (2) Sunnyside Community Service Centre, and (3) Directorate for Priority Crime Investigation (DPCI) officials with expertise related to human trafficking. This sample comprised 15 participants and a purposive sampling procedure was adopted. The study found that there are various methods of identifying human trafficking identified by the SAPS in the City of Tshwane Metropolitan Municipality (CTMM). Furthermore, the findings highlighted that human trafficking has a national dimension despite that trafficking could occur within the same province or policing area. However, it remains a concern that policing methods to reduce the scourge are not effectively implemented hence an increased rate of human trafficking not only in the CTMM policing area but in many parts of South Africa. It was also found that in the process of identifying human trafficking activities, the SAPS is often faced with various challenges that may be linked to ineffective implementation of methods of identifying human trafficking activities",,,International Journal of Research In Business and Social Science,,,,2022-12-25,2022,2022-12-25,,11,9,250-264,All OA; Gold,Article,"Chauke, Rescar; Motlalekgosi, Puleng; Mofokeng, Jacob","Chauke, Rescar (); Motlalekgosi, Puleng (Tshwane University of Technology); Mofokeng, Jacob ()",,"Chauke, Rescar (); Motlalekgosi, Puleng (Tshwane University of Technology); Mofokeng, Jacob ()",2,2,,2.81,https://www.ssbfnet.com/ojs/index.php/ijrbs/article/download/2203/1579,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1153975570,44 Human Society; 4402 Criminology,"16 Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions; 8 Decent Work and Economic Growth"

OBJECTIVE: The primary objective was to determine the health care attributes respondents at 2 pediatric institutions rate as important when prioritizing machine learning model implementation. The secondary objective was to describe their perspectives on implementation using a qualitative approach.
METHODS: In this mixed methods study, we distributed a survey to health system leaders, physicians, and data scientists at 2 pediatric institutions. We asked respondents to rank the following 5 attributes in terms of implementation usefulness: the clinical problem was common, the clinical problem caused substantial morbidity and mortality, risk stratification led to different actions that could reasonably improve patient outcomes, reducing physician workload, and saving money. Important attributes were those ranked as first or second most important. Individual qualitative interviews were conducted with a subsample of respondents.
RESULTS: Among 613 eligible respondents, 275 (44.9%) responded. Qualitative interviews were conducted with 17 respondents. The most common important attributes were risk stratification leading to different actions (205/275, 74.5%) and clinical problem causing substantial morbidity or mortality (177/275, 64.4%). The attributes considered least important were reducing physician workload and saving money. Qualitative interviews consistently prioritized implementations that improved patient outcomes.
CONCLUSIONS: Respondents prioritized machine learning model implementation where risk stratification would lead to different actions and clinical problems that caused substantial morbidity and mortality. Implementations that improved patient outcomes were prioritized. These results can help provide a framework for machine learning model implementation.",LS is supported by the Canada Research Chair in Pediatric Oncology,,JMIR Medical Informatics,,,,2022-11-17,2022,2022-11-17,,10,11,e40039,All OA; Gold,Article,"Alexander, Natasha; Aftandilian, Catherine; Guo, Lin Lawrence; Plenert, Erin; Posada, Jose; Fries, Jason; Fleming, Scott; Johnson, Alistair; Shah, Nigam; Sung, Lillian","Alexander, Natasha (Division of Haematology/Oncology, The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, ON, Canada); Aftandilian, Catherine (Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, Stanford University, Palo Alto, CA, United States); Guo, Lin Lawrence (Program in Child Health Evaluative Sciences, Peter Gilgan Centre for Research and Learning, Toronto, ON, Canada); Plenert, Erin (Program in Child Health Evaluative Sciences, Peter Gilgan Centre for Research and Learning, Toronto, ON, Canada); Posada, Jose (Department of Systems Engineering and Computing, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); Fries, Jason (Stanford Center for Biomedical Informatics Research, Department of Biomedical Data Science, Stanford University, Palo Alto, CA, United States); Fleming, Scott (Stanford Center for Biomedical Informatics Research, Department of Biomedical Data Science, Stanford University, Palo Alto, CA, United States); Johnson, Alistair (Program in Child Health Evaluative Sciences, Peter Gilgan Centre for Research and Learning, Toronto, ON, Canada); Shah, Nigam (Stanford Center for Biomedical Informatics Research, Department of Biomedical Data Science, Stanford University, Palo Alto, CA, United States); Sung, Lillian (Division of Haematology/Oncology, The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, ON, Canada; Program in Child Health Evaluative Sciences, Peter Gilgan Centre for Research and Learning, Toronto, ON, Canada)","Sung, Lillian (Hospital for Sick Children; Program in Child Health Evaluative Sciences, Peter Gilgan Centre for Research and Learning, Toronto, ON, Canada)","Alexander, Natasha (Hospital for Sick Children); Aftandilian, Catherine (Stanford University); Guo, Lin Lawrence (Program in Child Health Evaluative Sciences, Peter Gilgan Centre for Research and Learning, Toronto, ON, Canada); Plenert, Erin (Program in Child Health Evaluative Sciences, Peter Gilgan Centre for Research and Learning, Toronto, ON, Canada); Posada, Jose (Universidad del Norte); Fries, Jason (Stanford University); Fleming, Scott (Stanford University); Johnson, Alistair (Program in Child Health Evaluative Sciences, Peter Gilgan Centre for Research and Learning, Toronto, ON, Canada); Shah, Nigam (Stanford University); Sung, Lillian (Hospital for Sick Children; Program in Child Health Evaluative Sciences, Peter Gilgan Centre for Research and Learning, Toronto, ON, Canada)",4,4,0.37,2.8,https://medinform.jmir.org/2022/11/e40039/PDF,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1152820997,42 Health Sciences; 4203 Health Services and Systems,3 Good Health and Well Being

However, rather few studies have evaluated geocoding quality, with most of them being performed in the US and Europe. This article aims to compare the quality of three automatic online geocoding tools against a reference method. A subsample of 300 handwritten addresses from hospital records was geocoded using Bing, Google Earth, and Google Maps. Match rates were higher (> 80%) for Google Maps and Google Earth compared with Bing. However, the accuracy of the addresses was better for Bing with a larger proportion (> 70%) of addresses with positional errors below 20m. Generally, performance did not vary for each method for different socioeconomic status. Overall, the methods showed an acceptable, but heterogeneous performance, which may be a warning against the use of automatic methods without assessing quality in other municipalities, particularly in Chile and Latin America.","Impact of Wood Burning Air Pollution on Preeclampsia and other Pregnancy Outcomes in Temuco, Chile (DPI20140093) was garanted by CONICYT and Research Councils UK.

Material and methods. Data Sources: The population consists of students from the first to the fifth academic year (Course) (N = 312, n = 253, 81.08% of the population). Selection of  studies: Exploratory  and  cross-sectional  study.Data  extraction: The  authors  collected  the information between January and February 2018. Participants answered the Jefferson Medical Scale of Empathy, the Spanish version for medical students (S version), validated and adapted for nursing students in Colombia.Results. Synthesis of the data: Cronbach’s alpha was satisfactory (not typifed = 0.891 and typified = 0.886), from which it is inferred that the data has internal reliability. The inter-class correlation coefficient was 0.891; CI [0.87, 0.909] (F = 9.15, p = 0.005): confirms the good reliability. The authors observed that in empathy, this coefficient was highly signifi-cant in all three factors, with the eta-square value satisfactory and a high power observed. The significance level used was α ≤ 0.05 and β <0.20.Conclusions: The manifestation of the levels of empathy observed in this study agrees with the  concept  of  empathic  erosion,  especially  when  analyzing  empathic  behavior  in  the  male  gender. The empathy levels in the students examined are relatively low, and authors conclude that there is considerable potential for growth of empathy and that of its components.

Current genomic resources on M. depressus are rare, limiting the understanding of its adaptation to terrestrial life in species that evolved from marine ancestors. This study reports the complete mitochondrial genome of M. depressus assembled using Sanger sequencing. The AT-rich mitochondrial genome of M. depressus is 15,765 bp in length and comprises 13 protein-coding genes (PCGs), 2 ribosomal RNA genes, and 22 transfer RNA genes. A single 691 bp-long intergenic space is assumed to be the control region (CR) or D-loop. A set of selective pressure analyses indicate that the entirety of the PCGs experience purifying selection. Cox1, cox2, nad5, cox3, and atp6 experience strong purifying selection, and atp8 experiences weak purifying selection compared to the rest of the PCGs. The secondary structures of most tRNA genes exhibit a standard 'cloverleaf' structure, with the exception of trnS1, which lacks the dihydroxyuridine (DHU) arm but not the loop, the trnH gene, which lacks the thymine pseudouracil cytosine (T) loop but not the arm, and trnM, which exhibits an overly developed T loop. A maximum likelihood phylogenetic analysis based on all PCGs indicated that M. depressus is more closely related to the genera Clistocoeloma, Nanosesarma, and Parasesarma than to Chiromantes, Geosesarma, and Orisarma. This study contributes to deciphering the phylogenetic relationships within the family Sesarmidae and represents a new genomic resource for this iconic crab species.",J.A.B. thanks Vincent P.

This work corresponds to a basic type of study with a quantitative approach, non-experimental design and cross-sectional descriptive level. From the operational field, the study variable was the perception of academic plagiarism, and its dimensions were knowledge, motivations and practices. The population consisted of 2145 students, and intentional non-probabilistic sampling was carried out, resulting in a sample of 155 students in the 8th and 9th cycles of this public university. For data collection, a questionnaire was designed with 35 questions referring to the variable and its dimensions, with each question having five response options according to a Likert-type scale which were answered virtually by the students. The results from the descriptive point of view reflect that 56.1% of the students perceived plagiarism in a negative way and 43.9% perceived it in an irrelevant way. In the inferential field, the results did not show significant statistical differences (p > 0.05).

Concurrence with the inflammatory neuropathy Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) is observed in 1:4,000 ZIKV cases. Whether the neurologic symptoms of ZIKV infection are immune mediated is unclear. We used rodent and human live cellular models to screen for anti-peripheral nerve reactive IgG and IgM autoantibodies in the sera of patients with ZIKV with and without GBS.
METHODS: In this study, 52 patients with ZIKV-GBS were compared with 134 ZIKV-infected patients without GBS and 91 non-ZIKV controls. Positive sera were taken forward for target identification by immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry, and candidate antigens were validated by ELISA and cell-based assays. Autoantibody reactions against glycolipid antigens were also screened on an array.
RESULTS: Overall, IgG antibody reactivities to rat Schwann cells (SCs) (6.5%) and myelinated cocultures (9.6%) were significantly higher, albeit infrequent, in the ZIKV-GBS group compared with all controls. IgM antibody immunoreactivity to dorsal root ganglia neurones (32.3%) and SCs (19.4%) was more frequently observed in the ZIKV-GBS group compared with other controls, whereas IgM reactivity to cocultures was as common in ZIKV and non-ZIKV sera. Strong axonal-binding ZIKV-GBS serum IgG antibodies from 1 patient were confirmed to react with neurofascin 155 and 186. Serum from a ZIKV-infected patient without GBS displayed strong myelin-binding and putative antilipid antigen reaction characteristics. There was, however, no significant association of ZIKV-GBS with any known antiglycolipid antibodies.
DISCUSSION: Autoantibody responses in ZIKV-GBS target heterogeneous peripheral nerve antigens suggesting heterogeneity of the humoral immune response despite a common prodromal infection.","The authors thank Professors Peter Brophy and Sarosh Irani for kindly providing the anti-periaxin antibody and healthy human control sera, respectively.

This study aims to assess the incidence of life-threatening arrhythmias in patients with Takotsubo cardiomyopathy and evaluate the outcomes of patients with life-threatening arrhythmias (LTAs) in Takotsubo cardiomyopathy compared with those without LTA.
METHODS: We comprehensively searched the PubMed, Google Scholar, and Embase databases from inception to February 2021. The primary aim of the study was to determine the incidence of LTAs in TC patients. Other outcomes of interest were the odds of in-hospital, long-term mortality, and cardiogenic shock (CS) in TC patients with LTAs versus those without LTAs. For all statistical analyses, ReviewManager and MedCalc were used.
RESULTS: Eighteen studies were included in this study involving 55,557 participants (2,185 with LTAs and 53,372 without LTAs). The pooled incidence of LTAs in the patients of TC was found to be 6.29% (CI: 4.70-8.08%; I2 = 94.67%). There was a statistically significant increased risk of in-hospital mortality (OR = 4.74; CI: 2.24-10.04; I2 = 77%, p < 0.0001) and cardiogenic shock (OR = 5.60; CI: 3.51-8.95; I2 = 0%, p < 0.00001) in the LTA group versus the non-LTA group. LTA was not associated with long-term mortality (OR = 2.23; CI: 0.94-5.28; I2 = 53%, p = 0.07).
CONCLUSION: The pooled incidence of life-threatening arrhythmias in the patients of TC was found to be 6.29%. In the group of TC patients with LTAs, the odds of in-hospital mortality and CS, was higher than in the TC patients without LTAs.",None.,No funding sources to declare.,Indian Heart Journal,,,"Arrhythmias, Cardiac; Hospital Mortality; Humans; Incidence; Shock, Cardiogenic; Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy",2022-02-02,2022,2022-02-02,2022-03,74,2,110-119,All OA; Gold,Article,"Rathore, Sawai Singh; Iqbal, Kinza; Shafqat, Shameel; Tariq, Eleze; Tousif, Sohaib; UlHaq, Zain Ghufran; Fernández-Sánchez, David; Hernández-Woodbine, María José; Granados-Mendoza, Sofia Carolina; Lacouture-Cárdenas, Natalia Andrea; Avendaño-Capriles, Camilo Andrés; Maheshwari, Chanchal; Iqbal, Aimen; Mahalwar, Gauranga; Shariff, Mariam; Kumar, Ashish","Rathore, Sawai Singh (Department of Internal Medicine, Dr. Sampurnanand Medical College, Jodhpur, Rajasthan, India); Iqbal, Kinza (Department of Internal Medicine, Dow Medical College, Dow University of Health Sciences, Karachi, Pakistan); Shafqat, Shameel (Department of Internal Medicine, Aga Khan University, Karachi, Pakistan); Tariq, Eleze (Department of Internal Medicine, Aga Khan University, Karachi, Pakistan); Tousif, Sohaib (Department of Internal Medicine, Ziauddin University, Karachi, Pakistan); UlHaq, Zain Ghufran (Department of Internal Medicine, Ziauddin University, Karachi, Pakistan); Fernández-Sánchez, David (Department of Internal Medicine, Universidad Del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); Hernández-Woodbine, María José (Department of Internal Medicine, Universidad Del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); Granados-Mendoza, Sofia Carolina (Department of Internal Medicine, Universidad Del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); Lacouture-Cárdenas, Natalia Andrea (Department of Internal Medicine, Universidad Del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); Avendaño-Capriles, Camilo Andrés (Department of Internal Medicine, Universidad Del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); Maheshwari, Chanchal (Department of Internal Medicine, Karachi Medical College and Hospital, Karachi, Pakistan); Iqbal, Aimen (Bahria University Medical and Dental College, Karachi, Pakistan); Mahalwar, Gauranga (Department of Internal Medicine, Cleveland Clinic Akron General, Akron, OH, USA); Shariff, Mariam (Department of Surgery, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA); Kumar, Ashish (Department of Internal Medicine, Cleveland Clinic Akron General, Akron, OH, USA; Section of Cardiovascular Research, Heart, Vascular and Thoracic Department, Cleveland Clinic Akron General, Akron, OH, USA)","Kumar, Ashish (Cleveland Clinic; Cleveland Clinic)","Rathore, Sawai Singh (Department of Internal Medicine, Dr. Sampurnanand Medical College, Jodhpur, Rajasthan, India); Iqbal, Kinza (Dow University of Health Sciences); Shafqat, Shameel (Aga Khan University); Tariq, Eleze (Aga Khan University); Tousif, Sohaib (Ziauddin University); UlHaq, Zain Ghufran (Ziauddin University); Fernández-Sánchez, David (Universidad del Norte); Hernández-Woodbine, María José (Universidad del Norte); Granados-Mendoza, Sofia Carolina (Universidad del Norte); Lacouture-Cárdenas, Natalia Andrea (Universidad del Norte); Avendaño-Capriles, Camilo Andrés (Universidad del Norte); Maheshwari, Chanchal (Department of Internal Medicine, Karachi Medical College and Hospital, Karachi, Pakistan); Iqbal, Aimen (Bahria University); Mahalwar, Gauranga (Cleveland Clinic); Shariff, Mariam (Mayo Clinic); Kumar, Ashish (Cleveland Clinic; Cleveland Clinic)",4,3,0.94,2.78,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ihj.2022.01.005,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1145197559,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3202 Clinical Sciences,3 Good Health and Well Being

The factors affecting patients with early death remain poorly defined. We aimed to study the demographic and clinicopathologic pattern and to develop and validate a prediction model for PHEO/PGL patients with early death.
Methods: Data of 800 participants were collected from the Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) database as a construction cohort, while data of 340 participants were selected as a validation cohort. Risk factors considered included the year of diagnosis, age at diagnosis, gender, marital status, race, insurance status, tumor type, primary location, laterality, the presence of distant metastasis. Univariate and multivariate logistic regressions were performed to determine the risk factors. R software was used to generate the nomogram. Calibration ability, discrimination ability, and decision curve analysis were analyzed in both construction and validation cohorts.
Results: PHEO and PGL patients accounted for 54.3% (N=434) and 45.7% (N=366), respectively. More than half of tumors (N=401, 50.1%) occurred in the adrenal gland, while 16.9% (N=135) were in aortic/carotid bodies. For the entire cohort, the median overall survival (OS) was 116.0 (95% CI: 101.5-130.5) months. The multivariate analysis revealed that older age (versus age younger than 31; age between 31 and 60: OR=2.03, 95% CI: 1.03-4.03, P=0.042; age older than 60: OR=5.46, 95% CI: 2.68-11.12, P<0.001), female gender (versus male gender; OR=0.59, 95% CI: 0.41-0.87, P=0.007), tumor located in aortic/carotid bodies (versus tumor located in adrenal gland; OR=0.49, 95% CI: 0.27-0.87, P=0.015) and the presence of distant metastasis (versus without distant metastasis; OR=4.80, 95% CI: 3.18-7.23, P<0.001) were independent risk factors of early death. The predictive nomogram included variables: age at diagnosis, gender, primary tumor location, and distant metastasis. The model had satisfactory discrimination and calibration performance: Harrell's C statistics of the prediction model were 0.733 in the construction cohort and 0.716 in the validation cohort. The calibration analysis showed acceptable coherence between predicted probabilities and observed probabilities.
Conclusions: We developed and validated a predictive nomogram utilizing data from the SEER database with satisfactory discrimination and calibration capability which can be used for early death prediction for PHEO/PGL patients.",,The present study was sponsored by Natural Science Foundation of China (82011530050).,Frontiers in Oncology,,,,2022-02-25,2022,2022-02-25,,12,,770958,All OA; Gold,Article,"Li, Huiyang; Abbas, Kirellos Said; Abdelazeem, Basel; Xu, Yao; Lin, Yile; Wu, Haixiao; Chekhonin, Vladimir P.; Peltzer, Karl; Zhang, Chao","Li, Huiyang (Department of Obstetrics & Gynecology, Tianjin Medical University General Hospital, Tianjin, China; Tianjin Key Laboratory of Female Reproductive Health and Eugenics, Tianjin, China; The Sino-Russian Joint Research Center for Bone Metastasis in Malignant Tumor, Tianjin, China); Abbas, Kirellos Said (The Sino-Russian Joint Research Center for Bone Metastasis in Malignant Tumor, Tianjin, China; Faculty of Medicine, Alexandria University, Alexandria, Egypt); Abdelazeem, Basel (The Sino-Russian Joint Research Center for Bone Metastasis in Malignant Tumor, Tianjin, China; McLaren Health Care, Flint/Michigan State University, Michigan City, MI, United States); Xu, Yao (The Sino-Russian Joint Research Center for Bone Metastasis in Malignant Tumor, Tianjin, China; Department of Bone and Soft Tissue Tumors, Tianjin Medical University Cancer Institute and Hospital, National Clinical Research Center for Cancer, Key Laboratory of Cancer Prevention and Therapy, Tianjin’s Clinical Research Center for Cancer, Tianjin, China); Lin, Yile (The Sino-Russian Joint Research Center for Bone Metastasis in Malignant Tumor, Tianjin, China); Wu, Haixiao (The Sino-Russian Joint Research Center for Bone Metastasis in Malignant Tumor, Tianjin, China; Department of Bone and Soft Tissue Tumors, Tianjin Medical University Cancer Institute and Hospital, National Clinical Research Center for Cancer, Key Laboratory of Cancer Prevention and Therapy, Tianjin’s Clinical Research Center for Cancer, Tianjin, China); Chekhonin, Vladimir P.

This was a multicentre, prospective, cohort study. Patients were divided into two groups depending on the 30-day mortality. The heart rate variability and more specifically the relative parasympathetic activity (ANIm), and the SDNN (Energy), were measured. To predict severity and mortality multivariate analyses of ANIm, Energy, SOFA score, and RASS scales were conducted. 112 patients were collected, the survival group (n = 55) and the deceased group (n = 57).

238,pub.1150994858,10.3389/fmars.2022.948580,,,Deep anthropogenic impacts on benthic marine diversity of the Humboldt Current Marine Ecosystem: Insights from a Quaternary fossil baseline,"The Humboldt Current Marine Ecosystem (HCE) is one of the most productive areas in the global ocean, but current anthropogenic stressors, particularly overfishing, pose a significant threat to marine biodiversity. Moreover, the limited time scale of modern assessments may underestimate the magnitude of human alterations to marine biodiversity. Here we use the rich Quaternary fossil record present along the HCE coast, encompassing the last ca. 500 kyr, to build a baseline to evaluate the impact of human activities on the diversity of mollusk assemblages. We compiled an extensive database of >13,000 occurrences and ca. 370,000 individuals of 164 species of gastropods and bivalves from modern and fossiliferous outcrops from southern Peru to northern Chile (15-30°S). We tested for changes in coverage-based species richness, species dominance, species composition (Chao dissimilarity, unweighted and weighted by abundance), and the relative abundance (i.e., the proportion of individuals) of species exploited by the artisanal fisheries. Comparisons between fossil and modern assemblages were carried out at different scales of spatial aggregation to buffer against inherent differences in spatial and temporal averaging. Species composition shows remarkable stability in fossil assemblages, from Middle Pleistocene to Holocene, at most scales of spatial aggregation. Modern assemblages showed drastic alterations compared to fossil counterparts when analyses considered spatial aggregation scales, i.e., significant changes in species composition, and a 3 to 6-fold reduction in the relative abundance of exploited species, but not changes in species richness and dominance. Results suggest that contemporaneous anthropogenic activities disrupted a long-term stability in the species composition. The diversity of modern mollusk assemblages is unseen in the past 500 kyr and seems deeply perturbated by overfishing. Our synthesis sets the foundations for a conservation paleobiology approach to robustly understand the impacts of anthropogenic stressors at the HCE.",,"This work was funded by several ANID/FONDECYT grants (11070147, 1110582, 1200843), National Geographic Research Grant # 8690-09, ANID- Millennium Science Initiative Program-NCN19_153 (UPWELL), ANID-CENTROS REGIONALES R20F0008 (CLAP), and INACH RG_51-19.",Frontiers in Marine Science,,,,2022-09-14,2022,2022-09-14,,9,,948580,All OA; Gold,Article,"Rivadeneira, Marcelo M.; Nielsen, Sven N.","Rivadeneira, Marcelo M.

Flowers,"In the present study, we identified the Bacillus subtilis strain annotated Fa17.2 isolated from Bromelia flower inflorescences collected from the subtropical humid mesothermal region, Santo Domingo de Los Tsachilas Province, Ecuador. The probiotic capacity and antimicrobial potential against four foodborne pathogens were assessed. The cell culture of Fa17.2 is highly resistant to synthetic gastric acid (pH 2.5, 3.0, and 3.5), bile salts (0.3%), tolerating different sodium chloride concentrations (1, 3, and 5%), and growth conditions (15 °C and 45 °C), suggesting its potential probiotic features. The isolate showed no antibiotic resistance and was considered safe as no hemolysis was detected on sheep blood agar. The optimum medium for bacterial growth and the release of antimicrobial compounds was MRS with 10% glucose. The active components released in the neutralized crude extract (NCE) were insensitive to organic solvents, surfactants, and nonproteolytic enzymes and sensitive to proteolytic enzymes suggesting their proteinaceous nature. The antimicrobial activity was enhanced by heat and maintained active over a wide range of pH (2.0-8.0). Moreover, the crude extract (CE) showed inhibitory activity against several Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria. The molecular weight of partially purified precipitated bacteriocin-like substances (BLISs) was about 14 kDa in 20% Tricine-SDS-PAGE. The CE obtained from Fa17.2 inhibits the growth of four foodborne pathogens, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Kosaconia cowanii, and Shigella dysenteriae, which implies its potential as an antimicrobial producer strain.",The authors are thankful to Technical University of the North for funding this research.,"This research was funded by Technical University of the North, Grant No. 2929/2019.",Microorganisms,,Sabina Fijan,,2022-04-21,2022,2022-04-21,,10,5,860,All OA; Gold,Article,"Tenea, Gabriela N; Gonzalez, Gabriela Lizeth; Moreno, Jose Luis","Tenea, Gabriela N (Biofood and Nutraceutics Research and Development Group, Faculty of Engineering in Agricultural and Environmental Sciences, Technical University of the North, Av. 17 de Julio s-21, Barrio El Olivo, Ibarra 100150, Ecuador.); Gonzalez, Gabriela Lizeth (Biofood and Nutraceutics Research and Development Group, Faculty of Engineering in Agricultural and Environmental Sciences, Technical University of the North, Av. 17 de Julio s-21, Barrio El Olivo, Ibarra 100150, Ecuador.); Moreno, Jose Luis (Biofood and Nutraceutics Research and Development Group, Faculty of Engineering in Agricultural and Environmental Sciences, Technical University of the North, Av. 17 de Julio s-21, Barrio El Olivo, Ibarra 100150, Ecuador.)","Tenea, Gabriela N (Biofood and Nutraceutics Research and Development Group, Faculty of Engineering in Agricultural and Environmental Sciences, Technical University of the North, Av. 17 de Julio s-21, Barrio El Olivo, Ibarra 100150, Ecuador.)","Tenea, Gabriela N (Biofood and Nutraceutics Research and Development Group, Faculty of Engineering in Agricultural and Environmental Sciences, Technical University of the North, Av. 17 de Julio s-21, Barrio El Olivo, Ibarra 100150, Ecuador.); Gonzalez, Gabriela Lizeth (Biofood and Nutraceutics Research and Development Group, Faculty of Engineering in Agricultural and Environmental Sciences, Technical University of the North, Av. 17 de Julio s-21, Barrio El Olivo, Ibarra 100150, Ecuador.); Moreno, Jose Luis (Biofood and Nutraceutics Research and Development Group, Faculty of Engineering in Agricultural and Environmental Sciences, Technical University of the North, Av. 17 de Julio s-21, Barrio El Olivo, Ibarra 100150, Ecuador.)",9,9,1.55,2.75,https://www.mdpi.com/2076-2607/10/5/860/pdf?version=1650531949,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1147347701,31 Biological Sciences; 3106 Industrial Biotechnology; 3107 Microbiology,

In particular we study the Aw–Rascle–Zhang model for traffic estimation, which consists of two hyperbolic first-order partial differential equations. The Lie symmetries, the one-dimensional optimal system and the corresponding Lie invariants are determined. Specifically, we find that the admitted Lie symmetries form the four-dimensional Lie algebra A4,12. The resulting one-dimensional optimal system is consisted by seven one-dimensional Lie algebras. Finally, we apply the Lie symmetries in order to define similarity transformations and derive new analytic solutions for the traffic model.

Using a combination of phenomenological modeling and partial correlation analysis, we find that Σ* alone is insufficient to predict the N/O in MaNGA spaxels and that there is an additional dependence on the local star formation rate surface density, ΣSFR. This effect is a factor of 3 stronger than the dependence of 12+log(O/H) on ΣSFR. Surprisingly, we find that the local N/O scaling relations also depend on the total galaxy stellar mass at fixed Σ* and the galaxy size at fixed stellar mass. We find that more compact galaxies are more nitrogen rich, even when Σ* and ΣSFR are controlled for. We show that ∼50% of the variance of N/O is explained by the total stellar mass and size. Thus, the evolution of nitrogen in galaxies is set by more than just local effects and does not simply track the buildup of oxygen in galaxies. The precise form of the N/O–O/H relation is therefore sensitive to the sample of galaxies from which it is derived. This result casts doubt on the universal applicability of nitrogen-based strong-line metallicity indicators derived in the local universe.","We would like to thank the anonymous referee for their extremely useful comments on this manuscript.

Soluble guanylyl cyclase (sGC) participates in signaling pathways that induce vascular vasodilation and reduce vascular remodeling. However, when sGC is oxidized and/or loses its heme group, it does not respond to nitric oxide (NO), losing its vasodilating effects. sGC protein expression and function is reduced in hypertensive neonatal lambs. Currently, NPHT is treated with NO inhalation therapy; however, new treatments are needed for improved outcomes. We used Cinaciguat (BAY-582667), which activates oxidized and/or without heme group sGC in pulmonary hypertensive lambs studied at 3,600 m. Our study included 6 Cinaciguat-treated (35 ug kg-1 day-1 x 7 days) and 6 Control neonates. We measured acute and chronic basal cardiovascular variables in pulmonary and systemic circulation, cardiovascular variables during a superimposed episode of acute hypoxia, remodeling of pulmonary arteries and changes in the right ventricle weight, vasoactive functions in small pulmonary arteries, and expression of NO-sGC-cGMP signaling pathway proteins involved in vasodilation. We observed a decrease in pulmonary arterial pressure and vascular resistance during the acute treatment. In contrast, the pulmonary pressure did not change in the chronic study due to increased cardiac output, resulting in lower pulmonary vascular resistance in the last 2 days of chronic study. The latter may have had a role in decreasing right ventricular hypertrophy, although the direct effect of Cinaciguat on the heart should also be considered. During acute hypoxia, the pulmonary vascular resistance remained low compared to the Control lambs. We observed a higher lung artery density, accompanied by reduced smooth muscle and adventitia layers in the pulmonary arteries. Additionally, vasodilator function was increased, and vasoconstrictor function was decreased, with modifications in the expression of proteins linked to pulmonary vasodilation, consistent with low pulmonary vascular resistance. In summary, Cinaciguat, an activator of sGC, induces cardiopulmonary modifications in chronically hypoxic and pulmonary hypertensive newborn lambs. Therefore, Cinaciguat is a potential therapeutic tool for reducing pulmonary vascular remodeling and/or right ventricular hypertrophy in pulmonary arterial hypertension syndrome.",In memory of our dear friend and colleague Dr. Julian T.

We present a review about the history of expeditions and studies on deep-sea echinoderms in Costa Rica, including an updated list of species. We used literature and information gathered from the databases of the California Academy of Sciences, the Benthic Invertebrate Collection of the Scripps Institution of Oceanography, the National Museum of Natural History, the Museum of Comparative Zoology and the Museo de Zoología from the Universidad de Costa Rica. A total of 124 taxa (75 confirmed species) have been collected from the Costa Rican deep sea, 112 found in the Pacific Ocean, 13 in the Caribbean Sea, and one species shared between the two basins. We report 22 new records for the Eastern Tropical Pacific, 46 for Central American waters, and 58 for Costa Rica. The most specious group was Ophiuroidea with 37 taxa, followed by Holothuroidea (34 taxa), Asteroidea (23 taxa), Echinoidea (17 taxa), and Crinoidea (11 taxa). The highest number of species (64) was found between 800 m and 1200 m depth. Only two species were found deeper than 3200 m. Further efforts on identification will be required for a better comprehension of the diversity of deep-sea echinoderms. Limited research has been done regarding the biology and ecology of deep-sea echinoderms in Costa Rica, so additional approaches will be necessary to understand their ecological functions.","We thank the University of Costa Rica for supporting basic research in all topics, and especially the Vicerrectoría de Investigación and the logistic support of the Center for Research in Marine Science and Limnology (CIMAR).

168,pub.1151770743,10.3389/fmars.2022.915983,,,Borderless conservation: Integrating connectivity into high seas conservation efforts for the Salas y Gómez and Nazca ridges,"Connectivity is essential to consider in area-based marine conservation measures because it greatly impacts vital ecological processes (e.g., recycling nutrients, regulating temperature, sequestering carbon, and supporting the life cycle of species). However, it is generally not well studied or integrated into conservation measures, particularly in the Southeast Pacific. This region is home to the Salas y Gómez and Nazca ridges, two adjacent seamount chains that stretch between the Peruvian coast and Rapa Nui (i.e., Easter Island). The area has been recognized for its exceptional natural and cultural significance as well as one of the most important global areas to protect. However, over 73% of the ridges are in areas beyond national jurisdiction, where they are unprotected and under threat. This study provides a synthesis of what we know about connectivity in the Salas y Gómez and Nazca ridges and provides practical recommendations for integrating this knowledge into conservation and management measures for the region. While data on connectivity is still limited, it should not constrain the development of conservation measures, which should be co-designed and co-developed, leveraging the expertise of international working groups throughout the region. Due to their high rates of endemism, as well as importance as migratory corridors, enacting large-scale conservation measures would address important conservation considerations for both connectivity and endemism. Enacting such large-scale conservation measures would not only elevate the Salas y Gómez and Nazca ridges as an exemplary case study, providing lessons for other marine regions seeking to implement similar measures, but could also help raise awareness on the severity of externally originating threats like climate change and plastic pollution to global audiences.",,"This work was funded in part by the Paul M.

The South Eastern Pacific (SEP) coast is a highly productive coastal system that exhibits a broad biogeographic transition zone around 30-35°S. Here, we present a comparative genome-wide analysis of the sister species Scurria viridula and Scurria zebrina, that occur in parapatry and whose poleward and equatorward range edges intersect in the 30-35°S SEP biogeographic transition zone. We sampled 118 specimens sourced from nine sites from Tocopilla (22°S) to Chiloé (41°S) including one site where both species overlap and analyzed over 8000 biallelic single nucleotide polymorphisms. We found evidence of hybridization between these species in the contact zone and found significant but contrasting population structures for both species. Our results indicate that the genetic structure in S. viridula, which is currently expanding its range poleward, follows a simple isolation by distance model with no traces of natural selection (no evidence of outlier loci). In contrast, S. zebrina, which has  its equatorward range edge at the transition zone, displayed a pronounced genetic break approximately at 32-34°S, along a region of marked environmental heterogeneity in association with a semi-permanent coastal upwelling regime. For S. zebrina we also found 43 outlier loci associated with this genetic break, with a significant proportion of them clustering in a single linkage group. This marked difference in the presence of outlier loci between species suggests that they could be responding differently to local environmental challenges found at their overlapping geographic range edges, thus providing important new insights about genomic changes around biogeographic transition zones in sister species and the forces that shape genetic diversity in intertidal marine species.","ACKNOWLEDGMENTS PS‐A acknowledge support from Fondo Nacionanal de Ciencia y Tecnología (FONDECYT 1190710 and 1200636) and Millenium Nucleus NUTME (ANID NCN19_056), BRB, PAH, and MAL acknowledge support from Millennium Institute SECOS (ANID ICN2019_015) and FONDECYT 1190444.

S), Southern Atacama Desert, Based on Geomorphological Mapping and Cosmogenic 10Be Exposure Ages","The high mountain segments of the valleys of the southernmost Atacama Desert of Chile present Late Quaternary glacial landforms that developed in already incised valleys. Glacier advances and deglaciation have left a geomorphic imprint in the southernmost Atacama Desert. In this work, the glacial landforms of the Encierro River Valley (29.1°S–69.9°W) have been revisited and new detailed geomorphological mapping is provided. This work also includes new 10Be exposure ages from moraine boulders and one age from an ice-molded bedrock surface. The former glacier of the El Encierro valley extended 16 km down the valley during the last local glacial maximum recorded by a terminal moraine (ENC 1a) with an exposure age of ∼40 ka. Four inboard moraine arcs were deposited upstream in telescopic patterns (ENC 1b–d), whose exposure ages range between ∼25 and ∼33 ka (ENC 1d). Exposure ages between ∼17–24 ka on lateral moraines (ENC 1L) developed during the later ice recession of the ENC 1 drift. Thus, the ice mostly disappeared in the main valley before ∼18 ka, as is also supported by the exposure age obtained from an ice-molded bedrock surface. Seven kilometers up the valley from the ENC 1, the ENC 2a–d moraine arcs correspond to a small ice advance by ∼17–20 ka. The last glacial advance (ENC 2), which occurred after deglaciation of the last local glacial maximum (ENC 1), coincides with the start of the Heinrich Stadial Event 1 (HS1; 18–14.5 ka), which is thought to play a direct role in the last glacial termination in the Andes.",,"This work was supported by the INNOVA-CORFO project (RR); the Basal Project of the Advanced Mining Technology Center financed by ANID Project AFB0004 (AG), and the FONDECYT grant # 1200935 (GJ).",Frontiers in Earth Science,,,,2022-07-08,2022,2022-07-08,,10,,878318,All OA; Gold,Article,"Aguilar, G.; Riquelme, R.; Lohse, P.; Cabré, A.; García, J.-L.","Aguilar, G.

Although the PSP-inducing species that threaten the most vulnerable commercial species of shellfish are very patchy and spatially heterogeneous in their distribution, the spatial and temporal scales of their effects have largely been ignored in monitoring programs and by researchers. In this study, we examined the spatial and temporal dynamics of PSP toxicity in the clam (Ameghinomya antiqua) in two fishing grounds in southern Chile (Ovalada Island and Low Bay). During the summer of 2009, both were affected by an intense toxic bloom of A. catenella (up to 1.1 × 106 cells L-1). Generalized linear models were used to assess the potential influence of different environmental variables on the field detoxification rates of PSP toxins over a period of 12 months. This was achieved using a four parameter exponential decay model to fit and compare field detoxification rates per sampling site. The results show differences in the spatial variability and temporal dynamics of PSP toxicity, given that greater toxicities (+10-fold) and faster detoxification (20% faster) are observed at the Ovalada Island site, the less oceanic zone, and where higher amounts of clam are annually produced. Our observations support the relevance of considering different spatial and temporal scales to obtain more accurate assessments of PSP accumulation and detoxification dynamics and to improve the efficacy of fisheries management after toxic events.",We thank the Chilean Monitoring Program at IFOP for monthly reports on PSP toxicity concentrations and distributions in southern Chile.

Rivers have undergone major changes associated with urban centers, so monitoring them is important to determine their status and suitability to provide environmental services. Studies applying the community ecology approach, such as energy flow in aquatic macroinvertebrate assemblages, may be appropriate to determine their status and functioning. This study characterized an Andean river that runs across the city of Ayacucho (Peru). Water physicochemical parameters and biotic quality indices were used and compared with the abundance of trophic guild components and functional feeding groups to demonstrate that the latter are at least equally suitable to estimate water quality. The river section studied ranged from 2640 to 2900 m a.s.l. and was monitored in the wet and dry seasons. Six monitoring stations were established according to the extent of the influence of the urban center. Water physicochemical variables and macroinvertebrate abundances were determined. A Surber net was used for multihabitat sampling; macroinvertebrates were identified to genus level (in most cases) and counted to estimate relative abundances. Trophic guilds (detritivore, predator, herbivore) were formed using the genus data from identification according to the information available in Argentina, Colombia, Ecuador, Bolivia, and Peru. Functional feeding groups were set based on the classification of families. The sensitivity of trophic metrics was assessed by relating them to environmental variables and the Andean Biotic Index (ABI), the Biological Monitoring Working Party adapted for Colombia (BMWP/Col.), and the Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, Trichoptera (EPT) indices. Environmental variables and biotic indices increased significantly in the most impacted stations, where the abundance of most taxa decreased. The components of trophic guilds and functional groups varied, and those feeding on fine particles increased in sites with a higher urban impact. The metrics based on trophic characteristics were highly correlated with the BMWP/Col and ABI indices. Therefore, these indices can be used to estimate river water quality and provide information on its functioning.","To the Vice-rectorate of Research at the Universidad Nacional de San Cristobal de Huamanga and the General Office of Research and Innovation, for the financing provided.

The present study used a descriptive correlational type of quantitative approach on a sample of 389 older adults aged 60 years and over, who were recruited by non-probabilistic convenience sampling. For the application of the survey technique, the instrument used was a questionnaire modified by the authors. In terms of research ethics for the development of the study, the respondents provided informed consent, and other ethical considerations were addressed. In relation to sociodemographic variables of mental health, it was found that women had a greater incidence of anxiety (p < 0.01) and that people with fewer years of study had a greater incidence of depression (p < 0.01) and anxiety in sparsely populated areas. Exposure to news through television was associated with depression, and news obtained from other people was associated with depression (p < 0.001). An association was also found between the number of hours of television news and stress (p < 0.05), and radio news was associated with anxiety (p < 0.05). In terms of psychological consequences, the highest mean for television exposure was fear, while the greatest psychological consequence of radio news was fear, followed by stress and awareness. Finally, negative, inverse, and significant relationships were found that indicate protective factors, such as depression with awareness and indignation, and anxiety was inversely related to awareness.",,This research received no external funding.,International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health,,Malgorzata Sobieszczanska,Aged; Anxiety; COVID-19; Depression; Fear; Female; Humans; Mental Health; Middle Aged; Peru,2022-09-12,2022,2022-09-12,,19,18,11470,All OA; Gold,Article,"Cachicatari-Vargas, Elena; Cuellar, Karimen Jetzabel Mutter; Chipana, Wender Florencio Condori; de Maria Miranda Socasaire, Flor; Acevedo-Duque, Ángel; Arpasi-Quispe, Orfelina","Cachicatari-Vargas, Elena (Faculty of Health Sciences, Universidad Nacional Jorge Basadre Grohmann, Tacna 23001, Peru); Cuellar, Karimen Jetzabel Mutter (Faculty of Health Sciences, Universidad Nacional Jorge Basadre Grohmann, Tacna 23001, Peru; Programa de Doctorado en Ciencias Sociales, Universidad Autónoma de Chile, Santiago 7500912, Chile); Chipana, Wender Florencio Condori (Faculty of Health Sciences, Universidad Nacional Jorge Basadre Grohmann, Tacna 23001, Peru; Graduate School, Norbert Wiener University, Lima 15046, Peru); de Maria Miranda Socasaire, Flor (Faculty of Health Sciences, Universidad Nacional Jorge Basadre Grohmann, Tacna 23001, Peru); Acevedo-Duque, Ángel (Programa de Doctorado en Ciencias Sociales, Universidad Autónoma de Chile, Santiago 7500912, Chile); Arpasi-Quispe, Orfelina (Graduate School, Norbert Wiener University, Lima 15046, Peru; Faculty of Health Sciences, Universidad Peruana Unión, Lima 15046, Peru)","Acevedo-Duque, Ángel (Universidad Autónoma de Chile)","Cachicatari-Vargas, Elena (Jorge Basadre Grohmann National University); Cuellar, Karimen Jetzabel Mutter (Jorge Basadre Grohmann National University; Universidad Autónoma de Chile); Chipana, Wender Florencio Condori (Jorge Basadre Grohmann National University; Graduate School, Norbert Wiener University, Lima 15046, Peru); de Maria Miranda Socasaire, Flor (Jorge Basadre Grohmann National University); Acevedo-Duque, Ángel (Universidad Autónoma de Chile); Arpasi-Quispe, Orfelina (Graduate School, Norbert Wiener University, Lima 15046, Peru; Peruvian Union University)",2,1,,2.53,https://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/19/18/11470/pdf?version=1662987761,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1150980381,"42 Health Sciences; 47 Language, Communication and Culture; 4701 Communication and Media Studies",3 Good Health and Well Being

Validity was evaluated based on internal structure through confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) and reliability through the internal consistency method with the hierarchical omega coefficient. The results indicate that a bi-factor model presents better indexes of adjustment to the data (χ2=62.86; df=25; p=.000; RMSEA=.061 [IC90% .042-.080]; SRMR=.024; CFI=.99; TLI=.99). Furthermore, the bi-factor model presents adequate levels of reliability for the general factor (ωH=.70) and for the affective (ωhs=.32) and behavior (ωhs=.41) dimensions.

The realisation that employees formpart of the external corporate identity of a company has shifted the focus of corporate identitymanagement inwards towards employees as an internal stakeholder group. Although it isassumed that good corporate identity management leads to good relationships, little researchhas been done on the direct link between the two concepts.

However, since CESSs are still emerging technologies, there is much research space in this field for proposing innovative and economic control algorithms for such devices. Thus, this paper presents a study of four control strategies applied to an MV distribution network, i.e., peak shaving, line losses control, line congestion reduction, and system voltage control, through an Aggregated Community Energy Storage System (ACESS), which is represented as the sum of multiple CESSs connected in LV systems, viewed from MV side. The proposed strategies are based on Model Predictive Control (MPC), a technique that, using the future demand forecast data, calculates the dispatch of ACESS. The results show, with respect to the base case, an improvement between 12.8% and 15.1% for the line losses control strategy, a reduction of 31.5% on the maximum demand for the peak shaving control strategy, a maximum lowering of 12% on the currents of some lines for the congestion control strategy, and an enhancement of 0.15% for the voltage control strategy. Moreover, for estimating the service lifetime of the ACESS after applying the control algorithms, the Rainflow Counting Algorithm (RCA) is used, exhibiting that, regardless of the control strategy, the degradation is inversely proportional to the storage capacity.",,This work was supported by Universidad del Norte through Internal Research Agendas Program.,IEEE Access,,,,2022-01-01,2022,2022-11-07,2022-01-01,10,,119321-119332,All OA; Gold,Article,"Yepes-Fernéndez, Hernén; Restrepo, Mauricio; Arango-Manrique, Adriana","Yepes-Fernéndez, Hernén (Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, 081007, Colombia); Restrepo, Mauricio (Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, 081007, Colombia); Arango-Manrique, Adriana (Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, 081007, Colombia)","Restrepo, Mauricio (Universidad del Norte)","Yepes-Fernéndez, Hernén (Universidad del Norte); Restrepo, Mauricio (Universidad del Norte); Arango-Manrique, Adriana (Universidad del Norte)",5,5,,2.51,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/ielx7/6287639/6514899/09940955.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1152550077,"40 Engineering; 4008 Electrical Engineering; 4009 Electronics, Sensors and Digital Hardware",7 Affordable and Clean Energy

Trypanosomatids are traditionally divided into heteroxenous, characterized by the alternation of the life cycle between an insect vector and a plant or a vertebrate host, including humans being responsible for severe diseases; and monoxenous, which are presumably unique parasites of invertebrate hosts. Interestingly, studies reporting the occurrence of these monoxenous trypanosomatids in humans have been gradually increasing, either associated with Leishmania co-infection, or supposedly alone either in immunocompromised or even more sporadically in immunocompetent hosts.

KF was applied on young Coffea arabica and Coffea canephora plants before their transition from nursery to full sunlight during autumn and summer. The effects of KF were evaluated through the responses of leaf temperature (Tleaf), net CO2 assimilation rate (A), stomatal conductance (g s), transpiration (E), WUE, crop water stress index (CWSI), index of relative stomatal conductance (Ig), initial fluorescence (F0), and photosynthetic index (PI) in the first 2-3 weeks after the plant transitions to the full sun. All measurements were performed at midday. In Coffea plants, KF decreased the Tleaf up to 6.7°C/5.6°C and reduced the CWSI. The plants that were not protected with KF showed lower A, g s, E, and Ig than those protected with KF. C. canephora plants protected with KF achieved higher WUE compared with those not protected by 11.23% in autumn and 95.58% in summer. In both Coffea sp., KF application reduced F0, indicating reduced physical dissociation of the PSII reaction centers from the light-harvesting system, which was supported with increased PI.

238,pub.1151584882,10.1109/access.2022.3211973,,,Developing Computing Competencies Without Restrictions,"The information society represents a great revolution. Computing programming is a relevant competence nowadays for everybody, regardless of educational background. However, traditional programming languages consider syntax barriers that complicate their adoption and usefulness for beginners. Python is an exception for its open-source, cross-platform nature and syntax simplicity, which facilitate the development of algorithmic thinking and dissemination of programming solutions. Several Python extensions support modern functionalities such as web development, videogame, and machine learning, making it one of the most used programming languages. Google Colab or Colaboratory facilitates the online learning and development of Python solutions. This article presents positive academic experiences of Chilean students of majors from two Chilean universities, a traditional university in the north and a private university in the middle of Chile, using Google Colab to develop programming competencies remotely for the Covid pandemic. We highlight the promising results obtained for basic programming and operating system programming subjects, which motivate us to use Python and Google Colab widely, not only in university contexts. We expect to continue developing programming competencies using Google Colab and Python. The main limitation encountered in this experience is the internet connection requirements for online education. However, it does not represent an issue for education in developing and developed countries. Google Colab permits the development of highly demanded competencies worldwide at home, only with internet access and a web browse, an excellent motivation for learning for all students regardless of age and academic level.","The authors are currently living in a difficult time, plagued by a pandemic.

Thus, the meta-analysis was conducted to report and review the association between PD-L1 and survival in penile cancer patients.
Methods: PubMed, Cochrane Library, EMBASE, and Web of Science were all searched, screened, and reviewed by June 1, 2022. Hazard ratio (HR) was used to evaluate the relationship between PD-L1 and survival outcome, and odds ratio (OR) was for tumor features.
Results: Nine retrospective studies (1,003 patients) were incorporated. The prevalence of PD-L1 in patients with penile cancer was 51.4% (95% CI = 42.1%-60.8%, I 2 = 88.5%). Higher PD-L1 on tumor cells was related to shorter cancer-specific survival (CSS) in patients (HR = 1.578, 95% CI = 1.227-2.029, I 2 = 23.3%), but had no associations with overall survival (OS) (HR = 1.123, 95% CI = 0.511-2.465, I 2 = 0.0%). Subgroup analysis indicated that higher PD-L1 was related to shorter CSS in Caucasus (HR = 1.827, 95% CI = 1.355-2.465, I 2 = 0.0%) only. Furthermore, PD-L1 had associations with tumor stage (pT1 vs. pT2-4, OR = 0.480, 95% CI = 0.346-0.667, P = 0.001) and tumor grade (Well and moderate vs. Poor, OR = 0.377, 95% CI = 0.264-0.538, P < 0.001). PD-L1 positivity was also related to lymph node (LN) status (pN0/NX vs. pN1-3, OR = 0.541, 95% CI = 0.385-0.759, P = 0.001) and HPV status (Positive vs. Negative, OR = 0.510, 95% CI = 0.322-0.810, P = 0.003). A trend toward statistical significance between PD-L1 and histological types was also observed (Usual SCC vs. Others, OR = 1.754, 95% CI = 0.984-3.124, P = 0.070).
Conclusions: PD-L1 over-expression was related to worse survival outcomes and several clinicopathological features of penile cancer. PD-L1 expression can be applied to select appropriate treatment strategies for penile malignancies.

During the construction and analysis of the psychometric characteristics of the scale, an Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) and a Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) were performed. To test EES scores based on gender and school year, the T-Student test for independent samples and ANOVA were used, respectively. To verify the relationship between the scores of the different types of emotions and academic performance, the Pearson correlation test was performed. A total of 562 students belonging to the 5th (n = 228) and 6th (n = 186) primary school year and the 1st (n = 134) and 2nd (n = 94) secondary school year participated in the research. Age between 10 and 15 years old (mean = 11.66, standard deviation = 1.206) both males (50.5%) and females (49.5%). The results offered support for the three-factor structure. The analysis of invariance with respect to gender showed that the factor structure was invariant. Boys scored higher on the positive emotions factor and lower scores on anxiety than girls. Regarding school year, negative emotions and anxiety related to exams increase in the secondary courses compared to Primary while for positive emotions it is primary school students who obtain higher scores. The correlation coefficient between negative emotions (as well as anxiety) and school performance is negative whereas the correlation coefficient between positive emotions and academic performance is positive. EES scale is an instrument with scientific rigor and with adequate reliability and validity to be able to know the emotions that primary and secondary school students suffer when they are subjected to evaluation processes in the academic context.",,This research received no external funding.,International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health,,"Carlos Salavera, Pablo Usán Supervía, Víctor Murillo Lorente, Mário Rui Domingues Ferreira da Cruz",Adolescent; Child; Emotions; Female; Humans; Male; Psychometrics; Reproducibility of Results; Schools; Students; Surveys and Questionnaires,2022-06-01,2022,2022-06-01,,19,11,6770,All OA; Gold,Article,"Obregón-Cuesta, Ana Isabel; Mínguez-Mínguez, Luis Alberto; León-del-Barco, Benito; Mendo-Lázaro, Santiago; Fernández-Solana, Jessica; González-Santos, Josefa; González-Bernal, Jerónimo J.","Obregón-Cuesta, Ana Isabel (Department of Mathematics and Computing, University of Burgos, 09001 Burgos, Spain;, aiobregon@ubu.es); Mínguez-Mínguez, Luis Alberto (Department of Education Sciences, University of Burgos, 09001 Burgos, Spain); León-del-Barco, Benito (Department of Psychology and Anthropology, University of Extremadura, 10071 Caceres, Spain;, bleon@unex.es, (B.L.-d.-B.);, smendo@unex.es, (S.M.-L.)); Mendo-Lázaro, Santiago (Department of Psychology and Anthropology, University of Extremadura, 10071 Caceres, Spain;, bleon@unex.es, (B.L.-d.-B.);, smendo@unex.es, (S.M.-L.)); Fernández-Solana, Jessica (Department of Health Sciences, University of Burgos, 09001 Burgos, Spain;, jfsolana@ubu.es, (J.F.-S.);, mjgonzalez@ubu.es, (J.G.-S.);, jejavier@ubu.es, (J.J.G.-B.)); González-Santos, Josefa (Department of Health Sciences, University of Burgos, 09001 Burgos, Spain;, jfsolana@ubu.es, (J.F.-S.);, mjgonzalez@ubu.es, (J.G.-S.);, jejavier@ubu.es, (J.J.G.-B.)); González-Bernal, Jerónimo J.

Based on this review it was established that sexuality education should aim to train individuals capable of making decisions free of stereotypes recognizing their natural changes and assuming their own identity. This goal will be achieved if children and adolescents know their bodies, value themselves, know their anatomy and make responsible decisions based on respect and self-esteem. For those reasons, it must be strengthened from school their knowledge in biological function and other strategies that allow the management of psychological and social aspects that are related to sexuality.

239,pub.1146086575,10.3390/met12030445,,,Use of Alternative Water Resources in Copper Leaching Processes in Chilean Mining Industry—A Review,"Due to the significant growth of the world population, the accelerated growth of economic industries in various countries, and improved living conditions, freshwater consumption has increased dramatically and is currently under critical pressure. Its good use and rationing are essential. Even though mining is an industry that consumes much less water than other industries, such as agriculture, surrounding communities are constantly questioned. This occurs mainly because mining deposits are generally found in arid areas where freshwater is scarce, forcing government authorities to regulate water use in mining processes more severely. Faced with this scenario, the mining industry has innovated the use of seawater and wastewater from processes for its production processes. In addition, various projects are under development to construct desalination plants and water impulsion systems of the sea; therefore, it is expected that seawater and/or wastewater in mining will continue to grow in the coming years. Among the main challenges faced in the use of these water resources in mining is: (i) the close relationship that exists between the use of seawater and energy consumption, transferring the problem of water scarcity to a problem of energy cost overruns; (ii) generation of greater integration between the use of water and sustainable energy; and (iii) brine management is economically expensive and technically challenging and, therefore, most desalination plants discharge untreated brine directly into the sea, causing an environmental impact. On the other hand, regarding the use of these water resources in leaching processes, there are very positive results for the dissolution of copper from sulfide minerals, where the wastewater from desalination plants presents better results than seawater due to its higher concentration of chloride ions, allowing it to work at higher redox potential values in order to increase copper dissolution. This manuscript is a bibliographic review in which finally, it is concluded that it is feasible to incorporate wastewater from water desalination plants in heap leaching processes for copper sulfide ores, as long as the cost of transfer from water desalination plants to mining sites can be supported.",Pedro Robles thanks the Pontificia Universidad Católica de Valparaíso for the support provided.,This research received no external funding.,Metals,,,,2022-03-04,2022,2022-03-04,,12,3,445,All OA; Gold,Article,"Toro, Norman; Gálvez, Edelmira; Robles, Pedro; Castillo, Jonathan; Villca, Grecia; Salinas-Rodríguez, Eleazar","Toro, Norman (Faculty of Engineering and Architecture, Universidad Arturo Prat, Iquique 1100000, Chile); Gálvez, Edelmira (Departamento de Ingeniería Metalúrgica y Minas, Universidad Católica del Norte, Antofagasta 1270709, Chile;, egalvez@ucn.cl); Robles, Pedro (Escuela de Ingeniería Química, Pontificia Universidad Católica de Valparaíso, Valparaíso 2340000, Chile;, pedro.robles@pucv.cl); Castillo, Jonathan (Departamento de Ingeniería en Metalurgia, Universidad de Atacama, Copiapó 1531772, Chile;, jonathan.castillo@uda.cl); Villca, Grecia (Departamento de Ingeniería Química y Procesos de Minerales, Universidad de Antofagasta, Antofagasta 1270300, Chile;, grecia.villca.alarcon@ua.cl); Salinas-Rodríguez, Eleazar (Academic Area of Earth Sciences and Materials, Institute of Basic Sciences and Engineering, Autonomous University of the State of Hidalgo, Highway Pachuca-Tulancingo, km. 4.5, Mineral de la Reforma, Pachuca 42184, Mexico;, salinasr@uaeh.edu.mx)","Toro, Norman (Arturo Prat University)","Toro, Norman (Arturo Prat University); Gálvez, Edelmira (Catholic University of the North); Robles, Pedro (Pontificial Catholic University of Valparaiso); Castillo, Jonathan (University of Atacama); Villca, Grecia (University of Antofagasta); Salinas-Rodríguez, Eleazar (Academic Area of Earth Sciences and Materials, Institute of Basic Sciences and Engineering, Autonomous University of the State of Hidalgo, Highway Pachuca-Tulancingo, km. 4.5, Mineral de la Reforma, Pachuca 42184, Mexico;, salinasr@uaeh.edu.mx)",9,8,,2.43,https://www.mdpi.com/2075-4701/12/3/445/pdf?version=1648002862,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1146086575,40 Engineering; 4016 Materials Engineering; 4019 Resources Engineering and Extractive Metallurgy,6 Clean Water and Sanitation
226,pub.1149677900,10.3389/feart.2022.909967,,,An Inside Sun: Lickanantay Volcanology in the Salar de Atacama,"The need of establishing more substantive dialogs between the mainstream and Indigenous knowledge on volcanoes has been increasingly recognized. To contribute to this endeavor, in this article we present the basic volcanological understandings of the Lickanantay people in the Salar de Atacama Basin. The Salar de Atacama Basin is an active volcanic territory within the Central Volcanic Zone of the Andes (CVZA). From the El Tatio geothermal field to Socompa volcano, more than 19 active volcanoes surround the territory that the Lickanantay (Atacameño) people have inhabited for more than 11,000 years. Living around and with the geological dynamism of the CVZA for millennia, the Lickanantay communities have accumulated rich observational and ceremonial data on volcanoes and volcanism. Paradoxically, however, while the Atacameño people have thoroughly characterized the CVZA, the volcanology community has not been properly introduced to the ancestral knowledge articulated in the territory. In order to make traditional Atacameño perspectives on volcanoes, volcanic risk, and geo-cosmic interdependence more amply available to the volcanology community, in this article, we present a basic description of what we call Atacameño volcanology. By Atacameño volcanology, we understand the ancestral principles by which volcanoes are known and understood as partaking in larger processes of a cosmo-ecological formation. Specifically, we describe the basic volcanological notions arising from the Lickanantay ancestral knowledge—volcanic formation, functions, and behavior. Second, we focus on the El Tatio geothermal field to offer a situated example. Finally, we delineate some relevant elements of human–volcano interactions and volcanic risk management from an Atacameño perspective. In our conclusions we suggest that volcanology, particularly in the context of the Andes, needs to engage more substantially with the Atacameño or other ancestral systems of knowledge production to expand volcanological insights and respond to the call for decolonizing science.","We would like to express our gratitude to the Pacha for her sustenance, and especially to the tata El Tatio for being a constant source of guidance and knowledge.

DESIGN: It is a cross-sectional study with data from the European Health Survey of Spain 2020 (EESE 2020), consisting of 10,024 males and 11,126 females, between 18 and 84 years, which conformed the sample of 21,150 participants.
RESULTS: Depressive symptoms and depression were related to days of PA per week, PA frequency per week and strength training days per week (p < 0.001), depressive symptoms and depression were found to have higher prevalence in the inactive groups than in the active groups (p < 0.05); this phenomenon was found in both sexes and age groups.
CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of depressive symptoms and depression were associated with physical activity in the general population, by sex and by age group too. The prevalence of both were higher in the inactive population than in the active population of all ages and sexes. Future studies are required to confirm the relationship between PA and depression prevalence, in order to establish the scope of the effect of PA on depressive symptoms and depression.",,"The author A.

When the renal secretion capacity exceeds, calcium oxalate forms stones that accumulate in the kidneys. In this respect, detailed QSAR analysis, molecular docking, and dynamics simulations of a series of inhibitors containing glycolic, glyoxylic, and salicylic acid groups have been performed employing different regression machine learning techniques. Three robust models with less than 9 descriptors—based on a tenfold cross (Q2CV) and external (Q2EXT) validation—were found i.e., MLR1 (Q2CV = 0.893, Q2EXT = 0.897), RF1 (Q2CV = 0.889, Q2EXT = 0.907), and IBK1 (Q2CV = 0.891, Q2EXT = 0.907). An ensemble model was built by averaging the predicted pIC50 of the three models, obtaining a Q2EXT = 0.933. Physicochemical properties such as charge, electronegativity, hardness, softness, van der Waals volume, and polarizability were considered as attributes to build the models. To get more insight into the potential biological activity of the compouds studied herein, docking and dynamic analysis were carried out, finding the hydrophobic and polar residues show important interactions with the ligands. A screening of the DrugBank database V.5.1.7 was performed, leading to the proposal of seven commercial drugs within the applicability domain of the models, that can be suggested as possible PHT1 treatment.","The authors are grateful with the USFQ-POLI grants 2022-2023 for the financial support.

In 2020, there were 280 million international migrants in the world. Undoubtedly, Mexico plays a fundamental role in transnational migration due to the large flow  of  migrants  who  transit  through  its  borders.  Research  on  mental  health  and  migra-tion suggests a high prevalence of mental disorders due to the conditions of the migration process; this scenario may be aggravated as result of the health contingency caused by CO-VID-19.  Methodology:  This  research  is  intended  to  identify  the  relationship  between  the  mental health of migrants, the migratory process, and the COVID-19 epidemic. Therefore, it is a qualitative study with a deductive approach. A sample evaluation of Central Ameri-can  migrants  living  in  a  shelter  in  Tabasco,  Mexico  in  December  2020  was  used.  Results:  Some factors impact the mental health of migrants in the place of origin and during transit (forced migration, persecution, and the lack of possibilities to achieve a decent standard of living...). Moreover, positive, and negative manifestations were reported in the dimensions of mental health, because of the migratory process and COVID-19. Conclusions: Migration has become an option for survival and well-being given the limited opportunities that exist in the regions of origin. Efforts must be made to develop migration and health policies that benefit this group. Unfortunately, some limitations of data collection emerged due to Covid 19.

Interspecific hybridization is critical for resolving parental genetic diversity bottleneck problems. The reciprocal interspecific hybrids and their parents (Gossypium hirsutum and Gossypium barbadense) have been applied in this study to elucidate the transcription regulatory mechanism of early biomass heterosis. Phenotypically, the seed biomass, plant height over parent heterosis, leaf area over parent heterosis, and fresh and dry biomass were found to be significantly higher in hybrids than in parents. Analysis of leaf areas revealed that the one-leaf stage exhibits the most significant performance in initial vegetative growth vigor and larger leaves in hybrids, increasing the synthesis of photosynthesis compounds and enhancing photosynthesis compound synthesis. Comparative transcriptome analysis showed that transgressive down-regulation (TDR) is the main gene expression pattern in the hybrids (G. hirsutum × G. barbadense, HB), and it was found that the genes of photosystem I and Adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-binding may promote early growth vigor. Transgressive up-regulation (TUR) is the major primary gene expression pattern in the hybrids (G. barbadense × G. hirsutum, BH), and photosystem II-related genes mediated the performance of early biomass heterosis. The above results demonstrated that overdominance mediates biomass heterosis in interspecific hybrid cotton and the supervisory mechanism divergence of hybrids with different females. Photosynthesis and other metabolic process are jointly involved in controlling early biomass heterosis in interspecific hybrid cotton. The expression pattern data of transcriptome sequencing were supported using the qRT-PCR analysis.

Benchmarking low-coverage nanopore long-read sequencing for the assembling of mitochondrial genomes using the vulnerable silky shark Carcharhinus falciformis,"BackgroundWhole mitochondrial genomes are quickly becoming markers of choice for the exploration of within-species genealogical and among-species phylogenetic relationships. Most often, ‘primer walking’ or ‘long PCR’ strategies plus Sanger sequencing or low-pass whole genome sequencing using Illumina short reads are used for the assembling of mitochondrial chromosomes. In this study, we first confirmed that mitochondrial genomes can be sequenced from long reads using nanopore sequencing data exclusively. Next, we examined the accuracy of the long-reads assembled mitochondrial chromosomes when comparing them to a ‘gold’ standard reference mitochondrial chromosome assembled using Illumina short-reads sequencing.ResultsUsing a specialized bioinformatics tool, we first produced a short-reads mitochondrial genome assembly for the silky shark C. falciformis with an average base coverage of 9.8x. The complete mitochondrial genome of C. falciformis was 16,705 bp in length and 934 bp shorter than a previously assembled genome (17,639 bp in length) that used bioinformatics tools not specialized for the assembly of mitochondrial chromosomes. Next, low-pass whole genome sequencing using a MinION ONT pocket-sized platform plus customized de-novo and reference-based workflows assembled and circularized a highly accurate mitochondrial genome in the silky shark Carcharhinus falciformis. Indels at the flanks of homopolymer regions explained most of the dissimilarities observed between the ‘gold’ standard reference mitochondrial genome (assembled using Illumina short reads) and each of the long-reads mitochondrial genome assemblies. Although not completely accurate, mitophylogenomics and barcoding analyses (using entire mitogenomes and the D-Loop/Control Region, respectively) suggest that long-reads assembled mitochondrial genomes are reliable for identifying a sequenced individual, such as C. falciformis, and separating the same individual from others belonging to closely related congeneric species.ConclusionsThis study confirms that mitochondrial genomes can be sequenced from long-reads nanopore sequencing data exclusively. With further development, nanopore technology can be used to quickly test in situ mislabeling in the shark fin fishing industry and thus, improve surveillance protocols, law enforcement, and the regulation of this fishery. This study will also assist with the transferring of high-throughput sequencing technology to middle- and low-income countries so that international scientists can explore population genomics in sharks using inclusive research strategies. Lastly, we recommend assembling mitochondrial genomes using specialized assemblers instead of other assemblers developed for bacterial and/or nuclear genomes.",The author thanks Dr. Vince P.

Studies have linked inflammation to breast cancer development, but data is limited in premenopausal women, especially in Latin America.MethodsWe investigated the associations between serum biomarkers of chronic inflammation (interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, IL-10, tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interferon-γ (IFN-γ), leptin, adiponectin) and risk of premenopausal breast cancer among 453 cases and 453 matched, population-based controls from Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, and Mexico. Odds ratios (OR) were estimated using conditional logistic regression models. Analyses were stratified by size and hormonal receptor status of the tumors.ResultsIL-6 (ORper standard deviation (SD) = 1.33 (1.11–1.60)) and TNF-α (ORper SD = 1.32 (1.11–1.58)) were positively associated with breast cancer risk in fully adjusted models. Evidence of heterogeneity by estrogen receptor (ER) status was observed for IL-8 (P-homogeneity = 0.05), with a positive association in ER-negative tumors only. IL-8 (P-homogeneity = 0.06) and TNF-α (P-homogeneity = 0.003) were positively associated with risk in the largest tumors, while for leptin (P-homogeneity = 0.003) a positive association was observed for the smallest tumors only.ConclusionsThe results of this study support the implication of chronic inflammation in breast cancer risk in young women in Latin America. Largest studies of prospective design are needed to confirm these findings in premenopausal women.","The authors wish to acknowledge the substantial support provided by the research nurses and health workers as well as Tracy Lignini, Dacia Cristin, Cecile Le Duc, Jordi de Battle, Ana Cristina Ocampo, and Dr Talita Duarte-Salles for the logistics and data basis development.

Likewise, the partial substitution of cement by supplementary cementitious materials also affects the behavior of concrete. Despite the fact that both partial substitutions have undoubted benefits from the point of view of sustainability, their effect on the compressive strength of concrete is difficult to model. This document aims to predict the compressive strength of these special concretes through the use of artificial neural networks (ANN). Training and testing data for the development of the ANN model were prepared using 309 dosages published in 22 different literature sources. The results indicated that the ANN model is an efficient approach for predicting the compressive strength of concretes that incorporate recycled aggregates and supplementary cementitious materials.",Los autores agradecen a la Dirección de Tecnología OSIRIS de la Escuela Colombiana de Ingeniería Julio Garavito por el apoyo y disposición de los servidores para correr los algoritmos de inteligencia artificial sobre los que se trata en el presente trabajo.,,Matéria (Rio de Janeiro),,,,2022,2022,2022,,27,2,e13218,All OA; Gold,Article,"García, Joaquín Abellán; Varón, Fernando Andrés Pineda","García, Joaquín Abellán (Universidad del Norte, Departamento de Ingeniería Civil y Ambiental, Barranquilla, Atlántico, Colombia, PhD, Departamento de Ingeniería Civil y Ambiental, Universidad del Norte, Km 5 Vía Puerto Colombia, Barranquilla, Atlántico, Colombia.); Varón, Fernando Andrés Pineda (Escuela Colombiana de Ingeniería Julio Garavito, Bogotá, Cundinamarca, Colombia, Ingeniero Civil, Escuela Colombiana de Ingeniería Julio Garavito, AK 45 (Autonorte) N.205-59, Bogotá, Cundinamarca, Colombia.)","García, Joaquín Abellán (Universidad del Norte); Varón, Fernando Andrés Pineda (Escuela Colombiana de Ingenieria Julio Garavito)","García, Joaquín Abellán (Universidad del Norte); Varón, Fernando Andrés Pineda (Escuela Colombiana de Ingenieria Julio Garavito)",5,5,,2.32,https://www.scielo.br/j/rmat/a/wHF9ZGnfPqqd6B6M4DwbyqR/?lang=es&format=pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1154656124,33 Built Environment and Design; 3302 Building; 40 Engineering; 4005 Civil Engineering,

Yet, despite an increasing importance of shellcraft as a livelihood activity within the Indo-Pacific, information on the taxa utilized within shellcraft sectors remains scant. To address this knowledge gap, our study examined diversity, in terms of composition and quantities, of marine taxa utilized by artisan households and, collectively, within an artisanal shellcraft sector of Papua New Guinea. For each taxon, critical source habitats were identified, and the geographic scale of exploitation established. Critically, presented data revealed 73 taxa, representing at least 77 species, were utilized within the studied sector. Many of the taxa utilized had not previously been linked to shellcraft sectors, demonstrating that a broader composition of taxa is utilized than previously acknowledged. In terms of quantity, annual utilization within the sector was close to 500,000 individuals, the majority being mollusks of either class Gastropoda (83.6%), represented by 37 genera, or class Bivalvia (9.6%), represented by four genera. There was a strong bias towards a particular species, Chrysostoma paradoxum (78.5% of all individuals), as indicated by indices for the diversity utilized (H′ = 1.23; D = 0.38). However, substantial variation was evident in the diversity of taxa utilized among households (n = 36) engaged in shellcraft (H′ = 1.09 ± 0.71; D = 0.43 ± 0.27), with each household utilizing a unique composition of 19.1 ± 10.6 taxa. Source habitats for taxa ranged from pelagic to benthic intertidal and subtidal substrates, with the geographic scale of exploitation extending to 34 discrete locations up to 417 km away. The array of sector, household, and taxon-specific information presented provides a basis for supporting greater sustainability within shellcraft sectors across the Indo-Pacific, which is discussed within a context of informing community-based resource management, further developing marine aquaculture, and strengthening existing governance.",,This study was supported by the Australian Centre for International Agriculture Research (ACIAR) and the National Fisheries Authority (NFA) of Papua New Guinea within ACIAR Projects FIS/2014/060 and FIS/2019/122 led by PCS at the University of the Sunshine Coast.,Frontiers in Marine Science,,,,2022-11-22,2022,2022-11-22,,9,,1074996,All OA; Gold,Article,"Simard, Nittya S.

Abstract: The text proposes a dialogue between phenomenology and critical theory, specifically in Merleau-Ponty and Adorno.We argue that the work assigned by them to philosophy highlights a dialectical conception of experience in which its meaning as living experience is vindicated (Lebendige Erfahrung). Notwithstanding the strong objections to phenomenology by Adorno, Horkheimer, and Marcuse, we identify by way of introduction the negativity of experience as a characteristic feature in Husserl, Heidegger, and Merleau-Ponty. Second, we deal with the conception of perception as sensible experience in Merleau-Ponty, in order to clarify its dialectical meaning. Third, we point out the importance that Adorno assigns to the conceptual work of philosophy in order to see its dialectical meaning that links it to the living experience of things. Finally, by way of conclusion, we identify meeting points in the conception of dialectics in both authors and present a reflection on its current relevance.",,,Trans/Form/Ação,,,,2022-07,2022,2022-07,,45,3,105-124,All OA; Gold,Article,"Gamboa, Leonardo Verano","Gamboa, Leonardo Verano (Profesor del Departamento de Humanidades y Filosofía de la Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla - Colombia.

In this work, we evaluated the effect of other non-viable L. rhamnosus strains and their peptidoglycans on the respiratory immune response and their impact on primary and secondary respiratory infections. In addition, the duration of the protective effect induced by NV1505 and PG1505 as well as their ability to protect against different Streptococcus pneumoniae serotypes were evaluated. Our results showed that among the five selected L. rhamnosus strains (CRL1505, CRL498, CRL576, UCO25A and IBL027), NV1505 and NVIBL027 improved the protection against viral and pneumococcal infections by modulating the respiratory immune response. Of note, only the PG1505 presented immunomodulatory activities when compared with the other purified peptidoglycans. Studies on alveolar macrophages showed that NV1505 and PG1505 differentially modulated the expression of IL-6, IFN-γ, IFN-β, TNF-α, OAS1, RNAseL and IL-27 genes in response to RSV infection, and IL-6, IFN-γ, IL-1β, TNF-α, CCL2, CXCL2, CXCL10 and IL-27 in response to pneumococcal challenge. Furthermore, we demonstrated that NV1505 and PG1505 treatments protected mice against secondary pneumococcal pneumonia produced by different serotypes of S. pneumoniae until 30 days after stimulation with poly(I:C). This work advances the characterization of the protective effect of NV1505 and PG1505 by demonstrating that they increase resistance against the pneumococcal serotypes 3, 6B, 14 and 19F, with an effect that lasts up to 30 days after the primary viral inflammation. The results also confirm that the immunomodulatory properties of NV1505 and PG1505 are unique and are not shared by other members of this species, and suggest the existence of a capacity to stimulate trained immunity in alveolar macrophages.",,"This study was supported by a Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research (A) (19H00965) from the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS), the research program on development of innovative technology grants (JPJ007097) from the Project of the Bio-oriented Technology Research Advancement Institution (BRAIN), and by Japan Racing Association (JRA) Livestock Industry Promotion Project to Haruki Kitazawa.

Despite an increasingly competitive market, the literature offers little scientific advice regarding decision support systems (DSSs) for the nut sector. In particular, the literature does not present optimization approaches to support decision-making in walnut supply chain management, especially the processing planning. This work provides a DSS that allows the exporter to plan walnut processing decisions taking into account the quality of the raw material, such as size, color, variety, and external and internal defects, in order to maximize the benefits of the business. To formalize the problem, an integer programming model is proposed. The DSS was implemented via a web application for MeliFen, a walnut exporter located near Santiago, Chile. A comparative analysis of the last two years revealed that MeliFen increased its profit by approximately 9.8% using this tool. We also suggest other uses that this DSS provides, besides profit maximization.","The authors would like to thank MeliFen for providing their collected data and for their participation in the case study.

Annual mortality data 2014–2019 by municipality of residence and pooled effect measures for total, natural and specific causes of mortality were used to calculate the number of annual avoidable deaths and years of potential life lost (YPLL) related to the excess of PM2.5 concentration over the current mean annual national standard of 25 µg/m3 and projected standard of 15 µg/m3.ResultsCompared to surface data from 28 municipalities with monitoring stations in 2019, ACAG and CAMSRA models under or overestimated annual mean PM2.5 concentrations. Estimations from ACAG model had a mean bias 1,7 µg/m3 compared to a mean bias of 4,7 µg/m3 from CAMSRA model. Using ACAG model, estimations of total nationally attributable deaths to PM2.5 exposure over 25 and 15 µg/m3 were 142 and 34,341, respectively. Cardiopulmonary diseases accounted for most of the attributable deaths due to PM2.5 excess of exposure (38%). Estimates of YPLL due to all-cause mortality for exceeding the national standard of 25 µg/m3 were 2,381 years.ConclusionComparison of two global air quality models for estimating surface PM2.5 concentrations during 2014–2019 at municipality scale in Colombia showed important differences. Avoidable deaths estimations represent the total number of deaths that could be avoided if the current and projected national standard for PM2.5 annual mean have been met, and show the health-benefit of the implementation of more restrictive air quality standards.","The authors would like to thank Yurley Rojas for her contribution to the generation of maps.

It generates significant computational consumption, reducing the computational efficiency of the victim's computer. This attack has increased due to the rise of cryptocurrencies and their profitability and its difficult detection by the user. The identification and blocking of this type of malware have become an aspect of research related to cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology; in the literature, some machine learning and deep learning techniques are presented, but they are still susceptible to improvement. In this work, we explore multiple Machine Learning classification models for detecting cryptojacking on websites, such as Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting Classifier, k-Nearest Neighbor, and XGBoost. To this end, we make use of a dataset, composed of network and host features' samples, to which we apply various feature selection methods such as those based on statistical methods, e.g., Test Anova, and other methods as Wrappers, not only to reduce the complexity of the built models but also to discover the features with the greatest predictive power. Our results suggest that simple models such as Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and k-Nearest Neighbor models, can achieve success rate similar to or greater than that of advanced algorithms such as XGBoost and even those of other works based on Deep Learning.",,This work was carried out with the support of the program “Convocatoria 779 de 2017- Doctorado Nacional Convocatoria para la Formación de Capital Humano de Alto Nivel para el Departamento de Boyacá–2017” and the Universidad del Norte.,Sensors,,"Nima Karimian, Hossein Sayadi",Machine Learning; Algorithms; Logistic Models,2022-11-27,2022,2022-11-27,,22,23,9219,All OA; Gold,Article,"Aponte-Novoa, Fredy Andrés; Álvarez, Daniel Povedano; Villanueva-Polanco, Ricardo; Orozco, Ana Lucila Sandoval; Villalba, Luis Javier García","Aponte-Novoa, Fredy Andrés (Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla 081007, Colombia; Department of Systems Engineering, Universidad Santo Tomás, Tunja 150003, Colombia); Álvarez, Daniel Povedano (Group of Analysis, Security and Systems (GASS), Department of Software Engineering and Artificial Intelligence (DISIA), Faculty of Computer Science and Engineering, Office 431, Universidad Complutense de Madrid (UCM), Calle Profesor José García Santesmases 9, Ciudad Universitaria, 28040 Madrid, Spain); Villanueva-Polanco, Ricardo (Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla 081007, Colombia); Orozco, Ana Lucila Sandoval (Group of Analysis, Security and Systems (GASS), Department of Software Engineering and Artificial Intelligence (DISIA), Faculty of Computer Science and Engineering, Office 431, Universidad Complutense de Madrid (UCM), Calle Profesor José García Santesmases 9, Ciudad Universitaria, 28040 Madrid, Spain); Villalba, Luis Javier García (Group of Analysis, Security and Systems (GASS), Department of Software Engineering and Artificial Intelligence (DISIA), Faculty of Computer Science and Engineering, Office 431, Universidad Complutense de Madrid (UCM), Calle Profesor José García Santesmases 9, Ciudad Universitaria, 28040 Madrid, Spain)","Aponte-Novoa, Fredy Andrés (Universidad del Norte; Universidad Santo Tomás)","Aponte-Novoa, Fredy Andrés (Universidad del Norte; Universidad Santo Tomás); Álvarez, Daniel Povedano (Complutense University of Madrid); Villanueva-Polanco, Ricardo (Universidad del Norte); Orozco, Ana Lucila Sandoval (Complutense University of Madrid); Villalba, Luis Javier García (Complutense University of Madrid)",4,4,1.88,2.24,https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/22/23/9219/pdf?version=1669945926,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1153190941,46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4611 Machine Learning,
203,pub.1153807513,10.3390/electronics11244220,,,Integral Windup Resetting Enhancement for Sliding Mode Control of Chemical Processes with Longtime Delay,"The effects of the windup phenomenon impact the performance of integral controllers commonly found in industrial processes. In particular, windup issues are critical for controlling variable and longtime delayed systems, as they may not be timely corrected by the tracking error accumulation and saturation of the actuators. This work introduces two anti-windup control algorithms for a sliding mode control (SMC) framework to promptly reset the integral control action in the discontinuous mode without inhibiting the robustness of the overall control system against disturbances. The proposed algorithms are intended to anticipate and steer the tracking error toward the origin region of the sliding surface based on an anti-saturation logistic function and a robust compensation action fed by system output variations. Experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms when they are applied to two chemical processes, i.e., (i) a Variable Height Mixing Tank (VHMT) and (ii) Continuous Stirred Tank Reactor (CSTR) with a variable longtime delay. The control performance of the proposed anti-windup approaches has been assessed under different reference and disturbance changes, exhibiting that the tracking control performance in the presence of disturbances is enhanced up to 24.35% in terms of the Integral Square Error (ISE) and up to 88.7% regarding the Integral Time Square Error (ITSE). Finally, the results of the proposed methodology demonstrated that the excess of cumulative energy by the actuator saturation could reduce the process resources and also extend the actuator’s lifetime span.",,"This research was supported and funded by the Departamento de Ingeniería de Sistemas y Computación with the Universidad Católica del Norte under project 202203010029-VRIDT-UCN.

Specifically, we consider the Chiral–Quintom theory, which is an extension of the Chiral theory, because at least one of the scalar fields can have negative energy density. Moreover, the Quintom theory can be recovered when one of the free parameters of the theory vanishes. We find that Kasner-like and anisotropic exponential solutions exist for specific functional forms of the scalar field potential. Finally, Noether symmetry analysis is applied for the classification of the theory according to the admitted symmetries.

In addition, they are one of the natural hazards that cause the most severe damage to infrastructure and even cause deaths every year. Flow-type landslides are capable of develop in areas with different geomorphological, geological and climatic characteristics. In hyper-arid zones such as the Atacama Desert, these hazards are capable of develop in a timely manner, causing catastrophes. This study analyzes the flow-type landslide in a hyper-arid mountainous area in La Chimba basin of Antofagasta city (Chile). For this, a hydrometeorological analysis is carried out through a pluviometric analysis, statistical analysis of frequencies through the Gumbel probabilistic method of extreme values and determination of maximum flows by obtaining IDF (intensity-duration-frequency) curves and design rainfall intensity as a function of concentration time. To obtain the maximum flows of liquid runoff and debris, for different return periods, the rational method was used with the method proposed by O’Brien. For the determination in the impact zone, the modeling software HEC-RAS (Hydrologic Engineering Center’s River Analysis System) and RAMMS (Rapid Mass Movements). Hydrographs are used for a return period of about 200 years, considered the most unfavorable scenario with the Voellmy–Salm model. To validate the modeling, a morphometric, sedimentological and comparative analysis is carried out between real impact zones of 1991 event and those generated in this study. It is concluded that the sedimentological and morphometric characteristics indicate that the type of flow that it can originate would have a rapid response to rainfall events of great intensity or duration. The modeling provided by HEC-RAS represents a fluvial-type flow, while the RAMMS modeling is closer to the consistency of a flow-type landslide, which is estimated to be closer to reality. The results show that despite being in a hyper-arid zone, the rainfall factor is capable of landslides triggering in mountainous areas.","I.S., N.T., W.R. and F.R. are grateful for the financial support from the Project FONDEF ID 21I10181.

Brazil is an emerging economy and this study can contribute to improving projects of Corporate Social Responsibility developed by companies in emerging countries. Using this information, a SWOT matrix was structured. The research strategies used were bibliographic research (to establish the theoretical foundation) and semi-structured interviews with 18 experienced professionals on Corporate Social Responsibility projects. Data analysis was performed using a content analysis approach and the findings were used to structure the SWOT matrix. Despite some “Strengths” practices mentioned by professionals, many “Weaknesses” were highlighted regarding Corporate Social Responsibility projects developed by Brazilian companies and they may be improved to obtain better results. Interesting “Opportunities” were mentioned, for example, new business possibilities when companies are recognized as socially responsible. Return of branding and marketing due to sustainable positioning of companies are other possible opportunities to be explored. Finally, related to “Threats”, professionals mentioned aspects that may lead to devaluation of Corporate Social Responsibility practices in the Brazilian context, such as prejudices and political polarization. Despite the exploratory nature of the study, the information presented here can greatly contribute to the expansion of debates on Corporate Social Responsibility practices developed by Brazilian companies. It may be used to address public policies and motivate future studies aligned with United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. Researchers can use the findings presented here as a starting point to develop studies on Corporate Social Responsibility issues.",This work was supported by the Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico (CNPq) under Grants 307536/2018–1 and 305442/2018–0.,,Cleaner Engineering and Technology,,,,2022-04,2022,,2022-04,7,,100412,All OA; Gold,Article,"Matsutani, Letícia; Rampasso, Izabela Simon; Serafim, Milena Pavan; Quelhas, Osvaldo L.G.; Filho, Walter Leal; Anholon, Rosley","Matsutani, Letícia (School of Mechanical Engineering, University of Campinas, Campinas, Brazil); Rampasso, Izabela Simon (Departamento de Ingeniería Industrial, Universidad Católica Del Norte, Antofagasta, Chile); Serafim, Milena Pavan (Laboratory of Public Sector Studies, School of Applied Sciences, University of Campinas, Limeira, Brazil); Quelhas, Osvaldo L.G.

We evaluated its performance in controls, Peruvians with MCI or AD.
METHODS: A cross-sectional study of older adults attending a neurology institute in Lima (Peru) with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), ad or cognitively healthy. Test-retest reliability (intraclass correlation coefficient, ICC; internal consistency, Cronbach's alpha) and validity were assessed.
RESULTS: We enrolled 276 individuals (ad: 113, MCI: 68, controls: 95) with no age, sex, educational level, and depressive symptom differences. Reliability was ideal (ICC: .996), and Cronbach's alpha was adequate (.937). The ADCS-ADL could not differentiate MCI from controls but did differentiate ad severity. The ADCS-ADL correlated highly with nearly all tools.
CONCLUSIONS: The ADCS-ADL scale is reliable in a population with ad in Lima, Peru.

Upon impacting the stellar surface, the shocked gas recombines and emits hydrogen spectral lines. To characterize the density and temperature of the gas within these accretion streams, we measure equivalent widths of Brackett (Br) 11–20 emission lines detected in 1101 APOGEE spectra of 326 likely pre-main-sequence accretors. For sources with multiple observations, we measure median epoch-to-epoch line strength variations of 10% in Br11 and 20% in Br20. We also fit the measured line ratios to predictions of radiative transfer models by Kwan & Fischer. We find characteristic best-fit electron densities of n e = 1011–1012 cm−3, and excitation temperatures that are inversely correlated with electron density (from T ∼ 5000 K for n e ∼ 1012 cm−3 to T ∼ 12,500 K at n e ∼ 1011 cm−3). These physical parameters are in good agreement with predictions from modeling of accretion streams that account for the hydrodynamics and radiative transfer within the accretion stream. We also present a supplementary catalog of line measurements from 9733 spectra of 4255 Brackett emission-line sources in the APOGEE Data Release 17 data set.","We thank John Kwan and Will Fischer for their work to calculate and distribute the line ratio predictions that made this analysis possible.

184,pub.1148449904,10.3389/fmars.2022.913972,,,Managing Marine Growth on Historic Maritime Structures: An Assessment of Perceptions and Current Management Practices,"Maritime built heritage (e.g., historic harbors, breakwaters, etc.) is found widely along the coastlines of Europe. Due to its age and traditional construction, built heritage may represent important and largely unidentified hotspots of biodiversity in marine and coastal environments. At the same time, marine growth (e.g., seaweed, mussels, barnacles, etc.) found on these structures may provide both deteriorative and protective functions. To ensure future research focusing on the two-way interactions between marine growth and built heritage addresses the concerns of those responsible for their management, attitudes towards the colonization and growth of marine wildlife must first be evaluated. Such attitudes will shape how marine growth is managed at these sites, which in turn may influence biodiversity and built heritage conservation and any associated values. This study assesses how the growth of sessile species and other surface-colonizing organisms is currently perceived and managed by those responsible for maintaining maritime built heritage, with a particular focus on historic structures constructed of natural stone. Responses from a semi-quantitative online questionnaire of harbormasters, coastal engineers, environmental officers, and heritage managers from around the UK (n = 132) were analyzed alongside a series of semi-structured interviews (n = 29). Our results demonstrate that attitudes towards marine growth are generally in agreement among practitioners irrespective of their occupation or the historic maritime structures they are responsible for managing. Perceptions of marine growth are mostly positive, but concerns exist regarding its impacts on maintenance regimes, the condition of mortar, and health and safety. As well as highlighting opportunities for a more integrated approach to biodiversity and built heritage conservation, the concerns identified require further research attention to help address potential barriers and conflicts that may arise in practice.",We are grateful to all the participants in this study for sharing their knowledge and experience with us.

Because of this, microbial fuel cells have begun to be used as a technology to generate bioelectricity. The main objective of this research was to generate bioelectricity through banana waste using a low-cost laboratory-scale method, achieving the generation of maximum currents and voltages of 3.71667 ± 0.05304 mA and 1.01 ± 0.017 V, with an optimal pH of 4.023 ± 0.064 and a maximum electrical conductivity of the substrate of 182.333 ± 3.51 µS/cm. The FTIR spectra of the initial and final substrate show a decrease in the peaks belonging to phenolic compounds, alkanes, and alkenes, mainly. The maximum power density was 5736.112 ± 12.62 mW/cm2 at a current density of 6.501 A/cm2 with a peak voltage of 1006.95 mV.

Early sex assignment and early diagnosis of different genetic variations with a proper technique are important to reduce mortality and morbidity. Proper early sex identification reduces emotional, social, and psychological stress. Aim: Detection of a spectrum of aberrations in the CYP21A2 gene, including copy number variations, gene conversion, chimeric genes, and point variations. Methods: The CYP21A2 gene was screened using MLPA assay in 112 unrelated Egyptian children with 21-OHD CAH (33 males and 79 females). Results: In the studied group, 79.5% were diagnosed within the first month of life. 46.8% of the genetic females were misdiagnosed as males. Among the copy number variation results, large deletions in 15.4% and three types of chimeric genes in 9% (CH-1, CH-7, and CAH-X CH-1) were detected. Regarding gene dosage, one copy of CYP21A2 was found in 5 cases (4.5%), three copies were detected in 7 cases (6.3%), and one case (0.9%) showed four copies. Eight common genetic variants were identified, I2G, large deletions, large gene conversion (LGC), I172N, F306 + T, -113 SNP, 8bp Del, and exon 6 cluster (V237E and M239K) with an allelic frequency of 32.62%, 15.45%, 7.30%, 3.00%, 2.58%, 2.15%, 0.86%, and 0.86%, respectively. Conclusion: High prevalence of copy number variations highlights the added value of using MLPA in routine laboratory diagnosis of CAH patients.",,,Frontiers in Genetics,,,,2022-03-02,2022,2022-03-02,,13,,785570,All OA; Gold,Article,"Tolba, Aisha; Mandour, Iman; Musa, Noha; Elmougy, Fatma; Hafez, Mona; Abdelatty, Sahar; Ibrahim, Amany; Soliman, Hend; Labib, Bahaaeldin; Elshiwy, Yasmine; Ramzy, Tarek; Elsharkawy, Marwa","Tolba, Aisha (Clinical and Chemical Pathology Department, Cairo University, Giza, Egypt); Mandour, Iman (Clinical and Chemical Pathology Department, Cairo University, Giza, Egypt); Musa, Noha (Diabetes, Endocrine and Metabolism Pediatric Unit, Cairo University, Giza, Egypt); Elmougy, Fatma (Clinical and Chemical Pathology Department, Cairo University, Giza, Egypt); Hafez, Mona (Diabetes, Endocrine and Metabolism Pediatric Unit, Cairo University, Giza, Egypt); Abdelatty, Sahar (Clinical and Chemical Pathology Department, Cairo University, Giza, Egypt); Ibrahim, Amany (Diabetes, Endocrine and Metabolism Pediatric Unit, Cairo University, Giza, Egypt); Soliman, Hend (Diabetes, Endocrine and Metabolism Pediatric Unit, Cairo University, Giza, Egypt); Labib, Bahaaeldin (Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland, Medical University of Bahrain, Giza, Egypt); Elshiwy, Yasmine (Clinical and Chemical Pathology Department, Cairo University, Giza, Egypt); Ramzy, Tarek (Clinical and Chemical Pathology Department, Cairo University, Giza, Egypt); Elsharkawy, Marwa (Clinical and Chemical Pathology Department, Cairo University, Giza, Egypt)","Elsharkawy, Marwa (Cairo University)","Tolba, Aisha (Cairo University); Mandour, Iman (Cairo University); Musa, Noha (Cairo University); Elmougy, Fatma (Cairo University); Hafez, Mona (Cairo University); Abdelatty, Sahar (Cairo University); Ibrahim, Amany (Cairo University); Soliman, Hend (Cairo University); Labib, Bahaaeldin (Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland, Medical University of Bahrain, Giza, Egypt); Elshiwy, Yasmine (Cairo University); Ramzy, Tarek (Cairo University); Elsharkawy, Marwa (Cairo University)",5,4,0.98,2.12,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fgene.2022.785570/pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1145996333,31 Biological Sciences; 3105 Genetics,3 Good Health and Well Being

Design, setting, and participants: This population-based cohort study included all individuals aged 18 years or older, registered in the Information System for Research in Primary Care (SIDIAP), which covers >75% of the population in Catalonia, Spain, from 1 January 2007, to 31 December 2019. Main exposure and outcomes: The exposures were all commercialized opioids and their combinations (ATC-codes): codeine, tramadol, oxycodone, tapentadol, fentanyl, morphine, and other opioids (dihydrocodeine, hydromorphone, dextropropoxyphene, buprenorphine, pethidine, pentazocine). The main outcomes were the annual figures per 1,000 individuals of 1) opioid users, 2) dispensations, and 3) oral morphine milligram equivalents (MME). Results were stratified separately by opioid types, age (5-year age groups), sex (male or female), living area (rural or urban), and socioeconomic status (from least, U1, to most deprived, U5). The overall trends were quantified using the percentage change (PC) between 2007 and 2019. Results: Among 4,656,197 and 4,798,114 residents from 2007 to 2019, the number of opioid users, dispensations and morphine milligram equivalents per 1,000 individuals increased 12% (percentage change: 95% confidence interval (CI) 11.9-12.3%), 105% (95% confidence interval 83%-126%) and 339% (95% CI 289%-390%) respectively. Tramadol represented the majority of opioid use in 2019 (61, 59, and 54% of opioid users, dispensations, and total MME, respectively). Individuals aged 80 years or over reported the sharpest increase regarding opioid users (PC: 162%), dispensations (PC: 424%), and MME (PC: 830%). Strong opioids were increasingly prescribed for non-cancer pains over the years. Conclusion: Despite the modest increase of opioid users, opioid dispensations and MME increased substantially, particularly in the older population. In addition, strong opioids were incrementally indicated for non-cancer pains over the years. These findings suggest a transition of opioid prescriptions from intermittent to chronic and weak to strong and call for more rigorous opioid stewardship.",We thank the physicians and healthcare professionals involved in the recording of healthcare data in busy clinical settings in Catalonia.,"The research was supported by the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Oxford Biomedical Research Centre (BRC).

One Chinese family with clinical diagnosis of SMMCI was collected. Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) array was performed and identified variation was confirmed by whole-genome sequencing (WGS). The reported chromosomal abnormalities and pathogenic genes in patients with SMMCI in literature were reviewed and summarized. The proband was an 8-year-old boy presenting a typical solitary median maxillary central incisor with a range of other phenotypic anomalies, including ptosis. SNP array revealed a 14.3 Mbp heterozygous deletion at chromosome 18p11.32-p11.21 in the proband but not in the unaffected parents. WGS further confirmed the identified deletion. 194 genes were involved in the chromosome region. Among them, 12 genes had been shown to be associated with diseases, including TGIF1, a reported SMMCI gene. The de novo 18p deletion resulted in SMMCI in the present study.

This area presents particular ecological characteristics, such as circulation of currents, hotspot, high productivity and industrial activity. This extreme ecosystem generates the need to understand their dynamics and changes across time and space, as well as to identify the main differences with other OMZs. For this reason, we studied the benthic foraminifera to use them as environmental and oxygenation proxies. For this purpose, two sediment cores (ZA and Z1A) were collected, obtaining 14 samples of the first 8 cm (vertical distribution), and 18 samples with a mini boxcore (spatial distribution). When analyzing the foraminifera community, some similarities were found in environmental characteristics of other OMZs, such as the predominance of Bolivina seminuda, Bolivina costata, Epistominella exigua, Fursenkoina sp., and Nonioella stella (species typical of hypoxic conditions). In addition, a high abundance of angular-asymmetric morphologies was observed, indicating eutrophied silty substrates and low current circulation. However, the Mejillones Bay recorded a particular spatial and vertical dynamics respect to others OMZs, due to presence of other species of Bolivinids not reported for this area before, and a high abundance of Buliminella elegantissima, which is not recorded in most of OMZs. Foraminifera with rounded-symmetric morphologies were present and dominant in deeper layers, reflecting a turbulent and high-energy environment. On the basis of depth and conditions of microxia or dysoxia, no significative pattern of spatial and vertical distribution was observed. The latter can be explained by local factors such as cyclonic and anticyclonic whirlpools, wastewater from industrial activity and natural disaster such a Tsunami occurred in 1877. These factors contributed to the mixture of the benthic foraminifera and prevented the formation of spatial and vertical patterns. Finally, an intensification of hypoxia was identified, indicating microxia (0,01 ml l–1) in the superficial layers (0–3 cm from years 1996 to 2012), while the deeper layers (4–8 cm from years 1985 to 1877) presented foraminiferal species that indicated dysoxia conditions (0,07 ml l–1). The latter differs from other OMZs, which show greater oxygenation in the most superficial layers and microxia in deeper layers. This study represents the first ecological reconstruction using benthic foraminifera proxies for the Mejillones Bay, which results indicate an OMZ with ecological and environmental features that differ from other OMZs.","We thank FONDECYT project 1130511 and Dr. Ruben Escribano from Universidad de Concepción, for obtaining the sediment cores and Prof. Jorge Valdés for obtaining the sediment dredge samples; and the Fondequip EQM 170124-CONICYT project for allowing access to the SU 3500 Hitachi electron microscope at the University of Concepción, Chillán headquarters.

Based on the limitations observed in the treatment of leishmaniasis, such as high cost, significant adverse effects, and the potential for drug resistance, the aim of the present study was to evaluate the leishmanicidal activity of the compounds pseurotin A and monomethylsulochrin isolated from the biomass extract of Aspergillus sp. The chromatographic profiles of the extract were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with a diode-array UV-Vis detector (HPLC-DAD-UV), and the molecular identification of the pseurotin A and monomethylsulochrin were carried out by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry in tandem (LC-ESI-MS-MS) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). Antileishmanial activity was assayed against promastigote and intracellular amastigote of Leishmania amazonensis. As a control, cytotoxicity assays were performed in non-infected BALB/c peritoneal macrophages. Ultrastructural alterations in parasites were evaluated by transmission electron microscopy. Changes in mitochondrial membrane potential were determined by flow cytometry. Only monomethylsulochrin inhibited the promastigote growth (IC50 18.04 ± 1.11 µM), with cytotoxicity to peritoneal macrophages (CC50 5.09 91.63 ± 1.28 µM). Activity against intracellular amastigote forms (IC50 5.09 ± 1.06 µM) revealed an increase in antileishmanial activity when compared with promastigotes. In addition to a statistically significant reduction in the evaluated infection parameters, monomethylsulochrin altered the ultrastructure of the promastigote forms with atypical vacuoles, electron-dense corpuscles in the cytoplasm, changes at the mitochondria outer membrane and abnormal disposition around the kinetoplast. It was showed that monomethylsulochrin leads to a decrease in the mitochondrial membrane potential (25.9%, p = 0.0286). Molecular modeling studies revealed that monomethylsulochrin can act as inhibitor of sterol 14-alpha-demethylase (CYP51), a therapeutic target for human trypanosomiasis and leishmaniasis. Assessed for its drug likeness, monomethylsulochrin follows the Lipinski Rule of five and Ghose, Veber, Egan, and Muegge criteria. Furthermore, monomethylsulochrin can be used as a reference in the development of novel and therapeutically useful antileishmanial agents.",,"This research was funded by the Oswaldo Cruz Institute, by the Coordination for the Improvement of Higher Education Personnel (Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior do Brazil; CAPES), grant number 88887.368507/2019-00, Finance Code 001, and by the Carlos Chagas Filho Foundation for Research Support of the State of Rio de Janeiro (Fundação Carlos Chagas Filho de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado do Rio de Janeiro; FAPERJ), grant number E-26/210.344/2019, E-26/201.765/2019 and E-26/211.680/2021 (269680).

The bulk of the molecular emission is interpreted as being produced in a radially expanding disk-like structure with an expansion velocity vexp ∼ 90 km s−1 and an inclination i ≈ 60° with respect to the line of sight. The observations also reveal a compact high-velocity component, vexp ∼ 280 km s−1, that is aligned perpendicularly to the expanding disk. This component is interpreted as a bipolar outflow with a kinematical age τ ≲ 20 yr, which could either be material that is currently being ejected from V 605 Aql, or is being dragged from the inner parts of the disk by a stellar wind. The dust mass of the disk is in the range M dust ∼ 0.2–8 × 10−3 M ⊙, depending on the dust absorption coefficient. The mass of the CO is M CO ≈ 1.1 × 10−5 M ⊙, which is more than three orders of magnitude larger than the mass of the other detected molecules. We estimate a 12C/13C ratio of 5.6 ± 0.6, which is consistent with the single stellar evolution scenario in which the star experienced a very late thermal pulse instead of a nova-like event as previously suggested.","This Letter makes use of the following ALMA data: ADS/ JAO.ALMA#2019.1.01408.S.

However less is known about pathogen avoidance mechanisms underlying stigma towards SMI, specially in samples of non-industrialised societies of Latin America and the Caribbean. The primary aim of this study was to examine pathogen-disgust sensitivity and danger appraisal mechanisms in responses of stigma towards SMI.MethodsCross-sectional design with convenience sampling. Using an online survey, volunteers at the Universidad del Norte in Colombia (N = 271) provided their sociodemographic data and completed the Three-Domain Disgust Scale (TDDS). Participants were randomised to different descriptions of someone with SMI that varied in terms of aggressiveness (with and without danger) and causes of the SMI. Then, following the attribution questionnaire (AQ-27), respondents reported affective and discriminatory responses to the person in the description.ResultsIncreased disgust sensitivity to pathogen stimuli resulted in stronger reports of anger (β = .14; p = .03), and fear (β = 0.27; p < 0.001). The relationship between disgust sensitivity and discriminatory responses was indirectly mediated by fear towards SMI (Bootstrapped CI =—.04,—.009). Dangerousness attributions in the description of SMI predicted stronger feelings of anger (β = .23; p = 0.001) and fear (β = .40; p < .001), as well increased support for coercion-segregation of SMI (β = .34; p = 0.04), but less intentions to help (β = -.26; p = 0.003). The relationship between dangerousness and support for coercion was mediated by fear (Bootstrapped CI = .72, 1.37) and anger (Bootstrapped CI = .06, .44), whereas pity (Bootstrapped CI = .03, .38) and fear (Bootstrapped CI = -1.39, -.69) mediated responses of support for coercion-segregation of SMI. Attributions about causes and personal responsibility were not significantly linked to stigma towards SMI (p > 0.05).ConclusionsFindings suggested that pathogen avoidance and danger appraisal systems interplay in the generation of discriminatory behaviour towards SMI. Anti-stigma programs and policy makers would benefit from introducing strategies that challenge stereotypes of dangerousness and unpredictability by promoting positive contact with people with SMI.",We would like to thank all the volunteers who took part in this study.,This study was not funded.,BMC Psychiatry,,,Cross-Sectional Studies; Humans; Mental Disorders; Social Perception; Social Stigma; Surveys and Questionnaires,2022-05-12,2022,2022-05-12,2022-12,22,1,330,All OA; Gold,Article,"Chamorro Coneo, Ana; Aristizabal Diazgranados, Edith; Hoyos de los Rios, Olga; Aguilar Santander, Daniela","Chamorro Coneo, Ana (Psychology department, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla-Atlántico, Colombia); Aristizabal Diazgranados, Edith (Psychology department, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla-Atlántico, Colombia); Hoyos de los Rios, Olga (Psychology department, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla-Atlántico, Colombia); Aguilar Santander, Daniela (Psychology department, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla-Atlántico, Colombia)","Chamorro Coneo, Ana (Universidad del Norte)","Chamorro Coneo, Ana (Universidad del Norte); Aristizabal Diazgranados, Edith (Universidad del Norte); Hoyos de los Rios, Olga (Universidad del Norte); Aguilar Santander, Daniela (Universidad del Norte)",3,3,0.76,2.1,https://bmcpsychiatry.biomedcentral.com/track/pdf/10.1186/s12888-022-03951-x,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1147797260,42 Health Sciences; 4203 Health Services and Systems,3 Good Health and Well Being

In this context, this work aimed to study the influence of cucurbit[7]uril (CB7) on dyes such as 7-(dimethylamino)-aza-coumarins, which have more than one basic site along their molecular structure. For this, three 3-styryl derivatives of 7-(dialkylamino)-aza-coumarin dyes (SAC1-3) were synthesized and characterized by NMR, ESI-HRMS and IR. The spectral behaviour of the SACs in the absence and presence of CB7 was studied. The results showed large shifts in the UV-vis spectrum in acid medium: a hypsochromic shift of ≈5400 cm-1 (SAC1-2) and ≈3500 cm-1 (SAC3) in the absence of CB7 and a bathochromic shift of ≈4500 cm-1 (SAC1-3) in the presence of CB7. The new absorptions at long and short wavelengths were assigned to the corresponding protomers by computational calculations at the density functional theory (DFT) level. Additionally, the binding mode was corroborated by molecular dynamics simulations. Findings revealed that in the presence of CB7 the heterocyclic nitrogen was preferably protonated instead of the dialkylamino group. Namely, CB7 induces a change in the protonation preference at the basic sites of the SACs, as consequence of the molecular recognition by the macrocycle.",JJA is grateful for the CONICYT Doctoral Fellowship 21170793.

As a result, vaccination proved to be the most immediate option to control it. However, a sector of the population was reluctant to vaccination. Therefore, this study aimed to analyze the factors associated with the acceptance of COVID-19 vaccines by citizens of northern Peru.
Patients and Methods: The study was observational, descriptive-correlational and the sample was stratified and consisted of 516 citizens from eight departments of northern Peru, who answered an online questionnaire regarding sociodemographic, cultural and health aspects. The data were analyzed using statistical tests of association and a logistic model was estimated to identify factors predicting vaccine acceptance.
Results: Among the factors associated with vaccine acceptance, sociodemographic factors such as age and family income, cultural factors such as level of knowledge, and health factors such as having another chronic disease and a vaccine with a higher confidence (p<0.05) were found. In addition, 12% of the population do not trust them, 10% are afraid that they may cause thrombosis, 13% disagree with vaccination for children, 7% think that a chip will be implanted and 8% believe that their DNA will be changed. However, most people accept vaccination and consider it necessary. A multivariate analysis was also performed for the acceptance of vaccines, which presented a percentage of 80.2% correct in the prognosis.
Conclusion: The multivariate analysis allowed a conclusion that the predictor variables for vaccine acceptance are household income of less than 1000 Peruvian soles per month, low or medium levels of knowledge, and having another chronic disease.",We would like to express our gratitude to Cesar Vallejo University for their support in financing this work.,,Risk Management and Healthcare Policy,,,,2022-09,2022,2022-09,,15,,1705-1715,All OA; Gold,Article,"Yupari-Azabache, Irma Luz; Díaz-Ortega, Jorge Luis; Bardales-Aguirre, Lucia Beatriz; Barros-Sevillano, Shamir; Paredes-Díaz, Susana Edita","Yupari-Azabache, Irma Luz (Grupo de Investigación en Enfermedades Infecciosas y Transmisibles, Universidad César Vallejo, Trujillo, Peru); Díaz-Ortega, Jorge Luis (Grupo de Investigación en Enfermedades Infecciosas y Transmisibles, Universidad César Vallejo, Trujillo, Peru; Escuela Profesional de Nutrición, Universidad Cesar Vallejo, Trujillo, Peru); Bardales-Aguirre, Lucia Beatriz (Departamento de Ciencias, Universidad Privada del Norte, Trujillo, Peru); Barros-Sevillano, Shamir (Grupo de Investigación en Enfermedades Infecciosas y Transmisibles, Universidad César Vallejo, Trujillo, Peru; Sociedad Científica de Estudiantes de Medicina de la Universidad César Vallejo, Trujillo, Peru); Paredes-Díaz, Susana Edita (Grupo de Investigación en Enfermedades Infecciosas y Transmisibles, Universidad César Vallejo, Trujillo, Peru)","Yupari-Azabache, Irma Luz (Universidad César Vallejo)","Yupari-Azabache, Irma Luz (Universidad César Vallejo); Díaz-Ortega, Jorge Luis (Universidad César Vallejo; Universidad César Vallejo); Bardales-Aguirre, Lucia Beatriz (Private University of the North); Barros-Sevillano, Shamir (Universidad César Vallejo; Universidad César Vallejo); Paredes-Díaz, Susana Edita (Universidad César Vallejo)",3,3,,2.1,https://www.dovepress.com/getfile.php?fileID=83755,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1150869782,42 Health Sciences; 4203 Health Services and Systems,3 Good Health and Well Being

In this study, we developed genomic resources for T. crocea. Using low-pass (=low-coverage, ~6×) short read sequencing, this study, for the first time, estimated the genome size, unique genome content, and nuclear repetitive elements, including the 45S rRNA DNA operon, in T. crocea. Furthermore, we tested if the mitochondrial genome can be assembled from RNA sequencing data. The haploid genome size estimated using a k-mer strategy was 1.31-1.39 Gbp, which is well within the range reported before for other members of the family Cardiidae. Unique genome content estimates using different k-mers indicated that nearly a third and probably at least 50% of the genome of T. crocea was composed of repetitive elements. A large portion of repetitive sequences could not be assigned to known repeat element families. Taking into consideration only annotated repetitive elements, the most common were classified as Satellite DNA which were more common than Class I-LINE and Class I-LTR Ty3-gypsy retrotransposon elements. The nuclear ribosomal operon in T. crocea was partially assembled into two contigs, one encoding the complete ssrDNA and 5.8S rDNA unit and a second comprising a partial lsrDNA. A nearly complete mitochondrial genome (92%) was assembled from RNA-seq. These newly developed genomic resources are highly relevant for improving our understanding of the biology of T. crocea and for the development of conservation plans and the fisheries management of this iconic reef-dwelling invertebrate.",J.A.B thanks Vincent P.

There are no articles available in Chile to address academic integrity. The aim of this Study is to assess the perception on the conducts that relate to academic integrity of pharmacist students of the Universidad Católica del Norte, Chile. Method A quantitative, descriptive, cross-sectional and non-probabilistic study for convenience sample, in which an email and social network distributed expert peers aproved survey was conducted, including 11 written simulations showing dishonest conducts; students were required to recognize in every situation the person accountable of misconduct and to point out if they had witnessed these conducts during their college career. Results Out of a total of 126 students, 60% where female, average age of 22.9±3.2 years and 21 (16.7%) belonged to the 2020-2021 cohort. 98.8% of the students recognized plagiarism in the written simulation scenarios; the least recognized conduct was concealment (58.7%; p<0.0001). 90% of the students indicated that they had witnessed at least one situation involving concealment or deceit during their college career. Comparison between 2020-2021 cohort and the rest of the cohorts showed no statistically significant differences neither in a concealment situation (p=0.115) nor in a collusion situation (p=0.186).

The different characteristics, such as structural, morphological, chemical, optical, and dielectric properties were analyzed using X-ray diffraction (XRD), field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM), Raman spectroscopy, ultraviolet-visible diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (UV-DRS), and LCR [inductance (L), capacitance (C), and resistance (R)] meter (volume of the gas-sensing chamber is 650 mm3). It was revealed from the morphological study i.e., from the FESEM that p-type Si NWs are smaller in size than n-type Si NWs which is attributable to the energy band gap. The optical band gap (Eg) is observed to increase from 1.64 to 1.89 eV with the decreasing of the crystallite size and the optical reflection spectra of the Si NWs show a shift toward a lower wavelength (blue shift). Moreover, Raman spectra verified the red-shifted, asymmetrically broadened Raman line-shapes, which provides information about the size confinement effect in Si NWs. The MACE approach is excellent for synthesizing nanowire structures for use in gas-sensing applications due to its flexibility. The sensitivity of synthesized Si NWs was tested for NO2 gas. The sensor method is unique based on the testing of the device in the presence of a test gas because the use of the gas-sensing setup has the potential to measure the change in resistance by varying frequency, temperature, and time.","We would like to thank to Dr. Deepshikha Rathore (ASAS, Amity University, Jaipur, Rajasthan, India) for the use of the dielectric and gas-sensing facilities. we also acknowledge financial support via Senior Research Fellowship (SRF) from the University Grants Commission (UGC), India.

It can lead to serious issues such as rickets, periodontitis, osteoporosis, weakness, muscle ache, and depression. This study was conducted to determine the vitamin D status of patients with CKD in Pakistan and evaluate the correlation between serum vitamin D and renal function progression. Methodology A retrospective study enrolled patients who visited Liaquat National Hospital, Karachi, Pakistan, from January 2015 to January 2021 with a primary diagnosis of CKD. Anthropometric, laboratory, and demographic data were collected from the hospital management information system (HMIS). Results A total of 513 patients with CKD were included in the study. More than 50% of the patients were from stage 3 to stage 5 of CKD while the rest were from stage 1 and stage 2. Significant differences are in relation to calcium, phosphate, and albumin across categories of severity of CKD. Calcium is lowest in stage 5 while phosphate is highest in stage 5. Vitamin D deficiency was found in all participants, but serum vitamin D concentration was lowest in stage 5, i.e., 8.14+6.00. The changing of vitamin D level was associated with the severity of CKD staging (p-value=0.003). Conclusion The current study has shown that vitamin D deficiency, calcium deficiency, and hyperphosphatemia are more common in patients with CKD, but their severity is more common in advanced stages of CKD.",,,Cureus,,"Alexander Muacevic, John R Adler",,2022-01-13,2022,2022-01-13,2022-01-13,14,1,e21221,All OA; Gold,Article,"Kantas, Theodosios; Capriles, Camilo Andrés Avendaño; Babor, Sabir; Tamdin, Tenzin; Al-Rihani, Hady; Thalla, Anusha; Abdelmawla, Ahmed Adel; Muthanna, Fares Mohammed Saeed; Tousif, Sohaib; Capriles, Camilo Andres Avendaño; Tanding, Tenzing","Kantas, Theodosios (); Capriles, Camilo Andrés Avendaño (); Babor, Sabir (); Tamdin, Tenzin (); Al-Rihani, Hady (); Thalla, Anusha (); Abdelmawla, Ahmed Adel (); Muthanna, Fares Mohammed Saeed (); Tousif, Sohaib (); Capriles, Camilo Andres Avendaño (); Tanding, Tenzing ()","Muthanna, Fares Mohammed Saeed ()","Kantas, Theodosios (); Capriles, Camilo Andrés Avendaño (); Babor, Sabir (); Tamdin, Tenzin (); Al-Rihani, Hady (); Thalla, Anusha (); Abdelmawla, Ahmed Adel (); Muthanna, Fares Mohammed Saeed (); Tousif, Sohaib (); Capriles, Camilo Andres Avendaño (); Tanding, Tenzing ()",3,2,0.65,2.08,https://assets.cureus.com/uploads/original_article/pdf/82236/20220317-1132-1ixzlhl.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1144676958,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3202 Clinical Sciences,

We specifically focus on melanoma and heart murmurs. We use a comparative study of two convolution networks in the Complex and Real numerical domains. The idea is to obtain a powerful approach for building portable systems for early disease detection. Two similar algorithmic structures were chosen so that there is no bias determined by the number of parameters to train. Three clinical data sets, ISIC2017, PH2, and Pascal, were used to carry out the experiments. Mean comparison hypothesis tests were performed to ensure statistical objectivity in the conclusions. In all cases, complex-valued networks presented a superior performance for the Precision, Recall, F1 Score, Accuracy, and Specificity metrics in the detection of associated anomalies. The best complex number-based classifier obtained in the Receiving Operating Characteristic (ROC) space presents a Euclidean distance of 0.26127 with respect to the ideal classifier, as opposed to the best real number-based classifier, whose Euclidean distance to the ideal is 0.36022 for the same task of melanoma detection. The 27.46% superiority in this metric, as in the others reported in this work, suggests that complex-valued networks have a greater ability to extract features for more efficient discrimination in the dataset.",CEIBA and Government of Nariño Colombia.

First, researchers use XVIII and XIX century documents to localize the route for subsequent remote sensing and archaeological survey. The results, including evidence of a system of traditional rest stops (pascanas) and shepherd settlements, suggest that native efforts played a crucial role in early mercantile flows. One commonality among native transport practices, even during Inca and Bourbon times, is their independence from any official road infrastructure. Thus, a system of inns testifies to the influence of the Spanish Enlightenment on the Potosí-Cobija route. While the route itself was the result of continuous flows of native people, its story reflects the fusion of mercantile and Andean transportation models and practices. Synthesis of archaeological and historical information suggests early colonial flows under Inca canons of roads and inns (tambos), followed by post-Toledo partial merchantilization with muleteers and mule trains, and Andean implementation of Bourbon dictates in the wake of Bolivian independence.",,,Estudios Atacameños,,,,2022-05-03,2022,2022-05-03,,68,,e5003-e5003,All OA; Gold,Article,"García-Albarido, Francisco","García-Albarido, Francisco (Universidad de Pittsburgh)",,"García-Albarido, Francisco (University of Pittsburgh)",2,2,,2.08,https://revistas.ucn.cl/index.php/estudios-atacamenos/article/download/5003/4062,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1147606308,"33 Built Environment and Design; 3304 Urban and Regional Planning; 35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3509 Transportation, Logistics and Supply Chains; 43 History, Heritage and Archaeology; 4301 Archaeology; 4303 Historical Studies",

To fill this gap, this study provides a contrastive analysis of the subject, direct object, and indirect object pronouns in both Wa­yuunaiki and Spanish. The comparison is part of contrastive linguistics and accounts for the similarities and differences between the grammatical systems of both languages. The results show some similarities between the two languages related to the use of null subjects and the fact that their pronouns, with some excep­tions for the subject, do not establish differences between genders for the first and second person, contrary to what happens for the third. On the other hand, they also reveal some notable differences in relation to the position that these grammatical units occupy in the sentence structure, the marks used when the subject pronoun is not explicitly stated, and the morphological structure.

Inbreds to Develop Hybrids With Low Phytic Acid and High-Quality Protein,"Maize is a major staple crop with high value as food and feed in the poultry sector. Considering the overall nutritional value, maize-based diets comprise two major constraints, i.e., higher phytic acid (PA) and lack of tryptophan. To overcome these issues, a set of identified stable donors for low PA (lpa) and higher tryptophan were crossed in a line × tester fashion, and the hybrids obtained were evaluated at three locations with two replications. Among the inbreds for yield, UMI 1201 and UMI 1205 were the stable good combiners, and for PA, UMI 447 and LPA-2-285 were identified as efficient combiners across locations. Subsequently, 72 hybrids developed from these inbreds had a reduced phytate and higher tryptophan compared with checks having alterations in their yield levels. From Additive Main Effects and Multiplicative Interaction (AMMI) and Genotype main effect plus genotype-by-environment interaction (GGE) biplots, DMR-QPM-09-13-1 × UMI 1099 (PA:9.38 mg/g, trp:0.06%, and yield:184.35 g) and UMI 1205 × UMI 467 (PA:7.04 mg/g, trp:0.06%, and yield:166.39 g) were stable for their high yield with medium PA and tryptophan. Also, across environments, UMI 1200 × UMI 467 had a stable average yield of 129.91 g along with the lowest PA of 4.50 mg/g and higher tryptophan of 0.07%. Thus, these hybrids could be selected and evaluated in upcoming biofortification trials to benefit the poultry sector. Furthermore, the parental inbreds utilized were grouped into heterotic pools to serve as a source population for the development of lpa hybrids in future programs.",,,Frontiers in Plant Science,,,,2022-01-19,2022,2022-01-19,,12,,781469,All OA; Gold,Article,"Pramitha, J.

This study assesses the relationships between ecosystems and people in the rapidly expanding Barranquilla Metropolitan Area (BMA) and extracts lessons for its planning as a BiodiverCity. Using 22 interviews and 400 face-to-face surveys we evaluated: 1) the perception of positive and negative contributions of specific types of ecosystems to human well-being (HWB); 2) the importance and vulnerability of multiple ecosystem services (ES) and disservices (EdS); and 3) the relationships between ES, EdS and relational values (RV), and the influence of socioeconomic factors in providing HWB, using a Structural Equation Model (SEM). Open-ended answers in the survey showed that rural and certain natural ecosystems, such as wetlands, mangroves and tropical dry forest were the least valued ecosystems and included some EdS. In contrast, urban and peri-urban ecosystems, namely the river, beaches, crops, urban green, and backyards, were the most valued. Overall, regulating ES were perceived as critical, as well as important and vulnerable. The results of the SEM model indicate that HWB is not only explained by socioeconomic factors such as income and education, but also by ES. We argue that the necessary sustainable socio-economic development of the BMA should be coupled with an urban planning that integrates ES and their contributions to HWB.",We wish to thank all the people who were interviewed.

We present evidence of these events using sedimentary records that cover the last 1000 years in the Pachingo wetland. Two sediment cores were analyzed for granulometry, XRF, pollen, diatoms and TOC. Three extreme events produced by marine submersion and three by pluvial flooding during El Niño episodes were identified. Geochronology was determined using a conventional dating method using 14C, 210Pbxs and 137Cs). The older marine event (E1) was heavier, identified by a coarser grain size, high content of seashells, greater amount of gravel and the presence of two rip-up clasts, which seems to fit with the tsunami of 1420 Cal AD. The other two events (E3 and E5) may correspond to the 1922 (E3) tsunami and the 1984 (E5) storm waves, corroborated with a nearshore wave simulation model for this period (SWAM). On the other hand, the three flood events (E2, E4, E6) all occurred during episodes of El Niño in 1997 (E6), 1957 (E4) and 1600 (E6), represented by layers of fine-grain sands and wood charcoal remains.","The authors of this document are grateful for the financial support of the Project Fondec-yt#1140851/Fondecyt #1180413 and the international cooperation project Conicyt related to the ANID scholarship program within the framework of the DOCTORATE SCHOLAR-SHIP CONTEST ABROAD, SCHOLARSHIPS CHILE, CALL 2017/Folio 72180323.

A new evolutionary model promoting the role of explosion depth and vent migration during the formation of maars has provided an alternative approach to previous models. Despite a few attempts to test this model with real cases, there is still a need for field-based studies exploring the depositional characteristics of maars to better understand the factors affecting the model constraints. More investigations on less known felsic maars are required to elucidate the possible differences from their more common mafic counterparts. Here, we explore compositionally distinct monogenetic clusters within the Acıgöl caldera (NW of Central Anatolian Volcanic Province, CAVP), with four felsic maars (İnallı, Kalecitepe, Acıgöl, and Korudağ) and one mafic maar (İcik). Our field observations reveal a successive formation between rhyolitic maars and adjacent lava domes. The mugearitic İcik coalescent maar and the adjacent scoria cone are synchronously formed, which is disclosed by the intercalation of the maar and scoria cone deposits. The geochemistry of the maar juveniles suggests a parental basaltic magma source that has been possibly differentiated by varying degrees of fractional crystallization. Our findings identify the main factors in maar formation (i.e., optimum scaled depth-OSD, water-magma interaction, and basement lithology). We also determine some differences between the felsic and mafic maars in the region, such as higher juvenile content, less amount of sedimentary structure, and a clear transition from phreatomagmatic to magmatic explosions through the end of stratigraphy. All these reflect the complexity of maars, mainly formed by different depths of explosions that occurred in the shallowest few hundred meters rather than a systematic incremental decrease of the eruption locus. Further geophysical and geochronological studies will complete our proposed evolutionary model for the youngest monogenetic activity in the Acıgöl caldera that would also warrant volcanic hazard assessment due to the presence of low-velocity anomalies, shallow Curie depths, and prevalent geothermal activity.","GU is grateful to Rana Salihoğlu, Mustafa Erde Bilir, and Jean-Marie Boccard for the preparation of thin sections.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the relationships between positive and negative psychological variables associated with mental health and quality of life in leaders who were victims of the armed conflict in Montes de Maria, Sucre, Colombia. Methodology. Was based on a quantitative paradigm. Twenty-eight peasant leaders participated and were administered scales of social support, resilient coping, perceived stress, post-traumatic stress disorder, anxiety and depression, and health-related quality of life. Results. There were favorable levels in all study variables and linear regression analyses show that depression has a negative weight on physical quality of life and anxiety and perceived stress have a negative weight on mental quality of life.

Invasive cell migration has been linked to the aberrant expression of transmembrane solute-linked carriers (SLC). Here, we explore the role of glucose (SLC5A1) and inositol transporters (SLC5A3) in GBM cell migration. (2) Methods: Using immunofluorescence microscopy, we visualized the subcellular localization of SLC5A1 and SLC5A3 in two highly motile human GBM cell lines. We also employed wound-healing assays to examine the effect of SLC inhibition on GBM cell migration and examined the chemotactic potential of inositol. (3) Results: While GBM cell migration was significantly increased by extracellular inositol and glucose, it was strongly impaired by SLC transporter inhibition. In the GBM cell monolayers, both SLCs were exclusively detected in the migrating cells at the monolayer edge. In single GBM cells, both transporters were primarily localized at the leading edge of the lamellipodium. Interestingly, in GBM cells migrating via blebbing, SLC5A1 and SLC5A3 were predominantly detected in nascent and mature blebs, respectively. (4) Conclusion: We provide several lines of evidence for the involvement of SLC5A1 and SLC5A3 in GBM cell migration, thereby complementing the migration-associated transportome. Our findings suggest that SLC inhibition is a promising approach to GBM treatment.",,This research received no external funding.,Cancers,,"Sheila K.

Relying on the theory of equalising differences, we uncover which workers perceive the highest utility from holding a formal job. Our research sheds light on how workers derive utility from formal and informal job sectors' benefits and to which extent informal workers are willing to accept a lower (or higher) wage to get a job in the formal sector. We also analyse the factors increasing the likelihood to seek employment in the formal sector. Results suggest that, on average, informal workers in the study region are willing to switch to a formal job only if they are offered a salary higher than their current income but are also willing to accept a salary slightly lower than the legal minimum wage in the formal sector.

In our study, we explored the plant defense response induced by Bacillus velezensis BBC047 in relation to its application before or after Botrytis cinerea infection of tomato plants. The inoculation of BBC047 did not considerably alter the gene expression of the tomato tissues, whereas infection with B. cinerea in BBC047-primed plants induced expression of LRR and NBS-LRR receptors, which are highly related to the ISR response. As expected, B. cinerea infection generated molecular patterns typical of a defense response to pathogen infection as the overexpression of pathogenesis-related proteins (PRs) in leaflets distant to the point of infection. The curative treatment (P + F + B) allowed us to gain insights into plant response to an inverted priming. In this treatment, B. cinerea caused the m tissue damage, extending nearly entirely across the entire infected leaves. Additionally, genes generally associated with early SAR response (<16 h) were overexpressed, and apparently, the beneficial strain was not perceived as such. Therefore, we infer that the plant defense to the curative treatment represents a higher degree of biological stress triggered by the incorporation of strain BBC047 as second arriving microorganism. We highlight the importance the phytosanitary status of plants prior to inoculation of beneficial microorganism for the biocontrol of pathogens.","We acknowledge the technical support of Stefanie Maldonado and Williams Arancibia, as well as methodological advice provided by Teodoro Coba de la Peña.

However, there are still challenges and open questions regarding the implementation of practical precoding systems taking the phase uncertainties in estimating the channel state information into account. This work assesses the impact of phase variations and uncertainties inherent to the satellite communication system operating a precoded forward link. Specifically, we address the inability to measure at the user terminal, the absolute phase rotation introduced by the channel, and the transponder local oscillator phase noise effects on the precoding operations considering the use of frequency division multiplexing in the forward-uplink transmission. We formally demonstrate that the system performance for linear and non-linear precoding operations is not affected by the uncertainty in the phase measurements at the user terminal. Additionally, we show that using a single frequency reference for all the local oscillators at the transponder does not avoid the phase variations related to the frequency division multiplexing in the forward-uplink. This work demonstrates that these phase variations would not affect the system performance for an ideal zero-delay precoding loop. However, this is not feasible in practical scenarios, where the phase noise of the frequency reference at the transponder and the loop delay determine the impact on the system performance. We validate our results by simulations considering three frequency references with different stability levels in a typical geosynchronous orbit (GEO) satellite system. Our results suggest that practical implementations of multiuser-MISO precoding systems must include a differential phase synchronization loop to compensate for this performance degradation.","The authors would like to thank Prof. Adriano Camps from Universitat de Barcelona, for his insightful comments which greatly improved the manuscript.","This work was supported by Luxembourg National Research Fund (FNR) under the CORE project COHESAT: Cognitive Cohesive Networks of Distributed Units for Active and Passive Space Applications, under Grant Reference FNR11689919, and the ARMMONY project: Ground-Based Distributed Beamforming Harmonization for the Integration Of Satellite And Terrestrial Networks, under Grant Reference FNR16352790.

The sample included a total of 399 participants (199 patients with HIV and 200 without pathology). The instruments applied for data collection were as follows: a questionnaire on socio-demographic data, the Psychological Well-being Scale, the Resilience Scale and the Coping Strategies Questionnaire. The study period was from February 2018 to January 2020. Patients with HIV had a significantly lower score than healthy subjects, in the resilience factors of perseverance and self-confidence. Subjects with HIV scored less in all dimensions of psychological well-being, with the exception of the dimension of autonomy. Finally, it was observed that HIV-positive subjects used rational coping strategies less frequently than healthy subjects, based on social support seeking and problem-solving coping. However, HIV patients scored higher in emotional coping strategies than healthy individuals.",,This research received no external funding.,Behavioral Sciences,,Scott D.

The Emotion Regulation Questionnaire (ERQ) is used to assess Emotion Regulation. It has been translated into several languages (including Spanish) and has been adapted around the world, but its psychometric properties have not been tested in Ecuador.
Objective: To confirm the bifactor structure of the Emotion Regulation Questionnaire and its reliability in a sample of Ecuadorian college students.
Design: A quantitative and instrumental study using Confirmatory Factor Analysis with Robust Maximum Likelihood estimation. The sample consisted of 400 participants (62.5% women), aged 18 to 25 (M = 21.1; SD = 1.95) from two universities in Ecuador and seven different undergraduate courses.
Results: The bifactor model of the test is confirmed with an adequate adjustment ꭓ2 = 35.99; p > .001; ꭓ2/df = 1.43; CFI = .98; TLI = .96; SRMR = .034; and RMSE A = .033 CI95%: [.033-.052]; ωH = .70; ωHs1 = .23; ωHs2 = .35. Reliability is high with ω = .86 CI95%: [.81-.88].

In line with plant resistance being an efficient tool to control diseases, the findings of a previous work showed that some corn hybrids are resistant to D. maidis. In this work, we assessed the probing behavior of D. maidis on susceptible and resistant corn hybrids using EPG (Electrical Penetration Graph) technology. Feeding of fifteen-day-old, non-inoculative females was recorded for 20 hours, with access to hybrids DK390, DK670, DK79-10, and DK72-10. Compared to the susceptible hybrid DK670, the other hybrids shifted D. maidis probing behavior in a way consistent with plant resistance to insects. This shift consisted of a higher number of probes of short duration, difficulties in attaining phloem ingestion and increase in xylem ingestion. In addition to this common shift in probing behavior, a phloem-located resistance factor was inferred in DK72-10 based on the longer time spent in phloem conditioning to attain phloem ingestion. In contrast, DK390 expressed the highest level of mesophyll and phloem-based resistance, in both cases seen with repeated attempts of short duration, a behavior typically associated with failed attempts to ingest. These findings support and are consistent with previous research, providing useful information to characterize maize hybrids resistant to D. maidis, and consequently to corn stunt.","To Jazmín and Antonella Carpane, for their love, time, and patience while the authors carried out this work.

Intimate partners commit IPV, people with whom the victim shares (or shared) a close personal or sexual relationship. This phenomenon has a great global and national impact. Thus, it is necessary to establish trends of the risk of physical violence to women by their current or former partner in each department of Colombia and its relationship with sociodemographic and health characteristics. This study uses an ecological approach at the departmental level, with victims of intimate partner violence treated at the National Institute of Legal Medicine and Forensic Sciences (INMLyCF). Potential factors were identified through Bayesian factor analysis and were included in the model to estimate risk. The findings show that the Casanare department had the highest risk of producing victims (SMR: 2.545). In departments where the educational level of women is at or below primary school, there is a high-risk β = 0.343 (0.285, 0.397) of them being assaulted. For the departments in which the employment of women is in sales and services or office workers, the associated factor presents a higher risk β = 0.361 (0.201, 0.485), as in the risk related to affiliation with the social security system β = 0.338 (0.246, 0.498), as well as sexual and reproductive life β = 0.143 (0.003, 0.322).

An anthropometric study was carried out on 3166 schoolchildren aged 3 to 14 years from La Plata (Buenos Aires) and nutritional categories were determined based on body weight, height and body mass index (BMI). The MEL was obtained by means of a survey. Most of the population presented healthy nutritional status, although a bias towards overweight was observed, regardless of the MEL. Height was the most informative and differentiating variable of the population in relation to the MEL: schoolchildren whose mothers had low educational levels showed smaller heights and higher risk of suffering from it, while the group with high MEL showed higher heights and sexual dimorphism.

However, these experiences are isolated, and sometimes do not show an integrated vision between different areas of knowledge. This work aims to introduce the lessons learned by creating capstone integrative projects as tools for the design and control of processes in the Faculty of Chemical Engineering of the Universidad Pontificia Bolivariana. The capstone project was developed in randomly selected groups to develop a basic engineering proposal for an industrial process of local or national interest. Validation was carried out, consisting of surveys of 54 students in the last year of the program, an opinion query of 60 recent graduates, and a focus group of five graduates, with a profile of employers, management of innovation, development, and design of chemical processes. Between 2016 and 2020, more than 43 processes were evaluated with students, evidencing a significant improvement in the skills defined by the faculty in the graduation profile.

Commonly, the mineral resources evaluation is carried out hierarchically, considering the definition of geological domains first and then predicting or simulating the metal grades within each domain. Nevertheless, this approach assumes a weak correlation between the metal grades across the domain boundaries, which could not be suitable when gradual variations of the grades are observed across these boundaries. To account for the latter scenario known as soft boundaries, we compare three approaches: (i) a hierarchical prediction of the geological domain indicators and the grade within each domain, (ii) a direct prediction of partial grades, defined as the product of the grade and a geological domain indicator, and (iii) a joint simulation of the grade and geological domain indicators. A porphyry copper deposit in which the copper grade is controlled by mineralogical and rock type domains is used as a case study. When compared with production data, the proposed approaches generate more precise predictions than the traditional approach consisting in accounting for the hard boundaries between mineralogical domains but ignoring the soft boundaries between rock types. The joint simulation approach provides more realistic grade variations across the rock type boundaries, allows for an unbiased prediction of the recoverable resources, and quantifies the uncertainty on these resources based on multiple grade outcomes. Ultimately, we emphasize that identifying the geological controls and the nature (hard or soft) of the geological boundaries, and then defining the proper approaches to account for them is necessary to accurately assess the in-situ and recoverable resources.","The authors are grateful to three anonymous reviewers for their constructive comments and acknowledge the funding of the National Agency for Research and Development of Chile through grants Fondecyt N° 11220464 (M.M) and Fondecyt N° 1210050 (X.E) and ANID PIA AFB180004 (N.M., X.E), and postgraduate study scholarship ANID-Subdirección de Capital Humano/Doctorado Nacional/2022-21220317 (F.K.).",,Ore Geology Reviews,,,,2022-11,2022,,2022-11,150,,105133,All OA; Gold,Article,"Maleki, Mohammad; Mery, Nadia; Soltani-Mohammadi, Saeed; Khorram, Farzaneh; Emery, Xavier","Maleki, Mohammad (Department of Metallurgical and Mining Engineering, Universidad Católica del Norte, Antofagasta, Chile); Mery, Nadia (Department of Mining Engineering, University of Chile, Santiago, Chile; Advanced Mining Technology Center, University of Chile, Santiago, Chile); Soltani-Mohammadi, Saeed (Department of Mining Engineering, University of Kashan, Kashan, Iran); Khorram, Farzaneh (Department of Mining Engineering, University of Chile, Santiago, Chile; Facultad de Ingeniería, Universidad Andrés Bello, Santiago, Chile); Emery, Xavier (Department of Mining Engineering, University of Chile, Santiago, Chile; Advanced Mining Technology Center, University of Chile, Santiago, Chile)","Maleki, Mohammad (Catholic University of the North)","Maleki, Mohammad (Catholic University of the North); Mery, Nadia (University of Chile; University of Chile); Soltani-Mohammadi, Saeed (University of Kashan); Khorram, Farzaneh (University of Chile; Andrés Bello National University); Emery, Xavier (University of Chile; University of Chile)",3,3,,1.83,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.oregeorev.2022.105133,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1151407077,37 Earth Sciences; 3705 Geology,

La enfermedad de Chagas y la leishmaniasis tradicionalmente se han considerado zoonosis endémicas de áreas rurales del país. Sin embargo, la aparición de casos de estas enfermedades en áreas urbanas sugiere nuevos ciclos de circulación de estos parásitos. Por esta razón, se ha propuesto a los perros como centinelas de estos agentes zoonóticos, dado su rol como huéspedes accidentales o reservorios. Objetivo. Evaluar la circulación silenciosa de Leishmania spp. y Trypanosoma cruzi en perros de zonas urbanas de la ciudad de Sincelejo, Sucre. Materiales y métodos. Se analizaron 100 muestras de sangre de perros para amplificar la región ITS1 de Leishmania spp. Las muestras positivas se utilizaron para amplificar la región conservada del minicírculo del ADN del cinetoplasto de Leishmania infantum y para el análisis de polimorfismos de longitud de fragmentos de restricción con la endonucleasa HaeIII. Por otra parte, se amplificó un fragmento del ADN satelital de T. cruzi. Además, se evaluó la presencia de infecciones por Ehrlichia canis y Anaplasma platys, como potencialmente modificadoras de las manifestaciones clínicas. Resultados. De los 100 perros estudiados, se detectó: Leishmania spp. en 32, T. cruzi en 12, ambos parásitos en 7 y L. infantum en 18. Se encontraron infecciones por anaplasmatáceos en 18, y coinfecciones por bacterias y parásitos en 8 de los perros.

The primary pyrometallurgical route to produce ferronickel from laterite nickel ores is the Rotary Kiln-Electric Furnace (RKEF) process. In the RKEF process, minerals undergo calcination and partial reduction in a rotary kiln. Large amounts of mineral dust leave the kiln entrained in flue gases. Dust insufflation is a potential solution in which dust particles enter directly into the burner flame. The aim is that the insufflated dust softens, agglomerates, and finally joins the minerals stream that goes into the electric furnace. We applied data analytics techniques to a 1-year operation database to assess the operation before and after dust insufflation in an industrial rotary kiln furnace. Bootstrapping revealed statistically significant differences in the operation with and without dust insufflation. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and k-means clustering were used as exploratory techniques. PCA showed subsets of variables that significantly influence the dataset variance, and k-means allowed distinguishing operation conditions for dust insufflation with encouraging results for the calcine-to-fresh mineral and the natural gas-to-calcine ratios. These results pave the way towards successfully implementing dust insufflation in the RKEF process.",The research leading to these results has received funding from MINCIENCIAS under the project “Incremento en la Capacidad Operativa y Eficiencia de Producción de CERRO MATOSO S.A” with contract number 4684-786-66497.,,Alexandria Engineering Journal,,,,2022-04,2022,,2022-04,61,4,3215-3228,All OA; Gold,Article,"Romero, Johanna M.; Pardo, Yuleisy S.; Parra, Maricel; De J.

When the contagion was at a community level, quarantine measures were taken, causing population immobility. The lack of alternatives significantly altered the satisfaction of people’s basic needs. The objective of this article was to explore and generate real accessibility indicators for goods and services, in addition to the levels of spatial satisfaction of the population, at a regional level in the metropolitan area of Concepción, Chile. To focus on citizens’ social welfare, social geomarketing was applied as the method, obtaining the delimitation of accessibility areas for goods and services through population surveys and the delimited spatial decelerated satisfaction. Pre-pandemic and during-pandemic situations were evaluated. The results showed an improvement in the delimitation of accessibility areas of goods and services, as the citizens’ preferences as consumers were included, revealing an increment during the pandemic, especially in the food typology. In the same way, the existence of geospatial satisfaction and its increment under the pandemic context when accessing the diverse facilities that offer these kinds of goods was confirmed. In conclusion, the satisfaction areas were useful for analyzing urban form designs and focusing them to promote revitalization, as well as for inclusive and sustainable urbanization and proactive measures to make urban areas more resilient to natural or human risks, incorporating the role of geospatial tools for promoting sustainable urban development.","The theoretical framework, methodological foundations, data, spatial analysis, and results, which the application calculated and delivered, are part of the doctoral thesis associated with the project COVID0359.

262,pub.1151017201,10.3390/min12091162,,,Using Waste Brine from Desalination Plant as a Source of Industrial Water in Copper Mining Industry,"One of the main challenges of seawater desalination is a large volume of waste brine production that is commonly discharged into the sea and may threaten the marine ecosystem. This is critical in regions where conventional water resources are scarce and desalinated seawater is an alternative to meet water demand. Especially in regions where the mining industry is a key player in the economic development. The novelty of this research consists in the determination of the potential use of waste brine, discharged from the reverse osmosis process, as a source of industrial water in copper mining industry. To enable the waste brine applicability, there should be reduced calcium and magnesium ions concentration for improving copper recovery in the froth flotation process. The flotation tests were conducted in a batch cell with synthetic minerals composed of chalcopyrite, kaolinite, and quartz using different water qualities. The results showed that treated waste brine significantly improved copper recovery compared to untreated waste brine and seawater. Similar copper recovery was achieved when flotation test was performed with tap water and treated waste brine. Therefore, treated waste brine could provide a suitable water quality required in the froth flotation process as an alternative non-conventional water resource.",,This research was supported by ANID/ACT210027.,Minerals,,,,2022-09-14,2022,2022-09-14,,12,9,1162,All OA; Gold,Article,"Cruz, Constanza; Herrera-León, Sebastián; Calisaya-Azpilcueta, Daniel; Salazar, Ruth; Cisternas, Luis A.; Kraslawski, Andrzej","Cruz, Constanza (Departamento de Ingeniería Química, Universidad Católica del Norte, Antofagasta 1270709, Chile; School of Engineering Science, LUT University, P.O.

Due to the amount of iron in the final product, a study is proposed to evaluate different reagents for eliminating iron from the autoclave outcome, minimizing Zn losses. The colloid formation, zinc losses, iron removal, phase separation stage characteristics (sedimentation and filtering), and reagent costs were used to evaluate six-iron precipitating reagents: CaO, Na2CO3, CaCO3, NaOH, MgO, and Ca(OH)2. CaO shows 99.5% iron removal and 87% zinc recovery. Although CaO was one of the reagents with significant zinc recovery, it presented operational difficulties in the filtration stage due to the high viscosity of the mixtures. Finally, Ca(OH)2 is the reagent recommended due to its ease of use, zinc yield recovery, electrowinning efficiency, and iron precipitate filtration rate.

Methods: Ethnographic data was obtained through the application of in-depth interviews centered on topics such as migration history, personal experience with COVID-19 and beliefs about the pandemic. This information was further analyzed through a narrative approach and Atlas Ti.
Main findings: US Title 42 and the Migrant Protection Protocols (MPP) have stranded thousands of individuals in the US-Mexico border region, a situation that has overcrowded the available shelters in the area and forced many of the immigrants to live on the streets and in improvised encampments. Thus, exposing them to a higher risk of contagion. Furthermore, the majority of the interviewed Central American and Caribbean immigrants consider that Mexico is more lenient when it comes to the enforcement of sanitary measures, especially when compared to their countries of origin. Finally, vaccination hesitancy was low among the interviewees, mainly due to the operative aspects of the vaccination effort in Mexico and the fear of ruining their chances to attain asylum in the US. These findings are backed up by the discovery of five recurring narratives among the interviewees regarding: (1) The pandemic's psychological impact. (2) The uncertainty of being stranded in Mexico and the long wait. (3) Their fear of violence over the fear of contagion. (4) The perceived leniency of Mexico with the pandemic when compared to their countries of origin, and (5) their beliefs about the pandemic and vaccines.
Key finding: The mental health of stranded Central American and Caribbean immigrants in Mexico during the COVID-19 pandemic is mostly affected by their inability to make it across the US-Mexico border using legal means.",We would like to acknowledge the role and guidance provided by our group of colleagues that participated in the aforementioned research project.,"Funding was provided by the Canadian Institutes for Health Research (CIHR), as part of a grant issued to the COVID-19's differential impact on the mental and emotional health of Indigenous Peoples and Newcomers: A socioeconomic analysis of Canada, US and Mexico project.",Frontiers in Public Health,,,Humans; Mental Health; COVID-19; Mexico; Cities; Pandemics; Emigrants and Immigrants,2022-11-09,2022,2022-11-09,,10,,982389,All OA; Gold,Article,"Piñeiro, Rodolfo Cruz; Ibarra, Carlos S.","Piñeiro, Rodolfo Cruz (Population Studies Department, El Colegio de la Frontera Norte, Tijuana, Mexico); Ibarra, Carlos S.

The scallop Argopecten purpuratus is an important economic resource that is cultivated in areas where coastal upwelling is intensifying by climate change, potentially affecting host-microbiota interactions. Thus, we first characterized the bacterial community present in gills from cultivated scallops (by 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing) and assessed their stability and functional potential in animals under farm and laboratory conditions. Results showed that under both conditions the gill bacterial community is dominated by the phylum Campylobacterota (57%), which displays a chemoautotrophic potential that could contribute to scallop nutrition. Within this phylum, two phylotypes, namely symbionts A and B, were the most abundant; being, respectively, taxonomically affiliated to symbionts with nutritional functions in mussel gills, and to uncultured bacteria present in coral mucus. Additionally, in situ hybridization and scanning electron microscopy analyses allowed us to detect these symbionts in the gills of A. purpuratus. Given that shifts in upwelling phenology can cause disturbances to ecosystems, affecting bacteria that provide beneficial functions to the host, we further assessed the changes in the abundance of the two symbionts (via qPCR) in response to a simulated upwelling intensification. The exposure to combined decreasing values in the temperature, pH, and oxygen levels (upwelling conditions) favored the dominance of symbiont B over symbiont A; suggesting that symbiont abundances are modulated by these environmental changes. Overall, results showed that changes in the main Campylobacterota phylotypes in response to upwelling intensification could affect its symbiotic function in A. purpuratus under future climate change scenarios. These results provide the first insight into understanding how scallop gill-microbial systems adapt and respond to climate change stressors, which could be critical for managing health, nutrition, and scallop aquaculture productivity.","We gratefully acknowledge Ana Mercado, Ana Valdivia, and Jorge Inostroza for technical assistance and German Lira from Laboratorio Central de Cultivos Marinos from UCN for scallop procurement and maintenance.","This study was supported by the Chilean National Fund for Scientific and Technological Development, FONDECYT #1200129 to P.S. and K.B, and FONDECYT #3170156 to L.R.

In teleost fish, the brain and gastrointestinal tract integrate signals that include the perception of stress factors regulating physiological responses, such as social stress by fish population density, where peripheral and central signals, such as peptide hormones, are the main regulators. Therefore, we proposed in this study to analyze the effect of different stock densities (SD) in the gene expression of brain neuropeptide Y (NPY) and calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), together with the gastrointestinal peptide hormones leptin (Lep), vasointestinal peptide (VIP), and protachykinin-1 (Prk-1) in Salmo salar post-smolt. The coding sequence of S. salar VIP and Prk-1 precursors were firstly cloned and characterized. Then, the mRNA expression of these genes, together with the NPY, Lep, and CGRP genes, were evaluated in post-smolts kept at 11 Kg/m3, 20 Kg/m3, and 40 Kg/m3. At 14 days of culture, the brain CGRP and liver leptin mRNA levels increased three and tenfold in the post-smolt salmons kept at the highest SD, respectively. The high levels of leptin were kept during all the fish culture experiments. In addition, the highest expression of intestine VIP mRNA was obtained on Day 21 in the group of 40 Kg/m3 returning to baseline on Day 40. In terms of stress biochemical parameters, cortisol levels were increased in the 20 Kg/m3 and 40 Kg/m3 groups on Day 40 and were the highest in the 20 Kg/m3 group on Day 14. This study provides new insight into the gastrointestinal signals that could be affected by chronic stress induced by high stock density in fish farming. Thus, the expression of these peptide hormones could be used as molecular markers to improve production practices in fish aquaculture.",,"This research was funded by Program for Sanitary Management in Aquaculture of the Ministry of Economy, Development and Tourism of Chile (FIE-2015-V014 201708070149 to L.M.) and the ANID-Chile Grants: FONDECYT 11180042 (C.A.Á.), FONDECYT 1191763 (L.M.), FONDECYT 1210056 (F.G.), and REDES BIO0009 (P.A.A).",Animals,,,,2022-05-04,2022,2022-05-04,,12,9,1174,All OA; Gold,Article,"Álvarez, Claudio A.; Santana, Paula A.; Cárcamo, Claudia B.; Cárdenas, Constanza; Morales-Lange, Byron; Ramírez, Felipe; Valenzuela, Cristian; Boltaña, Sebastián; Alcaíno, Javier; Guzmán, Fanny; Mercado, Luis","Álvarez, Claudio A.

259,pub.1144368125,10.1016/j.aqrep.2021.100995,,,Continuous egg separation of the copepod Acartia tonsa. Implications for increasing adult density at an intensive level,"The concept of continuous egg and adult separation was studied to evaluate the possibility of cultivating the copepod Acartia tonsa at high density (> 2.5 adults mL−1). First experiment: Densities of 5, 10, 15, 30, and 45 adults mL−1 were evaluated. For this, eggs spawned were allowed to settle quickly, harvested, and counted to determine the specific and relative egg production (SEP and REP, eggs female−1 day−1 and eggs mL−1 day−1, respectively). Second experiment: Mature females were spawned on slides to observe the shape of the freshly spawned eggs. Third experiment: respiratory rate under four corporal velocities in the filter system were evaluated (57, 115, 173 and 231 PL min−1; PL, prosome length), corresponding to four water exchange rates (50, 100, 150 and 200 volumes day−1). Fourth experiment: A high-density (7 adults mL−1) prototype based on continuous egg separation was designed and compared with daily egg harvest for siphon (control system). The specific egg production (SEP, egg female−1 day−1) and relative egg production were determined (REP, eggs mL−1 day−1). The SEP decreased with culture density (p < .05), but quickly egg separation allowed a high REP when a density of 10 adults mL−1 was used. Freshly spawned eggs were elongated for the first 7 min, which suggests fragility when freshly spawned. Water velocity increased adult respiratory rate (p < .05), and egg production reached a maximum at 100 volumes per day (p < .05).

This study contributes to intensive A. tonsa culture; a superior density of 5 mL−1 is possible with a high water exchange rate and careful egg harvesting.","This research was funded by Fish Research Center, University of Córdoba, Colombia.

The classical Lagrangian of the model is scale invariant, but radiative corrections to the effective potential can lead to dimensional transmutation, when a dimensionless parameter (coupling constant) of the classical Lagrangian is exchanged for a dimensionful one, a dynamically generated mass for the fermion fields. For the model we are considering, perturbative calculations of the effective potential and renormalization group functions up to three loops are available, but we use the RGE and the leading logs approximation to calculate an improved effective potential, including contributions up to six loops orders. We then perform a systematic study of the general aspects of DSB in the GN model with finite N, comparing the results we obtain with the ones derived from the original unimproved effective potential we started with.","The authors would like to thank André Lehum for his comments about the manuscript, as well as the referee that provided very insightful comments that helped us to improve our paper.

Moreover, an increase in the number of visitors and tourism generated new interactions that often have unknown impacts on a particular community and its people. A qualitative methodology consisting of observations and semi-structured interviews was employed to evaluate the evolution of customs during the celebration of Lajas population religious functions between 2003 and 2018. The study results revealed that in the town of Lajas, while the population recognized ways in which their customs have changed in recent decades, they were unable to determine whether or not such changes affected their cultural identity and the preservation of their cultural heritage. Further, on analyzing the obtained data and comparing it with the proposed theoretical framework, we observed a gap between social participation and public administration management, the transformation of the existing model to a centralized management control model, and the creation of an official identity. Hence, such observations are necessary to lay the foundation for future studies to avoid negative impacts and generate sustainable management strategies that would justify the effort in conserving cultural identity.","To the community of Lajas, in the region of Cajamarca, province of Chota, for all the support provided for the photographic evidence, oral testimonies and documents collected during the years 2003 to 2018.","This research was funded by Cesar Vallejo University, grant number N°292-2022-VI-UCV code P-2022-27.",Heritage,,,,2022-12-30,2022,2022-12-30,,6,1,351-364,All OA; Gold,Article,"Palacios, Miguel Angel Ruiz; Villalobos, Lourdes Guevara; de Oliveira, Cristiana Pereira Teixeira; González, Elena María Pérez","Palacios, Miguel Angel Ruiz (Departament of Business, North Lima Campus, Universidad César Vallejo, Lima 15314, Peru; Faculty of Business, Universidad Privada del Norte, Lima 15314, Peru); Villalobos, Lourdes Guevara (Faculty of Business, Universidad Privada del Norte, Lima 15314, Peru); de Oliveira, Cristiana Pereira Teixeira (Universidad Europea de Canarias, 38300 Tenerife, Spain); González, Elena María Pérez (Departament of Social Sciences, Universidad Europea de Canarias, 38300 Tenerife, Spain)","Palacios, Miguel Angel Ruiz (Universidad César Vallejo; Private University of the North)","Palacios, Miguel Angel Ruiz (Universidad César Vallejo; Private University of the North); Villalobos, Lourdes Guevara (Private University of the North); de Oliveira, Cristiana Pereira Teixeira (European University of the Canary Islands); González, Elena María Pérez (European University of the Canary Islands)",1,1,,1.73,https://www.mdpi.com/2571-9408/6/1/18/pdf?version=1673340561,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1154187787,"43 History, Heritage and Archaeology; 4302 Heritage, Archive and Museum Studies",

Energy production costs are strongly affected by the use of scarcely efficient cleaning techniques that are not suitable for a particular type of contaminant, climate, and installation. This paper introduces a technology that is suitable for studying soiling, thus decreasing the number of variables studied and reliable results were obtained. Our attention is focused on deposited material physicochemistry, local geology, and installation effects. Analysis via scanning electron microscopy and pits revealed a similarity between local geological processes and module soiling, with gypsum being responsible for soil and module cementation. Analysis with Atomic Force Microscopy confirms the cementation effect and crust formation on the lower part of the photovoltaic glass, the latter concentrating in the greatest amount of cemented material. Using a solar simulator, the characteristic curves produced by the cemented material were studied, and it was determined that the lower part of the glass produced the greatest losses (27%). Thus, a non-uniformity deposition was generated, creating resistance between the cells. From the data obtained, it was possible to make recommendations regarding making decisions about plant cleaning, instead of only considering the physicochemical analysis of the deposited material.",,"The authors thank ANID/FONDAP/15110019 “Solar Energy Research Center” SERC-Chile; Chilean Economic Development Agency (CORFO), contract No17PTECES-75830 for project “AtaMoS TeC”; GORE-Antofagasta, Chile, FIC-R Antofagasta Project 2017 BIP code 30488824-0; Unidad de equipamiento científico “MAINI” at Universidad Católica del Norte for supporting sample preparation and data analysis and generation through the SEM and AFM team; ANID/FONDECYT Project N°11190289 (APC funding project); and FONDECYT Project 1181302 for IPCE use.",Applied Sciences,,,,2022-10-20,2022,2022-10-20,,12,20,10582,All OA; Gold,Article,"Olivares, Douglas; Taquichiri, Abel; Ferrada, Pablo; Marzo, Aitor; Henríquez, Mauro; Espinoza, Darío; Fuentealba, Edward; Llanos, Jaime","Olivares, Douglas (Centro de Desarrollo Energético Antofagasta, Universidad de Antofagasta, Antofagasta, Angamos 601, 1270300 Antofagasta, Chile); Taquichiri, Abel (Centro de Desarrollo Energético Antofagasta, Universidad de Antofagasta, Antofagasta, Angamos 601, 1270300 Antofagasta, Chile); Ferrada, Pablo (Centro de Desarrollo Energético Antofagasta, Universidad de Antofagasta, Antofagasta, Angamos 601, 1270300 Antofagasta, Chile); Marzo, Aitor (Freelance Solar Energy Researcher, 04007 Almería, Spain); Henríquez, Mauro (Centro de Desarrollo Energético Antofagasta, Universidad de Antofagasta, Antofagasta, Angamos 601, 1270300 Antofagasta, Chile); Espinoza, Darío (Departamento de Química, Universidad Católica del Norte, Angamos 610, 1270709 Antofagasta, Chile); Fuentealba, Edward (Centro de Desarrollo Energético Antofagasta, Universidad de Antofagasta, Antofagasta, Angamos 601, 1270300 Antofagasta, Chile); Llanos, Jaime (Departamento de Química, Universidad Católica del Norte, Angamos 610, 1270709 Antofagasta, Chile)","Olivares, Douglas (University of Antofagasta)","Olivares, Douglas (University of Antofagasta); Taquichiri, Abel (University of Antofagasta); Ferrada, Pablo (University of Antofagasta); Marzo, Aitor (Freelance Solar Energy Researcher, 04007 Almería, Spain); Henríquez, Mauro (University of Antofagasta); Espinoza, Darío (Catholic University of the North); Fuentealba, Edward (University of Antofagasta); Llanos, Jaime (Catholic University of the North)",1,1,,1.73,https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3417/12/20/10582/pdf?version=1666257460,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1152090019,"40 Engineering; 43 History, Heritage and Archaeology; 4302 Heritage, Archive and Museum Studies",7 Affordable and Clean Energy

This enables students to experience reading and writing as disciplinary academic practices. However, few lecturers have the language knowledge and the pedagogical expertise to do this. The Reading to Learn pedagogy provides a scaffolded methodology that lecturers in higher education can adapt. We reflect on our own experiences of using these scaffolded academic literacy practices in three cases: with first year biology students, biochemistry Honours students and Masters in Education students. We argue that scaffolded academic literacy practices are useful because they emphasise both the reading and writing of texts in the discipline, provide an educational approach to plagiarism by modelling how to meaningfully paraphrase academic text, and support learner engagement. Additionally, the professional learning opportunities help academics to develop both knowledge of language and a clear methodology which can be adapted to a range of disciplines and levels.",,,Critical Studies in Teaching and Learning,,,,2022,2022,2022,,10,1,165-185,All OA; Gold,Article,"Bertram, Carol; Johnson, Kathryn; Goldring, J.P.

We had previously shown that cultured macrophages infected with Leishmania parasites release EVs (LiEVs) containing parasite-derived molecules. In this study we show that LdVash, a molecule previously identified in LiEVs from L. donovani infected RAW264.7 macrophages, is widely distributed in the liver of L. donovani infected mice. This result shows for the first time that parasite molecules are released in EVs and distributed in infected tissues where they can be endocytosed by cells in the liver, including macrophages that significantly increase numbers as the infection progresses. To evaluate the potential impact of LiEVs on macrophage functions, we show that primary peritoneal exudate macrophages (PECs) express transcripts of signature molecules of M2 macrophages such as arginase 1, IL-10, and IL-4R when incubated with LiEVs. In comparative studies that illustrate how intracellular pathogens control the composition and functions of EVs released from macrophages, we show that EVs from RAW264.7 macrophages infected with Salmonella Typhimurium activate PECs to express transcripts of signature molecules of M1 macrophages such as iNOS, TNF alpha, and IFN-gamma and not M2 signature molecules. Finally, in contrast to the polarized responses observed in in vitro studies of macrophages, both M1 and M2 signature molecules are detected in L. donovani infected livers, although they exhibit differences in their spatial distribution in infected tissues. In conclusion, EVs produced by macrophages during Leishmania infection lead to the gene expression consistent with M2 polarization. In contrast, the EVs produced during S. Typhimurium infection stimulated the transcription of genes associated with M1 polarization.",,"This work was supported by U. S.

A pot experiment was undertaken, to evaluate the effect of Phosphogypsum (PG) and Gypsum (G), to remove salts, nutrients and trace elements in leached water from saline and saline-sodic soils. In order to determine the efficiency and safety of these amendments, as an affordable strategy, for overcoming salinity and sodicity stress. The PG at 0, 15, 30 and 45 t/ha and G at 15 t/ha were mixed with the upper 9 cm soil in the pot before being leached. The soils were collected from Sed El Masjoune and Sidi El Mokhtar areas of morocco with ECe of 140.6 mS/cm and 11.7 mS/cm respectively. The highest doses of PG (≥30 t/ha) removed significant amount of salts and nutrients. Calcium sulfate supplies calcium ions to replace salt ions (sodium, especially). The replaced salts are leached from the soil. The PG was more efficient compared to G in terms of salts leaching. Quantities of trace elements in the leachate, for most analyzed elements, were below the recommended limits of drinking and irrigation water.

There is a growing number of studies with multimodal approaches in the management of these patients, combining physical and behavioral therapies such as osteopathic manipulative treatment, associating pain education and clinical hypnosis. The aim of the present study will be to evaluate the effects of osteopathic manipulative treatment (OMT) associated with pain neuroscience education (PNE) and clinical hypnosis (CH) on pain and disability in participants with CLBP compared to PNE, CH, and sham therapy.MethodsA randomized controlled clinical trial will be conducted in participants aged 20–60 years with CLBP who will be divided into two groups. Group 1 will receive PNE and CH associated with OMT, and G2 will receive PNE, CH, and sham therapy. In both groups, 4 interventions of a maximum of 50 min and with an interval of 7 days will be performed. As primary outcomes, pain (numerical pain scale), pressure pain threshold (pressure algometer), and disability (Oswestry Disability Questionnaire) will be evaluated and, as a secondary outcome, global impression of improvement (Percent of Improvement Scale), central sensitization (Central Sensitization Questionnaire), biopsychosocial aspects (Start Beck Toll Questionnaire), and behavior of the autonomic nervous system (heart rate variability) will be assessed. Participants will be evaluated in the pre-intervention moments, immediately after the end of the protocol and 4 weeks after the procedures. Randomization will be created through a simple randomized sequence and the evaluator will be blinded to the allocation of intervention groups.DiscussionThe guidelines have been encouraging multimodal, biopsychosocial approaches for patients with CLBP; in this sense, the results of this study can help clinicians and researchers in the implementation of a model of treatment strategy for these patients. In addition, patients may benefit from approaches with minimal risk of deleterious effects and low cost. In addition, it will enable the addition of relevant elements to the literature, with approaches that interact and do not segment the body and brain of patients with CLBP, allowing new studies in this scenario.Trials registrationDate: September 4, 2021/Number: NCT05042115.",Not applicable.,The authors own the funding.,Trials,,,"Humans; Low Back Pain; Manipulation, Osteopathic; Pain Measurement; Educational Status; Hypnosis; Chronic Pain; Treatment Outcome; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic",2022-12-30,2022,2022-12-30,,23,1,1066,All OA; Gold,Article,"Luchesi, Guilherme Luis Santana; da Silva, Anne Kastelianne França; Amaral, Otávio Henrique Borges; de Paula, Vanessa Cristina Godoi; Jassi, Fabrício José","Luchesi, Guilherme Luis Santana (Postgraduate Program in Human Movement Sciences at the Health Sciences Center of the State University of the North of Paraná, Alameda Padre Magno, n° 841 - Nova Jacarezinho, 86400-000, Jacarezinho, Paraná, Brazil; Docusse Institute of Osteopathy and Manual Therapy (IDOT), Presidente Prudente, São Paulo, Brazil); da Silva, Anne Kastelianne França (Docusse Institute of Osteopathy and Manual Therapy (IDOT), Presidente Prudente, São Paulo, Brazil; Post-doctoral Program of São Paulo State University (UNESP), Faculty of Science and Technology, Presidente Prudente, São Paulo, Brazil); Amaral, Otávio Henrique Borges (Postgraduate Program in Human Movement Sciences at the Health Sciences Center of the State University of the North of Paraná, Alameda Padre Magno, n° 841 - Nova Jacarezinho, 86400-000, Jacarezinho, Paraná, Brazil); de Paula, Vanessa Cristina Godoi (Postgraduate Program in Human Movement Sciences at the Health Sciences Center of the State University of the North of Paraná, Alameda Padre Magno, n° 841 - Nova Jacarezinho, 86400-000, Jacarezinho, Paraná, Brazil); Jassi, Fabrício José (Postgraduate Program in Human Movement Sciences at the Health Sciences Center of the State University of the North of Paraná, Alameda Padre Magno, n° 841 - Nova Jacarezinho, 86400-000, Jacarezinho, Paraná, Brazil; Docusse Institute of Osteopathy and Manual Therapy (IDOT), Presidente Prudente, São Paulo, Brazil)","Luchesi, Guilherme Luis Santana (Postgraduate Program in Human Movement Sciences at the Health Sciences Center of the State University of the North of Paraná, Alameda Padre Magno, n° 841 - Nova Jacarezinho, 86400-000, Jacarezinho, Paraná, Brazil; Docusse Institute of Osteopathy and Manual Therapy (IDOT), Presidente Prudente, São Paulo, Brazil)","Luchesi, Guilherme Luis Santana (Postgraduate Program in Human Movement Sciences at the Health Sciences Center of the State University of the North of Paraná, Alameda Padre Magno, n° 841 - Nova Jacarezinho, 86400-000, Jacarezinho, Paraná, Brazil; Docusse Institute of Osteopathy and Manual Therapy (IDOT), Presidente Prudente, São Paulo, Brazil); da Silva, Anne Kastelianne França (Docusse Institute of Osteopathy and Manual Therapy (IDOT), Presidente Prudente, São Paulo, Brazil; São Paulo State University); Amaral, Otávio Henrique Borges (Postgraduate Program in Human Movement Sciences at the Health Sciences Center of the State University of the North of Paraná, Alameda Padre Magno, n° 841 - Nova Jacarezinho, 86400-000, Jacarezinho, Paraná, Brazil); de Paula, Vanessa Cristina Godoi (Postgraduate Program in Human Movement Sciences at the Health Sciences Center of the State University of the North of Paraná, Alameda Padre Magno, n° 841 - Nova Jacarezinho, 86400-000, Jacarezinho, Paraná, Brazil); Jassi, Fabrício José (Postgraduate Program in Human Movement Sciences at the Health Sciences Center of the State University of the North of Paraná, Alameda Padre Magno, n° 841 - Nova Jacarezinho, 86400-000, Jacarezinho, Paraná, Brazil; Docusse Institute of Osteopathy and Manual Therapy (IDOT), Presidente Prudente, São Paulo, Brazil)",2,2,0.38,1.63,https://trialsjournal.biomedcentral.com/counter/pdf/10.1186/s13063-022-07040-y,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1154065333,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3202 Clinical Sciences; 42 Health Sciences; 4201 Allied Health and Rehabilitation Science,4 Quality Education

For the development of this research, a sample of 500 entrepreneurs located in Colombia who are creating a company was taken. The research methodology is hypothetical-deductive with a cross-sectional multiple causal correlation design with an explanatory scope and is divided into three stages: first, an exploratory analysis of the data relating to the study variables is carried out. Second, a principal component analysis is carried out. Finally, the third stage is the modelling using the Partial Least Squares-Path Modelling methodology. Among the most relevant findings, it is found that Social Capital is significant in explaining Person-Entrepreneurship Fit. In turn, Social Capital and Person-Entrepreneurship Fit are significant in explaining Entrepreneurial Self-Efficacy. Finally, the construct of Venture Creation is only significantly explained by Person-Entrepreneurship Fit. Consequently, it can be concluded that the influence of social and psychological variables within the business cycle is significant, and models and strategies must consider these elements to design tools that support the optimal development of start-ups within the business cycle, so that they consolidate as stable ventures.

It can be analyzed using different approaches such as the Resource-Based View (RBV) and measured from a multidimensional perspective. This paper aims to examine the competitiveness of rural enterprises run by a millennial population consisting of undergraduate students and graduates from different faculties of agricultural sciences in Antioquia (Colombia). A total of 1242 emails were sent asking to fill out an online questionnaire, and 432 people responded (34.78 %), with 11.91 % already having a business in operation (148 enterprises). Once the competitiveness index was calculated, a multidimensional statistical analysis was performed to identify differences between regions, economic sectors, status (formal or informal), number of employees, and age of the company. According to the results, service companies in rural areas, enterprises registered at the chamber of commerce, and those with a higher number of employees and longer time in the market exhibit a better competitiveness index. The main limitations, however, are observed in the competitive strategy and marketing components. Since the competitiveness index can have a maximum value of 10, values in the range of 5.68 to 6.79 indicate a medium level of competitiveness and, therefore, imply that the other components of the competitiveness index must be improved to achieve higher levels of competitiveness.",,,Revista CEA,,,,2022-01-30,2022,2022-01-30,,8,16,e1993-e1993,All OA; Gold,Article,"Arias-Vargas, Francisco Javier; Ribes-Giner, Gabriela; Garcés-Giraldo, Luis Fernando; Arango-Botero, Diana María","Arias-Vargas, Francisco Javier (Corporación Universitaria Americana); Ribes-Giner, Gabriela (Universitat Politècnica de València); Garcés-Giraldo, Luis Fernando (Corporación Universitaria Americana); Arango-Botero, Diana María (Instituto Tecnológico Metropolitano)",,"Arias-Vargas, Francisco Javier (Corporación Universitaria Americana); Ribes-Giner, Gabriela (Universitat Politècnica de València); Garcés-Giraldo, Luis Fernando (Corporación Universitaria Americana); Arango-Botero, Diana María (Instituto Tecnológico Metropolitano)",2,1,,1.62,https://revistas.itm.edu.co/index.php/revista-cea/article/download/1993/2289,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1145480537,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3507 Strategy, Management and Organisational Behaviour",

However, the reports did not use real solutions (or synthetic solutions with various elements). This fact remains poorly established, and the interaction efficiencies are still under study. The objective of this research is to explore the extraction and stripping of the four major elements present in a copper industrial pregnant leach solution (Cu(II), Fe(III), Mn(II), and Zn(II)) using the methyltrioctyl/decylammonium bis(2,4,4-trimethylpentyl)phosphinate (R4NCy) ionic liquid as an extractant. The work conditions studied in extraction were ionic liquid concentration, initial pH, and O/A ratio, and in stripping were H2SO4 concentration and O/A ratio. The test was carried out at room temperature and ambient pressure. High efficiency and selectivity (99.82% and 113,755 over Cu(II), respectively) were observed for Fe(III) extraction over the other elements. Moreover, after the extraction test, significant difficulty in stripping Fe(III) loaded in the ionic liquid was observed (28.7% at 0.5 M of H2SO4). Finally, the present study demonstrates that the R4NCy ionic liquid is not suitable for copper extraction because it has a higher selectivity for Fe(III) and Zn(II).",This work was supported by the Universidad de Atacama (project DIUDA19/19).

They funnel anthropogenic contaminants and pollutants from the activities in the river catchment into the marine environment. The present study is focused on the Magdalena River-mouth at Bocas de Ceniza where land-based contamination and pollution are important issues. These were subsequently analysed using an expanded DPSIR framework (Drivers Pressures, State, Impacts Responses). Based on export coefficients and secondary information, the loads of BOD, TSS, Nutrients and solid waste from different sources were identified and compared to prioritize their management within the study area. Findings suggest that contaminants generated in the study area may be insignificant compared to the inputs from the Magdalena River, but they can have a significant impact on the state of local ecosystems. Of all the sources analysed, agriculture and livestock are theoretically the largest contributors of nitrogen (i.e., 14.84 t d-1 and 48.99 t d-1) and phosphorus (i.e., 5.90 t d-1 and 19.46 t d-1) in the basin ‘Direct to the Caribbean’ and ‘Cienaga de Mallorquín’ (that altogether are identified as DtC+) and the ‘Western bank of the lower Magdalena’ (DtM-LM), respectively. In the case of BOD, domestic and industrial wastewaters contribute about 5.10 t d-1 and 98.43 t d-1 in the same basins. Contributions of faecal coliforms were more than 4 orders of magnitude higher in untreated wastewater, being 4.86 x1016 NMP d-1 and 1.78 x1016 NMP d-1 in the lower Magdalena and Caribbean catchments, respectively. Inadequately managed waste and plastic represent a serious problem for the Caribbean Basin. Solid waste generated within the study area and coming from the Magdalena basin and the Caribbean Sea, reaches the coast and deteriorates its visual quality, affects mangrove ecosystems, and generates impacts on coastal populations. By basin, the DtM-LM is where the greatest pollutant loads are generated.

Models for this still have significant uncertainties. Recombination cannot normally be observed in isolation, because the ionization follows the evolutionary timescale of the ionizing source. Laboratory experiments are unable to reach the appropriate conditions because of the very long required timescales. The extended nebula around the very late helium pulse (VLTP) star V4334 Sgr provides a unique laboratory for this kind of study. The sudden loss of the ionizing UV radiation after the VLTP event has allowed the nebula to recombine free from other influences. More than 290 long-slit spectra taken with FORS1/2 at ESO’s Very Large Telescope between 2007 and 2022 are used to follow the time evolution of the lines of H, He, N, S, O, and Ar. Hydrogen and helium lines, representing most of the ionized mass, do not show significant changes. A small increase is seen in [N ii] (+2.8% yr−1; 2.7σ significance), while we see a decrease in [O iii] (−1.96% yr−1; 2.0σ significance). The [S ii] lines show a change of +3.0% yr−1 (1.6σ significance). The lines of [S iii] and of [Ar iii] show no significant changes. For [S iii], the measurement differs from the predicted decrease by 4.5σ. A possible explanation is that the fractions of S3+ and higher are larger than expected. Such an effect could provide a potential solution for the sulfur anomaly in planetary nebulae.","This investigation makes use of ESO data from program IDs 077.D-0394, 079.D-0256, 381.D-0117, 383.D-0427, 385.D-0292, 087.D-0223, 089.D-0080, 091.D-0209, 093.D-0195, 095.D-0113, 097.D-0146 099.D-0045, and 0109.D-0060.

In response to this challenge, the scientific community is developing a new generation of antibacterial molecules. Contributing to this effort, and inspired by the resveratrol structure, five new resveratrol-dimers (9a−9e) and one resveratrol-monomer (10a) were synthetized using 2,5-dibromo-1,4-diaminobenzene (8) as the core compound for Schiff base bridge conformation. These compounds were evaluated in vitro against pathogenic clinical isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus sp., and Listeria monocytogenes. Antibacterial activity measurements of resveratrol-Schiff base derivatives (9a−9e) and their precursors (4−8) showed high selectivity against Listeria monocytogenes, being 2.5 and 13.7 times more potent than chloramphenicol, while resveratrol showed an EC50 > 320 µg/mL on the same model. Moreover, a prospective mechanism of action for these compounds against L. monocytogenes strains was proposed using molecular docking analysis, finding a plausible inhibition of internalin C (InlC), a surface protein relevant in bacteria−host interaction.

METHODS: This is a cross-sectional survey. An online questionnaire based on the ""Noise Exposure Questionnaire"", plus 11 questions regarding hearing loss were sent to 730 randomly selected students. Participants self-reported time spent on different leisure noise activities and their subjective evaluation of the loudness of these activities, converted into equivalent noise levels, were used to estimate weekly noise exposure levels that were compared to occupational noise limits (> 85 dBA = hazardous). Inference statistics was applied to relate hearing symptoms and ""likely or having some degree of hearing loss"" with hazardous weekly leisure noise exposure levels.
RESULTS: Ninety-three percent of the participants reported at least one hypoacusis symptom. The most frequent sound-related ear symptom was tinnitus (72%). Fifty-five percent of the individuals presented weekly exposure to noise >85 dBA. Symptoms of hearing loss were more prevalent in those exposed to weekly noise levels >85 dBA.
CONCLUSION: This study suggests that there may be hearing loss caused by exposure to high levels of leisure noise in a large part of the study population. Health promotion of hearing conservation should be emphasized at university level.

We developed a protocol for viability determination and storage of E. racemosa pollen for breeding new varieties. The medium components for E. racemosa pollen germination was optimized by using an Orthogonal Assay Test Strategy (OATS). The germination rates of E. racemosa pollen were investigated after storing at different temperatures and different storage periods. The size of E. racemosa pollen was medium with three germination ditches, and the sculptural type of pollen was striate. Red ink and 2,3,5-triphenyl tetrazolium chloride (TTC) can effectively distinguish viable pollen from the unviable pollen of E. racemosa. The most suitable medium (CK2) for E. racemosa was composed of 150 g· L-1 sucrose, 100 mg·L-1 boric acid, 150 mg· L-1 Ca(NO3)2 and 50 mg· L-1 GA3. Low-temperature stress produced the greater inhibition of pollen tube growth compared with high-temperature conditions. The CK2 medium at pH 6.5 resulted in the highest pollen germination rate and most extended pollen tube length. The optimal temperature for storage of dried pollen was -80°C (P < 0.01), and the germination rate was 53.60% after storage for 390 days. Thawing in a 35°C water bath produced the best viability of E. racemosa pollen after storage at -20°C and -80°C. The short-term storage of E. racemosa fresh pollen at 4°C was better than that at -20°C and -80°C (P < 0.01). It is possible to evaluate pollen quality and store pollen grains for E. racemosa by the parameters defined in this study.",,This work was supported by The National Key Research and Development Program of China (Grant no. 2018YFD1000401) and Henan Key Research and Development Plan (Grant no. 202102110082).,Frontiers in Plant Science,,,,2022-10-11,2022,2022-10-11,,13,,994214,All OA; Gold,Article,"Jia, Wenqing; Wang, Yanli; Mi, Zhaorong; Wang, Zheng; He, Songlin; Kong, Dezheng","Jia, Wenqing (College of Forestry, Henan Agricultural University, Zhengzhou, China; Postdoctoral Research Base, Henan Institute of Science and Technology, Xinxiang, China); Wang, Yanli (College of Forestry, Henan Agricultural University, Zhengzhou, China; Postdoctoral Research Base, Henan Institute of Science and Technology, Xinxiang, China); Mi, Zhaorong (Postdoctoral Research Base, Henan Institute of Science and Technology, Xinxiang, China); Wang, Zheng (College of Forestry, Henan Agricultural University, Zhengzhou, China); He, Songlin (College of Forestry, Henan Agricultural University, Zhengzhou, China; Postdoctoral Research Base, Henan Institute of Science and Technology, Xinxiang, China); Kong, Dezheng (College of Forestry, Henan Agricultural University, Zhengzhou, China)","He, Songlin (Henan Agricultural University; Henan Institute of Science and Technology); Kong, Dezheng (Henan Agricultural University)","Jia, Wenqing (Henan Agricultural University; Henan Institute of Science and Technology); Wang, Yanli (Henan Agricultural University; Henan Institute of Science and Technology); Mi, Zhaorong (Henan Institute of Science and Technology); Wang, Zheng (Henan Agricultural University); He, Songlin (Henan Agricultural University; Henan Institute of Science and Technology); Kong, Dezheng (Henan Agricultural University)",3,3,0.58,1.54,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpls.2022.994214/pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1151771341,"30 Agricultural, Veterinary and Food Sciences; 3004 Crop and Pasture Production",

To this end, a measure that captures the degree of openness of the company in relation to the use of external sources of information for the development of innovation activities is introduced. Variables related to the technological capabilities of the company, barriers to innovation, and appropriability strategy are considered as possible determinants.",,,Procedia Computer Science,,,,2022,2022,,2022,198,,638-643,All OA; Gold,Article,"Manjarrés-Henriquez, Liney; Vega-Jurado, Jaider; Lombana-Coy, Jahir","Manjarrés-Henriquez, Liney (Departamento de Ciencias Empresariales.

By reducing biomass fluctuation, biodiversity could mitigate the impact of changing environmental conditions on rural incomes as long as people exploits a diverse set of natural assets. This effect is analogous to the risk-spreading function of financial portfolios. This paper presents evidence of the portfolio effect for an open-access artisanal fishery in an estuarine ecosystem, located in a Colombian Biosphere Reserve. Using catch statistics from 2002 to 2018, we evaluate the contribution of catch diversity to the stabilization of fishing income. We find that changes in catch composition are related to seasonal and interannual variations in salinity conditions. The portfolio effect arises from asynchronous fluctuations of fish species due to fluctuating environmental conditions. Catch diversification, instead of specialization, help achieve resilient fisheries.",,"Andrés Vargas and David Diaz received funding from Universidad del Norte, www.uninorte.edu.co.

This study examines the influence of the organisational context on the implementation of a psycho-educational programme and an academic levelling module at Colombian schools. Specifically, we evaluate the work design characteristics of teachers and their impact on the fidelity, effectiveness, and sustainability of the intervention. Information was collected from 102 teachers who acted as facilitators in the implementation of these interventions at a total of 72 schools in the city of Barranquilla. With a work design questionnaire, the characteristics of the task and working conditions of the teaching staff were analysed. To evaluate the implementation of the programme, indicators of fidelity, dose, frequency, and perceived effectiveness of the intervention were obtained. The results show that the autonomy and intrinsic characteristics of the task are positively related to the fidelity of the implementation. A certain influence of the working conditions of the teaching staff was also observed in the dose of the educational activities performed. Complementary to this, we describe the impact of confinement during the coronavirus pandemic on the implementation of programmes. Work design influences the process of implementing programmes in educational contexts. Both active hierarchical supervision and the motivational characteristics of teachers’ work affect the sustainability of interventions, especially in crisis circumstances. To conclude, we reflect on the organisational characteristics that facilitate the sustainability of the interventions.","This study was supported by the grant provided by the Andalusian Research Plan (PAIDI in Spanish) to the Research Group “Laboratory of Personal Networks and Communities” (2019/HUM-059).

For this purpose, the BDI-II was administered to 1665 participants (51.83% women) from different cities of Peru (75.92% from Cajamarca, 11.05% from Lima, 6.42% from La Libertad and 2.62% from Lambayeque), with an age range of 18 to 54 years (M = 24.99; SD = 8.73). Fourteen models, based on previous studies, were tested by confirmatory factor analysis. The results indicated that the bifactor and second-order models had convergence problems, whereas the two-dimensional and unifactor models had adequate goodness-of-fit indices. The unidimensional model was selected due to its theoretical coherence , since the BDI-II creators point out that the test should be interpreted globally by adding the 21 items, and discourage interpretations by calculating scores separated by dimensions. Furthermore, the antecedents indicate that the variance explained by the second factor is very low. Therefore, this approach would be unjustified. In addition, previous studies have indicated very high interfactor correlations. Finally, gender invariance was demonstrated, and normative data were calculated using percentiles, indicating that scores above 11 would be clinically relevant. In conclusion, the BDI-II has good psychometric properties in a unidimensional structure with 21 items, which is sex invariant and has adequate normative data for the general Peruvian population.",,,Acta Colombiana de Psicología,,,,2022-06-28,2022,2022-06-28,,25,2,158-170,All OA; Gold,Article,"Sánchez-Villena, Andy Rick; Cedrón, Eduardo Farfán; de-La-Fuente-Figuerola, Valeria; Chávez-Ravines, Daryana","Sánchez-Villena, Andy Rick (Universidad Privada del Norte, Cajamarca, Perú); Cedrón, Eduardo Farfán (Universidad Privada del Norte, Cajamarca, Perú); de-La-Fuente-Figuerola, Valeria (Fórum Centro de Estudios Familiares, Cajamarca, Perú); Chávez-Ravines, Daryana (Universidad Privada del Norte, Cajamarca, Perú)",,"Sánchez-Villena, Andy Rick (Private University of the North); Cedrón, Eduardo Farfán (Private University of the North); de-La-Fuente-Figuerola, Valeria (Fórum Centro de Estudios Familiares, Cajamarca, Perú); Chávez-Ravines, Daryana (Private University of the North)",3,2,,1.52,https://actacolombianapsicologia.ucatolica.edu.co/article/download/3620/4190,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1149037324,42 Health Sciences; 52 Psychology; 5201 Applied and Developmental Psychology,

To determine the association between family functioning and school connectivity in Mexican high school adolescents, an analytical cross-sectional study was carried out in a census of 396 adolescents in a public high school in Mexico. The self-report of family functioning and the school connectedness scale were used, both with α > 0.84. ꭕ2 and ANOVA were applied. The results show significant differences in conflict with shift (morning ꭕ2 = 42.47 vs. evening ꭕ2 = 40.35, F = 4.57, p = 0.033), and leadership with degree (1st ꭕ2 = 8.14, 2nd ꭕ2 = 8.97, 3rd ꭕ2 = 8.90, F = 3.52, p = 0.030). Connectivity associated with school variables (p < 0.05). There are no differences or association between sex, age or qualifications with connectivity. Family functioning was associated in affective expression with school (ꭕ2 = 3.77, p = 0.055) and in leadership with students (ꭕ2 = 2.92, p = 0.05). It is concluded that the leadership of the parents and the affective expression of the family favors school connectivity between students and with their school.

Plants are the main producers of AsA for humans and other non-synthesizing animals. It was immediately clear that some plant species have more AsA than others. Further studies evidenced that AsA content varies in different plant organs, in different developmental stages/environmental conditions and even within different cell compartments. With the progressive discovery of the genes of the main (Smirnoff-Wheeler) and alternative pathways coding for the enzymes involved in AsA biosynthesis in plants, the simple overexpression of those genes appeared a suitable strategy for boosting AsA content in any plant species or organ. Unfortunately, overexpression experiments mostly resulted in limited, if any, AsA increase, apparently due to a tight regulation of the biosynthetic machinery. Attempts to identify regulatory steps in the pathways that could be manipulated to obtain unlimited AsA production were also less successful than expected, confirming the difficulties in ""unleashing"" AsA synthesis. A different approach to increase AsA content has been the overexpression of genes coding for enzymes catalyzing the recycling of the oxidized forms of vitamin C, namely monodehydroascorbate and dehydroascorbate reductases. Such approach proved mostly effective in making the overexpressors apparently more resistant to some forms of environmental stress, but once more did not solve the issue of producing massive AsA amounts for human diet. However, it should also be considered that a hypothetical unlimited increase in AsA content is likely to interfere with plant development, which is in many ways regulated by AsA availability itself. The present review article aims at summarizing the many attempts made so far to improve AsA production/content in plants, evidencing the most promising ones, and at providing information about the possible unexpected consequences of a pure biotechnological approach not keeping into account the peculiar features of the AsA system in plants.",We apologized with the many colleagues whose work could not be mentioned here for space limitations.

In silico analysis has led to identifying a wide range of biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) and metabolic compounds. The genome had a total of 3,558,611 bp with GC of 43.96%, harboring 3,449 protein-coding genes, among which 3,209 were assigned by the EggNOG database, and 240 hypothetical proteins have no match in the BLASTN database. It also contains 68 tRNAs, 1 23S rRNA, 1 16S rRNA, 6 5S rRNA, and 1 tmRNA. In addition, no acquired resistance genes nor virulence and pathogenic factors were predicted, indicating that UTNGt21A is a safe strain. Three areas of interest (AOI) consisting of multiple genes encoding for bacteriocins and ABC transporters were predicted with BAGEL4, while eight secondary metabolite regions were predicted with the antiSMASH web tool. GutSMASH analysis predicted one metabolic gene cluster (MGC) type pyruvate to acetate-formate, a primary metabolite region essential for anaerobe growth. Several lanthipeptides and non-ribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) clusters were detected in the UTNGt21A but not the reference genomes, suggesting that their genome diversity might be linked to its niche-specific lineage and adaptation to a specific environment. Moreover, the application of a targeted genome mining tool (RiPPMiner) uncovered a diverse arsenal of important antimicrobial molecules such as lanthipeptides. Furthermore, in vitro analysis indicated that the crude extract (CE) of UTNGt21A exerted a wide spectrum of inhibition against several pathogens. The results indicated that the possible peptide-protein extract (PC) from UTNGt21A induces morphological and ultrastructural changes of Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica ATCC51741, compatible with its inhibitory potential. Genome characterization is the basis for further in vitro and in vivo studies to explore their use as antimicrobial producers or probiotic strains.",We acknowledged Technical University of the North for funding this research and would like to express their sincere gratitude to D.

This study analyzes the effects of waves on the hydrodynamics, stratification process, and dynamics of the salt wedge in an estuary with a microtidal range, high fluvial and sediment discharges, and dominated by waves: the Magdalena River estuary (MRE). It is, under low flow conditions, a highly stratified, salt wedge type. Field measurements and the MOHID 3D modeling system, 2D coupled with the SWAN model, were used for this purpose. The low flow seasons of 2018 (February-March) and 2020 (March) were taken as case studies. Results show that when considering wave effects in the numerical simulations, more realistic conditions are reproduced in the circulation patterns and salinity distribution in the outer estuary. Variations in velocity patterns and salinity distribution are found between the mouth and 2 km upstream of the mouth when comparing the simulations with and without waves, especially in the mixing layer. These variations in hydrodynamics and stratification may be associated with increased wave-induced bed shear stress, variations in barotropic and baroclinic acceleration, and increased vertical mixing. At 2 km into the river channel, the reduction in wave height energy of 95% and changes in salinity distribution are already lower than 2%. In addition, it was observed that waves do not generate significant changes in the dynamics of the salt wedge, which is mainly affected by the diurnal tidal cycle, presenting variations in the length of the intrusion of up to 1 km, and in the magnitude of the longitudinal salinity gradient at the salt front, presenting low salinities at high tide when the wedge enters, and high salinities at low tide, in its retreat.",,"This research was funded by Colciencias (Departamento Administrativo de Ciencia, Tecnología e Innovación), National Doctorates Program 727-2016, and the DIDI (Dirección de Investigación, Desarrollo e Innovación) of the Universidad del Norte.",Frontiers in Marine Science,,,,2022-11-07,2022,2022-11-07,,9,,974163,All OA; Gold,Article,"Álvarez, Aldemar Higgins; Otero, Luis; Restrepo, Juan Camilo; Álvarez, Oscar","Álvarez, Aldemar Higgins (); Otero, Luis (); Restrepo, Juan Camilo (); Álvarez, Oscar ()","Álvarez, Aldemar Higgins ()","Álvarez, Aldemar Higgins (); Otero, Luis (); Restrepo, Juan Camilo (); Álvarez, Oscar ()",3,3,,1.46,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmars.2022.974163/pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1152536107,37 Earth Sciences; 3705 Geology; 3708 Oceanography,

However, microorganisms have several resistance mechanisms, particularly the expression of arsenic pumps is a critical component for bacterial ability to expel it and decrease intracellular toxicity. In this study, we aimed to characterize the biochemical, structural, and genomic characteristics of the Acr3 pump among a group of Exiguobacterium strains isolated from different sites of the arsenic-rich Salar de Huasco (SH) ecosystem. We also determined whether the differences in As(III) resistance levels presented by the strains could be attributed to changes in the sequence or structure of this protein. In this context, we found that based on acr3 sequences the strains isolated from the SH grouped together phylogenetically, even though clustering based on gene sequence identity did not reflect the strain's geographical origin. Furthermore, we determined the genetic context of the acr3 sequences and found that there are two versions of the organization of acr3 gene clusters, that do not reflect the strain's origin nor arsenic resistance level. We also contribute to the knowledge regarding structure of the Acr3 protein and its possible implications on the functionality of the pump, finding that although important and conserved components of this family of proteins are present, there are several changes in the amino acidic sequences that may affect the interactions among amino acids in the 3D model, which in fact are evidenced as changes in the structure and residues contacts. Finally, we demonstrated through heterologous expression that the Exiguobacterium Acr3 pump does indeed improve the organisms As resistance level, as evidenced in the complemented E. coli strains.

DESIGN: A scoping review was performed according to the guidelines of the Joanna Briggs Institute.
STUDY SELECTION: All studies about intervention programmes for PA and nutritional behaviours in Colombia were included.
METHODS: Searches in Medline/PubMed, Embase, Cochrane, Scielo and Lilacs, using MeSH, Decs and Emtree terms, were performed up to August 2020. Additionally, a manual search was made in specialised national journals. An internet documentary search of the official websites on policies and programmes by departmental, district and municipal secretariats was also performed.Two reviewers independently screened titles and abstracts. Then, the full texts were reviewed to select documents to be included.Data management relevant information from selected documents and articles was extracted. A descriptive analysis was considered.
RESULTS: Sixty-seven documents and 70 published articles were found. The programmes were identified in 13 initiatives, 7 in the area of PA and 6 with a nutrition focus. They were on physical and social environmental modifications such as the 'muévete' ('get moving') programmes in Bogota, Quindio and Cartagena; a modification of 'ciclovía'; or bicycle path programmes as well as nutrition programmes in schools, universities and companies.
CONCLUSION: This scoping review identified national programmes and policies in Colombia in the area of nutrition and PA from the environmental perspective in different scenarios: from schools to workplaces and communities. The need to implement such programmes from public and private institutions is also noted, promoting the practice of PA and healthy eating in every scenario in the national territory. New research to determine the impact of these programmes is essential to get a glimpse of the effects of these programmes and the implications for public health.","EDH is a PhD candidate in Methodology of Biomedical Research and Public Health program, Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona (UAB), Barcelona, Spain.","The authors have not declared a specific grant for this research from any funding agency in the public, commercial or not-for-profit sectors.",BMJ Open,,,Colombia; Delivery of Health Care; Exercise; Humans; Public Health; Schools,2022-09-19,2022,2022-09-19,2022-09,12,9,e060085,All OA; Gold,Article,"Hernandez, Edgar D; Guzman, Cristian Arvey; Seron, Pamela","Hernandez, Edgar D (Facultad de Medicina, Human Movement Department, Universidad Nacional de Colombia, Bogotá, Colombia); Guzman, Cristian Arvey (Facultad de Medicina, Universidad Nacional de Colombia, Bogota, Colombia; Physical Therapy Department, Hospital Universitario Nacional de Colombia, Bogota, Colombia); Seron, Pamela (Departamento de Ciencias de la Rehabilitación & CIGES, Facultad de Medicina, Universidad de La Frontera, Temuco, Chile)","Seron, Pamela (University of La Frontera)","Hernandez, Edgar D (National University of Colombia); Guzman, Cristian Arvey (National University of Colombia; Hospital Universitario Nacional de Colombia); Seron, Pamela (University of La Frontera)",3,2,1.21,1.45,https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/bmjopen/12/9/e060085.full.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1151130544,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3210 Nutrition and Dietetics; 42 Health Sciences; 4206 Public Health,

While the political dimension concerns the construction of socio-political relations, the interpersonal dimension focuses on intergroup relationships. Empirical evidence shows that reconciliation should not assign primacy to one dimension over another; rather, it should address the interaction between them. However, research on this topic is scarce. There is a need to develop an instrument to assess the political and interpersonal dimensions of reconciliation in peacebuilding contexts. This study developed the Political and Interpersonal Reconciliation Scale (PIRS) and assessed its psychometric properties based on a sample of Colombian population after the peace agreement between the Colombian government and the FARC guerrilla group. The results show the validity of a factorial structure for two components as well as an acceptable Cronbach’s alpha. Concerning external validity, in line with the existing literature, the scale under study was positively related to confidence in the peace agreement, trust in the ex-combatants, willingness to share with the adversary and community identification. This study provides evidence that the Political and Interpersonal Reconciliation Scale is a valid and reliable instrument for evaluating reconciliation in peacebuilding contexts.",,"This research was funded by the Fundación Universidad del Norte, grant number 2018-14.

Its musicological and contextual study -as well as its corresponding comparison with other similar bone objects- allows us to present here the arguments for which we consider that this object could be a flute like the ones drawn by Guamán Poma in relation to the rites of the Collasuyu, in his work Nueva Corónica y Buen Gobierno [1615]. The correlation that we establish here between this type of flute and other archaeological elements referring to the clothing and personal adornments of the individuals portrayed, allow us to propose that the bi-diametral tubular flute would have been part of the musical heritage of the Colla ethnic group and its special sound aesthetics. With this we establish, on the one hand, a marked cultural difference with respect to the longitudinal flute of the quena type, and on the other hand, we expand the set of objects indicative of Colla affiliation. In this way, we propose that this bone flute would have been the musical instrument used in the ceremonies and rites carried out by the Lords of the Collasuyu, both in pre-Inca times and under the rule of the Tawantinsuyu.",,,Revista Española de Antropología Americana,,,,2022-01-17,2022,2022-01-17,,52,1,59-80,All OA; Gold,Article,"Gudemos, Mónica; Tricallotis, Helena Horta","Gudemos, Mónica (Universidad Nacional de Córdoba); Tricallotis, Helena Horta (Universidad Católica del Norte, San Pedro de Atacama)",,"Gudemos, Mónica (National University of Córdoba); Tricallotis, Helena Horta (Catholic University of the North)",1,1,,1.44,https://revistas.ucm.es/index.php/REAA/article/download/75826/4564456559846,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1145804846,44 Human Society; 4401 Anthropology,"16 Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions"
191,pub.1150841088,10.3390/min12091131,,,Response Surface Methodology for Copper Flotation Optimization in Saline Systems,"Response surface methodology (RSM) is one of the most effective tools for optimizing processes, and it has been used in conjunction with the Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) test to establish the effect of input factors on output factors. However, when this methodology is used in mineral flotation, its polynomial model usually performs poorly. An alternative is to use artificial neural networks (ANNs) in such situations. Within this context, the ANOVA test is not the best option for these model types; moreover, it requires statistical assumptions that are difficult to satisfy in flotation. This work proposes replacing the polynomial model of the RSM with ANNs and the Sobol methods to determine the influential input factors instead of the ANOVA test. This proposal is applied to two porphyry copper ores with a high content of pyrite, clay, and dilution media. In addition, this study shows how other computational intelligence techniques, such as swarm intelligence, can be incorporated into this type of problem to improve the learning process of ANNs. The results gave an adjustment of over 0.98 for R2 using ANNs, in comparison to values of around 0.5 when the polynomial model of RSM was utilized. On the other hand, the application of Global Sensitivity Analysis (GSA) identified the aeration rate and P80 size as the most influential variables in copper recovery under the conditions studied. Additionally, we identified significant interactions that affect the recovery of copper, with the interactions between the aeration rate, frother concentration, and P80 size being the most important.",We thank Renato Acosta-Flores and Unidad de Equipamiento Científico (MAINI) Universidad Católica del Norte for the SEM and XRD analyses.

The ultimate objective of this research was to be able to implement actions to improve students' reading comprehension skills using the resources available. To achieve this objective, the results of the Saber 9 National tests for the years 2015, 2016 and 2017 were examined. An ICT maturity level survey was also conducted in 10 schools from the sample and key qualitative criteria were identified and quantified. At the same time, the Meta­plan® technique was applied with 67 teachers in a school from the sample, to collect opinions on the domains and main causes that affect reading comprehension, and be able to cross these with the theory. The results of this analysis show that two factors are necessary to improve performance in reading comprehension: a) the explicit teaching of reading comprehension strategies, and b) the integration of ICT for learning. It is recommended that these two factors be prioritized in teacher training plans and be materialized in schools, as well as in teachers undergraduate degree programs in universities.",,,Íkala Revista de Lenguaje y Cultura,,,,2022-05-18,2022,2022-05-18,,27,2,332-354,All OA; Gold,Article,"Benítez, Wilman Enrique Pérez; Barreto, Carmen Tulia Ricardo","Benítez, Wilman Enrique Pérez (Universidad del Norte); Barreto, Carmen Tulia Ricardo (Universidad Nacional de Estudios a Distancia -UNED)",,"Benítez, Wilman Enrique Pérez (Universidad del Norte); Barreto, Carmen Tulia Ricardo (Universidad Nacional de Estudios a Distancia -UNED)",1,1,,1.43,https://revistas.udea.edu.co/index.php/ikala/article/download/346886/20808036,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1148129296,39 Education; 3901 Curriculum and Pedagogy; 3903 Education Systems,4 Quality Education

Despite the introduction of genetically resistant farmed Atlantic salmon and vaccination strategies in the Chilean salmon industry since 2019, the number of IPN outbreaks has been increasing in farmed Atlantic salmon in the freshwater phase. This study examined gross and histopathological lesions of IPNV-affected fish, as well as the IPNV nucleotide sequence encoding the VP2 protein in clinical cases. The mortality reached 0.4% per day, and the cumulative mortality was from 0.4 to 3.5%. IPNV was isolated in the CHSE-214 cell line and was confirmed by RT-PCR, and VP2 sequence analysis. The analyzed viruses belong to IPNV genotype 5 and have 11 mutations in their VP2 protein. This is the first report of IPN outbreaks in farmed Atlantic salmon genetically resistant to IPNV in Chile. Similar outbreaks were previously reported in Scotland and Norway during 2018 and 2019, respectively. This study highlights the importance of maintaining a comprehensive surveillance program in conjunction with the use of farmed Atlantic salmon genetically resistant to IPNV.",,This study was supported by Centro de Investigaciones Biológicas Aplicadas.,Pathogens,,,,2022-11-16,2022,2022-11-16,,11,11,1368,All OA; Gold,Article,"Godoy, Marcos; Kibenge, Molly J.

The study was justified by the relevance of the university's public policies to continue distance academic activities during confinement during their teacher training. A quantitative approach was used with a descriptive, non-experimental scope. The levels of analysis of the information collected in the survey at the state level were limited to the Internet connection that existed in the community where the students were; the internet service they had at home; and the computer equipment with which they carried out their school activities. The results obtained allowed us to know that most of the students had an internet connection in their community and at home to carry out their school activities during confinement, facing teaching trends through learning ecosystems to achieve Education 4.0; Almost half of all of them had their own desktop or laptop computer, but a similar percentage worked with their cell phones, and the rest carried out their tasks with a borrowed device.

Objective: To describe and interpret the subjective theories of Basic General Education Pedagogy students from a public university in northern Chile regarding the construction of professional identity in early practices. Method: A qualitative case study methodology was used with a theoretical sample of nine Basic General Education Pedagogy students from a public university in northern Chile. The data, obtained from episodic interviews and a group interview, was analyzed based on the grounded theory. Results: The following was found: (a) different meanings about early practice and an evaluation that includes positive and negative aspects of the process, (b) an association between the development of professional identity and the experience of implementing early practice, (c) a set of conditions that gather early practices to favor the construction of the professional identity and (d) the proposal for planning early practices as an experience different from the operation of the other subjects of the degree program.

Tuning the anisotropy with strain and curvature has become a promising ingredient in modern electronics, such as flexible and stretchable magnetoelectronic devices, impedance-based field sensors, and strain gauges, however, has been limited to extended thin films and to only moderate bending. By applying a self-assembly rolling technique using a polymeric platform, we provide a template that allows homogeneous and controlled bending of a functional layer adhered to it, irrespective of its shape and size. This is an intriguing possibility to tailor the sign and magnitude of the surface strain of integrated, micron-sized devices.

The Diabetes Stigma Assessment Scale 2 (DSAS 2) was designed to specifically measure the stigma associated with this type of diabetes. However, the psychometric properties of its Spanish version have not yet been addressed.
Objective: To analyze the validity and reliability of the Spanish version of DSAS 2 in a Colombian population.
Materials and methods: In total, 501 patients with type 2 diabetes from Barranquilla answered the Spanish version of DSAS 2, a questionnaire with sociodemographic and clinical indicators, as well as instruments to measure depression, self-efficacy, and stress. We performed a factor analysis (exploratory and confirmatory) to determine the internal structure of the DSAS 2 in Spanish and used the alpha coefficient (α) to evaluate its reliability. Additionally, we analyzed the relationship between the DSAS 2 scores and the other variables under study.
Results: The three-factor structure (different treatment / judgment, guilt and shame) showed good fit to the data (RMSEA = 0.081, CFI = 0.959, TLI = 0.95) and good reliability (α = 0.76). Significant correlations of the scores of the DSAS 2 Spanish version were observed with self-efficacy (rs=-0.37, p<0.001), stress (rs =0.24 , p<0.001), and depression (rs=0.1, p=0.021). Besides, the scores showed variations associated with sociodemographic and clinical variables.
Conclusions: The Spanish version showed certain differences compared with the original version of the DSAS2 but there was adequate evidence of its validity and reliability to be used in Colombia.",,Universidad Andrés Bello.

METHODS: We carried out a secondary data analysis of the National Health Services Users' Satisfaction Survey (ENSUSALUD), 2016. This nationally representative survey evaluates doctors and nurses working in clinical settings. We defined scientific activity as i) having published an original article (journal indexed in Web of Science, Scopus or Medline); and ii) having authored an abstract in a national or international conference. We estimated crude and adjusted disparities prevalence ratios (aDPR) and 95% confidence intervals (95%CI).
RESULTS: We included 2025 doctors and 2877 nurses in the analysis; 71% of doctors doctor were male, and 93% of nurses were female (p<0.001). Among doctors, 13.9% had published an article, and 8.4% presented an abstract at a conference in the last two years, while these proportions were 0.6% and 2.5% for nurses, respectively. The adjusted models showed that doctors, when compared to nurses, were approximately 27 times likely to have published a paper (aDPR = 27.86; 95% CI 10.46 to 74.19) and twice as likely to have authored a conference abstract (aDPR = 2.51; 95% CI 1.39 to 4.53).
CONCLUSIONS: There are important disparities in scientific activity between doctors and nurses working in clinical settings in Peru. Disparities are more significant for article publication than for authoring in conference abstracts. We suggest public policies that promote research dissemination between health professionals, with emphasis on nurses.",To Dr. Tomasa Cajas-Bravo for her help with revision and suggestions.,The author(s) received no specific funding for this work.,PLOS ONE,,Monica Guberti,Bibliometrics; Delivery of Health Care; Female; Humans; Male; Peru; Physicians; Research,2022-09-02,2022,2022-09-02,,17,9,e0273031,All OA; Gold,Article,"Vergara-Mejía, Angélica; Niño-Garcia, Roberto; Zeta-Solis, Ludwing; Soto-Becerra, Percy; Al-kassab-Córdova, Ali; Pereyra-Elías, Reneé; Cabieses, Báltica; Mezones-Holguin, Edward","Vergara-Mejía, Angélica (Universidad Nacional Hemilio Valdizán, Escuela de Postgrado, Huánuco, Perúa; Seguro Social en Salud (EsSalud), Hospital Nacional Guillermo Almenara Irigoyen, Lima, Peru); Niño-Garcia, Roberto (Universidad Nacional de Piura, Facultad de Ciencias de la Salud, Sociedad Científica de Estudiantes de Medicina de la Universidad Nacional de Piura (SOCIEMUNP), Piura, Peru); Zeta-Solis, Ludwing (Universidad Nacional de Piura, Facultad de Ciencias de la Salud, Sociedad Científica de Estudiantes de Medicina de la Universidad Nacional de Piura (SOCIEMUNP), Piura, Peru); Soto-Becerra, Percy (Universidad San Ignacio de Loyola, Centro de Excelencia en Investigaciones Económicas y Sociales en Salud, Lima, Peru; Epi-gnosis Solutions, Piura, Peru); Al-kassab-Córdova, Ali (Universidad San Ignacio de Loyola, Centro de Excelencia en Investigaciones Económicas y Sociales en Salud, Lima, Peru); Pereyra-Elías, Reneé (Nuffield Department of Population Health, University of Oxford, National Perinatal Epidemiology Unit, Oxford, United Kingdom; Facultad de Ciencias de la Salud, Universidad Peruana de Ciencias Aplicadas, Lima, Peru); Cabieses, Báltica (Facultad de Medicina Clínica Alemana, Universidad del Desarrollo, Programa de Estudios Sociales en Salud-Instituto de Ciencias e Innovación en Salud, Santiago de Chile, Chile); Mezones-Holguin, Edward (Universidad San Ignacio de Loyola, Centro de Excelencia en Investigaciones Económicas y Sociales en Salud, Lima, Peru; Epi-gnosis Solutions, Piura, Peru)","Mezones-Holguin, Edward (Universidad San Ignacio de Loyola; Epi-gnosis Solutions, Piura, Peru)","Vergara-Mejía, Angélica (Universidad Nacional Hemilio Valdizán, Escuela de Postgrado, Huánuco, Perúa; EsSALUD); Niño-Garcia, Roberto (Universidad Nacional de Piura); Zeta-Solis, Ludwing (Universidad Nacional de Piura); Soto-Becerra, Percy (Universidad San Ignacio de Loyola; Epi-gnosis Solutions, Piura, Peru); Al-kassab-Córdova, Ali (Universidad San Ignacio de Loyola); Pereyra-Elías, Reneé (University of Oxford; Peruvian University of Applied Sciences); Cabieses, Báltica (Universidad del Desarrollo); Mezones-Holguin, Edward (Universidad San Ignacio de Loyola; Epi-gnosis Solutions, Piura, Peru)",2,2,0.85,1.4,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0273031&type=printable,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1150701566,42 Health Sciences; 4203 Health Services and Systems,

METHODOLOGY: The methodology was qualitative with a phenomenological descriptive design, through which discourses from health personnel in the public primary and secondary care system were explored (n = 23). Next, meanings and practices in intercultural health for international migrants in health establishments are described from the perspective of health personnel in the northern Chilean city of Antofagasta.
RESULTS: The participants presented trees of thematic categories. There were three thematic categories overall: (1) The meaning of interculturality included features of understanding of the concept, with respect for culture being the transversal axis in all discourses. (2) Practices in health care, where voluntariness, references, and the adequacy or non-technicality of the language are fundamental axes. (3) Training in the intercultural approach, where there is often self-knowledge and lack of supply in the health system.
CONCLUSIONS: The findings show essential elements to consider in the care of international migrants, including the training and awareness of staff about the intercultural approach through strategies following the local reality in which each health establishment exists.",,"The project FONIS SAI190I066 ANID, Government of Chile.",International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health,,"Amit Arora, Tinashe Dune, Zelalem Mengesha, Pranee Liamputtong",Humans; Health Personnel; Delivery of Health Care; Chile; Transients and Migrants,2022-10-21,2022,2022-10-21,,19,20,13670,All OA; Gold,Article,"Cruz-Riveros, Consuelo; Urzúa, Alfonso; Macaya-Aguirre, Gustavo; Cabieses, Báltica","Cruz-Riveros, Consuelo (Escuela de Psicología, Universidad Católica del Norte, Antofagasta 1270709, Chile; Escuela de Enfermería, Facultad de Salud, Universidad Santo Tomás, Concepción 3460000, Chile); Urzúa, Alfonso (Escuela de Psicología, Universidad Católica del Norte, Antofagasta 1270709, Chile); Macaya-Aguirre, Gustavo (Facultad de Ciencias Sociales, Universidad Alberto Hurtado, Santiago 8320000, Chile); Cabieses, Báltica (Facultad de Medicina Clínica Alemana, Universidad del Desarrollo, Santiago 7610658, Chile)","Cruz-Riveros, Consuelo (Catholic University of the North; Universidad Santo Tomás)","Cruz-Riveros, Consuelo (Catholic University of the North; Universidad Santo Tomás); Urzúa, Alfonso (Catholic University of the North); Macaya-Aguirre, Gustavo (Alberto Hurtado University); Cabieses, Báltica (Universidad del Desarrollo)",2,1,0.51,1.4,https://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/19/20/13670/pdf?version=1666343915,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1152183194,42 Health Sciences; 4203 Health Services and Systems; 44 Human Society,

In recent decades, the distribution of scientific knowledge has undergone important changes aided by the strong emergence of the Open Access and the so-called open science movements. These changes have brought about a conceptual modification regarding to the past, present, and future of scientific publications. Technological advances have also made it easier and less costly to share knowledge, a situation that is undoubtedly influencing the development of these publications. In this reflection paper we will describe the events that have occured around the distribution of science and will analyze the available information to subsequently scrutinize the present of scientific publications and project the possible immediate future of such important publishing activity. First, we will describe the origins of scientific publication, its achievements, and the establishment of an industrial market, as well as the existence of a prestige emporium and the movements that advocate for a change in the commercial vision of the sector so that science is better served as a common good.

UI presents a social, medical, and mental issue with financial consequences.ObjectiveThis paper proposes a framework based on machine learning for predicting urination time, which can benefit people with various degrees of UI.MethodA total of 850 data points were self-recorded by 51 participants to investigate how different factors impact urination time. The participants were instructed to record input data (such as the time of consumption and the number of drinks) and output data (i.e., the time the individual urinated). Other factors, such as age and BMI, were also considered. The study was conducted in two phases: (1) data was prepared for modeling, including missing values, data encoding, and scaling; and (2) a classification model was designed with four output classes of the next urination time: <  = 30 min, 31–60 min, 61–90 min, > 90 min. The model was built in two steps: (1) feature selection and (2) model training and testing. Feature selection methods such as lasso regression, decision tree, random forest, and chi-square were used to select the best features, which were then used to train an extreme gradient boosting (XGB) algorithm model to predict the class of the next urination time.ResultThe feature selection steps resulted in nine features considered the most important features affecting UI. The accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score of the XGB predictive model are 0.70, 0.73, 0.70, and 0.71, respectively.ConclusionThis research is the first step in developing a machine learning model to predict when a person will need to urinate. A precise predictive instrument can enable healthcare providers and caregivers to assist people with various forms of UI in reliable, prompted voiding. The insights from this predictive model can allow future apps to go beyond current UI-related apps by predicting the time of urination using the most relevant factors that impact voiding frequency.",The study was funded through Dr. Ali’s start-up funds.

The zinc-iron hydrotalcite (ZnFe-LDH) and the composite materials of FS and ZnFe-LDH (F-T DS/ZnFe-LDH, FS/ZnFe-LDH) were prepared by hydrothermal synthesis, and the similarities and differences in tribological characteristics of the above three lubricating materials such as 10# white oil (10# WO) lubricant additives were investigated. FS is an aggregation composed of amorphous carbon and graphite microcrystals. ZnFe-LDH is mainly composed of nanosheets, Zn, and Fe hydroxide particles, with a high degree of crystallization, while FS/ZnFe-LDH is a “sandwich layer” composed of nanosheets and soot particles. Because of the addition of cetyltrimethylammonium bromide and the grafting of a long carbon chain lipophilic group in the preparation process, FS/ZnFe-LDH has better anti-wear properties than the FS and ZnFe-LDH Effect. When FS/ZnFe-LDH is added at 0.2 wt.%, the average friction coefficient (AFC) and average wears scar diameter (AWSD) are at their lowest. Compared with pure 10# WO, the minimum values of AFC and AWSD have dropped by 36.84% and 22.58%, respectively. XPS analysis of the wear scar surface shows that when ZnFe-LDH and FS/ZnFe-LDH are used as lubricating additives of 10# WO, together with the organic matter in the white oil and the iron element in the friction pair, tribochemistry occurs under the combined action of the adsorption force and the tribochemical reaction, a friction protection film containing four elements of C, O, Fe, and Zn is formed on the surface of the wear scar, which effectively reduces the wear and reduces the friction coefficient.",The Ningxia low-grade resource high-value utilization and environmental chemical integration technology innovation team project.,"This research was funded by the Natural Science Foundation of the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, grant number 2021AAC03181, and the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities of the North Minzu University, grant number FWNX29.",Applied Sciences,,,,2022-01-08,2022,2022-01-08,,12,2,599,All OA; Gold,Article,"Wang, Jian; Liu, Tianxia","Wang, Jian (School of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, North Minzu University, Yinchuan 750021, China;, 20197355@stu.nun.edu.cn); Liu, Tianxia (School of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, North Minzu University, Yinchuan 750021, China;, 20197355@stu.nun.edu.cn; Key Laboratory for Chemical Engineering and Technology, State Ethnic Affairs Commission, North Minzu University, Yinchuan 750021, China)","Liu, Tianxia (North Minzu University; North Minzu University)","Wang, Jian (North Minzu University); Liu, Tianxia (North Minzu University; North Minzu University)",4,2,,1.4,https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3417/12/2/599/pdf?version=1641783250,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1144539346,40 Engineering; 4002 Automotive Engineering; 4017 Mechanical Engineering,

E-Point Septal Separation (EPSS) measure through Point-of-Care Ultrasound (POCUS) has been used to evaluate systolic function in echocardiography. We analyzed EPSS for diagnosis of Left Ventricle Ejection Fraction <50% and ≤40% in ED patients. Methods: Retrospective analysis of a convenience sample of patients presenting to ED with chest pain or dyspnea who underwent admission POCUS evaluation by Internal Medicine Specialist unaware of Transthoracic Echocardiogram. Accuracy was assessed with sensitivity, specificity, likelihood ratios (LR) and Receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve. The best cut off point was calculated using Youden Index. Results: Ninety-six patients were included. Median EPSS and LVEF were 10mm and 41% respectively. Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC-ROC) to diagnose a LVEF <50% was 0.90 (IC95% 0.84-0.97). Youden Index was 0.71 with cut off point EPSS at 9.5mm, performing with a sensitivity of 0.80, a specificity of 0.91, a positive LR of 9.8 and a negative LR of 0.2. AUC-ROC to diagnose a LVEF ≤40% was 0.91 (IC95% 0.85-0.97). Youden Index was 0.71 with a cut off point EPSS at 9.5mm, performing with a sensitivity of 0.91 and specificity of 0.80, a positive LR of 4.7 and a negative LR of 0.1. Conclusion: EPSS can reliably diagnose reduced LVEF in a set of ED patients with cardiovascular symptoms.

Children are at a higher risk for progression to TB disease than adults. Isoniazid prophylaxis treatment period is long and can cause liver damage. Alternatives to isoniazid, such as rifamycin containing regimens, should be considered for prophylaxis. Previous systematic reviews, with different study designs and data combining results on children and adults, have evaluated the comparative efficacy and harms of LTBI treatment regimens. We aim to determine the effectiveness and safety of all the different regimens available for the treatment of LTBI for children and adolescents less than 18 years of age, contacts of drug-susceptible TB, without HIV infection.
METHODS AND ANALYSIS: MEDLINE, Embase and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials will be systematically searched for randomised controlled trials without any language or publication date restriction. Screening and extraction will be performed in duplicate. Risk of bias will be performed in duplicate with Cochrane Risk of Bias tool V.2. Pairwise meta-analysis of direct comparisons and network meta-analyses (NMAs) will be performed. Heterogeneity will be assessed using I2 and Cochrane thresholds. Direct and indirect estimates in an NMA will be combined if justifiable. Subgroups analyses will be performed in different mean age and study year groups. Sensitivity analysis based on the risk of bias will be conducted. Publication bias will be investigated using funnel plots and Egger's regression test. Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) criteria will assess certainty of the evidence for the direct comparisons. GRADE approach for NMA will assess the quality of the evidence from the indirect and NMA.
ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethical approval is not required as no primary data are collected. This systematic review will be disseminated in a peer-reviewed journal.

1752,pub.1153806190,10.33393/gcnd.2022.2490,,,Negative alactic base excess is reversed by hemoperfusion in septic patients,"Introduction: Gattinoni et al. have recently introduced a new parameter: the “alactic base excess” (ABE). ABE is equivalent to the number of strong acids, other than lactate, which are present in the plasma in abnormal concentrations, negative ABE being associated with higher mortality in sepsis. Hemoperfusion (HPF) is an extracorporeal procedure that involves the passage of blood through an adsorption cartridge, where solutes are removed by direct binding to the sorbent material. Then, it was decided to explore the influence of HPF on negative ABE value in sepsis. Materials and methods: Basal values of ABE, standard base excess (SBE), and lactate (mean, standard deviation [SD]) were obtained. The difference between these parameter values before and after four sessions of HPF (HA330) (delta value) was evaluated. Student’s t-test and Wilcoxon test were applied. Results: From 32 patients (age: 57±13) suffering from respiratory insufficiency secondary to COVID-19 who were treated with HPF in the critical care unit of Clinica de la Mujer, Bogotá (Colombia), 6 patients presented with metabolic acidosis with negative ABE value (‒2.7±1) with negative SBE (‒4.7±1) and high lactate serum value (2±0.7 mmol/L). Delta ABE, SBE, and lactate were: 7.7 (p = 0.005), 6.1 (p = 0.003), and 1.6 (p = NS), respectively. Thus, negative ABE was significantly reversed by HPF, since SBE value turned positive without significant change in lactate. Conclusion: Negative alactic parameter was significantly reversed by HPF in septic patients. It is necessary to carry out evaluations in larger groups to estimate their impact on clinical outcomes.",,,Giornale di Clinica Nefrologica e Dialisi,,,,2022-12-19,2022,2022-12-19,,34,,122-124,All OA; Gold,Article,"Musso, Carlos Guido; Cordoba, Juan P.; Aroca-Marinez, Gustavo; Terrasa, Sergio; Barriga-Moreno, Adriana P.; Lozano-Sanchez, Marcela; Barón-Alvarez, Rafael A.; Gonzalez-Torres, Henry; Cantos, Joaquin; Huespe, Iván","Musso, Carlos Guido (Facultad de Ciencias de la Salud, Universidad Simón Bolivar, Barranquilla - Colombia and Research Department, Hospital Italiano de Buenos Aires, Buenos Aires - Argentina); Cordoba, Juan P.

The aim of this study is to analyze the effect of socioeconomic conditions on self-rated health from a generational perspective, its differential effect on gender, and its influence on the gender gap in order to explore health diversity using a multidisciplinary approach and considering policy implications in Eastern European countries.
METHODS: We used data drawn from the European Health Interview Survey for eight Eastern European countries and EUROSTAT from 2006 through to 2009. We conducted multilevel analyses to understand the individual and national health determinants of self-rated health by gender and to determine whether national differences remain after controlling for micro variables. In order to analyze the role of equity (Gini quartile) in gender differences, Oaxaca analyses were used.
RESULTS: The self-rated health gender gap increases with age. Individual characteristics, such as educational level or smoking, influence citizens' perceived health, and have a stronger effect on women than on men. Knowing both the characteristics (endowment effects) and the effects of individual characteristics (coefficient effects) on health is important in order to understand gender gaps among people from the silent generation.
CONCLUSIONS: Our research indicates that random effects are greater for men than for women. Moreover, random effects might be explained to a certain extent by economic equity (Gini index). The combined effects of gender, cohort, and geographical differences on self-rated health have to be taken into account to develop public health policies.",,"This research was funded by the Government of Aragón (Reference Group BYCS S16_17R) and co-financed with Feder 2014–2020 “Building Europe from Aragón” and the Ministry of Economy, Industry and Competitiveness, Government of Spain, grant number: “CSO2017-82110-R”.

The scallop Argopecten purpuratus, one of the most important bivalve species subjected to fishery and aquaculture along the Humboldt Current System, inhabits spaces affected by continuous changes in temperature, pH, oxygen, and food availability driven by remote and local oceanographic processes. Specifically, in Chile, this species is mainly cultured in central-north Chile where is permanently affected by upwelling events of dissimilar intensity and duration which generate local conditions of acidification, deoxygenation, and cooling with different magnitudes. However, to date, it remains unknown how this economic valuable resource is physiologically affected throughout its life cycle by the continuous environmental changes driven by upwelling events of different intensities and duration along the year. Here, for the first time, A. purpuratus life-stage physiological sensitivity was assessed at a seasonal scale through a year-field experiment where growth, calcification, and survivorship were evaluated. Our study shows how seasonal differences in the upwelling phenology (here measured as changes in temperature, dissolved oxygen, pH, and primary productivity, but also as the number, duration, and intensity of cooling and de-oxygenation events) notably impacted the A. purpuratus physiological performance from juvenile to adult life-stages. This was especially noticeable during the spring season which showed the most intense cooling and deoxygenation events driven by stronger favorable-upwelling winds and the lowest growth and gross calcification rates (the highest decalcification rates) where adult stages showed the lowest performance. On the other hand, A. purpuratus survivorship was not significantly affected by upwelling intensity which would be providing evidence of the high physiological flexibility and well-locally adapted is this species to fluctuating and occasional stressful environmental conditions. Our results are significantly relevant in the climate change context as some upwelling systems are at risk to change shortly (i.e., an upwelling intensification in frequency and intensity) as a consequence of changes in the atmospheric pressures that modulate favourable-upwelling winds. These changes may certainly increase the climate related-risks of the entire socio-ecological systems related to the fishery and aquaculture of A. purpuratus along the Humboldt Current System.","We are very grateful to Julia Godoy, Pamela Tapia, Christian Tapia from OSTIMAR S.A., and Tongoy local school (Liceo Carmen Rodríguez Henriquez) for their support during the experiments.

In the Galapagos, mangroves have been primarily prized for their role as nursery grounds; though, the importance of cultural benefits, including the development of knowledge systems among fishers, needs to be further explored. Fishers’ local ecological knowledge (LEK) has been employed in the past to answer questions about the marine environment; not yet about mangroves. In such regard, this ethnoecological approach can contribute to unveil mangrove habitat-dependence relationships among fishery taxa across the life cycle, connectivity among habitats, and productivity spatial patterns across the archipelago. To access fishers’ LEK, we conducted 35 semi-structured interviews and 2 facilitated community workshops comprising 3 activities. A photo-elicitation method allowed us to extract values given to mangroves (i.e., ecosystem services), from which indirect use values were considered more relevant for fisheries. As such, the accumulation of LEK might have been crucial for the establishment of these values among fishers. By using a species-habitat association method, we revealed a high perceived connectivity between mangroves and other coastal and marine habitats in the Galapagos. Although this suggests an overall weak dependence to the ecosystem, fishers’ anecdotes allowed us to recognize novel species occurrences and exclusive habitat uses (e.g., spawning in Centropomus viridis). By applying Social Network Analysis to species-habitat association results, we learned that certain migratory commercial species (e.g., Lutjanus argentiventris, Seriola rivoliana) might constitute critical links in marine trophic webs and across seascapes. Finally, through scoring and participatory mapping methods, we revealed the prominence of western islands’ mangroves for fishery productivity, which were linked to biophysical attributes, like forest canopy and freshwater. Yet, other locations in central and southeastern islands might also be important, as they hold similar attributes. Interviews to other mangrove users (e.g., naturalist guides, park rangers, scientists; N = 33), and past scientific studies allowed us to triangulate LEK and to find complementarity among knowledge sources. Despite having an explorative focus, our work already showcases the potential of fishers’ LEK in improving mangrove research in the Galapagos, and the arising opportunities for ecosystem-based fisheries management and mangrove protection.","We would like to first thank to all the participants of fishing communities of Santa Cruz, San Cristobal and Isabela, including representatives and delegates from fishing cooperatives and associations, for sharing their knowledge and experiences around mangrove ecosystems, as well as providing support in our activities.

High hydrostatic pressure and ultrasound, as emerging extraction methods, constitute an alternative to conventional extraction, improving extractability and obtaining extracts rich in bioactive compounds. Therefore, lemon extracts (LEs) were obtained by conventional (orbital shaking), ultrasound-assisted, and high-hydrostatic-pressure extraction. Extracts were then microencapsulated with maltodextrin at 10% (M10), 20% (M20), and 30% (M30). The impact of microencapsulation on LEs physicochemical properties, phenolics (TPC), flavonoids (TFC) and relative bio-accessibility (RB) was evaluated. M30 promoted a higher microencapsulation efficiency for TPC and TFC, and a longer time required for microcapsules to dissolve in water, as moisture content, water activity and hygroscopicity decreased. The RBs of TPC and TFC were higher in microcapsules with M30, and lower when conventional extraction was used. The data suggest that microencapsulated LE is promising as it protects the bioactivity of phenolic compounds. In addition, this freeze-dried product can be utilized as a functional ingredient for food or supplement formulations.","The authors wish to thank FONDECYT POSTDOCTADO N° 3220661, FONDECYT REGULAR N°1220845 and DIULS PR 1921512.",The APC was funded by DIULS PR 1921512.,Molecules,,,Antioxidants; Capsules; Phenols; Plant Extracts; Water,2022-06-29,2022,2022-06-29,,27,13,4166,All OA; Gold,Article,"Giovagnoli-Vicuña, Claudia; Briones-Labarca, Vilbett; Romero, María Soledad; Giordano, Ady; Pizarro, Sebastián","Giovagnoli-Vicuña, Claudia (Departamento de Ingeniería en Alimentos, Universidad de La Serena, Av.

Recently, geopolymers have been proposed as valid and green alternatives to cement-based matrices. In this work, novel geopolymeric formulations have been studied at laboratory scale to encapsulate ashes from incineration of surrogate solid organic waste and to further pursue sustainability and circular economy goals. Indeed, the most widely used precursor of literature geopolymers, calcined kaolin, has been totally replaced by natural raw materials and recycled industrial by-products. In addition, a highly zeolitized volcanic tuff has been chosen to further improve the intrinsic cation-exchange capacity of the geopolymer, hence enhancing waste-matrix interaction. The alkaline activation of the precursors, achieved without silicates of any metal, resulted in a promisingly durable geopolymeric matrix, whose chemical composition has been optimised to provide compressive strength above 10 MPa after 28 days of curing. A water-saturated sealed chamber provided the optimal curing condition to limit the efflorescence and improve the mechanical properties. At least 20 wt% loading of treated surrogate waste was achieved, without compromising workability, setting time, and compressive strength, the latter remaining within acceptable values. In order to demonstrate matrix durability, leaching behaviour and thermal stability were preliminarily assessed by immersion tests and thermogravimetric analyses, respectively. The leachability indices of constituent elements resulted far above 6, which is the generally agreed requirement for cement-based matrices. Moreover, the mechanical resistance was not worsened by the water immersion. The preliminarily obtained results confirm the promising properties of the new matrix for the immobilization of nuclear waste.","The authors thank the KIPT (Ukraine) and Fertenia S.r.l.

192,pub.1153894063,10.5194/bg-19-5911-2022,,,Upwelled plankton community modulates surface bloom succession and nutrient availability in a natural plankton assemblage,"Abstract. Upwelling of nutrient-rich waters into the sunlit surface
layer of the ocean supports high primary productivity in eastern boundary
upwelling systems (EBUSs). However, subsurface waters contain not only
macronutrients (N, P, Si) but also micronutrients, organic matter and seed
microbial communities that may modify the response to macronutrient inputs
via upwelling. These additional factors are often neglected when
investigating upwelling impacts on surface ocean productivity. Here, we
investigated how different components of upwelled water (macronutrients,
organic nutrients and seed communities) drive the response of surface plankton
communities to upwelling in the Peruvian coastal zone. Results from our
short-term (10 d) study show that the most influential drivers in
upwelled deep water are (1) the ratio of inorganic nutrients
(NOx : PO43-) and (2) the microbial community present that can
seed heterogeneity in phytoplankton succession and modify the stoichiometry of
residual inorganic nutrients after phytoplankton blooms. Hence, this study
suggests that phytoplankton succession after upwelling is modified by
factors other than the physical supply of inorganic nutrients. This would
likely affect trophic transfer and overall productivity in these highly

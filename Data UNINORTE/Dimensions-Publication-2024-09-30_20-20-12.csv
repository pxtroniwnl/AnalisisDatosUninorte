METHODS: All patients noted to be using of glucocorticoids (GC) on an index consult from February to May 2004 were included in a descriptive cross sectional study. Criteria for inclusion of patients were to have had, at least, one previous visit to the service. We evaluated the study population for osteoporosis diagnosis, procedures, and treatment.
RESULTS: Of the 121 patients included, 103 (85.1%) were female and 18 (14.9%) were male; 76 patients (62.8%) were under 50 years, and 45 (37.2%) were over 50 years. Main reasons for corticosteroid use were rheumatoid arthritis in 68 patients (56.2%) and systemic lupus erythematous (SLE) in 31 patients (25.6%). Diagnostic testing for osteoporosis was reported on 50.1% of patients. Peripheral dual energy x-ray absorptiometry was the most frequently used method (52.6%). Therapeutic agents for GIOP were used in 96 patients (79.3%), with Calcium plus Vitamin D (55.2%) the principal treatments prescribed.
CONCLUSIONS: We found similar rates of diagnosis and treatment for GIOP to those reported in North America and Europe, although in this study treatment was mainly with calcium and vitamin D. There was a statistically significant relationship between being studied with any diagnostic method and being treated for GIOP. There may be undertreatment for GIOP in Latin America. Local interventions to improve care for patients in chronic use of steroids are needed.",,,JCR Journal of Clinical Rheumatology,,,"Absorptiometry, Photon; Bone Density Conservation Agents; Colombia; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Glucocorticoids; Humans; Male; Medical Audit; Middle Aged; Osteoporosis; Rheumatic Diseases",2008-06,2008,,2008-06,14,3,153-155,Closed,Article,"Caballero-Uribe, Carlo V.; Acosta-Velez, Juan G.; Hernandez-Ruiz, Eder A.; Rodado, Fernando M.

The DENV complex-reactive mAb identified the surface-exposed 304-GKFKV/IVKEIA-313 peptides and the DENV complex-conserved 393-KKGSSIGQ/KM-401 peptides in domain III, which were located adjacently in the native glycoprotein. Both flavivirus group-reactive mAbs reacted most strongly with fusion sequence peptides from domain II when they contained a cysteine (C) by glycine (G) substitution (underlined) (101-WGNGGGLFG-109) to represent the native rotated C side chain. The 393-401 sequence represents a newly identified epitope, present as a highly flexible coil located between the 385 and 393 cell-binding sequence and the 401 and 413 sequence involved in the E glycoprotein homo-trimer formation.

METHODS: Prospective comparison of PaO(2) and pulse oxygen saturation values in 7 NICUs at sea level in 2 countries was performed. The PaO(2) measurements were obtained from indwelling arterial catheters; simultaneous pulse oxygen saturation values were recorded if the pulse oxygen saturation values changed <1% before, during, and after the arterial gas sample was obtained.
RESULTS: We evaluated 976 paired PaO(2)/pulse oxygen saturation values in 122 neonates. Of the 976 samples, 176 (18%) from infants breathing room air had a mean pulse oxygen saturation of 93.9 +/- 4.3% and a median of 95.5%. The analysis of 800 samples from infants breathing supplemental oxygen revealed that, when pulse oxygen saturation values were 85% to 93%, the mean PaO(2) was 56 +/- 14.7 mmHg and the median 54 mmHg. At this pulse oxygen saturation level, 86.8% of the samples had PaO(2) values of 40 to 80 mmHg, 8.6% had values of <40 mmHg, and 4.6% had values of >80 mmHg. When the pulse oxygen saturation values were >93%, the mean PaO(2) was 107.3 +/- 59.3 mmHg and the median 91 mmHg. At this pulse oxygen saturation level, 39.5% of the samples had PaO(2) values of 40 to 80 mmHg and 59.5% had values of >80 mmHg.
CONCLUSIONS: High PaO(2) occurs very rarely in neonates breathing supplemental oxygen when their pulse oxygen saturation values are 85% to 93%. This pulse oxygen saturation range also is infrequently associated with low PaO(2) values. Pulse oxygen saturation values of >93% are frequently associated with PaO(2) values of >80 mmHg, which may be of risk for some newborns receiving supplemental oxygen.",The study was supported in part by a Goodard Scholarship (Dr Sola) and by funds from the Mid-Atlantic Neonatology Associates and Atlantic Neonatal Research Institute (Dr Sola).

Pre-Columbian history of the Eastern Andes in Colombia has been divided into three main periods: (i) an early colonization by groups of hunter-gatherers, (ii) an intermediate period ""Herrera"" characterized by primitive agriculture and (iii) a late stage of Chibcha-speaking groups, with agriculture and ceramics (""agroalfarero"").
OBJECTIVE: The mitochondrial DNA on ancient bone remains of the Herrera period were analyzed for comparison with modern and other ancient DNAs.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Mitochondrial DNA was extracted from 11 Herrera individuals [approximately 2,000 years before present (YBP)] found in the Madrid 2-41 archaeological site near Bogotá, Colombia. A 192 bp segment of the hypervariable segment I was amplified and sequenced, following stringent archaic DNA authenticity criteria. The sequences were compared with those in American and European databases using bioinformatics tools.
RESULTS: All individuals had identical sequences and were classified as haplogroup B. This identity may be related to the type of ritual burial performed in the site, probably exclusively for members of a hierarchically important family of the ancient Herrera society. The search for homologous sequences in the American and European mtDNA data bases produced no identical coincidences, although a Brazilian Amazonic individual (approximately 4,000 YBP) was recorded with a matching sequence.
CONCLUSION: Individuals buried in the Madrid 2-41 site were maternally closely related and showed a mtDNA sequence that is apparently absent in contemporary populations.",,,Biomédica,,,"Archaeology; Base Sequence; Bone and Bones; Colombia; Computational Biology; DNA, Mitochondrial; Databases, Nucleic Acid; Fossils; Haplotypes; History, Ancient; Humans; Paleontology; Polymorphism, Genetic; Sequence Analysis, DNA",2008-12-01,2008,2008-12-01,2008-12,28,4,569-577,All OA; Gold,Article,"Silva, Alejandro; Briceño, Ignacio; Burgos, Javier; Torres, Diana; Villegas, Victoria; Gómez, Alberto; Bernal, Jaime Eduardo; Rodríguez, José Vicente","Silva, Alejandro (Instituto de Genética Humana, Pontificia Universidad Javeriana, Bogotá, D.C., Colombia. asilvae@unal.edu.co); Briceño, Ignacio (); Burgos, Javier (); Torres, Diana (); Villegas, Victoria (); Gómez, Alberto (); Bernal, Jaime Eduardo (); Rodríguez, José Vicente ()",,"Silva, Alejandro (Pontificia Universidad Javeriana); Briceño, Ignacio (); Burgos, Javier (); Torres, Diana (); Villegas, Victoria (); Gómez, Alberto (); Bernal, Jaime Eduardo (); Rodríguez, José Vicente ()",10,3,0.11,2.69,https://revistabiomedica.org/index.php/biomedica/article/download/62/63,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1073856718,"31 Biological Sciences; 3105 Genetics; 43 History, Heritage and Archaeology; 4303 Historical Studies; 44 Human Society; 4401 Anthropology",

The increase of Na+ and Cl- effluxes on M. hypsauchen exposed to hypoxia may be related to an increase of gill ventilation and effective respiratory surface area, to avoid a reduction in the oxygen uptake, and/or with the decrease of pHe, that could inhibit Na+ and Cl- transporters and, therefore, reduce influx of these ions. Effluxes of Na+ and Cl- were lower in hypoxia than in normoxia for S. eigenmanni, possibly because in hypoxia this species would reduce gill ventilation and oxygen uptake, which would lead to a decrease of gill ion efflux and, consequently, reducing ion loss. The increase on hematocrit (Ht) during hypoxia in M. hypsauchen probably was caused by an increase of the red blood cell volume (MCV). For S. eigenmanni the increase on glucose possibly results from the usage of glucose reserve mobilization. Metynnis hypsauchen showed to be more sensitive to hypoxia than Serrasalmus eigenmanni, since the first presented more significant alterations on these osmoregulatory and hematological parameters. Nevertheless, the alterations observed for both species are strategies adopted by fishes to preserve oxygen supply to metabolizing tissues during exposure to hypoxia.",,,Brazilian Journal of Biology,,,"Adaptation, Physiological; Animals; Fishes; Hypoxia; Potassium Channels; Rivers; Sodium Channels",2008-08,2008,2008-09-23,2008-08,68,3,571-575,All OA; Gold,Article,"Baldisserotto, B.; Chippari-Gomes, AR.; Lopes, NP.; Bicudo, JEPW.; Paula-Silva, MN.; Almeida-Val, VMF.; Val, AL.","Baldisserotto, B.

OBJECTIVE: Population frequencies were determined for 17 short tandem repeats (STR) DNA markers on the Y-chromosome to compare the two identity codes and define the correlation between haplotypes and surnames in each individual.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: DNA was extracted from blood samples from 308 male individuals in provinces of Valle del Cauca, Cauca and Nariño, all in southwestern Colombia. Sample DNA was analyzed with the commercial kit AmpFLSTR Yfiler (Applied Biosystems) and examined for the following 17 Y-chromosome STR markers: DYS19, DYS389I, DYS389II, DYS390, DYS391, DYS392, DYS393, DYS385a/b, DYS437, DYS438, DYS439, DYS448, DYS456, DYS458, DYS635 and Y-GATA-H4. The frequencies of molecular haplotypes were associated with the surname reported by each individual, and a correlation table was constructed. Amerindian and European surnames were associated with the presence of allele DYS19/13, a characteristic of Amerindian populations.
RESULTS: Allele frequencies were reported for each of the 17 STR markers in the southwestern region of Colombia-high genetic and haplotypic diversities were obtained. Approximately 40% of lineage inconsistencies were found when the molecular genotype was compared with the European or Amerindian surnames.
CONCLUSIONS: Surnames must be used as population markers with reservation. The genetic evidence indicates that traditional genealogies based on surnames with or without documental support, may be inconsistant with their biological provenance.",,,Biomédica,,,"Child; Chromosomes, Human, Y; Colombia; Ethnicity; Gene Frequency; Genealogy and Heraldry; Genetic Markers; Haplotypes; Humans; Male; Names; Statistics as Topic",2008-09-01,2008,2008-09-01,2008-09,28,3,357-370,All OA; Gold,Article,"Gómez, Alberto; Avila, Sandra J; Briceño, Ignacio","Gómez, Alberto (Instituto de Genética Humana, Facultad de Medicina, Pontificia Universidad Javeriana, Bogotá, D.C, Colombia. agomez@javeriana.edu.co); Avila, Sandra J (); Briceño, Ignacio ()",,"Gómez, Alberto (Pontificia Universidad Javeriana); Avila, Sandra J (); Briceño, Ignacio ()",3,0,0.09,0.47,https://revistabiomedica.org/index.php/biomedica/article/download/74/74,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1073856697,31 Biological Sciences; 3105 Genetics; 44 Human Society; 4401 Anthropology,

The GLADEL experience in 230 children,"To evaluate disease characteristics of childhood onset SLE in Latin America and to compare this information with an adult population in the same cohort of GLADEL. A protocol was designed as a multicenter, multinational, inception cohort of lupus patients to evaluate demographic, clinical, laboratory and serological variables, as well as classification criteria, disease activity, organ damage and mortality. Descriptive statistics, chi square, Fisher's exact test, Student's t test and multiple logistic regression were used to compare childhood and adult onset SLE. 230 patients were <18 years and 884 were adult SLE patients. Malar rash, fever, oral ulcers, thrombocytopenia and hemolytic anemia and some neurologic manifestations were more prevalent in children (p<0.05). On the other hand, myalgias, Sjögren's syndrome and cranial nerve involvement were more frequently seen in adults (p<0.05). Afro-Latin-American children had a higher prevalence of fever, thrombocytopenia and hemolytic anemia. White and mestizo children had a higher prevalence of malar rash. Mestizo children had a higher prevalence of cerebrovascular disease and cranial nerve involvement. Children met SLE ACR criteria earlier with higher mean values than adults (p: 0.001).

While classical acute and chronic neuroinflammatory diseases such as meningitis or multiple sclerosis (MS) present aspects of neurodegeneration, the disease course of progressive degenerative disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD), Parkinson’s disease (PD), or stroke-mediated neuronal deficit are demonstrably affected by inflammation. These insights have immediate consequences both for research methods and for the development of novel, more efficient therapies for these diseases. In this review, we analyze the inflammatory and degenerative pathological mechanisms in the brain with particular emphasis on the classical chronic inflammatory disease MS. We demonstrate that the latest pathological considerations not only require the application of advanced research technologies to investigate new pathomechanistic pathways, but also affect the investigation, development, and monitoring of novel potential therapeutic tools.","We gratefully acknowledge the funding from the Institut für MS-Forschung (IFMS) Göttingen/Gemeinnützige Hertie-Stiftung (GHA), the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG), the Bundesministerium für Bildung und Forschung (BMBF), and the Charité–Universitätsmedizin Berlin.

Weekly doses given to women who remain undelivered after a single course may have benefits (less respiratory morbidity) or cause harm (reduced growth in utero). We aimed to find out whether multiple courses of antenatal corticosteroids would reduce neonatal morbidity and mortality without adversely affecting fetal growth.
METHODS: 1858 women at 25-32 weeks' gestation who remained undelivered 14-21 days after an initial course of antenatal corticosteroids and continued to be at high risk of preterm birth were randomly assigned to multiple courses of antenatal corticosteroids (n=937) or placebo (n=921), every 14 days until week 33 or delivery, whichever came first. The primary outcome was a composite of perinatal or neonatal mortality, severe respiratory distress syndrome, intraventricular haemorrhage (grade III or IV), periventricular leucomalacia, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, or necrotising enterocolitis. Analysis was by intention to treat. All patients and caregivers were unaware of the treatment given. This trial is registered as number ISRCTN2654148.
FINDINGS: Infants exposed to multiple courses of antenatal corticosteroids had similar morbidity and mortality to those exposed to placebo (150 [12.9%] vs 143 [12.5%]). Those receiving multiple doses of corticosteroids also weighed less at birth than those exposed to placebo (2216 g vs 2330 g, p=0.0026), were shorter (44.5 cm vs 45.4 cm, p<0.001), and had a smaller head circumference (31.1 cm vs 31.7 cm, p<0.001).
INTERPRETATION: Multiple courses of antenatal corticosteroids, every 14 days, do not improve preterm-birth outcomes, and are associated with a decreased weight, length, and head circumference at birth. Therefore, this treatment schedule is not recommended.

The surface is modeled using the repeated slabs approach. The calculation was performed solving the Kohn-Sham equation with a plane wave-pseudopotential approach and the generalized gradient approximation (GGA), using the Quantum-Espresso package. We find that with a Mn adatom, the w-BN(0001) lateral surface relaxation was around some hundredth of A˚. To study the most favorable Mn adsorption configuration we considered T1, T4 and H3 special points. We predict that the Mn-T4 structure is the most energetically favorable. We find that the adsorption of a Mn atom on top of a B atom (T1 site) is totally unfavorable. The calculated potential energy to describe the diffusion of a Mn atom on w-BN(0001) shows an energy barrier of 0.708eV. From the density of states with polarized spin we discuss the magnetic effect of Mn on w-BN(0001) surface.","AcknowledgmentsWe thank to COLCIENCIAS, DIB-Universidad Nacional de Colombia, Universidad del Norte, and Red Macro-U.A.L. for their financial support during the realization of this work.The calculations were carried out in the Hiperlab cluster of Basic Sciences in UNIVERSIDAD del NORTE-Barranquilla.",,Journal of Magnetism and Magnetic Materials,,,,2008-07,2008,,2008-07,320,14,e249-e252,Closed,Article,"Pérez, W.

In this type of operation a substantial change in the process dynamics occurs due to changes in volume, reaction rate, pressure, temperature, concentration, and other process variables. To compensate for changes in the dynamic, several matrix models are identified, and using a fuzzy supervisor a soft model transition is implemented, such that the controller and the process performance can adapt to the new operating conditions without affecting the process integrity. The control system design, its identification, and implementation are presented, focusing in the articulation between MPC (Model Predictive Control) and Fuzzy Supervision. The overall strategy is demonstrated at a simulation level using a benchmark fermentation process for Penicillin production in Fed-Batch mode. In this process glucose is used as a substrate, and a fungus, penicillium chrysogenum, is used in a fed-batch reactor to obtain penicillin. The model presents an unstructured approach to the reactor dynamic system, and the initial steps for this research required the development of an identification procedure for such zones.Copyright © 2008 by ASME",,,,Volume 2: Biomedical and Biotechnology Engineering,,,2008-01-01,2008,2009-08-26,2008-01-01,,,343-348,Closed,Proceeding,"Cantero, Katty M.; Sanjuan, Marco E.","Cantero, Katty M.

1856,pub.1092793768,10.1115/es2008-54286,,,Diesel Replacement Model for Dual Diesel-Natural Gas Engines Under Urban Traffic Operation,"The amount of Diesel (DI) that can be replaced by Natural Gas (NG) in turbocharged Diesel vehicles converted to dual operation and under urban traffic conditions is determined by the rapid changes of engine loads, which also limits the thermodynamic performance of turbochargers. Turbochargers control the air flow that enters to the engine at every single moment of its operation, and therefore supplies the Oxygen (O2 ) required for burning the fuels involved in the combustion process. This investigation models the energy consumption of a diesel engine operating in dual fuel mode in urban traffic conditions of Barranquilla, Colombia. This model is based on experimental studies of transient states of Turbocharged Diesel Engines and on recent research relating to the conversion of diesel engines to dual mode. Due to the absence of a standard test cycle for the city, this investigation uses a common driving behavior profile registered in 2006 with an urban bus Chevrolet B-70 with a Caterpillar 3126 Engine. It was determined that the greater replacement percentage was about 85% at maximum load and at cruising speeds, due to the air flow supplied by the compressor. The opposite effect was found at transient states; the absence of air is because of the turbocharger performance when the vehicle is leaving the stand-by condition.Copyright © 2008 by ASME",,,,"ASME 2008 2nd International Conference on Energy Sustainability, Volume 1",,,2008-01-01,2008,2009-06-22,2008-01-01,,,489-496,Closed,Proceeding,"Bermejo, Fabio A.; Corredor, Lesme A.","Bermejo, Fabio A.

The results of the simulations were compared with data obtained from the National Data Buoy Center and the results from NOAA's WAVEWATCH III (WW3) wave model. This study tested the applicability of the SWAN model at oceanic scales. The SWAN model was developed for coastal areas, but in version (40.11), spherical coordinates have been included in the code for oceanic applications. It was found that, in general, WW3 produces a somewhat better fit to the observations than SWAN. The same conclusion holds even when global scale WW3 results were used as boundary conditions in the SWAN simulations. Since the same wind forcing was used, we could conclude that this difference in significant wave height, Hs , could be due to the way wind energy is transferred to wave energy and its dissipation due to whitecapping in the models. The wind input parameterization in WW3 [Tolman and Chalikov, 1996] shows a better response to relatively fast changes in wind speed than the parameterization of Komen et al. [1984] used in SWAN. Although comparison between buoy observations and model output tends to favor WW3 over SWAN in deep water, we argue that the ease of use of SWAN, together with the simplification offered by just having to learn to use one model, makes the SWAN model a good option for simulations all the way from deep water up to the near shore.",,,Coastal Engineering Journal,,,,2008-03,2008,2018-01-10,2008-03,50,1,47-73,Closed,Article,"Ortiz-Royero, Juan Carlos; Mercado-Irizarry, Aurelio","Ortiz-Royero, Juan Carlos (Departamento de Física, Universidad del Norte, Km. 5 vía a Puerto Colombia, Barranquilla, Colombia, jortiz@uninorte.edu.co); Mercado-Irizarry, Aurelio (Department of Marine Sciences, University of Puerto Rico, P.

In this paper we investigate the predictors of young adolescents' transition to first intercourse using a social cognition theoretical framework. The analyses reported here were based on a longitudinal study of 2,360 students in the schools allocated to the control arm of a cluster-randomized controlled trial to investigate the effect of a school-based HIV prevention programme among Grade 8 students in Cape Town. Structural equation modelling was performed with Mplus version 3.11. Of the 1440 students who were virgins at baseline, 1,144 remained virgins 15 months later and 296 (20.6%) reported having had their first sexual intercourse. Transition to first sexual intercourse was more likely among males than females, among older students and among students with a lower socio-economic status. Transition to first sexual intercourse was significantly associated with intentions to have sexual intercourse, poor self-efficacy to negotiate delayed sex and intimate partner violence.

Furthermore, an assessment of body fat patterns was done to determine the subjects with the highest risk of overweight, hypertension and waist-to-hip ratio above the 90th percentile. Data were collected from 1817 subjects (938 boys and 879 girls), aged 7–13 years, participating in the Ellisras Longitudinal Study. Anthropometric measurements were taken according to the standard procedure of the International Society for the Advancement of Kinanthropometry. The EUROFIT test items were used to test the physical fitness of 1192 subjects (634 boys and 558 girls). Obesity was defined using the international recommended cutoff points for body mass index (BMI) in children. Hypertension was defined as the occurrence of BP levels greater or equal to the 95th percentile of height- and sex-adjusted reference levels. The prevalence of hypertension ranged from 1 to 11.4% and that of overweight 0.6–4.6%. Waist girth, BMI, triceps and subscapular skinfold showed significant (P<0.001–0.05) correlation with other fat pattern parameters (r ranging from −0.157 to 0.978) compared with significant correlations (P<0.001–0.05) with BP (r ranging from −0.071 to 0.164). Children with waist girth greater than the 90th percentile are more likely to have multiple risk factors than the children with a waist girth that is less than or equal to the 90th percentile. Longitudinal studies should verify whether changes in waist girth and skinfolds will indicate changes in cardiovascular risk factors during growth.","The financial support received from Vrije University, Amsterdam, The Netherlands, and the University of the North, South Africa, National Research Foundation and the Medical Research Council of South Africa for the Ellisras Longitudinal Growth and Health study is also acknowledged with gratitude.

1656,pub.1008856244,10.1007/978-0-387-74907-5_48,,,The Archaeology of Northern Chile,"This chapter considers prehistoric patterns of interaction in northern Chile from the time of the early agricultural settlements to the late pre-Hispanic period. Northern Chile encompasses the Atacama Desert and oases and the western valleys of the Andes mountains (Figure 48.1), more or less south to the location of contemporary Santiago/Copiapó. It is an “Andean” region in cultural, geographic and environmental terms, in contrast to the area lying south, a region characterized by temperate forests, steppes, fjords, islands, high rainfall, and extremely simple societies from the earliest prehistoric occupations through the ethnographically known peoples of Patagonia and Tierra del Fuego (see McEwan et al. 1997 for the most current discussion).The Highland Andean Tradition appeared in northern Chile by the time the old Chinchorro tradition was dying out (see Chapter 3 in this volume), overlapping Chinchorro for a period of five hundred years, and running up to recent times. Within this Andean Tradition a specific suite of features from the circum-Titicaca/altiplano area intruded into the coastal valleys of northern Chile as a result of influence from altiplano societies.The manifestation of influences from the altiplano that developed in the western valleys was somewhat different from those influences in the Atacama Desert zone. In the former, it seems there was a more direct relation to the circum-Titicaca area, becoming a constituent part of the emerging civilization that later centered on the Tiwanaku state. In the desert, the influence was rather indirect and more symbolic. This is identified with the Alto Ramirez development in both the western valleys and the Atacama Desert. My essay begins with Alto Ramirez and continues through the Inca conquest (see Figure 48.2).",,,,The Handbook of South American Archaeology,"Helaine Silverman, William H.

Junto con introducir un nuevo sistema de produccin de carcter capitalista, gener un nuevo sistema de relaciones sociales que produjo materialidades particulares. Los estudios arqueolgicos sistemticos del ciclo salitrero se reducen a esfuerzos espordicos en la dcada de 1980 y otros ms recientes en los ltimos cinco aos, todos en la regin de Antofagasta. En este artculo se sintetizan dichos estudios dejando en evidencia el claro dficit de arqueologa histrica a nivel nacional -y sobre todo industrial- con respecto al desarrollo de la arqueologa prehispnica. En el marco de una arqueologa histrico-capitalista mundial ya consolidada, discutimos, adems, cmo la formalizacin misma de una arqueologa industrial del salitre puede contribuir a dar voz a grupos desplazados de discursos dominantes. La arqueologa aportara evidencia paralela y complementaria del ciclo del salitre a aquella aportada desde la historia, literatura, sociologa y ms recientemente antropologa, siempre teniendo como fuente principal el documento escrito y/u oral, y privilegiando la “oficina” y el territorio tarapaqueo como ejes analticos. The development of the nitrate industry made a great impact not only worldwide but locally in the desertic pampa, between the end of the 19th and the beginning of the 20th centuries. Along with introducing a new system of production, it created a new system of social relations which produced a specific kind of cultural materiality. Systematic archaeological studies on the nitrate cycle are limited to scattered efforts in the 1980s and in the last five years, all of them in the Antofagasta region. In this article we summarize those studies evidencing the clear preference for the study of prehistoric over historical, let alone industrial, archaeology in Chile. Departing from a world historical-capitalist archaeology already consolidated, we also discuss the ways in which the very formalization of an industrial archaeology of nitrate could contribute to give voice to groups that are marginalized from dominant discourses. Archaeology may offer parallel and complementary evidence on the nitrate cycle to the one offered by history, literature, sociology and most recently anthropology; these disciplines have all had written and/or oral documents as main sources, and have privileged the “oficina” and Tarapac territory as analytical guidelines.",,,Chungara - Revista de Antropología Chilena,,,,2008-06,2008,2008-06,,40,1,19-30,All OA; Gold,Article,"Vilches, Flora; Rees, Charles; Silva, Claudia","Vilches, Flora (Universidad Catlica del Norte Instituto de Investigaciones Arqueolgicas y Museo, San Pedro de Atacama, Chile); Rees, Charles (); Silva, Claudia ()",,"Vilches, Flora (Catholic University of the North); Rees, Charles (); Silva, Claudia ()",18,3,,7.57,http://www.scielo.cl/pdf/chungara/v40n1/art03.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1033250202,"44 Human Society; 4404 Development Studies; 47 Language, Communication and Culture",

It is very important for the sustainability of these processes to implement strategies and alternatives in order to achieve a continuous production process and to control significant variables involved in the reaction. One of the most difficult variables to measure is the actual Biodiesel concentration inside the reactor. Neural networks have become a useful strategy to give solutions to complex problems; its application is growing faster at industries due to the inherent nonlinear behavior of the processes, modeled easily by this computational tool. The capacity of mapping a complex behavior trough input and output process data, without a complicated and hardly to obtain mathematical model, makes neural networks an attractive strategy to be implemented in most industries, in a soft sensor or a process model scheme. This investigation addresses the need to predict the concentrations of esters (biodiesel) when different triglycerides are reacting with alcohol. Concentration was estimated using an approach that uses a soft sensor that captures the dynamics of these variables through off line laboratory experiments. The soft sensor is actually a Random Activation Weight Neural Net (RAWN), which is a back propagation neural network with a fast training algorithm that does not need any iteration. Also, to reduce the complexity of the soft sensor an optimization procedure was carried out to determine the optimum number of neurons in the hidden layer. In this research Biodiesel was produced by transesterification of palm oil with ethanol and KOH as catalyst. During transesterification reaction the estimation of concentrations is determined by laboratory analysis at off line stages, these variables are very important to control the continuous process of a biodiesel plant.Copyright © 2008 by ASME",,,,Volume 2: Biomedical and Biotechnology Engineering,,,2008-01-01,2008,2009-08-26,2008-01-01,,,417-422,Closed,Proceeding,"García, Jaime; Posada, José; Villalba, Pedro; Sanjuan, Marco","García, Jaime (Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); Posada, José (Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); Villalba, Pedro (Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); Sanjuan, Marco (Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia)",,"García, Jaime (Universidad del Norte); Posada, José (Universidad del Norte); Villalba, Pedro (Universidad del Norte); Sanjuan, Marco (Universidad del Norte)",2,0,,0.45,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1092948083,"40 Engineering; 4007 Control Engineering, Mechatronics and Robotics; 4010 Engineering Practice and Education; 46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4605 Data Management and Data Science; 4611 Machine Learning",

(2002)). Traffic engineering has become a key issue within these new architectures, as supporting QoS requires more sophisticated resource management tools. Traffic engineering aims to optimize the performance of operational networks. The main objective is to reduce congestion hot spots and improve resource utilization. This can be achieved by setting up explicit routes through the physical network in such a way that the traffic distribution is balanced across several traffic trunks. This load balancing technique can be achieved by multicommodity network flow (Pioro, M., & Medhi, D. (2004)) formulation. This leads to the traffic being shared over multiple routes between the ingress node and the egress nodes in order to avoid link saturation and hence the possibility of congestion, which is the inability to transmit a volume of information with the established capacities for a particular equipment or network.",,,,Encyclopedia of Internet Technologies and Applications,"Mario Freire, Manuela Pereira",,2008,2008,,,,,339-345,Closed,Chapter,"Freire, Mario; Pereira, Manuela; Donoso, Yezid; Fabregat, Ramón","Freire, Mario (); Pereira, Manuela (); Donoso, Yezid (Universidad del Norte, Colombia); Fabregat, Ramón (Girona University, Spain)",,"Freire, Mario (); Pereira, Manuela (); Donoso, Yezid (Universidad del Norte); Fabregat, Ramón (University of Girona)",0,0,,0.0,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1005009001,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3509 Transportation, Logistics and Supply Chains; 40 Engineering; 4005 Civil Engineering",

No cases of disseminated BCG disease occurred in either group of children. While no cases of regional BCG disease were noted in exposed/uninfected children, the rate of regional BCG disease in HIV-infected children was 4.5% (3/66); the three events occurred in <1-year-old children (3/17; 17.6%). One case was associated with severe immunodepression before highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). Two cases were manifestations of immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS).

This paper introduces the A3 (a tree) algorithm, a simple, dis-tributed, and energy-efficient topology construction mechanism that finds a sub-optimal Connected Dominating Set (CDS) to turn unnecessary nodes off while keeping the network connected and providing complete communication coverage. A3 utilizes a weighted distance-energy-based metric that permits the network operator to trade off the lengths of the branches (distance) for the robustness and durability of the tree (energy). Comparisons with other well-known topology construction mechanisms show the superiority of the proposed scheme in terms of the number of active nodes and energy efficiency. Simulation experiments show that to achieve complete communication coverage, A3 needs only 6% and 41% of the nodes active in dense and sparse scenarios, versus 8% and 43% and 5% and 43% of the EECDS and CDS-Rule-K algorithms, respectively. More importantly, the proposed protocol presents a low linearly bounded worst-case amount of messages per node that limits the overhead and the energy usage compared to a non-linear increase of the EECDS and CDS-Rule-K algorithms.",,,,IEEE GLOBECOM 2008 - 2008 IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference,,,2008-11-01,2008,,2008-11-01,,,1-6,Closed,Proceeding,"Wightman, Pedro M.; Labrador, Miguel A.","Wightman, Pedro M.

This paper describes detailed mortality patterns of a rural African population in the central region of Limpopo Province.
METHODS: These data were based on yearly household visits to collect data on vital events, covering 63, 873 person-years of observation over eight years.
RESULTS: Crude mortality was 7.5 per 1,000 person-years (females: 6.9, males: 8.1). Under-1 year and under-5 years mortality was 15.1 and 5.8 per 1,000 person-years, respectively. Life expectancy at birth was 64.3 years (females: 68.1, males: 60.0). For the two four-year periods (1996-9 and 2000-3) under-20 years mortality risk decreased (rate ratio=0.45, 95% CI: 0.25 to 0.80) while 20-49 years mortality risk increased (rate ratio=1.55, 95% CI: 1.10 to 2.20). Multivariate mortality risk for migrants remained relatively constant (0.71, 95% CI: 0.54 to 0.94) across the two four-year periods, but has increased 2.5-fold in all DDSS +50 year-old adults across the two four-year periods.
CONCLUSIONS: The DDSS mortality estimates appear to have remained relatively constant while recent mortality estimates for the Agincourt Demographic and Health Surveillance System (ADHSS) site suggest that mortality risk is higher and life expectancy is lower in ADHSS residents. Moreover, DDSS mortality estimates are substantially more favourable compared with provincial and national mortality estimates.",,,Scandinavian Journal of Public Health,,,"Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Cause of Death; Child; Child, Preschool; Disease Outbreaks; Female; HIV Infections; Humans; Infant; Infant Mortality; Life Expectancy; Male; Middle Aged; Mortality; Population Surveillance; Risk Factors; Rural Population; Sex Distribution; Socioeconomic Factors; South Africa",2008-08-06,2008,2008-08-06,2008-09,36,7,753-760,Closed,Article,"Cook, Ian; Alberts, Marianne; Burger, Sandy; Byass, Peter","Cook, Ian (Department of Kinesiology, University of Limpopo (Turfloop Campus), Sovenga, South Africa,); Alberts, Marianne (Department of Medical Sciences, University of Limpopo (Turfloop Campus), Sovenga, South Africa); Burger, Sandy (Department of Geography, University of Limpopo (Turfloop Campus), Sovenga, South Africa); Byass, Peter (Umeå International School of Public Health, Umeå University, Umeå, Sweden)",,"Cook, Ian (University of Limpopo); Alberts, Marianne (University of Limpopo); Burger, Sandy (University of Limpopo); Byass, Peter (Umeå University)",11,0,0.38,1.8,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1064001471,42 Health Sciences; 4202 Epidemiology; 4206 Public Health,3 Good Health and Well Being

STUDY DESIGN: A register-based analysis of incidence in the period 1993-2006.
METHODS: NAO, a part of Arkhangelskaja Oblast in north-west Russia, has a population of 42,000 inhabitants. The central oncological hospital of the oblast registers all new cases of cancer. All new cases recorded in the study period among official residents of NAO were included in the study, except for secondary malignant neoplasm, cases revealed by autopsy and cancers diagnosed within 6 months of a previous cancer diagnosis. The census and annual sex and age-group-specific population figures for NAO were obtained from the regional statistics office. Crude and age-adjusted incidence rates (to the world standard population) were estimated.
RESULTS: The average crude cancer incidence per year was 204/100,000 among men and 194/100,000 among women. Adjusted for age, the incidence was 322/100,000 and 182/100,000, respectively. The most frequent primary site of cancer was trachea, bronchus and lung, which constituted 17.3% of all cases (of which 87% were among men), followed by stomach cancer (12.5%). Breast cancer constituted 17.5% of all cases among women.
CONCLUSIONS: The results are consistent with reports of a low cancer risk among women compared with men in Russia and compared with women in Western countries and with results that point out that public health measures are needed to curb the lung cancer epidemic among men in Russia. The high risks of pancreas, kidney and oesophagus cancers among men should be investigated further.",,,International Journal of Circumpolar Health,,,Arctic Regions; Ethnicity; Female; Humans; Incidence; Male; Middle Aged; Neoplasms; Russia,2008-12,2008,2016-12-15,2008-12,67,5,433-444,All OA; Gold,Article,"Vaktskjold, Arild; Ungurjanu, Tatjana N.; Klestsjinov, Nikolaj M.","Vaktskjold, Arild (Nordic School of Public Health (a subsidiary of the Nordic Council of Ministers, Denmark), Sweden); Ungurjanu, Tatjana N.

Our system is composed of two stages. A person detector is first applied to provide crude information about the possible locations of humans. Then a constrained clustering algorithm groups the detections and rejects false positives based on the appearance similarity and spatio-temporal coherence. In the second stage, we apply a top-down pictorial structure model to complete the extraction of the humans in arbitrary motion. During this procedure, a density propagation technique based on a mixture of Gaussians is employed to propagate temporal information in a principled way. This method reduces greatly the search space for the measurement in the inference stage. We demonstrate the initial success of this framework both quantitatively and qualitatively by using a number of YouTube videos.",,,Lecture Notes in Computer Science,Computer Vision – ECCV 2008,"David Forsyth, Philip Torr, Andrew Zisserman",,2008,2008,,2008,5305,,527-540,Closed,Chapter,"Niebles, Juan Carlos; Han, Bohyung; Ferencz, Andras; Fei-Fei, Li","Niebles, Juan Carlos (Princeton University, Princeton, NJ, USA; Universidad del Norte, Colombia); Han, Bohyung (Mobileye Vision Technologies, Princeton, NJ, USA); Ferencz, Andras (Mobileye Vision Technologies, Princeton, NJ, USA); Fei-Fei, Li (Princeton University, Princeton, NJ, USA)",,"Niebles, Juan Carlos (Princeton University; Universidad del Norte); Han, Bohyung (Mobileye Vision Technologies, Princeton, NJ, USA); Ferencz, Andras (Mobileye Vision Technologies, Princeton, NJ, USA); Fei-Fei, Li (Princeton University)",31,0,,5.91,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1028553810,"46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4607 Graphics, Augmented Reality and Games",

The program is called DESASS (DEsign and Simulation of Activated Sludge Systems) and has been developed by CALAGUA research group. The mathematical model implemented is the Biological Nutrient Removal Model No.1 (BNRM1) which allows simulating the most important physical, chemical and biological processes taking place in treatment plants. DESASS calculates the performance under steady or transient state of whole treatment schemes including primary settlers, volatile fatty acid generation systems by primary sludge fermentation, activated sludge systems for biological organic matter and nutrient removal, chemical phosphorus precipitation, secondary settlers, gravity thickeners and sludge digesters (aerobic and anaerobic). Biological conversions occurring in settlers and thickeners (primary sludge fermentation, denitrification) are also taken into account, i.e. they are considered as reactive elements. DESASS also includes pH calculation coupled to biological processes in all the elements, so pH effect on biological processes can be directly simulated. Furthermore, the effect of sidestreams on nutrient removal efficiency can be estimated because the performance of the whole plant can be simulated.","AcknowledgementsFinancial support from Entidad Pública de Saneamiento de Aguas Residuales de la Comunidad Valenciana, SEARSA y AQUAGEST is gratefully acknowledged.",,Environmental Modelling & Software,,,,2008-01,2008,,2008-01,23,1,19-26,Closed,Article,"Ferrer, J.; Seco, A.; Serralta, J.; Ribes, J.; Manga, J.; Asensi, E.; Morenilla, J.J.; Llavador, F.","Ferrer, J.

Most of the previous works [6],[16],[21] treat these spatial-temporal features as a bag of video words, omitting any long range, global information in either the spatial or temporal domain. Other ways of learning temporal signature of motion tend to impose a fixed trajectory of the features or parts of human body returned by tracking algorithms. This leaves little flexibility for the algorithm to learn the optimal temporal pattern describing these motions. In this paper, we propose the usage of spatial-temporal correlo-grams to encode flexible long range temporal information into the spatial-temporal motion features. This results into a much richer description of human actions. We then apply an unsupervised generative model to learn different classes of human actions from these ST-correlograms. KTH dataset, one of the most challenging and popular human action dataset, is used for experimental evaluation. Our algorithm achieves the highest classification accuracy reported for this dataset under an unsupervised learning scheme.",This work is supported by a NSF grant 0413312.

The existence of large crystals should allow homoepitaxial growth of ZnO films for advanced optoelectronic devices. However, the ZnO substrates are not yet mature. Both defect induced by growth and by polishing together with the high reactivity of the surface are problems to their industrial application. Cathodoluminescence (CL) was used to probe the quality of substrates from two different suppliers. The surface damage was studied by varying the penetration depth of the electron beam, allowing to observe significant differences between the two samples within a 0.5-μm-thick surface layer. CL spectra show a complex band (P1) at ∼3.3eV composed of two overlapped bands (3.31 and 3.29eV) related to point defects (PD) and the 1-LO phonon replica of the free exciton (FX-1LO). This band (P1) is shown to be very sensitive to the presence of defects and the surface and thermal treatments. Its intensity compared with the excitonic band intensity is demonstrated to provide criteria about the quality of the substrates.",AcknowledgmentsThe Spanish group was funded by the EOARD (Grant FA8655-04-13073).

A video sequence is represented as a collection of spatial-temporal words by extracting space-time interest points. The algorithm automatically learns the probability distributions of the spatial-temporal words and the intermediate topics corresponding to human action categories. This is achieved by using latent topic models such as the probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis (pLSA) model and Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA). Our approach can handle noisy feature points arisen from dynamic background and moving cameras due to the application of the probabilistic models. Given a novel video sequence, the algorithm can categorize and localize the human action(s) contained in the video. We test our algorithm on three challenging datasets: the KTH human motion dataset, the Weizmann human action dataset, and a recent dataset of figure skating actions. Our results reflect the promise of such a simple approach.

Adiposity measures included body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC) and percentage body fat (PBF).Results:Sedentarism (<5000 steps day−1) was found in 13.7%, while 39.7% were classified as accruing sufficient physical activity (⩾10 000 steps day−1). Significant associations (P<0.02) existed between steps day−1 and adiposity measures (r=−0.22 to −0.23). After adjusting for age, only BMI remained significantly associated with steps day−1 (r=−0.20, P=0.032). Significant age-adjusted linear trends were found across combined BMI–WC risk categories for steps day−1 (P=0.036). Adjusting for age, motor vehicle access, education, use of tobacco products and comorbidities, BMI decreased 1.4 kg m−2 per 5000 steps day−1 (P=0.035), access to a motor vehicle within the household increased PBF by 4% (P=0.018), and compared with sedentarism, the risk of obesity (BMI ⩾30 kg m−2) was 52% lower at 10 000 steps day−1 (P=0.028).Conclusion:Modest associations were found between adiposity and ambulation.

We studied the case of armchair and zigzag GNRs with quasi-one-dimensional side-attached molecules, such as linear poly-aromatic hydrocarbons and poly(para-phenylene). These nanostructures are described using a single-band tight-binding Hamiltonian and their electronic conductance and density of states are calculated within the Green's function formalism based on real-space renormalization techniques. We found that the conductance exhibits an even-odd parity effect as a function of the length of the attached molecules. Furthermore, the corresponding energy spectrum of the molecules can be obtained as a series of Fano antiresonances in the conductance of the system.

The multi-armed sea star Heliaster helianthus is a key predator of the intertidal and the shallow rocky subtidal communities of north-central Chile. Natural populations of this sea star have been found with up to 60% of the individuals showing some degree of autotomy. The present study evaluated the effects of autotomy on feeding rate and growth of juvenile and adult H. helianthus after experimentally induced autotomy of 17% and 33% of their arms, as well as on the energy content of the pyloric caeca and gonads of adults during the reproductive period. Experimental juvenile sea stars were maintained and fed in the laboratory over a period of five months and adult sea stars for one month, Intact individuals were maintained as parallel controls. The results showed that juveniles undergoing 33% autotomy decreased their feeding rates, and as a consequence showed lowered net individual growth. In contrast, adults with 17% and 33% autotomy showed marked reductions in feeding. The results showed that autotomized adults had between five and seven times lower contents of carbohydrates, lipids, and proteins (and thus energetic content) in their pyloric caeca and gonads. The loss of the arms not only decreased the capacity for feeding in sea stars, but also allocated energy away from growth and reproduction into the process of regeneration of arms. This suggests that autotomy reduces the fitness of H. helianthus. Growth was reduced in the juveniles, while adults became limited in their ability to store energy which then limited their reproductive potential. Finally, based on the important effect of autotomy on reducing the feeding capacity of H. helianthus, the role of this sea star as a predator in the environment may be strongly affected.","AcknowledgmentsWe are grateful to M.J.

METHODS: Study conducted in a sample of 178 female homemakers (n=101) and female health providers (n=77) from Antofagasta, Chile, in 20062007. Homemakers were considered at social risk. HIV vulnerability was estimated through a 21-item instrument comprising three domains: gender roles; relationship with the partner; and attitude toward condom use. For determining the relative weight of each dimension to total vulnerability a multiple regression analysis was carried out using the instrument's total score as dependent variable and each domain as independent variable.
RESULTS: Overall, the domain showing the highest relative weight was attitude toward condom use (0.542), followed by relationship with the partner (0.453) and gender roles (0.379). There were weight differences between homemakers: relationship with the partner (0.597), attitude toward condom use (0.508) and gender roles (0,403); and health providers: attitude toward condom use (0.638), relationship with the partner (0.397), and gender roles (0.307).

The problem, for astronomers, is that the black hole is postulated to be accreting surrounding gas through an accretion disk, and observations so far have not corroborated the model. In particular, the 'standard disk' model predicts a specific blue spectral shape from the visible to near-infrared, which had not shown up in the spectra. Kishimoto et al. now report observations of polarized light interior to the dust-emitting region of several quasars that reveal the characteristic blue spectrum of an accretion disk in the near-infrared. This indicates that, at least in the outer near-infrared emitting radii, the standard picture of the locally heated disk is approximately correct.","The UK Infrared Telescope (UKIRT) is operated by the Joint Astronomy Centre on behalf of the Science and Technology Facilities Council of the UK.

The sample population was composed of children and their parents who ascended within 24 hours from Arica (sea level) to Putre (3500 m) in Chile.
METHODS: Acute mountain sickness symptoms were evaluated using the Children's Lake Louise Score (CLLS) in children and the Lake Louise Scoring System in their parents. Heart rate, pulse oximetry, and AMS symptoms were evaluated in Arica before ascent, in Putre, and on return to Arica.
RESULTS: The mean CLLS was 10.8 +/- 3 at Putre, with 92% of children developing AMS. Low oxygen saturation (80% +/- 2%) and tachycardia (129 +/- 9 beats/min) were observed in children with higher AMS scores. In contrast, parents had higher oxygen saturation (89% +/- 3%), less tachycardia (87 +/- 13 beats/min), and a 25% incidence of AMS.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that children exposed acutely to high altitude are more sensitive to hypobaric hypoxia than are their parents, as manifested by symptoms of AMS, significant oxyhemoglobin desaturation, and tachycardia. Young children may experience an exaggerated hypoxemic response to high altitude exposure, and young age may be an additional risk factor for the development of AMS.",,,Wilderness and Environmental Medicine,,,"Adaptation, Physiological; Adult; Altitude Sickness; Child, Preschool; Chile; Female; Humans; Male; Oxygen Consumption; Surveys and Questionnaires; Travel",2008,2008,,2008,19,4,287-292,Closed,Article,"Moraga, Fernando A.; Pedreros, Constanza P.; Rodríguez, Cristián E.","Moraga, Fernando A.

The percentage of women receiving bachelor's and master's degrees in engineering has hovered at around 20% for several years. No matter how we look at these numbers and at related statistics, the conclusion is that we are not moving toward parity; by and large, we are not moving at all. The efforts to understand why young women do not choose engineering as a career path and the various programs designed to reverse the course are numerous.

METHODS AND RESULTS: The P. haloplanktis isolated from a scallop hatchery was used to analyse antibacterial activities. Crude extracts were obtained with ethyl acetate of the cultured broth, after separation of bacterial cells, and assays against six strains of marine bacteria and nine clinically important pathogenic bacteria. The active compounds were purified from ethyl acetate extracts, by a combination of SiO(2) column and thin layer chromatography. Two active fractions were isolated, and chemical structures of two products from the major one were unambiguously identified as isovaleric acid (3-methylbutanoic acid) and 2-methylbutyric acid (2-methylbutanoic acid), by comparing their mass spectra and (1)H- and (13)C-nuclear magnetic resonance spectra to those of authentic compounds.
CONCLUSIONS: In the antibacterial activity of P. haloplanktis INH strain, extra cell compounds are involucred, mainly isovaleric and 2-methylbutyric acids.
SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Production of antimicrobial compounds by marine micro-organisms has been widely reported; however, the efforts not always are conducted to purification and applications of these active compounds. This study is a significant contribution to the knowledge of compounds unique from marine bacteria as potential sources of new drugs in the pharmacological industry.","We thank to Dr Paula Díaz‐Palma, Dr Carlos Contreras, Dr Victor Kesternich and Dr Marta Hengst for their constructive comments on the manuscript.

Six hundred and fifty-six fish belonging to seven species were necropsied and examined for parasites, from which 31 species of metazoan parasites were recorded. The community was dominated by the nematodes both in species and numbers. Most species were generalists with only two trematodes, Diplostomum mashonense and Tylodelphys species, being specialists of Clarias gariepinus. Ten species were considered core and predictable. Parasite species richness, number of individuals per host and Shannon-Wiener diversity indices were generally high. At the compound community level, a mean number of 7.8 parasites were shared among different species of fish and the maximum number of parasites species per fish at the infracommunity level was seven. Levels of similarity in parasite species richness at the component community level ranged from 29.6 to 61.5%. The study concludes that parasite communities in clariid fishes of Lake Victoria are structured by ecological factors. At the infracommunity level, host size, diet and vagility promoted a richer parasite community. At the compound level, two factors were crucial, namely the intermixing of the waters in the lake and the predominant and mobile C. gariepinus.",,,Journal of Helminthology,,,Animals; Catfishes; Cestoda; Crustacea; Diet; Female; Fresh Water; Host-Parasite Interactions; Intestines; Leeches; Male; Mouth; Nematoda; Parasites; Skin; Species Specificity; Tanzania; Trematoda,2008-03-01,2008,2008-03-01,2008-03,82,1,7-16,Closed,Article,"Mwita, Chacha; Nkwengulila, Gamba","Mwita, Chacha (Department of Fisheries Science and Aquaculture, Faculty of Aquatic Sciences and Technology, University of Dar Es Salaam, PO Box 35064, Dar Es Salaam, Tanzania); Nkwengulila, Gamba (Department of Zoology and Wildlife Conservation, Faculty of Science, University of Dar Es Salaam, PO Box 35064, Dar Es Salaam, Tanzania)","Mwita, Chacha (University of Dar es Salaam)","Mwita, Chacha (University of Dar es Salaam); Nkwengulila, Gamba (University of Dar es Salaam)",28,3,0.39,2.45,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1045600290,"30 Agricultural, Veterinary and Food Sciences; 3005 Fisheries Sciences; 31 Biological Sciences; 3103 Ecology",14 Life Below Water

Materials and methods: A retrospective follow-up study was carried out in women on treatment for breast cancer, selected from public and private institutions in six cities. A survey to collect information about health insurance status and economic, geographic, organizational and administrative barriers that might constrain access to diagnosis by biopsy was applied. To evaluate equity logistic regression model to calculate odds ratios to establish the association between health insurance status and putative barriers was used. Finally a multivariate analysis to control for confounding factors of women sociodemographic conditions was performed. Additionally interaction with their educative level and their residence location was evaluated. Results: Higher probabilities of barriers to biopsy in women with subsidized health insurance (OR 3.8 CI 95% 2.65-5.49) and for those without insurance (OR 4.9 CI 95% 3.00-7.99), compared to the insured women to face economic barriers for accessing diagnosis services for breast cancer were found. Also, women with health subsidized by the government together with those living in rural areas have a greater probability of geographic barriers (OR 2.0; CI 1.31-3.22) and (OR: 11.0 CI 95% 6.45-18.51) respectively. Conclusions: The study suggests that the use of diagnosis services for breast cancer is inequitable because the differences in probabilities affect the most vulnerable groups.

In a first experiment, a group of resonators are loaded with the same amount of mass but different contact areas, achieving responsivities as high as 10−19g/Hz, and potential sensitivities in the order of 10−14g. These numbers are at least one order of magnitude higher than those obtained for uniform thin-film loadings, although it is clear that sensitivity decreases with the area of the localized-mass. The current phase-noise levels and the quality factor of resonators would allow measuring frequency changes of 30kHz – the minimum measured frequency shifting has been 500kHz so far – due to a mass deposition of 9.0×10−15g. In a second experiment, localized-loadings with the same mass are located in different positions of the top electrodes of the corresponding FBARs. It was found out that a location change of the mass in the electrode causes different magnitudes of frequency shifting. A discussion on these topics is opened, in order to define future applications and research lines concerning localized-mass sensing in FBARs.","AcknowledgementsThis work has been supported by Seiko EPSON Corporation, through its European branch EPSON Europe Electronics GmbH and EPSON&#x27;s Barcelona Research and Development Laboratory (BRDL).

However, basic knowledge of its trophic biology is still scarce. Studies of this kind are critical to the successful development of farming techniques as an alternative to the harvest of natural populations. The aims of this study were to quantify the composition of L. albus' natural diet, to determine the assimilation efficieney of the most important dietary components, and to experimentally examine the species' trophic selectivity. Adult and juvenile specimens were sampled in spring 1993 and summer, fall and winter 1994 from the shallow subtidal zone of Iquique, northern Chile. Neither juveniles or adults showed significant seasonal differences in dietary composition. The main tems in the diet were the green alga Ulva sp. for juveniles and the kelp Lessonia sp. for adults. In adults, assimilation efficieney (as percentage of the total organic matter ingested) was not significantly different among individuals that consumed Lessonia sp. (48.7 %), Ulva sp. (44.6 %) and Macrocystis (38.1 %), whereas in juveniles assimilation efficieney was significantly higher for individuals fed on the chlorophyte Ulva sp. (55.4 %), followed by Lessonia sp. (35.0 %) and Macrocystis (25.5 %). These results suggest that L. albus undergoes an ontogenetic shift in the diet, consisting of a differential foraging strategy between juveniles and adults. El erizo Loxechinus albus (Molina, 1782) es un recurso de gran importancia econmica en los sistemas bentnicos costeros, y que se encuentra bajo una fuerte presin de explotacin. Sin embargo, los antecedentes sobre diversos aspectos bsicos de su biologa trfica son an escasos. Estudios de esta naturaleza son importantes en razn a que constituyen la base para el desarrollo de tcnicas de cultivo exitosas, alternativa a la explotacin de poblaciones naturales. Los objetivos del presente trabajo fueron: determinar cuantitativamente la composicin dietaria de L. albus, el grado de selectividad trfica, y las tasas de asimilacin de los componentes de su dieta. Especmenes adultos y juveniles fueron muestreados en la primavera de 1993 y el verano, otoo e invierno de 1994 en la zona submareal de Iquique, norte de Chile. No se detectaron diferencias en la composicin de la dieta de adultos y juveniles entre las estaciones muestreadas. El principal tem alimentario de los juveniles y adultos fueron el alga verde Ulva sp. y el alga parda Lessonia sp., respectivamente. En experimentos de seleccin trfica se observ que los juveniles y adultos prefieren el tem que es ms abundante en su dieta natural.

Germination test was carried out at 25°C and the following parameters were analyzed: percentage of germination, initial, average, and final germination time. Seed reserve quantification was monitored in quiescent seeds and during different stages of radicle growth. Starch mobilization was studied in function of a-amylase activity. Germination reached 87.5% at the initial, average, and final time of 16, 21 and 30 days, respectively. Oil mobilization showed a negative linear behavior, decreasing 40% between the first and the last stage analyzed, whereas protein levels increased 34.7% during the initial period of germination. Starch content (46.4%) was the highest among those of the metabolites analyzed and starch mobilization occurred inversely to the observed for soluble sugars; alpha-amylase activity increased until the 15th day, a period before radicle emission and corresponding to the highest starch mobilization.

The study comprised 19 focus group discussions with adolescents aged 12 to 14 years. The informants depict male sexuality as biologically predetermined, where physical needs and practices such as circumcision legitimize early sexual debut. Furthermore, the construction of male sexual identity and power imbalances in relationships are already evident at an early age, and age and economics are pertinent factors affecting social relations. Violent behavior and sexual abuse are supported by constructed gender inequalities forming an often negative and nonsupportive environment for young people. We stress the importance of planned HIV and sexuality education for young adolescents with support structures that can help endorse individual actions and informed choices.

METHODS: Data were extracted through MEDLINE from papers published between 1993 and 2007. Surveys, reviews, clinical studies and comments were included in this review. The impact of cost, moral, social, personal and psychological factors were taken into consideration.
RESULTS: Several factors were associated with non-use of a condom during sexual intercourse. Their cost often posed a barrier to condom use for the poor, even in developed countries. In many communities, moral values, ethnic and religious factors also played a role. Among other social factors, gender inequality, lack of a dialogue among partners with regard to condom use, and the stigma attached to the condom could all lead to unprotected sexual intercourse. Personal factors such as aversion to the condom, consumption of alcohol or use of drugs prior to sexual intercourse, and anxiety and depression all were negatively associated with condom use.
CONCLUSION: Their cost evidently poses a barrier to the use of condoms by the poor. Beside social stigmas and personal reluctance, prevailing moral norms and religious interdicts also adversely affect use of these devices in many communities. Because of their disastrous consequences in the domain of public health each of these barriers must be effectively addressed.",,,The European Journal of Contraception & Reproductive Health Care,,,Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome; Condoms; Humans; Morals; Patient Acceptance of Health Care; Religion; Safe Sex; Sexually Transmitted Diseases; Socioeconomic Factors,2008-01,2008,2009-07-06,2008-01,13,2,114-122,Closed,Article,"Sarkar, N.

Electronic properties are calculated by means of semiempirical (PM3), ab initio (HF/3-21G) and density functional theory (B3LYP/6-31+G*) methodologies. Three different electronic states, neutral quinones, hydroquinones and semiquinones, are studied to investigate if any one of them are statistically related with the biological activities. The best correlations were obtained at the B3LYP level of theory because it includes electronic correlation. The QSAR-2D indicates that the best trypanocidal growth inhibitors are molecules in the semiquinone electronic state, with the following properties: (a) high negative value of EHOMO, (b) high negative charge in the oxygen atoms of the carbonyl groups, (c) high positive charge in the carbon atom of one of carbonyl moieties and (d) high electronegativity (chi). In a complementary way, the QSAR-3D indicates that the electrostatic field correlates with trypanocidal activity and the presence of bulk moieties would increase activity. The idea of comparing the three electronic states may prove to be of most importance in the general strategy to the design of new trypanocidal drugs. In fact, the experimental results showed that semiquinone is the one really statistically relevant indicating a clear connection between biochemical and theoretical aspects. Finally, we demonstrated that to be a good anti-trypanosomatid compound, the molecule must be a good electron acceptor to reach easily the essential semiquinone state. We expect that the present results motivate new experimental as well as theoretical investigations that confirm our findings.","AcknowledgementsThis work was supported by the ChagaSpace project, LFMMB, Fac.

Samples were inoculated into mineral media with 10 mM NH4+ at five different salt concentrations (10, 200, 400, 800 and 1,400 mM NaCl). Low diversity (up to three phylotypes per enrichment) of beta-AOB was detected using 16S rDNA and amoA clone libraries. Growth of beta-AOB was only recorded in a few enrichment cultures and varied according to site or media salinity. In total, five 16S rDNA and amoA phylotypes were found which were related to Nitrosomonas europaea/Nitrosococcus mobilis, N. marina and N. communis clusters. Phylotype 1-16S was 97% similar with N. halophila, previously isolated from Mongolian soda lakes, and phylotypes from amoA sequences were similar with yet uncultured beta-AOB from different biofilms. Sequences related to N. halophila were frequently found at all salinities.

1021,pub.1021277669,10.1016/j.jmps.2008.08.005,,,Instabilities in shear and simple shear deformations of gold crystals,"We use the tight-binding potential and molecular mechanics simulations to study local and global instabilities in shear and simple shear deformations of three initially defect-free finite cubes of gold single crystal containing 3480, 7813, and 58,825 atoms. Displacements on all bounding surfaces are prescribed while studying simple shear deformations, but displacements on only two opposite surfaces are assigned during simulations of shear deformations with the remaining four surfaces kept free of external forces. The criteria used to delineate local instabilities in the system include the following: (i) a component of the second-order spatial gradients of the displacement field having large values relative to its average value in the body, (ii) the minimum eigenvalue of the Hessian of the energy of an atom becoming non-positive, and (iii) structural changes represented by a high value of the common neighborhood parameter. It is found that these criteria are met essentially simultaneously at the same atomic position. Effects of free surfaces are evidenced by different deformation patterns for the same specimen deformed in shear and simple shear. The shear strength of a specimen deformed in simple shear is more than three times that of the same specimen deformed in shear. It is found that for each cubic specimen deformed in simple shear the evolution with the shear strain of the average shear stress, prior to the onset of instabilities, is almost identical to that in an equivalent hyperelastic material with strain energy density derived from the tight-binding potential and the assumption that it obeys the Cauchy–Born rule. Even though the material response of the hyperelastic body predicted from the strain energy density is stable over the range of the shear strain simulated in this work, the molecular mechanics simulations predict local and global instabilities in the three specimens.","AcknowledgementsThis work was partially supported by the ONR grant N00014-99-06-0567 to Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University with Dr. Y.D.S.

C., J. Phys. Chem. 1981, 85, 727] with charged solutes. These predictions can be very useful to a priori design or identify optimal operating conditions for a Couette-based device for field flow fractionation when the orthogonal field is an electrical field. Mathematically friendly relationships are obtained by applying the method of spatial averaging to the solute species continuity equation; this is accomplished after the role of the capillary geometrical dimensions on the applied electrical field equations has been assessed [Oyanader M. A., Arce P., Electrophoresis 2005; 26, 2857]. Moreover, explicit analytical expressions are derived for the effective parameters, i.e. diffusivity and convective velocity as functions of the applied (orthogonal) electrical field. These effective transport parameters are used to study the effect of the cation valence of the solutes and of the magnitude of the applied orthogonal electrical field on the values of the optimal time of separation. These parameters play a significant role in controlling the optimal separation time, leading to a family of minimum values, for particular magnitudes of the applied orthogonal electrical field.","Acknowledgements The authors are indebted to helpful discussions with Dr. Sharon G.

The exopolysaccharide slime (EPS) producing CAM2 strain was isolated as the primary organism from moribund larvae in a pathogenic outbreak occurring in a commercial hatchery producing larvae of the Chilean scallop Argopecten purpuratus located in Bahía Inglesa, Chile. The CAM2 strain was characterized biochemically and was identified by polymerase chain reaction amplification of 16S rRNA as Halomonas sp. (Accession number DQ885389.1). Healthy 7-day-old scallop larvae cultures were experimentally infected for a 48-h period with an overnight culture of the CAM2 strain at a final concentration of ca. 105 cells per milliliter, and the mortality and vital condition of larvae were determined by optical and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) to describe the chronology of the disease. Pathogenic action of the CAM2 strain was clearly evidenced by SEM analysis, showing a high ability to adhere and detach larvae velum cells by using its “slimy” EPS, producing agglutination, loss of motility, and a posterior sinking of scallop larvae. After 48 h, a dense bacterial slime on the shell surface was observed, producing high percentages of larval agglutination (63.28 ± 7.87%) and mortality (45.03 ± 4.32%) that were significantly (P < 0.05) higher than those of the unchallenged control cultures, which exhibited only 3.20 ± 1.40% dead larvae and no larval agglutination. Furthermore, the CAM2 strain exhibited a high ability to adhere to fiberglass pieces of tanks used for scallop larvae rearing (1.64 × 105 cells adhered per square millimeters at 24 h postinoculation), making it very difficult to eradicate it from the culture systems. This is the first report of a pathogenic activity on scallop larvae of Halomonas species, and it prompts the necessity of an appraisal on biofilm-producing bacteria in Chilean scallop hatcheries.","This study was partially supported by the Project Grant PT-10 from the Developing and Innovation Funding (FDI-CORFO) of Chile.

The results highlight the need for better access to psychosocial support and medical services for PLHIV in South Africa, as well as the need to consider a patient's general health perceptions during the course of ART.",,,African Journal of AIDS Research,,,,2008-07,2008,,2008-07,7,2,209-218,Closed,Article,"Peltzer, Karl; Phaswana-Mafuya, Nancy","Peltzer, Karl (); Phaswana-Mafuya, Nancy ()",,"Peltzer, Karl (); Phaswana-Mafuya, Nancy ()",34,2,1.11,5.46,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1070960152,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 42 Health Sciences; 4203 Health Services and Systems; 4206 Public Health,3 Good Health and Well Being

It is redescribed here on the basis of a re-examination of its syntypes, voucher specimens from museum collections, and freshly collected material from the intestine of Heterotis niloticus (Osteoglossiformes: Arapaimidae) from Benin, Nigeria, Senegal, and the Sudan. The species possesses several unique morphological characters, such as (1) a vitellarium formed by 2 compact, but deeply lobulated, postovarian masses near the posterior margin of proglottids; (2) a scolex with a highly modified apical structure formed by 4 muscular retractile lappets; (3) a well-developed circular musculature, which is external to the inner longitudinal muscles; (4) a dilated, vesicle-like proximal part of the external sperm duct; (5) the unique morphology of the uterus and its development, which represents an intermediate form between the 2 basic types recognized in the Proteocephalidea; (6) the growth of eggs during their development within the uterus; and (7) the complex proglottization with intermingled smaller and larger (wider) proglottids. The morphology of S. sandoni, including the form and distribution of microtriches, was studied by scanning electron microscopy for the first time, and the lectotype and paralectotypes of S. sandoni are designated. Sequences of the 28S rRNA gene of 4 specimens (2 from the Sudan and 2 from Senegal) were identical, which confirms conspecificity of geographically distant samples. Sandonella sandoni sequences have also shown that it actually belongs among the Proteocephalidea, being a sister taxon of a relatively derived clade of Palaearctic proteocephalideans, containing Glanitaenia osculata and Paraproteocephalus parasiluri from catfish and Palaearctic species of the Proteocephalus aggregate.","The authors thank David I. Gibson and Eileen Harris (London) for loan of the type and comparative material of S. sandoni, Louis Euzet (Ste) for comparative material from Benin and permission to use his hand-made sketches for making a drawing of the scolex, Cheikh Tidiane Bâ (Dakar) for his collaboration in obtaining the Senegal material, and Dia-Eldin Elnaiem (Davis, California) for help in organizing the stay of the 2 authors (A.de C. and T.S.) in the Sudan.

Additionally, it examines ways in which the Department of Health (DOH) is striving to meet the increasing burden of nutrition-related diseases in South Africa.
METHODS: The primary sources of data used for the review were reports from the Census office, South African health reviews, mortality and morbidity statistics, and documents from the Health Professions Council of South Africa.
RESULTS: There are fewer than 2000 registered dietitians in South Africa and fewer than 600 of them work in the public health sector. Furthermore, professional nurses - who are the backbone of the primary health-care system and deliver the rudiments of basic nutritional care - are not being trained in sufficient numbers to meet population growth; in 2004 there was only one nurse per 4000 persons. This situation is aggravated by the growing burden of conditions associated with both overnutrition and undernutrition, as well as the enormous demands of the HIV/AIDS epidemic. The DOH is striving to meet these increasing needs by means of the Integrated Nutrition Programme as well as a National Human Resources Plan which includes numerous strategies to improve the quantity and quality of health professionals' training, including dietitians and nutritionists. This plan includes the objective of increasing the public health nutrition workforce to more than 250 newly trained dietitians and nutritionists per annum by 2010.","No conflict of interest is declared by the two authors.

We investigate how a Network Connectivity Proxy (NCP) could enable significant energy savings by allowing idle hosts to enter a low-power sleep state and still maintain full network presence. An NCP must handle ARP, ICMP, DHCP, and other low-level network presence tasks for a network host. An NCP must also be able to maintain TCP connections and UDP data flows and to respond to application messages. The focus of this paper is on how TCP connections can be kept alive during periods of host sleep by using a SOCKS-based approach called green SOCKS (gSOCKS) as part of an NCP. The gSOCKS includes awareness of the power state of a host. A prototype implementation of gSOCKS in a Linksys router shows that TCP connections can be preserved.","The development of this material is based upon work supported by the National Science Foundation under grant CNS-0721858 (Christensen), Cisco Collaborative Research Initiative (Jimeno), and California Energy Commission – Public Interest Energy Research program (Nordman).

the Jones polynomial of tangles is valued in a certain skein module, we
describe an alternating condition on elements of this skein module, show that
it is satisfied by the Jones invariant of the single crossing tangles, and
prove that it is preserved by appropriately ""alternating"" planar algebra

Early North American and Mesoamerican agricultural villages were preceded by still earlier settlements in Perú and Ecuador. In Perú, exceptional preservation permits a wide range of studies of the archaeological record. Domestic structures may have been built 12000years ago and are definitely known from 7000BC in the central western Andean region. Coastal Peruvian fishing villages are present by 6000BC followed by more agricultural settlements in Ecuador and Perú by 4000BC. On the central coast of Perú, Quipa, a site with a domestic structure that dates to at least 7000BC, is not far from the first excavated large village settlement at Paloma at 6000–3000BC. Subsequent central Andean villages are larger and most have non-domestic structures. They present both food and economic crops such as cotton for nets and textiles. To the north, the precocious Real Alto site in Ecuador at 4000–3500BC demonstrates non-domestic architecture and pottery. The late aceramic component at the Buena Vista Peruvian middle valley site produced sculptures in the round and platform pyramids, which date to 4200BC. Very large sites in the Norte Chico of Perú are older still, but their settlement pattern is not yet resolved. The 55 domestic structures with their 200 interments from the stratified fishing villages at the Middle Preceramic site of Paloma describe changes over time in gender and age distinctions evident in mortuary customs. As well, shifts in subsistence activities and in dietary patterns at Paloma and related sites have been determined from bioarchaeological studies. Health changes with adoption of village life are minimal, although subsequent deterioration was followed by gradual improvement, perhaps never reaching the same level of adult health as was experienced at Paloma. These early villages represent the instantiation of widespread belief systems in particular habitats, probably maintained and partly shared with adjacent ethnic groups who were trading partners. The beginning of ancestor veneration at Paloma may be associated with an early astronomical alignment that becomes widespread in the larger settlements of the Peruvian Late Preceramic. While each people had its special history, there are some similarities in response to the dryer and more unpredictable climate that followed the end of the worldwide climatic optimum at about 3000BC. Village life, in time associated with monumental constructions, was a response of some of the peoples who experienced this change. Early Peruvian fishing villages were supplanted by a tripartite system of fishing, farming food crops, and growing of economic plants.",The field and laboratory work was made possible by four awards from the NSF and additional awards from the University of Missouri-Columbia that provided vital bridging support.

In prehispanic times they were widely distributed, but their number decreased dramatically as a consequence of the portmanteau biota introduced by the Europeans, among other reasons. Nonetheless, today, wild and domestic SAC remain a core element in rural communities all along the Andes. They have been exported all over the world, and their use has expanded amazingly due to globalization.In all the Americas, camelids are the only large herd mammals that were domesticated. Although researchers may accept that the origins of domestication and the development of native camelid herding are restricted to the Andes, there is still no agreement on its timing, or whether one or several centers of domestication existed. It is essential to inquire whether the identification of the Central Andes as the heartland of camelid domestication is an accurate characterization of this process, or an artifact of the pioneering zooarchaeological analyses undertaken there.","AcknowledgmentsThis presentation gives me the opportunity to highlight the essential contribution of many colleagues who have devoted many years of their research to the study of camelid remains and have emphasized their significance for Andean societies: Antonia Benavente, Isabel Cartajena, Loli Elkin, Brian Hesse, Jonathan Kent, George Miller, Kate Moore, Daniel Olivera, Denise Pozzi-Escot, Silvana Rosenfeld, Jane Wheeler, Elizabeth Wing, and Hugo Yacobaccio.

This article tackles, by means of a biographical case, what the erudite labour culture was at the of the 19th century in Tarapac. It analyzes the significance, the political and cultural action of the labour organization in the development of social conscience that ended in the strike and the subsequent massacre at the Santa Maria school of Iquique in 1907, event that would set a turning point both organization and labour culture at that time. They mentioned the mancommunal movement, the Democratic Party and the anarchist movement. It analyzes in a preferent way what the labour memorials were in 1904 and the subsequent visit Consultive Committee sent to travel across the salpetre-pampas as one of the first State's actions with regard to the social matter in the nitrate north of Chile. The figure that this work studies is Osvaldo Lpez Mellafe, militant of the Democratic Party, director of the El Pueblo newspaper, author of the (damned) novel Tarapac and a Worker Dictionary, among other pieces of work, whose job propaganda of the worker ideology was to have a prominent role in the composition of the Memorials of 1904, fundamental restoring platform for the striker movement in 1907.

Determining the scales of variation and whether spatial patterns in the supply of individuals are persistent over time can provide insight into spatial generality and the application of conservation and metacommunity models. We examined these issues using eight-year-long data sets of monthly recruitment of intertidal mussels (Mytilus spp., Perumytilus purpuratus, Semimytilus algosus, Brachidontes granulata) and barnacles (Balanus glandula, Chthamalus dalli, Jehlius cirratus, Notochthamalus scabrosus) at sites spanning > 900 km along the coasts of Oregon-northern California (OR-NCA, 45.47-39.43 degrees N) and central Chile (CC, 29.5-34.65 degrees S). We evaluated four general ""null"" hypotheses: that despite different phylogenies and great spatial separation of these taxa, their similar life history strategies and environmental settings lead to similar patterns of recruitment (1) between hemispheres, (2) in time, (3) in space, and (4) at larger and smaller spatial scales. Hypothesis 1 was rejected: along the OR-NCA coast, rates of recruitment were between two and three orders of magnitude higher, and patterns of seasonality were generally stronger and more coherent across space and time than along CC. Surprisingly, however, further analysis revealed regularities in both time and space for all species, supporting hypotheses 2 and 3. Temporal decorrelation scales were 1-3 months, and characteristic spatial scales of recruitment were approximately 250 km. Contrary to hypothesis 4, for the ecologically dominant species in both hemispheres, recruitment was remarkably persistent at larger mesoscales (kilometers) but was highly stochastic at smaller microscales (meters). Across species, increased recruitment variation at large scales was positively associated with increased persistence. Our results have several implications. Although the two regions span distinct latitudinal ranges, potential forcing processes behind these patterns include similar large-scale climates and topographically locked hydrographic features, such as upwelling. Further, spatial persistence of the recruitment patterns of most species at the mesoscale supports the view that marine protected areas can be powerful conservation and management tools. Finally, persistent and yet contrasting spatial patterns of recruitment among competing species suggest that recent metacommunity models might provide useful representations of the mechanisms involved in species coexistence.","We are in debt to many students, technicians, colleagues, and friends who have helped to assemble and maintain these data sets over the years.

Bacteria inhabiting there have to deal with extreme changes in salinity, temperature and UV dose (i.e., high environmental dissimilarity in the physical landscape). We analyzed the bacterioplankton structure of this lake by 16S rRNA gene analyses along a spatio–temporal survey. The bacterial assemblage within the lake was quite heterogeneous both in space and time. Salinity changed both in space and time ranging between 1 and 30% (w/v), and total abundances of planktonic prokaryotes in the different sampling points within the lake ranged between two and nine times 106 cells mL−1. Community composition changed accordingly to the particular salinity of each point as depicted by genetic fingerprinting analyses (denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis), showing a high level of variation in species composition from place to place (beta-diversity). Three selected sites were analyzed in more detail by clone libraries. We observed a predominance of Bacteroidetes (about one third of the clones) and Gammaproteobacteria (another third) with respect to all the other bacterial groups. The diversity of Bacteroidetes sequences was large and showed a remarkable degree of novelty. Bacteroidetes formed at least four clusters with no cultured relatives in databases and rather distantly related to any known 16S rRNA sequence. Within this phylum, a rich and diverse presence of Salinibacter relatives was found in the saltiest part of the lake. Lake Tebenquiche included several novel microorganisms of environmental importance and appeared as a large unexplored reservoir of unknown bacteria.","Sampling and measurements carried out in Chile were funded by grants FONDECYT 1030441 and FONDEF D99I1026.

DESIGN: Cross-sectional validation study in 324 conveniently sampled men and women.
METHODS: Repeated 24-hour urinary Na values and 24-hour dietary recalls were obtained on three occasions. Food items consumed by >5% of the sample and which contributed > or =50 mg Na serving-1 were included in the questionnaire in 42 categories. A scoring system was devised, based on Na content of one index food per category and frequency of consumption.
RESULTS: Positive correlations were found between Na content of 35 of the 42 food categories in the questionnaire and total Na intake, calculated from 24-hour recall data. Total Na content of the questionnaire was associated with Na estimations from 24-hour recall data (r = 0.750; P < 0.0001; n = 328) and urinary Na (r = 0.152; P = 0.0105; n = 284). Urinary Na was higher for subjects in tertile 3 than tertile 1 of questionnaire Na content (P < 0.05). Questionnaire Na content of <2400 and > or =2400 mg day-1 equated to a reference cut-off score of 48 and corresponded to mean (standard deviation) urinary Na values of 145 (68) and 176 (99) mmol day-1, respectively (P < 0.05). Sensitivity and specificity against urinary Na > or =100 and <100 mmol day-1 was 12.4% and 93.9%, respectively.
CONCLUSION: A 42-item food-frequency questionnaire has been shown to have content-, construct- and criterion-related validity, as well as internal consistency, with regard to categorising individuals according to their habitual salt intake; however, the devised scoring system needs to show improved sensitivity.","Sources of funding:This study was funded by a doctoral fellowship provided by Unilever South Africa Foods and by research grants from the South African Medical Research Council, the Circulatory Diseases Research Fund and the South African Hypertension Society.

However, such correlations, while useful for detecting long-term trends, are unable to provide a mechanism linking the physical environment and ecological processes. Here we evaluate the effects of the NAO on recruitment variability of rocky intertidal invertebrates in the North Atlantic examining two possible climate-related pathways. Using a highly conservative test we interpret associations with the NAO integrated over a season (three months) as an indicator of atmospheric effects on newly settled recruits (NAO3), and the effects of the NAO integrated over six months (NAO6) as an indicator of changes in ocean circulation affecting patterns of larval transport. Through an extensive literature survey we found 13 time series, restricted to southwest Ireland and Britain and comprising five species, that could be used for statistical analysis. Significant correlations with NAO3, our proxy for atmospheric effects, were observed in the south-central domain of our study region (southwest Ireland and south England). Significant correlations with NAO6, the proxy for ocean circulation effects, were detected on southwest Ireland. The associations were detected for three (two barnacles and a topshell) at two sites. These results suggest that the NAO can have effects on the recruitment of intertidal invertebrates through different pathways linked to climate and be distributed heterogeneously in space. Based on previous evidence and the sign and geographic location of significant correlations, we suggest that winter NAO effects are likely to occur as a result of effects on the survival of early life stages settling during spring or through changes in phenology. Our results argue that a combination of modeling and synthesis can be used to generate hypotheses regarding the effects of climate on recruitment and aid in the design of field-based tests of explicit ecological mechanisms.","This manuscript was conceived during workshops organized by the CORONA Research Coordination Network, funded by NSF DEB‐ 0130275.

Impaired learning capacity caused by hypothyroxinemia was consistent with cellular and molecular alterations, including: 1) lack of increase of phosphorylated c-fos on the second day of the water maze test; 2) impaired induction of long-term potentiation in response to theta-burst stimulation to the Schaffer collateral pathway in the area 1 of the hippocampus Ammon's horn stratum radiatum, despite normal responses for input/output experiments; 3) increase of postsynaptic density protein 95 (PSD-95), N-methyl-D-aspartic acid receptor subunit 1, and tyrosine receptor kinase B levels in brain extracts; and 4) significant increase of PSD-95 at the PSDs and failure of this molecule to colocalize with N-methyl-D-aspartic acid receptor subunit 1, as it was shown by control rats. Our findings suggest that maternal hypothyroxinemia is a harmful condition for the offspring that can affect key molecular components for synaptic function and spatial learning.","We thank Drs.

Clyman y Van Overmeire) y 45 neonatólogos de 23 países fueron invitados a participar y a colaborar. Se desarrollaron 46 preguntas de importancia clínico-fisiológica sobre la totalidad de los aspectos del ductus arterioso permeable (DAP). Las pautas para el proceso del consenso, la búsqueda de la bibliografía y la futura preparación de material educativo y autoría fueron descritas, revisadas y acordadas por todos los participantes. Los expertos de diferentes países fueron distribuidos en grupos, y asignados para interactuar y trabajar conjuntamente para responder a las 3-5 preguntas, revisando la totalidad de la bibliografía globalmente y los factores locales. Las respuestas y los resúmenes fueron recibidos, cotejados y revisados por 2 coordinadores y los 2 expertos. Los participantes y los expertos se reunieron en Granada, España, durante 4,5 h (con conferencias de expertos, presentaciones por grupos y discusión de toda la bibliografía de la que se disponía).ResultadosParticiparon 31 neonatólogos de 16 países. Las presentaciones de cada grupo y la discusión general se utilizaron para desarrollar un consenso en el que se consideraron: tratamiento general, disponibilidad de fármacos (indometacina frente a ibuprofeno), costes, indicaciones para eco/cirugía, etc. En este foro de cooperación, los participantes aprendieron numerosos aspectos del tratamiento de esta entidad.ConclusionesEste primer grupo de consenso de neonatólogos iberoamericanos de SIBEN llevó a la participación activa y cooperativa de neonatolólogos de 16 países, mejoró la educación de todos los participantes y finalizó desarrollando un consenso sobre los enfoques clínicos del DAP. Además, indica recomendaciones para el cuidado clínico a las que se ha llegado mediante consenso. Asimismo, servirá como una base útil para futuros consensos de SIBEN en otros temas y podría llegar a ser un valioso modelo para disminuir la disparidad en el cuidado y mejorar los resultados en esta y en otras regiones.ObjectiveTo report the process and results of the first neonatal clinical consensus of the Ibero-American region.Design and methodsTwo recognized experts in the field (Clyman and Van Overmeire) and 45 neonatologists from 23 countries were invited for active participation and collaboration. We developed 46 questions of clinical-physiological relevance in all aspects of patent ductus arteriosus (PDA). Guidelines for consensus process, literature search and future preparation of educational material and authorship were developed, reviewed and agreed by all. Participants from different countries were distributed in groups, and assigned to interact and work together to answer 3-5 questions, reviewing all global literature and local factors. Answers and summaries were received, collated and reviewed by 2 coordinators and the 2 experts. Participants and experts met in Granada, Spain for 4.5h (lectures by experts, presentations by groups, discussion, all literature available).Results31 neonatologists from 16 countries agreed to participate. Presentations by each group and general discussion were used to develop a consensus regarding: general management, availability of drugs (indometacine vs. ibuprofen), costs, indications for echo/surgery, etc. Many steps were learnt by all present in a collaborative forum.ConclusionsThis first consensus group of Ibero-American neonatologists SIBEN led to active and collaborative participation of neonatologists of 16 countries, improved education of all participants and ended with consensus development on clinical approaches to PDA. Furthermore, it provides recommendations for clinical care reached by consensus. Additionally, it will serve as a useful foundation for future SIBEN Consensus on other topics and it could become valuable as a model to decrease disparity in care and improve outcomes in this and other regions.",AgradecimientosLa empresa Ovation Pharmaceuticals donó fondos para educación a SIBEN para apoyar este grupo de consenso.

Garden City, Dodge City, and Liberal in southwest Kansas and Emporia in eastern Kansas have undergone significant transformation due to the influx of immigrants, the large majority of whom are of Mexican background. The present research approaches these immigrants from a sociological perspective, observing their cultural characteristics in order to understand who they are, and the process they face when adapting to the receiving environment, as a process of acquisition of cultural capital (Bourdieu 1977). This study focuses on the elements from Midwestern culture that are adopted and adapted, as well as the elements from the immigrants' cultural backgrounds that are softened or modified in order to fit within the receiving environment. The study examines these processes, from the theoretical perspective modeled by Pierre Bourdieu, as an attempt to develop an interpretive and comprehensive approach of immigrant experiences.",,,Journal of Latino/Latin American Studies,,,,2008-09,2008,,2008-09,3,2,1-25,Closed,Article,"Aguilar, Daniel","Aguilar, Daniel ()",,"Aguilar, Daniel ()",2,0,,1.18,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1011501056,"44 Human Society; 47 Language, Communication and Culture; 4702 Cultural Studies",

The depictions of garments worn by the embroidered figures, and their correspondence with actual garments, are discussed first. The garment depictions reveal gender and possibly age categories among the figures, while the golden adornments that they wear suggest hierarchical relationships among the members of the group. Additional hierarchical relationships, which appear to correspond with a high-ranking lineage, are carried in patterns of figure repetition on several textiles that display multiple figure types. Pattern is a salient feature of the Paracas Necropolis embroideries, but it is often studied in isolation from iconography. This study indicates that patterns of color, symmetry, and figure repetition are aspects of the graphic code that reiterate or add to the structured relationships evident in the iconography.",,,Arqueología y Sociedad,,,,2008-12-31,2008,2008-12-31,,,19,241-264,All OA; Hybrid,Article,"Frame, Mary","Frame, Mary (Independent Scholar, Vancouver, Canada.

Abstract
                  
                    Maize remains have been scarce in the archaeological deposits from central Chile. We will discuss the archaeobotanical data and the results of stable isotope analyses of a set of human samples spreading from the initial ceramic (300 B.C.–A.D. 200) up to the Inca contact moments (A.D. 1450–1550) in order to study the introduction and adoption of maize in this region. Stable carbon isotopes can be used to determine the presence and estimate the abundance of C4 plants such as
                    Zea mays
                    , in past diets. The results show that i) the adoption of this plant in the region was later than A.D. 200, ii) it became a regular dietary resource for Llolleo groups, iii) its use was more important for the Aconcagua groups with a differential gender consumption and, finally iv) that Zea mays dietary importance diminished during Inca times. During the Early Ceramic period maize horticulturalists were contemporaneous and shared the landscape with hunter-gatherers and quinoa horticulturalists; therefore the dietary habits were peculiar to specific groups. This evidence provides new insights into social systems but also left unanswered questions, especially concerning the earliest moments of maize development in this region.",,,Latin American Antiquity,,,,2008-03,2008,2017-01-20,2008-03,19,1,25-46,Closed,Article,"Falabella, Fernanda; Planella, M.

Following this up, we turn here to an ideal case-study for exploring how the various patterns in linguistic (pre-)histories can be matched with their most plausible correlates in the archaeological data. Beyond our initial illustration of the Incas we now look further afield, to set the sequence of major civilizations of the Andes into its linguistic context, tracing the expansion trajectories of the main Andean language families further back in time, stage by stage, ultimately to their most plausible original homelands. The linguistic story emerges starkly at odds with assumptions widely held among archaeologists of the region.

551,pub.1083711580,10.1017/s1045663500004338,,,"War, Chronology, and Causality in the Titicaca Basin","In the Late Intermediate Period (ca. A.D. 1000-1450), people in many parts of the Andean highlands moved away from rich agricultural lands to settle in defensive sites high on hills and ridges, frequently building hilltop forts known as pukaras in Quechua and Aymara. This settlement shift indicates a concern with warfare not equaled at any other time in the archaeological sequence. While the traditional assumption is that warfare in the Late Intermediate Period resulted directly from the collapse of the Middle Horizon polities of Wari and Tiwanaku around A.D. 1000, radiocarbon dates presented here from occupation and wall-building events at pukaras in the northern Titicaca Basin indicate these hillforts did not become common until late in the Late Intermediate Period, after approximately A.D. 1300. Alternative explanations for this late escalation of warfare are evaluated, especially climate change. On a local scale, the shifting nature of pukara occupation indicates cycles of defense, abandonment, reoccupation, and wall building within a broader context of elevated hostilities that lasted for the rest of the Late Intermediate Period and beyond.
Resumen En el Período Intermedio Tardío (ca. 1000-1450 d.C.), los habitantes de muchas partes de la sierra andina abandonaron terrenos productivos para asentarse en sitios defensivos en colinas, a veces construyendo asentamientos amurallados en las cumbres, llamados “pukaras” tanto en Quechua como Aymara. Este cambio demuestra una preocupación por la guerra no conocida anteriormente en la secuencia arqueológica. Según la interpretación tradicional, el conflicto resultó directamente del colapso de Wari y de Tiwanaku, aldredor de 1000 d.C., pero los fechados radiocarbónicos de un grupo de pukaras de la cuenca septentrional del Titicaca, presentados en este trabajo, indican que la mayoría de estos pukaras no fueron construidos ni ocupados hasta el final del Intermedio Tardío, después de aproximadamente 1300 d.C. Se evalúa las explicaciones alternativas para esta intensificación tardía de la guerra, sobre todo las condiciones ambientales adversas. En una escala más pequeña, los ocupaciones variables de pukaras indican ciclos locales de la defensa, del abandono, de la reoccupación, y de la construcción de murallas dentro de un contexto más amplio de conflicto agravado que duró el resto del Intermedio Tardío y aún después.",,,Latin American Antiquity,,,,2008-12,2008,2017-01-20,2008-12,19,4,339-373,All OA; Bronze,Article,"Arkush, Elizabeth","Arkush, Elizabeth (Department of Anthropology, University of Virginia, P.O.

We present four stages in this 'reading for pleasure' course with descriptions of the pedagogy and excerpts of classroom interaction.

Through this analysis, using lexical overlap, metaphorical language, expressive values and the use of passive constructions (passivisation), we show how the language of these groups, despite apparent commonalities, reveals different frames of reference and different strategies for securing authority. The nonmanagement group is motivated by legitimacy and founds its sense of authority on this, whilst the official management group increasingly appeals to legality as its basis for authority. The analysis contributes to understanding the complexity involved in the transformation of South Africa's higher education system and may be of interest to those researching the transformation of education systems and the nature of democracy in universities.

The sludge was initially submitted to characterization tests to determine its particle size distribution, chemical composition, mineralogical composition, thermal behavior and morphological aspects. Mixtures were prepared with amounts of 0, 3, 5 and 10wt% of sludge incorporated into the clayey body. Rectangular specimens were obtained by 20MPa pressure molding and then fired at 700, 900 and 1100°C in a laboratory furnace. Ceramic properties related to the bulk density, linear shrinkage, water absorption and flexural rupture strength were determined. The results indicated that the incorporation of the sludge increase the water absorption and reduce the mechanical strength of the clayey fired ceramic. This is a consequence of the changes caused in the porosity by the relatively elevated weight loss during the firing stage.","AcknowledgementsThe support provided by the Brazilian Agencies: FAPERJ, CNPq and FENORTE/TECNORTE is gratefully acknowledged.

South Africa now operates a 10‐m class optical telescope, the Southern African Large Telescope (SALT), and is one of two countries short listed to host the Square Kilometre Array (SKA), an ambitious international project to construct a radio telescope with a sensitivity one hundred times that of any existing telescope. The challenge now is to produce an indigenous community of users for these facilities, particularly from among the black population which was severely disadvantaged under the apartheid regime. In this paper I briefly describe the observing facilities in Southern Africa before going on to discuss the various collaborations that are allowing us to use astronomy as a tool for development, and at the same time to train a new generation of astronomers who will be well grounded in the science and linked to their colleagues internationally.",,,AIP Conference Proceedings,AIP Conference Proceedings,,,2008-03-13,2008,,2008-03-13,991,1,37-46,All OA; Green,Proceeding,"Whitelock, Patricia; Oluseyi, Hakeem M.","Whitelock, Patricia (); Oluseyi, Hakeem M.

The workshop-format programme, consisted of six two-hour sessions conducted over five days. A pre and post-test design included an experimental group (n = 8), control group (n = 8) and ‘chat group’ (n = 8). Findings indicated that the programme increased hope levels of the experimental group as indicated by the Hope Scale and the Hopefulness Subscale of the Hunter Opinions and Personal Expectations Scale.

Along with it, other areas of research evolved and contribute directly or indirectly to achieve this goal, such as: OLAP (On-Line Analytical Processing), data mining, artificial intelligence, knowledge discovery in database and business intelligence.

These clays are intended for applications in ceramics such as bricks and roofing tiles. Clays were first analyzed by X-ray diffraction, chemical composition particle size distribution, thermal analysis and plasticity. Extruded samples were fired at temperatures varying from 850 to 1100°C to determine the linear shrinkage, water absorption and flexural rupture strength. The results showed that three of the studied clays have adequate characteristics for brick fabrication. However, for two of these adequate clays it is necessary to add convenient materials to enhance the workability. The high porosity developed after firing impairs the use of these clays for roofing tiles. This is a consequence of the kaolinitic nature of the clays as well as their elevated loss on ignition.","AcknowledgementsThe support provided by the Brazilian Agencies: FAPERJ, CNPq and FENORTE/TECNORTE is gratefully acknowledged.",,Construction and Building Materials,,,,2008-05,2008,,2008-05,22,5,781-787,Closed,Article,"Vieira, C.M.F.; Sánchez, R.; Monteiro, S.N.","Vieira, C.M.F.

Our results show that both the reattachment of fronds and sprouting of new shoots from secondary attachment discs, occurred in both life cycle phases. We did not observe statistical differences between cystocarpic and tetrasporophytic fronds, which have a similar ability to reattach and produce new shoots. Reattachment was observed after 5d and reached 54±9% (mean±S.D.). The new shoots started sprouting 20d after reattachment, with a growth rate of 5±1%d−1 (mean±DS). Our results show that the formation of secondary attachment discs is not only an effective form of reattachment for drifting fronds but also an important strategy to generate new individuals.",AcknowledgementsWe are grateful to the staff of Marine Botany Laboratory (UCN) for field assistance.

These ceramic products can serve as matrices for the incorporation of industrial residues such as the ash of sugarcane bagasse used as fuel in the boilers of the sugar and alcohol plants. The incorporation of ashes in ceramics is a solution that eventually can cause an improvement on the properties of the material. The objective of this work is to characterize granulometric fractions of sugarcane bagasse ash with particle sizes less than 149, 75 and 44 μm aiming at the ash incorporation into red ceramics. Chemical, mineralogical and microstructural characterization were carried out in the granulometric fractions. The results showed that the granulometric fractions present as main crystalline phase the cristobalite and that the ashes with smaller particle sizes can improve the densification of the ceramic body by the formation of more liquid phase during firing, due to the presence of less silica and more alkaline- and alkaline-earth oxides than the original ash.",,,Materials Science Forum,,,,2008-08,2008,2008-08,2008-10-03,591-593,,471-476,Closed,Article,"Gadioli, Monica Castoldi Borlini; Vieira, Carlos Maurício Fontes; Rodríguez, Rubén Jesus Sánchez; Conte, R.A.; Pinatti, Daltro Garcia; Monteiro, Sérgio Neves","Gadioli, Monica Castoldi Borlini (Mineral Technology Center – CETEM/MCT, Advanced Campus of Cachoeiro de Itapemirim - CACI, Morro Grande, Cachoeiro de Itapemirim, ES, Brazil, Rodovia Cachoeiro-Alegre, km 05, Bloco 10, 29300-970); Vieira, Carlos Maurício Fontes (State University of North Fluminense - UENF, LAMAV - Advanced Materials Laboratory, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Avenue Alberto Lamego, 2000, Parque Califórnia, 28013-602); Rodríguez, Rubén Jesus Sánchez (State University of North Fluminense - UENF, LAMAV - Advanced Materials Laboratory, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Avenue Alberto Lamego, 2000, Parque Califórnia, 28013-602); Conte, R.A.

                  The total claim amount for a fixed period of time is, by definition, a sum of a random number of claims of random size. In this paper we explore the probabilistic distribution of the total claim amount for claims that follow a Weibull distribution, which can serve as a satisfactory model for both small and large claims. As models for the number of claims we use the geometric, Poisson, logarithmic and negative binomial distributions. In all these cases, the densities of the total claim amount are obtained via Laplace transform of a density function, an expansion in Bell polynomials of a convolution and a subsequent Laplace inversion.",,,The ANZIAM Journal,,,,2008-04-01,2008,2008-04-01,2008-04,49,4,495-501,All OA; Bronze,Article,"LACAYO, RAMON","LACAYO, RAMON (Escuela de Ingeniería Comercial, Universidad Católica del Norte, Larrondo 1281, Coquimbo, Chile, (email:, rlacayo@ucn.cl, ))",,"LACAYO, RAMON (Catholic University of the North)",0,0,,0.0,https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/C0585988F5414DEEDC9037EC25522EB4/S1446181108000187a.pdf/div-class-title-expansion-in-bell-polynomials-of-the-distribution-of-the-total-claim-amount-with-weibull-distributed-claim-sizes-div.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1008783890,49 Mathematical Sciences; 4901 Applied Mathematics; 4905 Statistics,

Helminth parasites infecting these fish were isolated from the gills, skin, muscles, body cavity, gall bladder, stomach, and intestines and were examined microscopically. Adult helminths were collected from the darter, Anhinga melanogaster, a piscivorous bird, to compare and possibly link them to the larvae recovered from fish. Stomach contents of the birds were analyzed, and their prey fish species were identified. Larval helminths collected include digenean metacercariae (clinostomes and strigeids), larval cestodes (gryporhynchids), and juvenile nematodes (Contracaecum). Adult worms include the monogeneans Macrogyrodactylus clarii, Macrogyrodactylus karibae, and Macrogyrodactylus congolensis; the digenean Clinostomum complanatum; the nematodes Paracamallanus cyathopharynx, Contracaecum rudolphi, Contracaecum multipapillatum, and Contracaecum rodhaini; and the cestodes Polyonchobothrium clarias and Echinorhynchotaenia tritesticulata. Many of these observations are the first record of that particular parasite species in Zimbabwe or southern Africa.

The strong emissions from the broad-line region (BLR) and the obscuring torus, which are generally yet to be spatially resolved, essentially 'bury' such signatures. Here we argue that we can actually isolate the disk emission spectrum by using optical and near-infrared polarization of quasars and uncover the important spectral signatures. In these quasars, the polarization is considered to originate from electron scattering interior to the BLR, so that the polarized flux shows the disk spectrum with all the emissions from the BLR and torus eliminated. The polarized flux observations have now revealed a Balmer edge feature in absorption and a blue near-infrared spectral shape consistent with a specific and robust theoretical prediction. These results critically verify the long-standing picture of an optically thick and locally heated disk in AGNs.",,,Journal of Physics Conference Series,,,,2008-10-01,2008,2008-10-24,2008-10-01,131,1,012039,All OA; Gold,Article,"Kishimoto, Makoto; Antonucci, Robert; Blaes, Omer; Lawrence, Andy; Boisson, Catherine; Albrecht, Marcus; Leipski, Christian","Kishimoto, Makoto (Max-Planck-Institut für Radioastronomie, Auf dem Hügel 69, 53121 Bonn, Germany; SUPA (Scottish Universities Physics Alliance), Institute for Astronomy, University of Edinburgh, Royal Observatory, Blackford Hill, Edinburgh, EH9 3HJ, UK); Antonucci, Robert (Physics Department, University of California, Santa Barbara, CA 93106, USA); Blaes, Omer (Physics Department, University of California, Santa Barbara, CA 93106, USA); Lawrence, Andy (SUPA (Scottish Universities Physics Alliance), Institute for Astronomy, University of Edinburgh, Royal Observatory, Blackford Hill, Edinburgh, EH9 3HJ, UK); Boisson, Catherine (LUTH, FRE 2462 du CNRS, associée á l'Université Denis Diderot, Observatoire de Paris, Section de Meudon, F—92195 Meudon Cedex, France); Albrecht, Marcus (Instituto de Astronomía, Universidad Católica del Norte (UCN), Avenida Angamos 0610, Antofagasta, Chile); Leipski, Christian (Physics Department, University of California, Santa Barbara, CA 93106, USA)",,"Kishimoto, Makoto (Max Planck Institute for Radio Astronomy; University of Edinburgh); Antonucci, Robert (University of California, Santa Barbara); Blaes, Omer (University of California, Santa Barbara); Lawrence, Andy (University of Edinburgh); Boisson, Catherine (Laboratory Universe and Theories); Albrecht, Marcus (Catholic University of the North); Leipski, Christian (University of California, Santa Barbara)",4,0,,0.95,https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1742-6596/131/1/012039/pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1037045362,51 Physical Sciences; 5101 Astronomical Sciences,

In spite of the efforts and advances, this approach faces the problem that it is not broadly utilized in the industrial practice. One reason, among other, is that their implementation requires complex mathematical developments and therefore a good knowledge of the mathematical programming techniques. Therefore, it is important to develop procedures that can consider real situations, but on the other hand does not require complex mathematical methods.In this work the potential application of grey programming (GP) and grey system to process design is analyzed. GP is a simple technique to consider uncertainty. The design of flexible heat-exchange network is used as an example. Complete methodologies is developed, which include the grey composite curve, the determination of the grey minimum utility consumption, and the determination of grey number of interchangers units. The utilized techniques consider grey linear programming (GLP) and grey mixed-integer linear programming (GMILP).",,,Computer Aided Chemical Engineering,18th European Symposium on Computer Aided Process Engineering,,,2008,2008,,2008,25,,671-676,Closed,Chapter,"Gálvez, Edelmira D.; Cisternas, Luis A.; Patiño, Pamela S.; Ossandon, Kathy L.","Gálvez, Edelmira D.

MW effects were tested by analysing the viscosity of the solutions as well as the properties of the films of the nanocomposite the chitosan with poly(3-(aminopropyl)triethoxysilane)(pAPS) they produce. Microwave irradiation induces rapid dissolution, leading to solutions with relatively low viscosity, which asymptotically increases with further irradiation. Dissolution-precipitation-redissolution experiments with samples prepared using both methods indicate that MW effects are more related with the aggregation state of the macromolecule in the solution than with the chitosan degradation. CHI/pAPS hybrid materials appear to be different when the solutions of chitosan used as precursor are obtained by MW irradiation.

(Cyprinidae) from Mozambique,"The development of aquaculture in Mozambique is very important in the country’s development. Although one of the most important freshwater fish species culture in the country is the common carp, Cyprinus carpio, nothing is known about their parasites. In order to contribute to this knowledge a two-year study was conducted on the metazoan parasites of common carp from the River Limpopo and the Lagoon Chuáli, located in the provinces of Gaza and Maputo respectively, south of Mozambique. Nine metazoan parasite species were detected in common carp: one Digenea (Clinostomum tilapiae), two Cestoda (Parvitaenia samfya and Cyclustera sp.), one Acanthocephala (Acanthogyrus tilapiae), two Nematoda (Contracaecum sp. and Procamallanus sp.) and three Crustacea (Lamproglena monodi, Lernaea cyprinacea and Dolops ranarum). Specimens of Cyclustera sp. and Procamallanus sp. were not detected in Lagoon Chualí. Parasite infection levels were very low and the abundance values, except for P. samfya, were always lower than 1.

In all the cases, the meson leptonic decay constants decrease with increasing T, and vanish at a critical temperature Tc, while the mesons develop a width which increases dramatically, diverging when T → Tc, where Tc is the temperature for chiral-symmetry restoration. The spectral function becomes a smooth function of the energy. This is interpreted as a signal for deconfinement at T = Tc. In contrast, the thermal masses are stable, except when T → Tc, where the pseudoscalar meson mass increases slightly by 10-20 %, and the vector meson mass decreases by some 20-30 %.",,,Brazilian Journal of Physics,,,,2008-09,2008,2008-09,,38,3b,437-442,All OA; Gold,Article,"Dominguez, Cesareo A.; Loewe, Marcelo; Rojas, Juan Cristobal","Dominguez, Cesareo A.

                    The amount of molecular gas is a key for understanding the future star formation in a galaxy. However, this quantity is difficult to infer as the cold H
                    2
                    is almost impossible to observe and, especially at low metallicities, CO only traces part of the clouds, keeping large envelopes of H
                    2
                    hidden from observations. In this context, millimeter dust emission tracing the cold and dense regions can be used as a tracer to unveil the total molecular gas masses. I present studies of a sample of giant molecular clouds in the Small Magellanic Cloud. These clouds have been observed in the millimeter and sub-millimeter continuum of dust emission: with SIMBA/
                    SEST
                    at 1.2 mm and the new LABOCA bolometer on
                    APEX
                    at 870 μm. Combining these with radio data for each cloud, the spectral energy distribution of dust emission are obtained and gas masses are inferred. The molecular cloud masses are found to be systematically larger than the virial masses deduced from CO emission. Therefore, the molecular gas mass in the SMC has been underestimated by CO observations, even through the dynamical masses. This result confirms what was previously observed by Bot
                    et al
                    . (2007). We discuss possible interpretations of the mass discrepancy observed: in the giant molecular clouds of the SMC, part of cloud's support against gravity could be given by a magnetic field. Alternatively, the inclusion of surface terms in the virial theorem for turbulent clouds could reproduce the observed results and the giant molecular clouds could be transient structures.",,,Proceedings of the International Astronomical Union,,,,2008-07-01,2008,2008-07-01,2008-07,4,S256,148-153,All OA; Bronze,Article,"Bot, Caroline; Rubio, Mónica; Boulanger, François; Albrecht, Marcus; Bertoldi, Frank; Bolatto, Alberto D.; Leroy, Adam K.","Bot, Caroline (UMR7550, Observatoire Astronomique de Strasbourg, F-67000 Strasbourg, France, email:, bot@astro.u-strasbg.fr); Rubio, Mónica (Departamento de Astronomia, Universidad de Chile, Casilla 36-Dm Santiago, Chile); Boulanger, François (Institut d'Astrophysique Spatiale, Université de Paris-Sud, F-91405, Orsay, France); Albrecht, Marcus (Argelander-Institut für Astronomie, Universität Bonn, Germany; Universidad Católica del Norte, Chile); Bertoldi, Frank (Argelander-Institut für Astronomie, Universität Bonn, Germany); Bolatto, Alberto D.

Data analysis reveals that the predicted magnitude drop for this phenomenon was overestimated and we establish an upper limit of 0 m . 05 for the phenomenon, perhaps due to a non‐lambertian limb scattering. The new astrometry obtained from this run is in good agreement with the LA06 numerical model and these new data will improve the dynamical models of the Uranus system. The paper concludes with an uncertainty analysis on the parameters for the event, determined by the uncertainty of the magnitude drop of about 0.04 mag, and the difficulty to observe mutual phenomena between satellites in the Uranian system.

Formation, Structure, and Properties of Films","We have investigated the properties of films from polymer complexes obtained by the reaction of chitosan with poly(aminoproylethoxysiloxane) which are known to be constituted by molecularly compatibilized microdomains of the components. Specifically, we studied the influence that both, the acetylation degree the donor-acceptor activity of chitosan in the precursor solutions, have on the composition, thermal stability and morphology of the products. Comparison of the behaviour of two chitosans of similar molecular weight but different origin and acetylation degree, 12% and 17% respectively, shows that the latter is an important factor in stabilising the formation of chitosan aggregates in its solutions and films, thus making less efficient the formation of strong chitosan/polysiloxane interfaces. Dissolution of chitosan by microwave radiation improves polymer dissociation, thus increasing its donor-acceptor activity. That however also results, in this case, to disfavours strong hetero-polymer interfaces due to the large tendency of chitosan to self-aggregation.","Research partially financed by FONDECYT (Grant 1050344), the Universidad de Chile, the Universidad Tecnológica Metropolitana and the Universidad Católica del Norte.",,Molecular Crystals and Liquid Crystals,,,,2008-04-15,2008,,2008-04-15,483,1,109-119,Closed,Article,"Fuentes, S.; Retuert, J.; Benavente, E.; Lozano, H.; González, G.","Fuentes, S.

Given realizable sets (i.e., sets which are spectra of some nonnegative matrix), each of these three elementary transformations constructs a new realizable set. This defines a special kind of realizability, called C-realizability and this is closely related to the idea of compensation. After observing that the set of all C-realizable sets is a strict subset of the set of realizable ones, we show that it strictly includes, in particular, all sets satisfying several previously known sufficient realizability conditions in the literature. Furthermore, the proofs of these conditions become much simpler when approached from this new point of view.",,,Linear Algebra and its Applications,,,,2008-06,2008,,2008-06,428,11-12,2574-2584,All OA; Bronze,Article,"Borobia, Alberto; Moro, Julio; Soto, Ricardo L.","Borobia, Alberto (Departamento de Matemáticas, UNED, 28040 Madrid, Spain); Moro, Julio (Departamento de Matemáticas, Universidad Carlos III de Madrid, Madrid, Spain); Soto, Ricardo L.

This species produces tetraspores mainly in the austral summer and fall. Tetraspore germination and survival were studied under different conditions of temperature, photon flux density, and photoperiod in the laboratory. Field experiments were also carried out. Although tetraspores of K. alvarezii germinated, they had low survival rates, most dying after 20 days. Recruitment of K. alvarezii tetraspores did not occur in experiments conducted in the field. The results indicated that the establishment of K. alvarezii via spore production in the natural environment of the south‐east coast of Brazil is rather remote.",C.

A comparative study of the proton conductivity properties of this kind of inclusion compounds is presented. The hexagonal binary inclusion compound [quinuclidine]3thiourea 1 was taken as reference. The study shows the conductivity properties of [quinuclidine2H]+[thiourea2Cl]-2, [quinuclidine2H]+[thiourea2Br]- 3, [quinuclidine2H]2(2+)[thiourea2I2]2- 4, [quinuclidine2H]+[urea5Cl]- 5, [quinuclidine2H]+[urea2Br]- 6, and [quinuclidine2H]+[urea2I]- 7. Ionic conductivities of all the compounds in pellets, and of 2 and 3 in large single crystals were measured by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). Anisotropic conductivity behaviour in crystals of adequate dimensions of 2 and 3 was detected. The conductivity values of 2 and 3 in the crystals were 2.19x10-4 and 6.03x10-6(S/cm), respectively, in the assmed channel direction, and 2.42x10-6 and 8.27x10-9 (S/cm), respectively, in the perpendicular direction to the former, at 298 K. Conductivities at room temperature of the thiourea-halide derivatives in pellets show a changing behaviour from insulator (10-11 S/cm) for 2,3 and 4 measured in vacum, to semiconductor (10-7-10-8S/cm) for the thiourea-halide derivative measured at atmospheric pressure. For the urea-halide system the highest conductivity value corresponds to derivative 7 (8.66x10-5 S/cm) at atmospheric pressure, and the lowest to derivative 5 (5.48x10-7 S/cm) measured in vacum.

Five ectoparasites and 13 endoparasites were recorded and the highest prevalence and intensity of infection was found for the copepods Jusheyhoea macrura and Clavella sp. 1, for the monogenean Diclidophora sp. and for the larval acanthocephalan Corynosoma australe . Parasite species richness decreased with latitude. Multivariate discriminant analysis and correspondence analysis supported the use of parasites of N. pulchella to discriminate populations of this host, suggesting the existence of three well‐defined host populations in the geographical range examined. Jusheyhoea macrura , C. australe , Lophoura sp., Diclidophora sp., Capillaria sp. and Proleptus sp. were the most important species for discriminant analysis.",The fish samples were captured during the development of Fishery Research Fund Projects FIP N° 2006‐04 and FIP N° 2006‐11 of the Chilean Government.

It argues that the concept ‘hybridity’ might be a useful addition to the vocabulary of scholars studying contemporary global Christianity. The use of hybridity could replace ideologically loaded terms, such as syncretism, while still describing the interaction between different religious traditions on the phenomenological level. In Africa, as elsewhere, there are ongoing internal dialogues between the often divergent traditions represented in the worldviews of contemporary Christians. Under the concept hybridity, this internal inter-religious dialogue might be well described using non-pejorative, empirical language.",,,Verbum et Ecclesia,,,,2008-11-17,2008,2008-11-17,,29,3,819-831,All OA; Gold,Article,"M, R","M, R ()",,"M, R ()",4,1,,11.12,https://verbumetecclesia.org.za/index.php/ve/article/download/28/27,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1072236281,50 Philosophy and Religious Studies; 5004 Religious Studies,

Design: This is a descriptive study with analytical components. Methods: Pregnant teenagers aged between 12 and 21 years were recruited from Mankweng, Dikgale, Makotopong and Kganya clinics in the Limpopo Province, South Africa. Dietary data and blood were collected for the analysis of iron, folate and vitamin B12 status. Outcome measures: Blood was collected for the analysis of iron, folate and vitamin B12 status. Dietary data were collected using a repeated 24-hour recall questionnaire and a food frequency questionnaire, and demographic data were also collected using a standard questionnaire. Results: The mean and standard deviation for iron, folate, vitamin B12 and vitamin C were 6.5 mg ± 3.3, 155.3 µg ± 92.7, 2.3 µg ± 2.8 and 31.2 mg ± 36.2 respectively. The prevalence of anaemia was high (36%), with iron deficiency anaemia being the most prevalent (57%) as compared to either folate (9%) or vitamin B12 (7%) deficiency anaemia. There was a significant difference (p = 0.03) in serum folate between teenagers who were receiving folic acid supplements and those who were not receiving any such supplements. Conclusions: More than a third of the teenagers were anaemic and this is considered to be high. These teenagers need nutrition education so that they will be able to choose nutritious food, especially at a critical stage such as pregnancy.",,,South African Journal of Clinical Nutrition,,,,2008-01,2008,2016-05-31,2008-01,21,4,332-336,Closed,Article,"Bopape, Mm; Mbhenyane, Xg; Alberts, M","Bopape, Mm (Human Nutrition Programme, University of Limpopo, Sovenga, Limpopo Province); Mbhenyane, Xg (Department of Human Nutrition, University of Venda for Science and Technology, Venda, Limpopo Province); Alberts, M (Medical Sciences Programme, University of Limpopo, Sovenga, Limpopo Province)","Mbhenyane, Xg (University of Venda)","Bopape, Mm (University of Limpopo); Mbhenyane, Xg (University of Venda); Alberts, M (University of Limpopo)",7,1,,1.16,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1008346411,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3210 Nutrition and Dietetics,2 Zero Hunger

The goal of this study is to assess the genetic diversity of a hatchery population of the Pacific abalone (Haliotis discus hannai) from the Center for Abalone Production of the Universidad Católica del Norte (CAP‐UCN) that is maintained under a breeding programme. We used six polymorphic microsatellite markers within the cultivated population. The loci Awb033 and Awb079 had the highest number of alleles (11 and 10 respectively) and the loci Awb022 and Awb026 the lowest (two and four respectively). The mean number of alleles per locus was 6.83. The average observed and expected heterozygosities were 0.71 and 0.70, respectively, and the average FIS (f) index was −0.023. We compared the population genetic parameters of the CAP‐UCN population with previously published data of wild and hatchery populations of the same species. Results indicate lower genetic diversity estimated as allelic richness in the introduced population with a loss of 11–58% alleles per locus. Despite the high allelic loss, the estimated inbreeding coefficient suggests that the breeding programme carried out in the CAP‐UCN has controlled and maintained heterozygosity levels successfully. A temporal study is necessary to determine whether the genetic diversity loss detected was caused during the initial introduction of breeders or to the breeding programme actually implemented.",We thank Eugenia Valdebenito and Ratcliff Ambler of the CAP‐UCN for assistance with the collection of abalone samples.

However, the accuracy to evaluate comets assay has been the major obstacle in order to determine specific damage undergone cellular stress. The aim of this study was to evaluate DNA fragmentation in sperm cells based in fluorescence image analysis. The species used was the giant mussel Choromytilus chorus. The in vitro experiments were carried out through oxidative stress with five hydrogen peroxide concentrations (0, 50, 100, 500 and 1000 mM). To evaluate DNA damage two groups of parameters were used: (1) Morphological comet parameters as tail length, nuclear diameter (head) and tail moment, and (2) Quantification of DNA strand breaks grade by fluorescence image analysis. The sperm DNA damage was possitively correlated with the morphological parameters, as they were exposed to an increasing dose range of H2O2 and negatively correlated with nuclear diameter. Additionally, fluorescence analysis showed that fragment sizes and the fluorescence intensity could be identified and related the level of DNA damage independently the intercellular variation of DNA strand breaks. The large fragment sizes decrease with H2O2 doses, while medium and small fragments increase in treatments with highest peroxide concentration. This study supported future research to examine comet assay conjugated with molecular approaches, especially in reference to integrate FISH to evaluate if the DNA fragmentation includes specific genes. El ensayo cometa o gel de electroforesis de nica clula es un procedimiento sencillo, rpido, relativamente barato y un mtodo muy sensible para evaluar la integridad del genoma (ADN o daos) en los animales acuticos expuestos a diversos agentes fsicos y qumicos. Sin embargo, la precisin para evaluar los ensayos cometas han sido el principal obstculo para determinar el dao especfico sufrido por estrs celular. El objetivo de este estudio fue evaluar la fragmentacin del ADN en espermatozoides basado en anlisis de imgenes fluorescente. La especie utilizada fue el choro zapato, Choromytilus chorus. Los experimentos in vitro se llevaron a cabo por estrs oxidativo con cinco concentraciones de perxido de hidrgeno (0, 50, 100, 500 y 1000 mM). Para evaluar el dao del ADN se utilizaron dos grupos de parmetros: (1) parmetros morfolgicos de los cometas como la longitud de la cola, el dimetro nuclear (cabeza) y el tail moment, y (2) Cuantificacin de la fragmentacin de ADN mediante anlisis de imagen fluorescentes. El dao del ADN en el esperma se correlacion positivamente con los parmetros morfolgicos, a medida que fue expuesto a una mayor dosis de H2O2 y negativamente correlacionado con el dimetro nuclear. Adems, el anlisis de fluorescencia mostr que los tamaos de los fragmentos y la intensidad de la fluorescencia pueden ser relacionados con el nivel de dao en el ADN independiente de la variacin intercelular. Los fragmentos grandes disminuyen con la dosis de H2O2, mientras que los medianos y pequeos aumentan a mayor concentracin de perxido.

Among the 829 surveyed students, the incidence of cigarette use was 22.7%, alcohol consumption 12.5%, and illicit drug use 1%. The starting age for smoking and alcohol consumption was 17–18, and ages 20–22 for illicit drug use. Significant correlations were found between age and smoking, alcohol consumption, religious belief, and between substance use and experiencing violence.

METHODS: Study conducted in a sample of 178 female homemakers (n=101) and female health providers (n=77) from Antofagasta, Chile, in 20062007. Homemakers were considered at social risk. HIV vulnerability was estimated through a 21-item instrument comprising three domains: gender roles; relationship with the partner; and attitude toward condom use. For determining the relative weight of each dimension to total vulnerability a multiple regression analysis was carried out using the instrument's total score as dependent variable and each domain as independent variable. RESULTS: Overall, the domain showing the highest relative weight was attitude toward condom use (0.542), followed by relationship with the partner (0.453) and gender roles (0.379). There were weight differences between homemakers: relationship with the partner (0.597), attitude toward condom use (0.508) and gender roles (0,403); and health providers: attitude toward condom use (0.638), relationship with the partner (0.397), and gender roles (0.307).

as first spectra, of several young stellar and sub-stellar M6- to M8-type
objects in the Cha I dark cloud. One of these objects is Cha Halpha 2,
classified as brown dwarf candidate in several publications and suggested as
possible binary in Neuhaeuser et al. (2002). We have searched around Cha Halpha
2 for close and faint companions with adaptive optics imaging. Two epochs of
direct imaging data were taken with the Very Large Telescope (VLT) Adaptive
Optics instrument NACO in February 2006 and March 2007 in Ks-band. We retrieved
an earlier image from 2005 from the European Southern Observatory (ESO) Science
Archive Facility, increasing the available time coverage. After confirmation of
common proper motion, we deduce physical parameters of the objects by
spectroscopy, like temperature and mass. We find Cha Halpha 2 to be a very
close binary of ~0.16 arcsec separation, having a flux ratio of ~0.91, thus
having almost equal brightness and indistinguishable spectral types within the
errors. We show that the two tentative components of Cha Halpha 2 form a common
proper motion pair, and that neither component is a non-moving background
object. We even find evidence for orbital motion. A combined spectrum of both
stars spanning optical and near-infrared parts of the spectral energy
distribution yields a temperature of 3000+/-100 K, corresponding to a spectral
type of M6+/-1 and a surface gravity of log g= 4.0 +0.75-0.5, both from a
comparison with GAIA model atmospheres. We derive masses of ~0.110 Msun (>0.070
Msun) and ~0.124 Msun (>0.077 Msun) for the two components of Cha Halpha 2,

                    This article reflects on the spread of English in South Africa, especially in the wake of the large-scale changes following the collapse of apartheid in the early 1990s. These changes allowed freer mixing of young South Africans of all backgrounds than had been hitherto possible in a segregated society. In particular, schools formerly reserved for Whites, opened their doors to initially small, then increasing numbers of pupils from other race groups: viz. Black, Coloured and Indian (this group is sometimes described as
                    black
                    in the general sense, in lower case, or

En la actualidad la ciruga ha demostrado ser el tratamiento ms eficaz a largo plazo. Objetivos: Informar los resultados obtenidos en el tratamiento de obesos mrbidos sometidos a ciruga abierta en un servicio hospitalario pblico regional. Material y mtodo: Se analiza en forma prospectiva los primeros 100 pacientes sometidos a ciruga baritrica en el Hospital de Coquimbo entre Septiembre de 1998 y Diciembre de 2005. Se usaron 3 tcnicas en forma consecutiva. En todas ellas se efectu el bypass gstrico empleando anastomosis en Y de Roux con asa larga de 160 cm. Para los anlisis estadsticos se emplearon los test de ANOVA y Student. Resultados: El 83% de los operados fueron mujeres. El IMC preoperatorio promedio fue de 46 kg/m, siendo un 29% superobesos (IMC>50). La estada postoperatoria promedio fue de 7,6 das. Complicaciones postoperatorias precoces hubo en el 5%. No se registr mortalidad operatoria en esta serie. El promedio de reduccin de exceso de peso fue de 60% a los 6 meses, 72% al ao y 66% a los 3 aos. Conclusiones: Los resultados obtenidos en un hospital pblico regional en relacin a la ciruga baritrica son absolutamente comparables a estudios nacionales e internacionales, tanto en la reduccin de peso como en la morbimortalidad Background: Surgery is the most effective treatment in the long run, for morbid obesity. Aim: To report the results of open bariatric surgery for morbid obesity in a regional public hospital. Material and methods: Prospective study of the first 100 patients aged 14 to 62 years (84% women) undergoing bariatric surgery in Coquimbo hospital between September 1998 and December 2005. A Horizontal Gastroplasty without gastric resection was done in 13 patients, a 6/7 Gastrectomy in 58 and a 9/10 Gastrectomy in 29. A gastric bypass with Roux-en-Y anastomosis with a 160 cm long loop, was always performed. Results: Preoperative body mass index (BMI) was 46 kg/m. Twenty nine percent had a BMI over 50 kg/m. The average postoperative hospital stay was 7.6 days. Five percent had early complications. No patients died. The average excess weight loss at 6 months, one and three years after surgery was 60, 72 and 66% respectively. Patients subjected to a gastric resection had a higher percentage of excess weight loss than gastroplasty after 1 year (p <0.01). After 3 years, the greatest excess weight loss was seen in patients with a BMI below 50 kg/m subjected to Gastrectomy. The smaller excess weight loss was observed in patients with a BMI over 50 kg/m subjected to Gastroplasty. After 6 months and 1 year, patients undergoing larger Gastrectomies (9/10) had a significantly greater percentage weight loss than those subjected to smaller resections (6/7).

This area, delimited at its base by a ring of arching membranes and bordered by cortical microtubules, contains two centrioles associated with typical striated rootlets with a reduced intercentriolar body between them. The apical area of the differentiation zone exhibits electron-dense material that is present only during the early stages of spermiogenesis. Only one of the centrioles develops into a free flagellum that grows at an angle of >90° in relation to the cytoplasmic extension. Spermiogenesis is also characterized by a flagellar rotation and a proximodistal fusion of the flagellum with the cytoplasmic extension. The most interesting features observed in W virilis are the presence of a reduced, very narrow intercentriolar body and the unique type of flagellar rotation >90°. Results are compared with those described in two caryophyllideans, Glaridacris catostomi Cooper, 1920 and Khawia armeniaca (Cholodkovski, 1915). Contrary to the original report of Świderski and Mackiewicz (2002), that flagellar rotation has never been observed in spermiogenesis of G. catostomi, re-assessment of their description and illustrations leads us to conclude that flagellar rotation must logically occur in that species. The value of various morphological features of sperm in phylogenetic inference is discussed.",,,Acta Parasitologica,,,,2008-03-01,2008,2008-04-07,2008-03-01,53,1,19-29,All OA; Hybrid,Article,"Miquel, Jordi; Świderski, Zdzisław; Mackiewicz, John; Ibraheem, Mohammed","Miquel, Jordi (Laboratori de Parasitologia, Departament de Microbiologia i Parasitologia Sanitàries, Facultat de Farmàcia, Universitat de Barcelona, Av.

However, the beneficiaries of these redistribution schemes known as 'emerging farmers', many of whom generally possess limited technical and financial skills or knowledge of commercial farming practices, face serious challenges in their journey to commercial status. Problems facing the emerging farmers include lack of secure title to the land, lack of investment and working capital and limited access to credit, poor veld condition, highly variable climate, insufficient farm size, inadequate or damaged infrastructure, poor access to extension officers who, in turn, are often overcommitted and under-resourced, poor knowledge of pasture and animal management, and a highly competitive industry context. Many of these problems can be resolved only by government, but problems of pasture, animal, financial and property management can be addressed by training and support. This paper outlines the experiences to date of a project that is seeking to provide technical information and support to emerging livestock farmers in four communities in Limpopo province.",,,African Journal of Range and Forage Science,,,,2008-06,2008,2009-11-12,2008-06,25,2,71-77,Closed,Article,"MacLeod, ND; McDonald, CK; van Oudtshoorn, FP","MacLeod, ND (); McDonald, CK (); van Oudtshoorn, FP ()",,"MacLeod, ND (); McDonald, CK (); van Oudtshoorn, FP ()",16,2,,1.27,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1070960528,31 Biological Sciences; 3103 Ecology,

This isolated island is located at the edge of the continental shelf in an area where the Humboldt Current originates, and holds a population of more than 150,000 breeding pairs. On 13 December 2005, four TDRs were successfully attached to females at the end of the brooding period and recorded diving activity at intervals of 2 s over the next 4 weeks. In total, 40 complete foraging trips were recorded. Trip duration was on average 42.4 ± 40.1 h and the proportion of overnight trips (60%) was the highest value found so far for this species. Mean dive depth and dive duration was 20.6 ± 19.4 m and 63.7 ± 36.4 s, respectively. The diving effort was higher than that of brooding females from the Indian Ocean and comparable with that of conspecifics from colonies in the southwest Atlantic in terms of diving rate (38 ± 14.2 dives h−1), but slightly lower as regards the proportion of time spent underwater (61 ± 10.5%). This study confirms that the diving behaviour of rockhopper penguins varies as a function of the physical and biological characteristics of the foraging areas and of the particular stage of the breeding season.","This research was made possible through the support of Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Científicas y Técnicas (CONICET) though projects PIP N° 02820 and PEI N° 6045, from the, Wildlife Conservation Society, National Geographic Society and the financial support to the Antarctic Research Trust by the Vontobel-Stiftung, Switzerland.

Design: A descriptive and exploratory study was done. A sample of 185 mothers with 185 infants 12 months and younger was selected from five primary healthcare clinics. A validated questionnaire, which consisted of questions relating to demographic data, breast-feeding and weaning practices, was used. The weight and length measurements of the infants were taken. Results: The majority (97%) of the mothers were still breast-feeding at the time of the interviews. Only 7,6% practised exclusive breast-feeding, however, while 43,2% had introduced solid foods at three months and 15% before two months. The weaning food given by most of the mothers was maize-meal soft porridge and had been introduced before four months of age. The Z-score classification was used and showed that stunting (18,9%), underweight (7%) and wasting (7%) were present among the infants but that only wasting was found to be a disorder of public-health significance. The nutritional status of the infants was therefore not significantly influenced by the breast-feeding and weaning practices of the mothers or other demographic parameters.

In particular, the impacts of globalisation and the knowledge economy upon the internationalisation of higher education are examined. The study suggests that the internationalisation of higher education is becoming increasingly dominated by economic imperatives that focus on exporting education and generating income from overseas students. What is currently overlooked is that ‘internationalisation’ is occurring not only beyond but also within national borders. A practice model is proposed for helping higher education institutions analyse the internationalisation of higher education from four rationales to develop more inclusive internationalisation policies and strategies.","This article is funded by the Guangdong Natural Science Foundation in P.

However, there are no long-term studies on the growth response of shrimp culture in freshwater. In the present study white shrimp Penaeus vannamei was cultured in freshwater (0 ppt) at three densities (90, 130 and 180 shrimp m−2) and comparisons made of the resulting growth, length–weight relationship and condition factor data. Gravimetric data were recorded during a 210-day trial to estimate growth rates, the length–weight relationship and the condition factor (according to Fulton's equation). Weight gain results showed the freshwater culture system to be viable, with effects from density (P<0.05). Growth rates decreased as density increased, exhibiting an inverse relationship (P<0.05, R2=0.68). Survival decreased as density increased with differences between treatments (P<0.05). A potential model was used to analyze the length–weight relationship of the treatments. The slopes were different between treatments according to an ANCOVA and a Tukey test (P<0.05). The function exponents showed that the 130 shrimp m−2 treatment produced organisms with isometric growth (b=2.99) in good condition (t̂=0.96; P>0.05). The 90 shrimp m−2 treatment produced positive allometric growth and the 180 shrimp m−2 treatment negative allometric growth.","AcknowledgmentsThe authors thank Miguel Vela, Leonardo Martinez and Miguel A.

These praises are also performed in many places such as schools, churches and funerals. The question is whether the praises performed in other places rather than traditional gatherings still possess the characteristics of traditional praises. In many praises Xhosa poets draw terminology from Biblical texts. This strategy can be seen as an attempt to break the boundaries between Christianity and Xhosa poetry. Having said that, the aim of this article is to uncover the interplay between Xhosa traditional poems and Christianity. To do that, this article discusses the interplay between Christianity, elegy, health and social issues. It also discusses new trends of intertextuality in Xhosa poetry. The intertextual theory insists that a text cannot exist as a hermetic or self-sufficient whole and does not function as a closed system.

With growing concerns about the resilience of shark populations to heavy fishing pressure, there is a need for better information on shark landings to aid management efforts. In the widespread absence of shark landing records especially by species, monitoring the fin trade has been proposed as a way to assess species exploitation levels. Here, the first species assessment of the Chilean shark‐fin trade was provided. The goals of this study were to (1) determine the species composition and relative species proportion of sharks utilized in the fin trade, (2) determine the relationship between fin trader market names and species and (3) assess trader accuracy in identifying shark fin species based on fin photographs. Fins were analysed from two different fin drying facilities (n = 654) (secaderos) and two fin‐storage warehouses (n = 251). In contrast to official government landing records that only document four species in the landings, molecular species identification of the fins demonstrated that at least 10 pelagic shark species are present in the north‐central Chilean shark fin trade: Alopias superciliosus, Alopias vulpinus, Carcharhinus obscurus, Galeorhinus galeus, Isurus oxyrinchus, Isurus paucus, Lamna nasus, Prionace glauca, Sphyrna lewini, Sphyrna zygaena. The species composition of the fins from the secaderos was P. glauca (83·9%), I. oxyrinchus (13·6%), L. nasus (1·7%) and A. superciliosus (0·2%). There was generally good agreement between market names and single shark species for the trade categories ‘Azulejo’, ‘Tiburon’, ‘Tintorera’, ‘Cola de zorro’ and ‘Martillo’. In contrast, the market category ‘Carcharhinus’ consisted of a mixture of at least five species. The molecular results also identified two species (S. lewini and I. paucus) not previously recorded in Chilean waters. The fin identification survey given to nine regional traders demonstrated that they were highly accurate in recognizing pictures of fins from P. glauca and I. oxyrinchus. The overall strong concordance between market categories and fins from single species and the trader accuracy in survey fin identification suggests that monitoring the Chilean fin trade by market names will provide a reasonably accurate picture of the volume of sharks landed by species.","This study was supported by funds from a DGI – Universidad Católica del Norte grant (to P.A.H.) and Hai Stiftung and Pew Institute for Ocean Science (to M.S.S.).

An empirical model is presented for bubble size as a function of frother type using a normalized concentration. The model provides a benchmark for assessing operations. There is no agreed mechanism of how frothers act to reduce bubble size. Prevention of coalescence is a common explanation and this action is illustrated. The case against the ‘coalescence model’ alone is presented and a breakup mechanism is introduced based on pilot cell and single bubble studies. Phenomena associated with bubble shape, velocity and surface flows are used to illustrate the force associated with surface tension gradients. Breakup mechanisms resulting from this force are proposed. The concept is extended to high salt concentrations which also promote small bubble formation.","AcknowledgementsThe work was conducted under the Chair in Mineral Processing at McGill University funded by NSERC (Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada) through the CRD (Collaborative Research and Development) program sponsored by (2007) CVRD Inco, Xstrata Process Support, Teck Cominco, Agnico-Eagle, SGS Lakefield Research, COREM, Shell Canada and Flottec.",,Minerals Engineering,,,,2008-11,2008,,2008-11,21,12-14,949-957,Closed,Article,"Finch, James A.; Nesset, Jan E.; Acuña, Claudio","Finch, James A.

261,pub.1027100701,10.1144/sp299.9,,,On the structure and mechanical properties of large strike-slip faults,"Abstract  Elucidation of the internal structure of fault zones is paramount for understanding their mechanical, seismological and hydraulic properties. In order to observe representative brittle fault zone structures, it is preferable that the fault be passively exhumed from seismogenic depths and the exposure must be in arid or semi-arid environments where the fragile rocks are not subject to extensive weathering. Field observations of two such faults are used to constrain their likely mechanical properties. One fault is the Carboneras fault in southeastern Spain, where the predominant country rocks are phyllosilicate-rich lithologies, and the other is part of the Atacama fault system in northern Chile, where faults pass through crystalline rocks of acidic to intermediate composition. The Carboneras fault is a left lateral fault with several tens of kilometres offset exhumed from approximately 4 km depth, and displays multiple strands of clay-bearing fault gouge, each several metres wide, that contain variably fractured lenses of protolithic mica schists. The strain is evenly distributed across the gouge layers, in accordance with the measured laboratory mechanical behaviour which shows predominantly strain hardening characteristics. The overall width of the fault zone is several hundred metres. Additionally, there are blocks of dolomitic material that are contained within the fault zones that show extremely localized deformation in the form of faults several centimetres wide. These are typically arranged at an angle of c . 20° to the overall fault plane. These differing types of fault rock products allow for the possibility of ‘mixed mode’ seismicity, with fault creep occurring along the strands of velocity strengthening clay-rich gouge, punctuated by small seismic events that nucleate on the velocity weakening localized faults within the dolomite blocks. The Caleta Coloso fault in northern Chile has a left-lateral offset of at least 5 km and was exhumed from 5–10 km depth. The fault core is represented by a 200–300 m wide zone of hydrothermally altered protocataclasite and ultracataclasite. This is surrounded by a zone of micro and macro-fractures on the order of 150 m thick. The fault core shows a heterogeneous distribution of strain, with alternate layers of ultracataclasite and lower strain material. The strain-weakening behaviour of crystalline rocks might be expected to produce highly localized zones of deformation, and thus the wide core zone must be a result of additional process such as precipitation strengthening or geometric irregularities along the fault plane.",This work was supported by NERC grant NE/C001117/1 (to D.R.F.).

A nivel histolgico los fotforos estn formados por un tejido fotogenerador, que se tie de color naranja intenso con tincin tricrmica de Mallory y un tejido vacuolar, que lo rodea y penetra en ste, con numerosos vasos sanguneos. Ultraestructuralmente, el tejido fotogenerador es denso a los electrones, homogneo y finamente granular. Los fotforos subcutneos se observaron en todo el calamar, en cabeza, manto, aletas, brazos y tentculos, por dorsal y ventral. En brazos y tentculos se observaron escasos fotforos ubicados a lo largo, tanto del nervio axial, como del borde externo, excepto en el cuarto par de brazos, en que los fotforos, presentes en las mismas ubicaciones, son mucho ms numerosos, formando una hilera casi continua. En trozos de manto fresco o congelado-descongelado se observ una luminiscencia amarillo-verdosa en un cuarto oscuro. Los fotforos de D. gigas tienen una estructura muy similar a la de Sthenoteuthis pteropus. La nica diferencia es que esta ltima especie tiene una cpsula de tejido conectivo alrededor del fotforo, ausente en D. gigas. La estructura del fotforo de D. gigas es muy bsica, y probablemente sea la ms simple dentro de la subfamilia Ommastrephinae. In Dosidicus gigas small pale yellow ovoid inclusion bodies corresponded to subcutaneous photophores, which were embedded in the mantle muscle, at differing depths. At the histological level the photophores were composed of a photogenic tissue, which stained bright orange with Mallory triple stain. Surrounding it was a vacuolated tissue with numerous blood vessels which also intruded into the light-emitting tissue. Viewed with transmission electron microscopy the photogenic tissue was electron dense and homogeneously finely granular, in close contact with capillaries of the intruding vacuolar connective tissue. Subcutaneous photophores were observed over the whole squid on tentacles, arms, head, mantle and the fins, both dorsally and ventrally. On arms and tentacles the photophores were sparsely located along the axial nerve, and along the outer edge, with the exception of the fourth pair of arms, where the photophores, having the same location, were very numerous, forming an almost continuous row. A yellow-greenish luminescence could be observed on fresh or frozen-thawed muscle in a dark room. The subcutaneous light organs of D. gigas have a very similar structure to those described for Sthenoteuthis pteropus.

Landings of Chilean kelp fluctuated between 40,000 t.year−1 in the early ‘80s to 250,000 t.year−1 more recently. Commercialized algae come from natural populations and no mass-cultures of involved species have been established. Four species of brown algae are commercially collected in the country: Lessonia trabeculata, L. nigrescens, Macrocystis pyrifera and M. integrifolia. Since 2000, the demand of alginate sources and food for cultivated abalones dramatically raised the harvesting of these species. Direct evaluations of Lessonia spp. and Macrocystis standing-stocks were made along 700 km of coast in northern Chile. Lessonia spp. estimated populations exceed 900,000 t, whereas M. integrifolia does not exceed 300 t. The insights provided indicate that sustainability of Chilean kelp subjected to intense harvesting would require management programs including the following bio-ecological recommendations: (1) to harvest the entire plant including the holdfast; (2) to harvest plants larger than 20 cm in diameter; (3) to harvest plants sparsely, selecting mayor specimens; (4) rotation of harvesting areas; and (5) for Macrocystis, to cut the canopy 1–2 m from the surface. They must be implemented in a National Program of Kelp Management, elaborated by government, scientists, fisherman, and industry.","O. Castillo, R. Rojas, G. Vásquez, G. Aguirre, N. Kusmicic, E.

The register of Psychologists of the Health Professions Council of South Africa (HPCSA) was examined to analyse (1) the number of black Africans registered as clinical psychologists, and (2) the universities that trained them. Methodologically this was a challenging exercise, since black African clinical psychologists had to be identified by their names, with the result that a margin of error is expected, albeit rather small. A total of 325 black African clinical psychologists were identified in the HPCSA registers up to November 2006, reflecting 14.2% of all registered clinical psychologists in the country. Fifty-nine (18.2%) of the 325 were trained in the years up to 1994, while the rest (266 or 81.8%) were trained in the years following the official demise of apartheid. Almost one out of six was trained at the Medical University of Southern Africa (Medunsa), which together with the University of the Witwatersrand trained over one quarter of the black African clinical psychologists registered at the time. In total, the historically black universities trained 153 (47.1 %), but in the post- apartheid period from 1995 they trained the majority (136 or 51.1%).

Near-IR photometry of dwarf irregular galaxies (dIs) has been acquired to expand the sample of objects suitable for investigating the fundamental plane (FP) discovered previously by us. Data for blue compact dwarfs (BCDs), dwarf ellipticals (dEs), and dwarf spheroidal galaxies (dSphs) are amalgamated to evaluate how closely these classes of galaxies are related to dIs. Methods. Surface brightness profiles for dIs are modeled using a hyperbolic secant function (sech), which has been shown to sample the old galaxy component observed in the NIR (Ks). Also, profiles for BCDs are modeled using a sech function, but to this is added a Gaussian burst. Kinematics for dIs and BCDs are constrained by the width W20 of integrated HI line profiles, and motions within dEs and dSphs are judged from stellar velocity dispersions. Results. The existence of a FP for dIs is confirmed. Omitting extreme deviants, the scatter of dIs about the plane is 0.43 mag, somewhat higher than expected from observational errors alone. Corrections of line widths for tilt do not reduce the residuals, so motions must be predominantly random. Corrections of surface brightnesses for tilt have no effect either. BCDs and dEs lie precisely on the FP defined by dIs, suggesting strong underlying connections among dIs, BCDs, and dEs.",,,Astronomy & Astrophysics,,,,2008-05-27,2008,2008-05-27,2008-08,487,1,147-160,All OA; Bronze,Article,"Vaduvescu, O.; McCall, M.

To accomplish this objective, a capillary bundle with three different geometries (i.e., rectangular, cylindrical, and annular) has been used to describe the microscopic-level structure of the soil domain. The analysis considers the simultaneous effects of different transport driving forces responsible for the motion of the bulk fluid and solute species, i.e., electro-osmosis, electromigration, buoyancy, and advection. The presence of these collaborative and competing forces, usually ignored or not taken into account completely, promotes distinct flow regimes that may explain important field test results. Several numerical examples are used to illustrate the flow situations found in the system for a selection of values of the parameter space. From the analysis and comparison of these graphic representations, a qualitative and semiquantitative description of the different flow regimes inside the capillary channel is obtained. In particular, the role of the capillary geometry on flow reversal is analyzed in detail, and its implications for mixing as a possible cause of lowering efficiency in soil cleaning by electrokinetic-based methods are highlighted.",,,Journal of Porous Media,,,,2008,2008,,2008,11,8,733-750,Closed,Article,"Oyanader, Mario A.; Arce, Pedro; Dzurik, Andrew","Oyanader, Mario A.

The selection of a specific site by a copepod parasite is determined by a set of mostly unknown factors. The spatial distribution of Kroyeria dispar, Kroyeria papillipes and Eudactylina pusilla on the gill filaments of Galeocerdo cuvier was investigated to determine whether niche restriction occurs in the different planes on the gills. In order to do this, the complete sets of left gills of 14 tiger shark hosts were examined and the species, location (hemibranch, horizontal distribution, longitudinal distribution), orientation and gender of each copepod noted. Kroyeria dispar was dominant on most hosts and exhibited a prevalence of 100% and a mean intensity of 73 individuals per shark. Kroyeria papillipes was dominant on the remaining hosts and displayed a prevalence of 78.6% and a mean intensity of 33 individuals per shark while E. pusilla had a prevalence of 85.7% and a mean intensity of 20 individuals per shark on the examined hosts. No evidence of intra- or interspecific competition or microniche restriction was found even though all three species occupy the same fundamental niche.

It was hypothesized, that if it were possible to extract and analyze particles from different reaction zones within a gasifier, it may be likely to enhance the understanding of the contribution that these particles make towards gasification. This better understanding of the particle-type compositional responses could act as an enabler to further manipulate and improve gasifier performance.The primary focus of this study was to evaluate a sequential (axial) sampling “turn-out” methodology of a quenched fixed-bed commercial-scale Sasol–Lurgi gasifier, in order to present samples that accurately describe operational aspects occurring in the reaction zones within the reactor. Characterization of the chemical properties of the sample increments were expected to deliver distinct profiles of the drying, pyrolysis, reduction and combustion (ash-bed) zones, which could be used to advance the kinetic modeling capability of the process. In order to interpret the coal property transformational behaviour occurring within the commercial-scale gasifier, the proximate, Fischer tar, ultimate, and coal char CO2 reactivity analysis were conducted.The pyrolysis zone was found to be the largest reaction zone situated below the drying zone within the gasifier, followed by the reduction zone, and combustion (ash-bed) zones. Whilst the boundaries of the pyrolysis zone were very clearly defined by the residual volatile matter distribution profile, distinctive regional overlap with a “slow pyrolysis with gasification” region was observed in the bottom half of the pyrolysis zone, above which a “rapid de-volatilization” region existed. The reduction zone was found to also exhibit an overlap in zonal fronts, i.e. a gasification region occurred below the pyrolysis zone and co-existed in equal proportions, with an oxidation frontal region occurring above the combustion zone. The combustion zone was found to be very shallow, below which the ash-bed region existed.The findings clearly suggest that text book pictures showing axially-depicted reaction zones occurring within the fixed-bed gasifier, i.e. drying, pyrolysis, gasification and combustion, inadequately describe the “real” situation and in practice, overlap of reaction regions within zones indeed also transpire.",AcknowledgementsThis work was sponsored by Sasol Technology R+D together with Sasol–Lurgi and the Sasol Synfuels Gas Production Division (Secunda).

The biodiversity studies of industrial systems have revealed the occurrence of acidophilic microorganisms, forming dynamic communities that include bacteria and archaea. A combination of molecular and cultivation-based approaches has been used during the leaching cycle to understand the key microorganisms present and their function in the Escondida Sulphide Leach Plant. The global genomic expression in solution samples has been analyzed by random arbitrary primed polymerase chain reaction (RAP-PCR), to pinpoint those microorganisms with active metabolism in the communities present in regions of the heap leach operation of different ages.Four random primers were used and one hundred and twenty RAP-PCR products were cloned, sequenced and compared to databases using the BLAST search algorithm. Approximately 48% of the RAP-PCR products were 16S and 23S rRNA genes, and many of these results are consistent with community analysis carried out on the same heap using 16S rRNA gene libraries and real-time PCR. Interestingly, different microorganisms to those previously detected by 16S rRNA PCR-DGGE, represented by sequences distantly related to the archaea Picrophilus torridus, and Thermoplasma acidophilum sequences, were detected using RNA analysis. Eight different RAP-PCR products shared similarity with functional genes, and sequence analysis revealed the expression of genes associated with transcription (RNA polymerase) and translation (elongation factor and ribosomal protein) components, metabolic function (2-methylisocitrate synthase and pyruvate dehydrogenase), and electron transport (cytochrome). Other genes such as mercuric reductase and ABC transporter ATP-binding proteins were also detected. However, 30% of RAP-PCR products showed no similarity with any sequences currently in the database.This report represents the first transcriptomic study of the microbial community inhabiting an industrial bioleaching system. The data suggest that the functional spectrum of expressed genes was consistent with genomic and proteomic reports from pure cultures and environmental AMD samples containing microorganisms involved in bioleaching processes. Both studies revealed the expression of genes mainly related to energetic metabolisms and stress responses.","AcknowledgementsThis work was supported in part by the FONDEF project D04I1169 from CONICYT.

                  Goetz, S., Wolff, M., Stotz, W., and Villegas, M. J. 2008. Interactions between the South American sea lion (Otaria flavescens) and the artisanal fishery off Coquimbo, northern Chile. – ICES Journal of Marine Science, 65: 1739–1746. The South American sea lion (Otaria flavescens) forages in coastal waters, where it interacts with fisheries and causes considerable economic loss by removing some catch and damaging gear. This study describes for the fishery region of Coquimbo (Chile) where, when, and with what type of gear interactions occur, characterizes the animals involved (group size, sex, and age), and derives some management recommendations. The study was based on 55 interviews with fishers and observations aboard fishing vessels in the main fishing sectors between October 2003 and March 2004. Interactions were primarily at night (88% of interviewees fished at night), in the bay (“Bahía”) of Coquimbo (81% of interviewees fished in this sector), where shoaling fish were abundant, and with purse-seines (100% of interviewees used this gear). Although some large groups of sea lions were seen, most comprised 1–10 animals. Most animals that interacted with the fishing gear were males (67%), probably because of the different feeding strategies of the two sexes. Management options discussed include the adjustment of fisheries to foraging behaviour of sea lions, and the controlled elimination of conflicting animals.","This article is dedicated to the memory of our friend and co-author MJV, who unexpectedly passed away in March 2008 and without whose dedication and insights this work would not have been possible. We thank the fishers of Coquimbo, especially Renato Laferte, Juan Arenas, the crew of FVs “Don Gustavo” and “Vicho”, the working group ECOLMAR (Grupo de Ecología y Manejo de Recursos), and the staff of the University Católica del Norte for technical support and cooperation.

The government realised that overtly supporting the liberation movements was potentially suicidal, for the country could easily be punished by South Africa: trade links could be severed and communication networks paralysed. The settler regimes did try to infiltrate and weaken the liberation movements in Botswana and carried out acts such as kidnapping, intimidation and deportation, to try to prevent the liberation movements from threatening the status quo in southern Africa.

It is formed of a porphyritic biotite–hornblende monzonite that was emplaced at less than 1000m depth. The intrusion has a cylindrical vertical form at depth, whereas its uppermost section resembles a mushroom whose stem is inclined 20–25° to the northwest. The location of the Potrerillos porphyry coincides with a major facies and east–west thickness change in Jurassic to Late Cretaceous marine sedimentary and Tertiary volcanic host rocks. Structurally, the porphyry was emplaced at the intersection between the northeast-oriented Potrerillos fold-and-thrust belt, and a system of northwest-trending strike-slip faults of the Ciénaga fault system. Both structural elements are related to a sinistral regional transpression that was active during the Middle to Late Eocene. The north–northeast trending Sierra Castillo-Agua Amarga fault system was trench-linked with an oblique subduction along the Peru–Chile trench in the southwestern part of South America at this time. One of the main structural elements of the Potrerillos fold-and-thrust belt is the eastward verging Potrerillos Mine reverse fault. We demonstrate a syntectonic relationship between the Potrerillos porphyry emplacement and the onset of the Potrerillos Mine fault. The control at the shallowest levels of the Potrerillos porphyry emplacement was studied by means of a structural analysis of folds, cleavage and deformed oolites in the country rock. This analysis suggests that the porphyry occupied the core of an anticline. The form of this anticline was modeled as a fault-propagation-fold taking into account a 200m displacement along the basal fault and a local shortening of 45.5% occurred. This model is compatible with a limited displacement along the Potrerillos Mine fault under hot, ductile conditions. The remaining displacement of 1600m would have taken place afterwards under cold, brittle conditions. The Potrerillos porphyry was emplaced during a transpressional regime within the Potrerillos fold-and-thrust belt. The fact that the cleavage does not show a concentric distribution around the Potrerillos porphyry, discounts the possibility of a forced emplacement of the porphyry, pushing aside its wall rocks. This is reinforced by the deformed oolites which do not show a strain gradient from outside towards the edge of the body. The clockwise transection of the fold axes by the cleavage and the southeast direction of displacement along the Potrerillos Mine fault are interpreted as related to the regional sinistral transpression related to the Sierra Castillo Fault movement.","AcknowledgmentsThe authors are greatly indebted to Victor Maksaev (Universidad de Chile), Tim Marsh (Arizona, USA), Steve Olson (APO, USA) and Jeremy Richards (University of Alberta, Canada) for contributing to improve this paper.

Based on observations from previous studies, it was hypothesized that juvenile, subadult and male isopods migrate actively, and will rapidly abandon substrata after detachment. In contrast, reproductive females and small offspring were predicted to remain in floating substrata and thus have a high probability to disperse passively via rafting. In order to test this hypothesis, a colonization and an emigration experiment were conducted with giant kelp (Macrocystis integrifolia), the holdfasts of which are inhabited by boring isopods from the genus Limnoria. A survey of benthic substrata in the kelp forest confirmed that limnoriids inhabited the holdfasts and did not occur in holdfast-free samples. Results of the colonization experiment showed that all life history stages of the boring isopods immigrated into young, largely uncolonized holdfasts, and after 16 weeks all holdfasts were densely colonized. In the emigration experiment, all life history stages of the isopods rapidly abandoned the detached holdfasts — already 5 min after detachment only few individuals remained in the floating holdfasts. After this initial rapid emigration of isopods, little changes in isopod abundance occurred during the following 24 h, and at the end of the experiment some individuals of all life history stages still remained in the holdfasts. These results indicate that all life history stages of Limnoria participate in both active migration and passive dispersal. It is discussed that storm-related dynamics within kelp forests may contribute to intense mixing of local populations of these burrow-dwelling isopods, and that most immigrants to young holdfasts probably are individuals emigrating from old holdfasts detached during storm events. The fact that some individuals of all life history stages and both sexes remain in floating holdfasts suggests that limnoriids could successfully reproduce during rafting journeys in floating kelp, facilitating long-distance dispersal. We propose that the coexistence of different modes of dispersal (short distance local migrations and long-distance regional dispersal) within these kelp-dwelling isopods might be advantageous in an environment where unpredictable El Niño events can cause extinction of local kelp forests.","AcknowledgementsWe are grateful for the help from I.

                  Sellanes, J., Quiroga, E., and Neira, C. 2008. Megafauna community structure and trophic relationships at the recently discovered Concepción Methane Seep Area, Chile, ∼36°S. – ICES Journal of Marine Science, 65: 1102–1111. The fauna, community composition, and trophic support of the newly discovered Concepción Methane Seep Area (CMSA) are compared with those at a nearby non-seep control. The assemblage of chemosymbiotic bivalves is defined by eight species, including the families Lucinidae, Thyasiridae, Solemyidae, and Vesicomyidae. Seep polychaetes are represented by Lamellibrachia sp. and two commensal species of the vesicomyid Calyptogena gallardoi. Although taxonomic analysis is still under way, most of the chemosymbiotic species seem to be endemics. The CMSA is a hotspot for non-seep benthic megafauna too; 101 taxa were present, but most of them are colonists or vagrants (i.e. not endemics of methane seeps). Isotope analysis supported the belief that non-symbiont-bearing species utilize photosynthetically fixed carbon, because they were isotopically distinct from the chemosymbiotic bivalve species present. It is our opinion that, at this site, which underlies one of the most productive coastal upwelling regions of the world, spatial heterogeneity and the availability of hard substratum, generated by the presence of authigenic carbonate crusts, are more important factors in attracting non-seep fauna than the availability of locally produced chemosynthetic food.","We thank the captain and crew of the Chilean Navy’s RV “Vidal Gormáz” for support at sea, and R.

The results of those experiments might not reflect the natural situation, which can only be studied in situ. We examined whether the brown macroalgae Dictyota kunthii (C. Agardh) Greville and Macrocystis integrifolia (Bory) show inducible defenses following exposure to different grazing levels (direct, water-borne cues from nearby grazed conspecifics, presence of a non-grazing herbivore and natural grazing) in field experiments, striving to maintain natural conditions as much as possible. We measured palatability of algae after exposure to different grazing levels by using live algae and agar-based food containing non-polar extracts. M. integrifolia showed no induction of defenses (at least not of non-polar compounds), suggesting constitutive defenses, absence of defenses (tolerance) or use of another strategy to avoid herbivory. These results are similar to those from previous laboratory experiments. In D. kunthii, defense was induced after two weeks of direct grazing by amphipods under field conditions. Water-borne cues from nearby grazed conspecifics, presence of a non-grazing herbivore and natural grazing did not induce defenses. Induction of defense in response to direct grazing agrees with results from a previous laboratory study, but while indirect cues induced defenses in the laboratory, there was no measurable induced defense in the field. Probably chemical cues from grazers are diluted quickly in the field, not reaching concentrations that cause induction of defenses. This might be the reason why in some algae induction by direct grazing is a more important defensive strategy than induction by water-borne cues. The results from our study also suggest that laboratory experiments showing induced defenses in response to grazed neighbours or mere grazer presence need to be interpreted with caution.","AcknowledgmentsWe are most grateful to S.

We present spectroscopy taken with the aim of detecting emission from the mass donor in this system. We fail to do so at a level which allows us to rule out the presence of a near-main-sequence star donor. Given GD 552's orbital period of 103 min, this suggests that it is either a system that has evolved through the ∼80-minute orbital period minimum of CV stars and now has a brown dwarf mass donor, or that has formed with a brown dwarf donor in the first place. This model explains the low observed orbital velocity of the white dwarf and GD 552's low luminosity. It is also consistent with the absence of outbursts from the system.","EU was supported by PPARC (UK) and Fundación Andes (Chile) under the program Gemini PPARC-Andes throughout most of this research.

243,pub.1016539347,10.1016/j.ecss.2008.05.001,,,Recruitment of coastal fishes and oceanographic variability in central California,"Recruitment of pelagic larval fishes to the nearshore environment is dependent on a suite of biological and physical processes operating at many spatial and temporal scales. Nearshore circulation processes associated with coastal upwelling are widely upheld as major determinants of year class strength for many rockfishes (Sebastes spp.), but the mechanism by which these processes drive recruitment is largely unknown. We used Standard Monitoring Units for the Recruitment of Fishes (SMURFs) to monitor recruitment of two rockfish complexes (Sebastes spp.) and cabezon (Scorpaenichthys marmoratus) from March to September of 2004 and 2005 at 3 sites along the central California coast. We examined the relationship between recruitment of these fishes and measurements of oceanographic variability associated with upwelling dynamics, including in situ water temperature, AVHRR sea surface temperature, the Bakun upwelling index, and an index of alongshore surface water transport. We found that rockfish comprising the KCGB complex (Sebastes atrovirens, Sebastes caurinus, Sebastes carnatus, Sebastes chrysomelas) recruit during early summer, while fishes of the BYO complex (Sebastes melanops, Sebastes flavidus, Sebastes serranoides), as well as cabezon recruit during late summer. Our results provide limited support for an association between the arrival of juvenile pelagic rockfish and cabezon to the nearshore environment and physical processes related to upwelling and relaxation. Beyond the limitations of our bimonthly sampling scheme, the lack of a clear pattern may be related to the near absence of upwelling–relaxation cycles along this stretch of coast during these two study periods. Moreover, the settlement and recruitment of nearshore fishes may be closely tied to processes occurring earlier in the larval stage.","We thank Erin Nakada, Collin Johnson, Nicole Molinari and numerous others for field and lab help.

However, this microbial diversity is usually not tracked during reactor operation and mostly neglected in present mathematical models, which distinguish at the most between ammonium oxidizers and nitrite oxidizers, assuming the same properties for all bacteria of each group. Nevertheless, experimental evidence is available that different process conditions may favour the selection of different types of bacteria. This contribution deals with observed differences between two nitrifying inverse turbulent bed reactors (ITBRs) with different solid hold-ups. It also contains additional experimental data, revealing a microbial population shift upon changing the operating conditions in one of these reactors. The reactor behaviour is described with a basic two-step nitrification model, which includes the competition between two different types of ammonium oxidizers, besides nitrite oxidizers. Considering the oxygen concentration as the key variable governing the population shift, the influence of microbial growth parameters on the competition dynamics is assessed.","AcknowledgementEveline Volcke has been supported by the EU through a Marie Curie Intra-European Fellowship (EIF), Proposal 039401-PopCon4Biofilms, followed by a postdoctoral grant of the Research Foundation – Flanders (Belgium) (FWO).",,Process Biochemistry,,,,2008-12,2008,,2008-12,43,12,1398-1406,Closed,Article,"Volcke, Eveline I.P.; Sanchez, Omar; Steyer, Jean-Philippe; Dabert, Patrick; Bernet, Nicolas","Volcke, Eveline I.P.

Along the lines set by Candlin (1991: vi–vii), it is argued that language management should take due cognisance of the various historical, structural and social environments in which the management activity takes place. In the light of the foregoing, particular emphasis is placed on the current sociopolitical transformation agenda within South African higher education and the role of language management as part of this process. The article also investigates ways in which the drafting of an inclusive language policy and plan could be utilised as a change management instrument in contributing towards institutional transformation. To this end, an analysis is presented in respect of the general tendencies and patterns of responses to an institutional language audit conducted during the last semester of 2005 at the North-West University as a means of paving the way towards the formulation of an inclusive multilingual language policy.",,,Southern African Linguistics and Applied Language Studies,,,,2008-12,2008,,2008-12,26,3,379-392,Closed,Article,"Verhoef, Marlene; Venter, Theo","Verhoef, Marlene (); Venter, Theo ()",,"Verhoef, Marlene (); Venter, Theo ()",5,0,,2.38,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1070960911,"47 Language, Communication and Culture; 4703 Language Studies; 4704 Linguistics",4 Quality Education
238,pub.1070960906,10.2989/salals.2008.26.3.1.628,,,Sourcing and maintaining a pool of suitably skilled interpreters for educational interpreting at a tertiary institution,"In addition to utilising dual- and parallel-medium instruction for its lectures to a very limited extent, the North-West University, as part of its language management programme, opted for relatively large-scale simultaneous interpreting as a delivery mode in some of its classes, initially only on its Potchefstroom campus. This service expanded tenfold, from an initial 24 interpreted periods per week to approximately 240 periods just over 2 years later. For a relatively small campus, given the low numbers of simultaneous interpreters generally available, establishing and maintaining an interpreting service of this magnitude posed a serious challenge. This article (in a case study format) describes, firstly, the recruitment and selection, and secondly, the training of a pool of interpreters to staff an educational interpreting service. The increasing demands with regard to recruitment, selection and training, from the Telkom Pilot Study, through the relatively small Engineering Interpreting Project to the fully-fledged University Interpreting Service, are discussed. The conclusion reached in the article is that a suitably skilled pool of interpreters for a fairly large interpreting service can be sourced and maintained, even if only basic initial training takes place before selection, provided that this training is followed by comprehensive and continuous in-service training, with extensive quality control, based on the collection of actual interpreting product data.",,,Southern African Linguistics and Applied Language Studies,,,,2008-12,2008,,2008-12,26,3,301-313,Closed,Article,"Blaauw, Johan","Blaauw, Johan ()",,"Blaauw, Johan ()",4,0,,2.53,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1070960906,"47 Language, Communication and Culture; 4703 Language Studies",

In situ fluorescent measurements were acquired from naturally fluorescing biomolecules such as chlorophyll and from specific fluorescent probes sprayed on the samples, targeting each of the four biological macromolecule classes: DNA, protein, lipid, and carbohydrate. RGB context images were also acquired. Preparatory reagents were applied to enhance the dye probe penetration and fluorescence intensity of chlorophyll. Fluorescence imager data sets from 257 samples were returned to the Life in the Atacama science team. A variety of visible life forms, such as lichens, were detected, and several of the dye probes produced signals from nonphotosynthetic microorganisms.",The authors thank the LITA rover team and the Eventscope team for all of their dedication and support from the planning stages to the field operations.

The inadequate education system, of which the vast majority of black people are the victims, is a legacy of apartheid that affects both the clinic clients and students. There is a significant and continuous growth in student numbers at tertiary institutions. The LLB curriculum was condensed to a four- year undergraduate LLB degree, resulting in increased skills training being required at clinical level, not only to ensure the completion of the clinical curriculum, but to also equip students to enter an increasingly competitive legal practice environment. The solution for the Wits Law Clinic was found in the establishment of specialised units within the clinic, initially in family law, delict (tort), criminal law, labour law and general litigation. These specialised units now extend to consumer litigation, land rights, urban evictions and refugee law. The clinic focuses on general tutoring and mentoring of students to increase their English language proficiency, legal writing and drafting skills, legal ethics and professional conduct and trial advocacy skills.",,,Griffith Law Review,,,,2008-01,2008,2014-07-16,2008-01,17,1,121-138,Closed,Article,"du Plessis, MA","du Plessis, MA ()",,"du Plessis, MA ()",0,0,,0.0,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1024843430,48 Law and Legal Studies; 4807 Public Law,4 Quality Education

Yet, this did not insulate the party from accusations of ethnic bias – a perception the leadership largely left unattended. But, entry into the arena of competitive politics has imposed a slight modification on the part of the party towards pandering to ethnic sentiments, albeit not officially acknowledged. The intention is not to cultivate political tribalism in a divisive sense. Rather, it is employed to cultivate among ethnic communities, which otherwise feel marginalised, a sense of identification with the ruling party. The party itself has done well to blunt the perception of ethnic bias to a point where it lacks popular resonance. That the perception itself still exists, reflects the saliency of (politicised) ethnic consciousness among the populace owing to past apartheid machinations in service of political hegemony.

238,pub.1011759655,10.1007/s00227-008-1059-z,,,Is Hippolyte williamsi gonochoric or hermaphroditic? A multi-approach study and a review of sexual systems in Hippolyte shrimps,"Sexual systems vary considerably among caridean shrimps and while most species are gonochoric, others are described as sequential protandric hermaphrodites or simultaneous hermaphrodites with an early male phase. At present, there is confusion about the sexual system exhibited by several species mostly because those studies attempting to reveal their sexual system draw inferences solely from the distribution of the sexes across size classes. Here we investigated the sexual system of the shrimp Hippolyte williamsi from Chile to determine if the species is protandric or gonochoric with sexual dimorphism (males smaller than females). Morphological identification and size frequency distributions indicated that the population comprised small males, small immature females, and large mature females, which was confirmed by dissections. No transitional individuals were found. Males maintained in the laboratory molted 1–8 times, and many grew up to reach sizes observed in only a small fraction of males in the field. No indication of sex change was recorded. Our results indicate that H. williamsi is a sexually dimorphic gonochoric species and emphasizes the importance of using several kinds of evidence (size measurements, growth experiments, morphological dissections, and histological studies) to reveal the sexual system of Hippolyte species. Whether the observed size dimorphism between males and females in many species of Hippolyte is expression of contrasting sexual and natural selection, and whether divergent sexual fitness functions can contribute to the evolution of hermaphroditism remains to be revealed in future studies.",JAB thanks for the support from a Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute (STRI) Postdoctoral Fellowship and a Smithsonian Marine Station at Fort Pierce (SMSFP) Postdoctoral Fellowship.

Seventy five shallow crustal events with magnitudes up to Mw 3.8 and depths shallower than 25 km were observed in an 11-month period mainly occurring in different clusters. Those clusters are spatially related to the LOFZ, to the volcanoes Chaitén, Michinmahuida and Corcovado, and to active faulting on secondary faults. Further activity along the LOFZ is indicated by individual events located in direct vicinity of the surface expression of the LOFZ. Focal mechanisms were calculated using deviatoric moment tensor inversion of body wave amplitude spectra which mostly yield strike-slip mechanisms indicating a NE–SW direction of the P-axis for the LOFZ at this latitude. The seismic activity reveals the present-day activity of the fault zone. The recent Mw 6.2 event near Puerto Aysén, Southern Chile at 45.4°S on April 21, 2007 shows that the LOFZ is also capable of producing large magnitude earthquakes and therefore imposing significant seismic hazard to this region.","AcknowledgementsThe TIPTEQ seismic array was run collaboratively by the University of Potsdam (Germany), University of Hamburg (Germany), University of Liverpool (UK), the Universidad de Concepción (Chile) and the IFM-GEOMAR (Germany).

We examined intertidal mussel beds at four distant locations around the globe with the same sampling method, to find out whether this “hot spot” designation holds universally. We studied species assemblages within the matrices of byssally interconnected mussels engineered by Mytilus edulis in the North Sea, by mixed Perumytilus purpuratus and Mytilus chilensis at the southern Chilean coast, by Musculista senhousia in the Yellow Sea and by Xenostrobusinconstans at the coast of southern Australia. In all cases, species assemblages inside mussel beds were significantly different from those outside with many species being restricted to one habitat type. However, species richness and diversity were not generally higher in mussel beds than in ambient sediments without mussels. In the North Sea (M. edulis) and at the Chilean coast (P. purpuratus, M. chilensis), mussel beds have markedly higher species numbers and diversities than surrounding sediments, but this was not the case for mussel beds in Australia (X. inconstans) and the Yellow Sea (M. senhousia) where numbers of associated species were only slightly higher and somewhat lower than in adjacent sediments, respectively. In conclusion, although soft bottom mytilid mussels generally enhance habitat heterogeneity and species diversity at the ecosystem level, mussel beds themselves are not universal centres of biodiversity, but the effects on associated species are site specific.","We thank many highly motivated students for their assistance and kindness.

237,pub.1050740357,10.1080/01434630802147833,,,Necessary Versus Sufficient Conditions for Using New Languages in South African Higher Education: A Linguistic Appraisal1,"This paper critically examines one particular issue against the background of changes in South Africa's higher education system consequent upon the advent of a non-racial democracy – the possibility of implementing multilingual instructional polices that include indigenous African languages in its universities. Currently, a great deal of applied linguistic work is being carried out on the creation of word lists and dictionaries, via translation and term creation. This paper concurs that this is a necessary step in language adaptation for the task envisaged. It uses Saussurian semantics to show that translation and/or creation of terms is not a relatively transparent activity. An examination of Saussure's notion of ‘semantic value’ leads to a post-structuralist concern with use and function. This orientation to language is considered further in light of the discourse-oriented work of M.A.K. Halliday and J.R. Martin on the language of science in Writing Science, Literacy and Discursive Power, published by Falmer Press in 1993. Such discourse unfolds within a community of practice. The practices required for a translated science involve semiotic inculcation, and can be compared to the efforts of 19th-century Christian missionaries who worked on expanding Xhosa for religious purposes. These efforts show the complexities of developing Xhosa as a possible language of science, which any language planner will have to face.","I thank the University of Cape Town&#x27;s Research Committee for funding this research.

236,pub.1072235482,10.4102/td.v4i2.162,,,"In search of a merged identity: the case of multi-campus North-West University, South Africa","South Africa’s post–apartheid governments have taken far–reaching policy measures to transform the system of higher education, do away with its strongly segregated character, and develop an efficient and internationally recognised system that provides equal chances for all ethnic groups. Since 2002 higher education has become the explicit target of a government policy, geared to cultural development and intervention, including the enforcement of a series of mergers between traditionally white and black universities and former technikons (currently universities of technology). This process has caused intense debate at the level of leadership and among policy makers in these institutions, but little is known of how this ideological battle over educational development has affected daily academic practice. This paper gives a first, somewhat tentative discussion on the current effects of the changes in higher education in South Africa, and in particular at one of the institutions affected: the newly merged North-West University (NWU). The article is based on documentary research and three personal visits to the university; in the process a joint research project was initiated between the VU University of Amsterdam (VUUA) and NWU. This paper attempts to shed some early light on how efficiency and social equity goals are met within NWU’s institutional merger, beginning from a cultural perspective that focuses on the construction of ‘merger narratives’. The paper also gives a voice to critical reactions, narratives of resistance that have emerged from the university shop floor.",,,The Journal for Transdisciplinary Research in Southern Africa,,,,2008-04-04,2008,2008-04-04,,4,2,21,All OA; Gold,Article,"Kamsteeg, Frans","Kamsteeg, Frans (VU University Amsterdam (VUUA))",,"Kamsteeg, Frans (VU University Amsterdam (VUUA))",8,0,,1.86,https://td-sa.net/index.php/td/article/download/162/286,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1072235482,"39 Education; 3902 Education Policy, Sociology and Philosophy; 3903 Education Systems",4 Quality Education

Beyond these concerns, nature conservation areas mirror complex interrelationships between society and the environment, and how those relationships are, or should be managed in various contexts. These interrelationships cannot appropriately be understood within the confines of disciplinary boundaries; they require multi‐ and interdisciplinary perspectives. The aim of this article is to illustrate that various categories of nature conservation areas, including protected areas, embody ideas about nature and how it should be governed in changing socio‐economic conditions. The article draws on examples from southern Africa to argue that significant turns in strategies for protecting nature were made during periods of political transformation. It concludes that the gradation of protected areas, as a group of conservation areas, reflects different ways in which human activities are incorporated or marginalised in these areas. These processes are contingent on sociopolitical conditions.",The work presented in this paper is based upon research supported by the National Research Foundation.,,Geography Compass,,,,2008-03-11,2008,2008-03-11,2008-03,2,2,359-374,Closed,Article,"Ramutsindela, Maano","Ramutsindela, Maano (Department of Environmental and Geographical Science, University of Cape Town)",,"Ramutsindela, Maano (University of Cape Town)",5,0,,0.65,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1001060774,37 Earth Sciences; 3709 Physical Geography and Environmental Geoscience; 44 Human Society; 4406 Human Geography,15 Life on Land

It documents their decisions in setting up an experiment establishing how the current produced by a solar cell changes with the sun's radiation. The data include responses from 42 students to five written probes, each describing an experimental situation. The students make decisions and justify their choice of a valid independent variable; the optimal values of the dependent variable and the independent variable; a valid interval and range of the independent variable; and valid control variables. Clustering similar ideas underlying responses across the probes led to an eight-level model of progression for the understanding of validity showing some parallels with Bloom's cognitive taxonomy. The different ideas, from most sophisticated to least sophisticated range from a focus on seeing a trend emerging, to a focus on an algorithm. Other ideas appearing between the two extremes are: a focus on the quality of calculations, on the quality of measurements, on the nature of what is to be measured, on features of the variable, on measurement procedures and a focus on the experimental set up. Students mostly justify their choices based on a concern about the quality of the measurements and the nature of what is to be measured.

Chemical and isotopic gas composition shows direct addition of high-temperature fluids from magmatic degassing, mainly testified by the very high contents of SO2, HCl and HF (up to 87,800, 29,500 and 2,900 μmol/mol) and the high R/Ra values (up to 7.29). Contributions from a hydrothermal source, mainly in gas discharges of the Active Crater rim, has also been detected. Significant variations in fluid chemistry, mainly consisting of a general decrease of magmatic-related compounds, i.e. SO2, have affected the fumarolic system during the period of observation, indicating an increase of the influence of the hydrothermal system surrounding the ascending deep fluids. The chemical composition of Active Crater fumaroles has been used to build up a geochemical model describing the main processes that regulate the fluid circulation system of Lascar volcano to be utilized in volcanic surveillance.","This research was partially financed by Dirección General de Investigación y Postgrado (UCN-Chile) and by D-21050592 CONICYT grant (Government of Chile).

Thus, lifetime expectation of particular tissues and their contribution to the fitness of the alga may affect defense allocation. Two brown algae common to the SE Pacific coasts, Lessonia nigrescens Bory and Macrocystis integrifolia Bory, feature important ontogenetic differences in the development of reproductive structures; in L. nigrescens blade tissues pass from a vegetative stage to a reproductive stage, while in M. integrifolia reproductive and vegetative functions are spatially separated on different blades. We hypothesized that vegetative blades of L. nigrescens with important future functions are more (or equally) defended than reproductive blades, whereas in M. integrifolia defense should be mainly allocated to reproductive blades (sporophylls), which are considered to make a higher contribution to fitness. Herein, within-plant variation in susceptibility of reproductive and vegetative tissues to herbivory and in allocation of phlorotannins (phenolics) and N-compounds was compared. The results show that phlorotannin and N-concentrations were higher in reproductive blade tissues for both investigated algae. However, preferences by amphipod grazers (Parhyalella penai) for either tissue type differed between the two algal species. Fresh reproductive tissue of L. nigrescens was more consumed than vegetative tissue, while the reverse was found in M. integrifolia, thus confirming the original hypothesis. This suggests that future fitness function might indeed be a useful predictor of anti-herbivore defense in large, perennial kelps. Results from feeding assays with artificial pellets that were made with air-dried material and extract-treated Ulva powder indicated that defenses in live algae are probably not based on chemicals that can be extracted or remain intact after air-drying and grinding up algal tissues. Instead, anti-herbivore defense against amphipod mesograzers seems to depend on structural traits of living algae.","We are thankful to the leaders of the GAME project Mark Lenz and Martin Wahl.

After a few brief biographical facts, some elements that allow us to understand the continuity and the distinction between both philosophical approaches will be reviewed. In the body of the text, account is given of the Zubirian attempt to specify the philosophical ""supposition"" that would be the basis for a great number of contemporary demonstrations or refutations of the existence of God, which consider God an external fact, added on to humanity. In the face of this panorama, the Zubirian effort clearly shows the question of God as a true problem, affecting the whole human person and all of humanity, due to its being a dimensin both constitutive and radically characteristic of human existence. This is a proposal in which the mportance of human reason is reasserted, while at the same time denying that a primary problem of a merely epistemological order is the issue. Zubiri insists that God is a true problem for the human being, by the mere fact of being human, by being strongly attached to the deity or forc of the real, which truly makes him free.",,,Teología y Vida,,,,2008,2008,2008,,49,3,353-370,All OA; Hybrid,Article,"CORREA, FRANCISCO","CORREA, FRANCISCO (Universidad Catlica del Norte Departamento de Teologa, Chile)",,"CORREA, FRANCISCO (Catholic University of the North)",0,0,,0.0,http://www.scielo.cl/pdf/tv/v49n3/art11.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1005654388,"38 Economics; 3801 Applied Economics; 47 Language, Communication and Culture","16 Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions"

The uptake of 3H-alanine, as representative of dissolved organic matter, by embryo and larval stages is also investigated. While protein levels increased at all temperature conditions after ingestion of nurse eggs, lipids only increased when embryo and larvae were reared at 15 °C, and no change in carbohydrate levels was detected at any of the temperatures. The RNA/DNA indexes showed no significant differences with temperature at any stage of development but decreased along with the development of individuals. After hatching, organic matter and energy content of juveniles steadily decreased. Individuals at any of the developmental stage showed to be able to uptake alanine from seawater; the aminoacid uptake capacity increased along with intracapsular development. Uptake of alanine showed to be an active process and to follow Michaelis–Menten kinetics. This would be the first report about dissolved organic matter uptake by encapsulated development stages of any marine invertebrate species and let conclude that these larvae have the ability to obtain exogenous food in a dissolved form and to incorporate it into metabolizable compounds.","AcknowledgementsThis study was supported by a grant from the Programa Acuicultura y Biotecnología Marina, 1 (97), FONDAP, Chile (Sub-programa Invertebrados).

The architecture of the sedimentary infill evidences three main distinctive seismic sequences, identified as basal pre-kinematic, intermediate syn-kinematic, and upper post-kinematic units. Although the absolute thickness of each of these sequences varies from basin to basin, the intermediate, syn-kinematic sequence is commonly thicker, associated with high sedimentation rates coeval with slip on bordering faults. Age estimations on boundaries of these units evidence first-order cycles which can be linked with global climate fluctuations. The dynamics of the deposition and deformation of the different sequences suggest alternating episodes of extension, relative stability and compression (and/or transpression). Positive flower structures evidence current transpressional activity associated with tectonic inversion and differential uplift of the accretionary prism. The evolution of depositional and deformational episodes is strongly controlled by tectonic events induced by subduction and the large-scale mass transfer processes. The seismic lines allow the identification of at least two mechanisms for slope basin formation, one of them (more local) associated with seamounts subduction or its proximity. A second mechanism (more widespread), would be controlled by basal accretion of large volumes of underplated sediment underneath the buttress, which in turn drives deformation and tilting of the upper part of the slope. This process is strongly connected with the available volume of sediments at the trench and the basal properties of the prism. Climatic fluctuations and currently active canyons are an important supply of sediments to the system. The study of seismic sequences thus provides a good record of the interplay between plate boundary deformation and marine basin evolution along the accretionary part of the Chilean margin.","AcknowledgmentsThis study is part of a Ph.D. partially funded by the Dirección de Investigación of the Universidad Católica del Norte, in Antofagasta-Chile and Fundación Andes.

Whether costs of changing to a subsequent reproductive phenotype are outweighed by a higher mating probability may depend on the frequencies of different phenotypes in a group of competitors. Benefits and costs associated with different phenotype frequencies depend on interactions within and between alternative phenotypes, but the underlying behavioural mechanisms have rarely been studied. Herein, we used the rock shrimp Rhynchocinetes typus as a model: ontogenetic male stages of this species differ in morphological and behavioural traits that indicate alternative reproductive phenotypes. The small, subordinate, male stage (typus) develops via several intermediate stages (intermedius) to the dominant male stage (robustus): in competitive interactions the typus males usually employ the sneaking tactic, while the robustus males invariably employ the monopolizing fighter tactic. In laboratory experiments, we manipulated phenotype frequencies to examine whether there are frequency‐dependent effects on searching behaviour, aggressiveness and mating probability. With increasing frequency of robustus males, the rate of aggressive interactions among them increased. Furthermore, robustus males increased walking velocity when more than one robustus male was present. In contrast, typus males did not adjust their searching or aggressive behaviour. The increase of aggressive interactions among robustus males provided more opportunities for typus males to seize a temporarily unguarded female. While typus males exploit fights among robustus males that produce mating opportunities for them, robustus males benefit from typus males, which reveal the presence of receptive females. We suggest that each phenotype benefits from the presence of the other phenotype and suffers costly interference among individuals of the same phenotype. Whether frequency‐dependent effects on the mating probability of subordinates also affect their ontogenetic switchpoint should be examined in future studies.",We are very grateful to I.

We monitored the thermal behavior of two caves in the Atacama Desert of northern Chile. Through this work, we identified times when temperature contrasts between entrance and surface were greatest, thus enabling us to suggest optimal overflight times. The largest thermal contrast for both caves occurred during mid-day. One cave demonstrated thermal behavior at the entrance suggestive of cold-trapping, while the second cave demonstrated temperature shifts suggestive of airflow. We also collected thermograms without knowing optimal detection times; these images suggest both caves may also be detectable during off-peak times. We suggest cave detection using thermal remote sensing on Earth and other planetary objects will be limited by (1) capturing imagery in the appropriate thermal wavelength, (2) the size of cave entrance vs. the sensor's spatial resolution, (3) the viewing angle of the platform in relation to the slope trajectory of the cave entrance, (4) the strength of the thermal signal associated with the cave entrance, and (5) the time of day and season of thermal image capture. Through this and other studies, we will begin to identify the range of conditions under which caves are detectable in the thermal infrared and thus improve our detection capabilities of these features on Earth, the Moon and Mars.","This study was partially funded by NASA Exobiology grant NNH04ZSS001N-EXB, NASA Spaceward Bound!, the L.

On the one hand, they are an aesthetic product that is culturally created and defined. On the other, they are created, and re-created, by people through their experience of, and interaction with, the world around them.Against this background, it is clear that landscape has to be contextualised. The way that people see and engage with their world depends upon the specific time, place and historical conditions in which they are operating. Similarly, their age, gender, class, caste, social and economic situation will also play a significant role. These forces may operate at a conscious, a partly-conscious or an unconscious level. Depending on changing situations, they may also be reformulated over time and place. In the words of Barbara Bender, “Each individual holds many landscapes in tension” and “Landscapes are […] polysemic, and not so much artefact as in a process of construction and reconstruction.” Thus, far from being inert, landscapes are re-worked, appropriated and contested.The relationship between the Berlin missionaries, the landscape of Vendaland and the Vhavenda people during the late nineteenth century was a complex one. It varied over time and between individuals. Even individuals’ experiences of the landscape changed over time, and were influenced by factors such as mood, the dynamics of the local situation at any given time, and other intangibles which it may be impossible to recapture over a century later. However, I believe that it is possible to identify and explore certain tendencies. In extremely broad outline, what remained constant in missionary thinking, writing and images in Vendaland during the late nineteenth century was a sense of the land and its people as being inextricably bound. For them, the “heathen Bawenda [Vhavenda]” blended into, or were created by, the landscape which nurtured, succoured and concealed them.",,,,Toxic Belonging?

The triple helix perspective is adopted to examine the causes of the poor knowledge transfer among small firms, academic and higher vocational training institutions, government and other public agencies. Main causes include insufficient communication between parties, little awareness of government agencies on small firms’ specific problems, poor visibility of government programmes for small firms, high bureaucracy and overlapping of responsibilities between government agencies with an entrepreneurship-support mission, cultural and language differences. A number of policy recommendations are suggested, particularly at the university–industry interface, as the ‘university’ institutional sphere appears to be the least active in the collaboration with small firms and is often outrun by the regional higher vocational training institutions.",,,Technology Analysis and Strategic Management,,,,2008-11,2008,,2008-11,20,6,697-716,Closed,Article,"Ranga, Liana Marina; Miedema, Joost; Jorna, René","Ranga, Liana Marina (Business School, Newcastle University, Newcastle upon Tyne, UK); Miedema, Joost (Faculty of Management and Organization, University of Groningen, Groningen, The Netherlands); Jorna, René (Faculty of Management and Organization, University of Groningen, Groningen, The Netherlands)","Ranga, Liana Marina (Newcastle University)","Ranga, Liana Marina (Newcastle University); Miedema, Joost (University of Groningen); Jorna, René (University of Groningen)",61,11,,13.29,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1005586766,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3507 Strategy, Management and Organisational Behaviour; 44 Human Society",

Here we examine the community‐level marine biogeographical patterns in the context of formerly described biogeographical regions, and we evaluate the combined effects of geographical distance and environmental conditions on patterns of species similarity across this region.   Location  Pacific coast of North America.   Methods  Data on the percentage cover of benthic marine organisms were collected at 67 rocky intertidal sites from south‐eastern Alaska, USA, to central Baja California Sur, Mexico. Cluster analysis and non‐metric multidimensional scaling were used to evaluate the spatial patterns of species similarity among sites relative to those of previously defined biogeographical regions. Matrices of similarity in species composition among all sites were computed and analysed with respect to geographical distance and long‐term mean sea surface temperature (SST) as a measure of environmental conditions.   Results  We found a high degree of spatial structure in the similarity of intertidal communities along the coast. Cluster analysis identified 13 major community structure ‘groups’. Although breaks between clusters of sites generally occurred at major biogeographical boundaries, some of the larger biogeographical regions contained several clusters of sites that did not group according to spatial position or identifiable coastal features. Additionally, there were several outliers – sites that grouped alone or with sites outside their region – for which localized features may play an important role in driving community structure. Patterns of species similarity at the large scale were highly correlated with geographical distance among sites and with SST. Importantly, we found community similarity to be highly correlated with long‐term mean SST while controlling for the effects of geographical distance.   Main conclusions  These findings reveal a high degree of spatial structure in the similarity of rocky intertidal communities of the north‐east Pacific, and are generally consistent with those of previously described biogeographical regions, with some notable differences. Breaks in similarity among clusters are generally coincident with known biogeographical and oceanographic discontinuities. The strong correlations between species similarity and both geographical position and SST suggest that both geography and oceanographic conditions have a large influence on patterns of intertidal community structure along the Pacific coast of North America.","This project has been funded by the Partnership for Interdisciplinary Studies of Coastal Oceans and the Minerals Management Service.

Two-dimensional numerical models were used to explore the geometrical and mechanical parameters needed to produce extension within a bulk contractional regime. All of the mechanical models show the same structure as the field: a concentration of cracks predominantly at the top, rather than on the forelimbs of the scarps. In the field case extension begins as soon as a discrete scarp forms; with progressive shortening the scarp height increases producing a broadening of the zone in extension. The numerical models show that this broadening stabilizes when a maximum in the scarp height is reached. To produce concentration of the extension on top of the scarps, the reverse fault needs to be weak (ϕ∼10°). The models suggest that distribution of this extensional zone depends on the cross-sectional geometry of the fault and on the location of the detachment at depth. The main mechanism that produces extension on the top of the reverse scarp is stretching of the topographic surface by folding of the hanging wall at the tip of the fault zone.",AcknowledgmentsThis work has been funded by the Fondecyt project 1040389 (GG) and by the French-Chile Cooperation Program Ecos-Conicyt CU04.

In our ongoing search for close and faint companions around T Tauri stars in the Chamaeleon star-forming region, we here present observations of a new common proper motion companion to the young T-Tauri star and Chamaeleon member CT Cha and discuss its properties in comparison to other young, low-mass objects and to synthetic model spectra from different origins. Methods. Common proper motion of the companion and CT Cha was confirmed by direct -band imaging data taken with the VLT Adaptive Optics (AO) instrument NACO in February 2006 and March 2007, together with a Hipparcos binary for astrometric calibration. An additional J-band image was taken in March 2007 to obtain color information for a first classification of the companion. Moreover, AO integral field spectroscopy with SINFONI in J, and bands was obtained to deduce physical parameters of the companion, such as temperature and extinction. Relative flux calibration of the bands was achieved using photometry from the NACO imaging data. Results. We found a very faint ( = 14.9 mag, = 14.4 mag) object, just ~2.67´´ northwest of CT Cha corresponding to a projected separation of ~440 AU at 165 ± 30 pc. We show that CT Cha A and this faint object form a common proper motion pair and that the companion is by ≥4σ significance not a stationary background object. The near-infrared spectroscopy yields a temperature of 2600 ± 250 K for the companion and an optical extinction of AV = 5.2 ± 0.8 mag, when compared to spectra calculated from Drift-Phoenix model atmospheres. We demonstrate the validity of the model fits by comparison to several other well-known young sub-stellar objects. Conclusions. We conclude that the CT Cha companion is a very low-mass member of Chamaeleon and very likely a physical companion to CT Cha, as the probability for a by chance alignment is ≤0.01. Due to a prominent Pa-β emission in the J-band, accretion is probably still ongoing onto the CT Cha companion. From temperature and luminosity (log = –2.68 ± 0.21), we derive a radius of R = . We find a consistent mass of M = 17 ± 6 for the CT Cha companion from both its luminosity and temperature when placed on evolutionary tracks. Hence, the CT Cha companion is most likely a wide brown dwarf companion or possibly even a planetary mass object.",,,Astronomy & Astrophysics,,,,2008-09-17,2008,2008-09-17,2008-11,491,1,311-320,All OA; Bronze,Article,"Schmidt, T.

Here we present the results of the tomographic inversion for P-wave velocity anomalies, based on teleseismic data recorded at the stations. The reliability of the results has been checked by a series of synthetic tests. The tomographic images show high-velocities on the west of the profile that are indicative of cold material from the fore-arc. A low-velocity anomaly is detected at the border between the fore- and the volcanic arc where the Quebrada Blanca seismic anomaly was previously described. This anomaly might be related to the presence of fluids that originate at the cluster of earthquakes at a depth of ∼100km in the subducted plate. A strong low-velocity anomaly is detected beneath the entire Altiplano plateau and part of the Eastern Cordillera, in agreement with previous receiver function results. The Brazilian Shield is thought to be responsible for the strong high-velocity anomaly underneath the Interandean and Subandean regions.",AcknowledgementsWe would like to thank the people from the different villages in Bolivia and Chile for permitting us to deploy the stations for those long and pleasant two years on the field and particularly to Max Cayo Vilca in San Juan del Rosario and Felipe our driver from La Paz.

We show that the share of health and welfare in total public spending are strong predictors of suicide rates and yield estimated coefficients that are both statistically significant and economically meaningful. In parsimonious specifications, we also find that suicide rates are systematically higher in states with higher divorce rates, but average income level, income inequality and unemployment rates do not have a robust impact on suicide. The model provides a better fit to male than to female suicide data. Our main results hold up to a series of specification tests.","AcknowledgmentWe are grateful to an anonymous referee, Sanjay Reddy, and conference participants at the 2004 Southwestern Economics Association Annual Meeting (Corpus Christi, Texas) for helpful comments.

Initially it recalls how game was utilised in South Africa in the nineteenth century and then reflects on the rise of the modern livestock industry and its detrimental effect on the herds of game that survived in the region into the twentieth century. The roles of scientists from different regions—Britain, the United States and South Africa—are identified and their respective scientific contributions to the wildlife industry evaluated.

The LOFZ has been regarded as a Late Miocene-Pliocene dextral strike-slip fault zone within a bulk transpressional setting. Nevertheless, little geologic and morphological evidence exists for Quaternary right-lateral offsets. In contrast, vertical separation is the most outstanding feature observable along the master faults. The river network also shows local discontinuities (sinuosity, stream power index) where cut by these first-order faults. In humid climates, topographic equilibrium should be rapidly restored; therefore, at least part of the vertical displacement should be Holocene. Vertical movements can be caused by tectonic forces but are also enhanced by the postglacial isostatic rebound. The latter would have been intense during the Quaternary and especially after the Last Glacial Maximum (i.e., < ca. 14 ka) in the Southern Andes between 38° and 46°S. A consistent Quaternary NE-oriented maximum horizontal stress accompanies both compressional and transpressional tensors along the entire volcanic arc, which supports the argument that part of the vertical displacement could be tectonic in origin. Therefore, competing transpressional and compressional regimes, with both strike-slip and vertical displacement, occur along the entire intra-arc zone, and are spatially and causally related to a wide variety of volcanic outspurs. Compression and transpression can alternate along the intra-arc fault systems (by shifting σ2 and σ3; σ1 remaining constant) because of local or regional factors such as inherited discontinuities and/or variations of the angle between the convergence vector and the continental margin trend. The shifting between σ2 and σ3 should be common in highly oblique subduction zones, which develop ""pure shear-dominated"" strain regimes. Whatever the driving mechanism of vertical displacements, the most primitive Holocene basaltic magmas were erupted along the LOFZ master faults, where the vertical offsets are more clearly distinguished. At the regional scale, arc volcanism would be sustained by flux melting in the asthenosphere and magma ascent controlled by the bulk transpressional regime. Instead, sporadic vertical adjustments along the LOFZ, either by tectonic and/or climatic processes, would trigger monogenetic volcanism after induced decompressional melting. Thus, volcanic and orogenic processes are coupled and should be considered for understanding the global arc architecture and coeval relief building.",,,International Geology Review,,,,2008-11,2008,2010-08-06,2008-11,50,11,975-993,Closed,Article,"Lara, L.

(2005, A&A, 435, L13) presented direct imaging evidence for a sub-stellar companion to the young T Tauri star GQ Lupi. Common proper motion was highly significant, but no orbital motion was detected. Faint luminosity, low gravity, and a late-M/early-L spectral type indicated that the companion is either a planet or a brown dwarf. Aims. We have monitored GQ Lupi and its companion in order to detect orbital and parallactic motion and variability in its brightness. We also search for closer and fainter companions. Methods. We have taken six more images with the VLT Adaptive Optics instrument NACO from May 2005 to Feb. 2007, always with the same calibration binary from Hipparcos for both astrometric and photometric calibration. By adding up all the images taken so far, we search for additional companions. Results. The position of GQ Lupi A and its companion compared to a nearby non-moving background object varies as expected for parallactic motion by about one pixel ( with parallax π). We could not find evidence for variability of the GQ Lupi companion in the Ks-band (standard deviation being ±0.08 mag), which may be due to large error bars. No additional companions are found with deep imaging. Conclusions. There is now exceedingly high significance for common proper motion of GQ Lupi A and its companion. In addition, we see for the first time an indication for orbital motion (~2 to 3 mas/yr decrease in separation, but no significant change in the position angle), consistent with a near edge-on or highly eccentric orbit. We measured the parallax for GQ Lupi A to be mas (i.e. pc) and for the GQ Lupi companion to be mas (i.e. pc), both consistent with being in the Lupus I cloud and bound to each other.",,,Astronomy & Astrophysics,,,,2008-01-17,2008,2008-01-17,2008-06,484,1,281-291,All OA; Bronze,Article,"Neuhäuser, R.; Mugrauer, M.; Seifahrt, A.; Schmidt, T.

211,pub.1016651355,10.1007/s00126-008-0226-y,,,"New thermochronologic constraints on the evolution of the Zaldívar porphyry copper deposit, Northern Chile","Life spans and thermal evolution of hydrothermal systems are of fundamental metallogenic importance. We were able to establish the chronology and cooling history of the Zaldívar porphyry copper deposit (Northern Chile) by applying a combination of different isotopic dating methods in minerals with different closure temperatures, including 40Ar/39Ar geochronology and zircon fission track thermochronology, together with fluid inclusion thermometry and previous published U–Pb zircon geochronology. The hydrothermal mineralization in the Zaldívar deposit is genetically related to the Llamo Porphyry unit. Samples of igneous biotites from this intrusion yielded 40Ar/39Ar plateau ages between 35.5 ± 0.7 and 37.7 ± 0.4 Ma defining a weighted average of 36.6 ± 0.5 Ma (2σ). In contrast, one sample from the Zaldívar porphyry, one from the andesites, and two from the Llamo porphyry yielded considerably younger fission track ages of approximately 29 Ma with a weighted mean for all ages of 29.1 ± 1.7 Ma (2σ). Thermal and compositional constraints for the hydrothermal system in the Zaldívar deposit from fluid inclusions thermometry show that at least three fluid types broadly characterize two main hydrothermal episodes during the evolution of the deposit. The main mineralization and alteration event is characterized by high temperature (above 320°C) hypersaline fluids (salinity between 30 and 56 wt.% NaCl equivalents) coexisting with low-density gas-rich inclusions (salinity less than 17 wt.% NaCl equivalents) that homogenizing into the gas phase at temperatures above 350°C. The second episode corresponds to a low-temperature event which is characterized by liquid-rich fluid inclusions that homogenize into the liquid phase at temperatures ranging from 200°C to 300°C with salinities lower than 10 wt.% NaCl equivalents. The 40Ar/39Ar data (36.6 ± 0.5 Ma, weighted average) obtained from igneous biotites represent the minimum age for the last high-temperature (above 300°C) hydrothermal pulse. When compared with previously published U–Pb ages (38.7 ± 1.3 Ma) in zircons from the Llamo porphyry, a close temporal relationship between crystallization of the parental intrusion and the thermal collapse of the last high-temperature hydrothermal event is evident. Cooling took place from approximately 800°C (crystallization of the intrusive complex defined by zircon U–Pb ages) to below 300 ± 50°C (biotite 40Ar/39Ar closure temperature) within approximately 1.5 m.y. Because the thermal annealing of fission tracks in zircons occurs at temperatures of 240 ± 30°, the zircon fission track (ZFT) ages of 29.1 ± 1.7 Ma (2σ) mark the end of the thermal activity in the Zaldívar area, specifically the time when the whole area cooled below this temperature, well after the collapse of the main hydrothermal event in the Zaldívar porphyry copper deposit. This cooling age roughly coincides with the age defined for the emplacement of dacitic dikes at 31 ± 2.8 Ma (2σ) (published K–Ar whole rock), 5 km south of the Zaldívar deposit, in the Escondida area. This late magmatic pulse probably is responsible for high heat flow in the Zaldívar deposit as late as 29 Ma. There is no evidence that the low temperature hydrothermal pulse recognized by fluid inclusion studies is related to this thermal event. The zircon fission track cooling ages are interpreted to be related to the time lag required for complete relaxation of the perturbation of the isotherms in the geothermal field imposed by the intrusion of magmatic bodies, with or without any association with low temperature hydrothermal activity.","We gratefully acknowledge Compañía Minera Zaldívar for providing field support and access to the mine and to unpublished reports; special thanks are owed to Jaime Delgado and Patricio Morales.

203,pub.1118186915,10.48550/arxiv.0809.2812,,,Direct evidence of a sub-stellar companion around CT Cha,"In our ongoing search for close and faint companions around T Tauri stars, we
found a very faint (Ks=14.9mag, Ks_0=14.4mag) object, just ~2.67"" northwest of
the Chamaeleon star-forming region member CT Cha corresponding to a projected
separation of ~440AU at 165+/-30 pc. We show that CT Cha A and this faint
object form a common proper motion pair from data of the VLT Adaptive Optics
(AO) instrument NACO taken in February 2006 and March 2007 and that the
companion is by >=4 sigma significance not a stationary background object. Our
AO integral field spectroscopy with SINFONI in J, and H+K bands yields a
temperature of 2600+/-250K for the companion and an optical extinction of
A_V=5.2+/-0.8mag, when compared to spectra calculated from Drift-Phoenix model
atmospheres. We demonstrate the validity of the model fits by comparison to
several other well-known young sub-stellar objects. Relative flux calibration
of the bands was achieved using photometry from the NACO imaging data. We
conclude that the CT Cha companion is a very low-mass member of Chamaeleon and
very likely a physical companion to CT Cha, as the probability for a by chance
alignment is <=0.01. Due to a prominent Pa-Beta emission in the J-band,
accretion is probably still ongoing onto the CT Cha companion. From temperature
and luminosity (log(Lbol/Lsun)= -2.68+/-0.21), we derive a radius of
R=2.20+0.81-0.60 R_Jup. We find a consistent mass of M=17+/-6 MJup for the CT
Cha companion from both its luminosity and temperature when placed on
evolutionary tracks. Hence, the CT Cha companion is most likely a wide brown
dwarf companion or possibly even a planetary mass object.",,,arXiv,,,,2008-09-16,2008,,,,,,All OA; Green,Preprint,"Schmidt, T. O.

Two deformation episodes are superposed in the bedrock: a Neogene deformation event (post 9 Ma), having an E-W-trending al, and a late Quaternary event with al roughly trending N-S. The latter would be the result of regional-scale partitioning of the oblique convergence vector between the Nazca and South American Plates; a buttress at 33S would produce a north-south velocity gradient in the forearc leading to regional, north-south shortening.

These ridges were uplifted by steep reverse N–S faults that deformed the Mesozoic–Cenozoic cover. The vergence of the fault system varies along strike, conferring an apparent doubly vergent “pop-up” geometry to the axial zone. Two Mesozoic pre-compressional extensional events were recorded in the area. New structural data presented in this paper indicate that most of the generated N–S-trending thrusts and related folds were controlled by the inversion of the pre-existing Mesozoic extensional faults. Thin-skin structures in the Mesozoic–Cenozoic cover are genetically linked to major basement upthrusts, which could be interpreted as basement short-cuts formed during inversion rather than as uplifted blocks associated with major Cenozoic strike-slip faults. Growth-strata geometries date the beginning of the Andean compressional event, which generates the Chilean Precordillera, as far back as 90Ma ago; the resulting structural architecture is strongly controlled by inherited pre-Andean extensional structures. The association of porphyry intrusives with major reverse faults suggests that the emplacement of the Eocene–Oligocene porphyry Cu–Mo deposits in Northern Chile can be explained by an oblique-inversion Tectonics Model. The upper Eocene–lower Oligocene giant porphyry copper bodies (Chuquicamata, La Escondida, El Salvador) located in the Cordillera de Domeyko show an adakitic affinity. This magma affinity, together with structural evidence presented in this work, indicates that porphyry emplacement occurred at the end of the basement-involved contractional stage that generates the anomalous thickened crust needed to generate these magmas. This tectonic evolution is coherent with the existence of a flat-slab subducting beneath the Central Andes (22°–26° S) during early Cenozoic, that will also produce the eastward migrating of the compressional regime in the upper plate since Late Cretaceous.","AcknowledgementsFunding for this project was provided by projects CGL2007-66431-C02-01/BTE, PB96-1002 &amp; BTE2000-0571 of the Ministerio de Educación y Ciencia and CODELCO.

202,pub.1070960907,10.2989/salals.2008.26.3.2.629,,,Perspectives on managing Afrikaans and English as 'equal' languages of learning and teaching at the University of the Free State,"This article provides a description of language management at the University of the Free State (UFS) and offers perspectives on two aspects, namely the language management agents involved, and the devices employed to ensure parity in the use of Afrikaans and English, both as institutional languages and languages of learning and teaching. The overview considers the possibilities offered by the two models for managing more than one language in higher education, as proposed by Van der Walt and Brink (2005), namely the protectionist model, comprising a model that 'safeguards' a designated language; and the multiculturalist model, a more open model based on the premise of language tolerance. The development of the concept of parallel bilingualism at the UFS is discussed in the main part of the article, in which the language management approach at this institution is considered, as well as its relation to the variety of agents involved and particular devices employed. In problematising the view held by the authors mentioned above, the article concludes by proposing a mixed model and theoretically applying it to the UFS. In the process, it identifies some weaknesses regarding the alignment of the multiculturalist ideals of the UFS language policy with its language strategy as a central language management device.",,,Southern African Linguistics and Applied Language Studies,,,,2008-12,2008,,2008-12,26,3,315-332,Closed,Article,"du Plessis, Theodorus","du Plessis, Theodorus ()",,"du Plessis, Theodorus ()",1,0,,0.48,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1070960907,"47 Language, Communication and Culture; 4703 Language Studies; 4704 Linguistics",4 Quality Education

Immigrant Teenagers in Quest of Multilingual Competence and Identity,"Second generation immigrants tend to shift their loyalty from their own languages (‘immigrant languages’) to the language of the host country (‘societal language’), given the socioeconomically weak vitality position of the immigrant languages. This language shift makes intergenerational communication, especially with folk left at home, often problematic. Similarly, intragenerational communication may equally be difficult among young relatives from families having adopted different societal languages. The present study draws from observational speech data of immigrant teenagers of Congolese origin during a seven-week reunion. The teenagers had adopted, respectively, French and English to the detriment of Kiswahili (for both sets) and of French for those who spoke only English. This paper highlights different coping strategies to smooth multilingual intragenerational interaction. These strategies include accommodation (mostly convergence), crossing, code negotiation, and negotiation of meaning. Convergence and divergence can be explained mainly by the existence of differing levels of integrative motivation. The data also reveal boundary crossing as a phenomenon of identity creation in which two of the youngsters engage, in contrast to resistance by another teenager.",,,International Journal of Multilingualism,,,,2008-11,2008,,2008-11,5,4,333-356,Closed,Article,"Kasanga, Luanga Adrien","Kasanga, Luanga Adrien (Nanyang Technological University, Singapore)","Kasanga, Luanga Adrien (Nanyang Technological University)","Kasanga, Luanga Adrien (Nanyang Technological University)",4,1,,1.91,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1042360444,"47 Language, Communication and Culture; 4703 Language Studies; 4704 Linguistics",

The focus is on isotherm vertical displacement variability associated with extratropical Rossby waves (ETRW) and their connection with equatorial Kelvin waves (EKW). The WKB theory is used to interpret the modeled subsurface variability. The analysis reveals vertical propagation of energy associated with the 1997–1998 El Niño near the coast at various latitudes. Consistent with theory, WKB raypaths are steeper southward and do not extend more than ∼600 km from the coast at ∼2000 m depth. A vertical mode decomposition of model variability showed that vertical propagation mostly involves the first three baroclinic modes. The vertical isotherm displacements along the raypaths, associated with the downwelling EKW of the 1997–1998 El Niño, are negative (rising isotherms) and peak (minimum isotherm) as El Niño reverses to La Niña conditions. The relationship between vertical propagation of ETRW and equatorial variability is interpreted in the light of EKW sequence. The evolution of the vertical isotherm displacements along the raypath at extratropical latitudes is controlled by the vertical structure of the EKW. As El Niño develops, high‐order baroclinic mode contributions to the EKW progressively increase, leading to the dominance of finer vertical scales of variability along the coast, triggering the vertical propagation of ETRW. This mechanism of connection between equatorial variability and subsurface variability at the extratropical latitudes illustrates how sensitive the ETRW characteristics in the eastern South Pacific are to equatorial forcing.","M.

It then reports the findings of the first phase of ""Pluralizing the Archival Paradigm through Education,"" a collaborative project examining archival education in Pacific Rim nations and whether it meets the needs of Indigenous and local ethnic communities. Its findings to date suggest a need to develop and deliver culturally sensitive and responsive archival curricula and associated pedagogy inclusive of local and Indigenous knowledge and practices.

Obtaining a conceptual hydrogeological model is crucial for groundwater resources development and management. Surveys of water seepages and rain for chemical and environmental isotope contents may provide information on the whole island groundwater flow conditions, in spite of remaining geological and hydrogeological uncertainties. New data from Easter Island (Isla de Pascua), in the Pacific Ocean, are considered. Whether Easter Island has a central low permeability volcanic “core” sustaining an elevated water table remains unknown. Average recharge is estimated at 300–400 mm/year, with a low salinity of 15–50 mg/L Cl. There is an apron of highly permeable volcanics that extends to the coast. The salinity of near-the-coast wells, >1,000 mg/L Cl, is marine in origin. This is the result of a thick mixing zone of island groundwater and encroached seawater, locally enhanced by upconings below pumping wells. This conceptual model explains what is observed, in the absence of inland boreholes and springs.","The studies carried out have been financed by the Research and Postgraduate Directorate of the Universidad Católica del Norte (Antofagasta, Chile) with the chemical analytical help and support of the Geological Survey of Spain (Instituto Geológico y Minero de España, IGME, Madrid).

Various independent estimates yield a distance of 2.1 ± 0.2 kpc. The ratio of total-to-selective extinction is R = 3.9. Within a projected area of 3.6 × 3.7 pc, there are several thousand stars. About 74% of them show infrared excess suggesting the presence of dense circumstellar material; the excess frequency is higher for fainter stars. The number of spectroscopically classified exciting stars could be enlarged from 13 to 46. The two central O4 stars are both spectroscopic binaries; multiplicity of other early O-type stars could also be established, increasing the number of high-mass stars even further. Our data suggest at least two episodes of star formation: There are about 500 ZAMS sources (2 < AV < 7)—among them many spectroscopically classified OB stars and a significant fraction of lower mass sources with infrared excess (~25%) and X-ray emission (~6%). About 3350 heavily reddened sources with 10 < AV < 40) are most likely deeply embedded pre-main-sequence objects with an age of less than 5 × 105 yr.

170,pub.1015881105,10.1890/06-1805.1,,,SPATIAL AND TEMPORAL PATTERNS OF INVERTEBRATE RECRUITMENT ALONG THE WEST COAST OF THE UNITED STATES,"Patterns of recruitment in marine ecosystems can reflect the distribution of adults, dispersal by ocean currents, or patterns of mortality after settlement. In turn, patterns of recruitment can play an important role in determining patterns of adult abundance and community dynamics. Here we examine the biogeographic structure of recruitment variability along the U.S. West Coast and examine its association with temperature variability. From 1997 to 2004 we monitored monthly recruitment rates of dominant intertidal invertebrates, mussels and barnacles, at 26 rocky shore sites on the West Coast of the United States, from northern Oregon to southern California, a span of 1750 km of coastline. We examined spatial variation in the dynamics of recruitment rates and their relationship to coastal oceanography using satellite‐derived time series of monthly sea surface temperature (SST). Recruitment rates showed a biogeographic structure with large regions under similar dynamics delimited by abrupt transitions. The seasonal peak in recruitment rates for both mussels and barnacles changed from a late summer–early fall peak in Oregon to winter or early spring in northern California, and then back toward summer in southern California. Recruitment rates varied greatly in magnitude across the latitudinal range. The barnacle Balanus glandula and mussels (Mytilus spp.) showed a decline of two orders of magnitude south of Oregon. In contrast, recruitment rates of barnacles of the genus Chthamalus showed a variable pattern across the region examined. The spatial distribution of associations between raw SST and recruitment rates for all species showed positive associations, indicating recruitment during warm months, for all species in Oregon, northern California, and several sites in south‐central California. By considerably extending the spatial and temporal scales beyond that of previous studies on larval recruitment rates in this system, our study has identified major biogeographic breaks around Cape Blanco and Point Conception despite considerable spatial and temporal variation within each region and among species. These large differences in recruitment rates across biogeographic scales highlight the need for a better understanding of larval responses to ocean circulation patterns in the conservation and management of coastal ecosystems.","We thank the legions of interns who have helped with field sampling and processing of the samples in the laboratory; without their help, such a massive sampling effort would have been impossible.

However, in most real-world applications the particle sizes are distributed continuously. In this paper, a well-studied one-dimensional kinematic model for batch sedimentation of polydisperse suspensions of small equal-density spheres is extended to suspensions with a continuous particle size distribution. For this purpose, the phase density function Φ = Φ(t, x, ξ), where ξ ∈ [0, 1] is the normalized squared size of the particles, is introduced, whose integral with respect to ξ on an interval [ξ 1 , ξ 2 ] is equivalent to the volume fraction at (t, x) occupied by particles of that size range. Combining the Masliyah–Lockett–Bassoon (MLB) model for the solid-fluid relative velocity for each solids species with the concept of phase density function yields a scalar, first-order equation for Φ, namely the equation of the generalized kinetic theory. Three numerical schemes for the solution of this equation are introduced, and a numerical example and an L 1 error study show that one of these schemes introduces less numerical diffusion and less spurious oscillations near discontinuities than the others. Several numerical examples illustrate the simulated behavior of this kind of suspensions. Numerical results also illustrate the solution of an eigenvalue problem associated with the equation of the generalized kinetic theory.",,,Mathematical Models and Methods in Applied Sciences,,,,2008-10,2008,2011-11-21,2008-10,18,10,1741-1785,Closed,Article,"BÜRGER, RAIMUND; GARCIA, ANTONIO; KUNIK, MATTHIAS","BÜRGER, RAIMUND (Departamento de Ingeniería Matemática, Facultad de Ciencias Físicas y Matemáticas, Universidad de Concepción, Casilla 160-C, Concepción, Chile); GARCIA, ANTONIO (Departamento de Ingeniería Metalúrgica, Facultad de Ingeniería y Ciencias Geológicas, Universidad Católica del Norte, Avenida Angamos 0610, Antofagasta, Chile); KUNIK, MATTHIAS (Institut für Analysis und Numerik, Fakultät für Mathematik, Universität Magdeburg, Universitätsplatz 2, D-39106 Magdeburg, Germany)",,"BÜRGER, RAIMUND (University of Concepción); GARCIA, ANTONIO (Catholic University of the North); KUNIK, MATTHIAS (Otto-von-Guericke University Magdeburg)",17,1,,4.11,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1062963066,49 Mathematical Sciences; 4901 Applied Mathematics,
162,pub.1036766172,10.1016/j.jsames.2008.03.004,,,The time-space distribution of Eocene to Miocene magmatism in the central Peruvian polymetallic province and its metallogenetic implications,"Eocene to late Miocene magmatism in the central Peruvian high-plain (approx. between Cerro de Pasco and Huancayo; Lats. ∼10.2–12°S) and east of the Cordillera Occidental is represented by scattered shallow-level intrusions as well as subaerial domes and volcanic deposits. These igneous rocks are calc-alkalic and range from basalt to rhyolite in composition, and many of them are spatially, temporally and, by inference, genetically associated with varied styles of major polymetallic mineralization. Forty-four new 40Ar–39Ar and three U/Pb zircon dates are presented, many for previously undated intrusions. Our new time constraints together with data from the literature now cover most of the Cenozoic igneous rocks of this Andean segment and provide foundation for geodynamic and metallogenetic research. The oldest Cenozoic bodies are of Eocene age and include dacitic domes to the west of Cerro de Pasco with ages ranging from 38.5 to 33.5Ma. South of the Domo de Yauli structural dome, Eocene igneous rocks occur some 15km east of the Cordillera Occidental and include a 39.34±0.28Ma granodioritic intrusion and a 40.14±0.61Ma rhyolite sill, whereas several diorite stocks were emplaced between 36 and 33Ma. Eocene mineralization is restricted to the Quicay high-sulfidation epithermal deposit some 10km to the west of Cerro de Pasco. Igneous activity in the earliest Oligocene was concentrated up to 70km east of the Cordillera Occidental and is represented by a number of granodioritic intrusions in the Milpo–Atacocha area. Relatively voluminous early Oligocene dacitic to andesitic volcanism gave rise to the Astabamba Formation to the southeast of Domo de Yauli. Some stocks at Milpo and Atacocha generated important Zn–Pb (–Ag) skarn mineralization. After about 29.3Ma, magmatism ceased throughout the study region. Late Oligocene igneous activity was restricted to andesitic and dacitic volcanic deposits and intrusions around Uchucchacua (approx. 25Ma) and felsic rocks west of Tarma (21–20Ma). A relationship between the Oligocene intrusions and polymetallic mineralization at Uchucchacua is possible, but evidence remains inconclusive. Widespread magmatism resumed in the middle Miocene and includes large igneous complexes in the Cordillera Occidental to the south of Domo de Yauli, and smaller scattered intrusive centers to the north thereof. Ore deposits of modest size are widely associated with middle Miocene intrusions along the Cordillera Occidental, north of Domo de Yauli. However, small volcanic centers were also active up to 50km east of the continental divide and include dacitic dikes and domes, spatially associated with major base and precious metal mineralization at Cerro de Pasco and Colquijirca. Basaltic volcanism (14.54±0.49Ma) is locally observed in the back-arc domain south of Domo de Yauli approximately 30km east of the Cordillera Occidental. After about 10Ma intrusive activity decreased throughout Central Perú and ceased between 6 and 5Ma. Late Miocene magmatism was locally related to important mineralization including San Cristobal (Domo de Yauli), Huarón and Yauricocha. Overall, there is no evidence for a systematic eastward migration of the magmatic arc through time. The arc broadened in the late Eocene to early Oligocene, and thereafter ceased over wide areas until the early Miocene, when magmatism resumed in a narrow arc. A renewed widening and subsequent cessation of the arc occurred in the late middle and late Miocene. The pattern of magmatism probably reflects two cycles of flattening of the subduction in the Oligocene and late Miocene. Contrasting crustal architecture between areas south and north of Domo de Yauli probably account for the differences in the temporal and aerial distribution of magmatism in these areas. Ore deposits are most abundant between Domo de Yauli and Cerro de Pasco and were generally emplaced in the middle and late Miocene during the transition to flat subduction and prior to cessation of the arc. Eocene to early Oligocene mineralization also occurred, but was restricted to a broad east–west corridor from Uchucchacua to Milpo–Atacocha, indicating a major upper-plate metallogenetic control.","The results presented herein are part of the outcomes of a three year MDRU project entitled “Sources and Exhausts in Polymetallic Carbonate Rock-hosted Ore Deposits”.

Fault activity is expressed as a group of fault scarps and fault-bend fold scarps whose orientation defines three main domains WNW-ESE, N-S and NNW-SSE.

The avenues and plazas of Mexico City, Havana, Santo Domingo, Caracas, Bogotaì, São Paulo, Lima, Santiago, and Buenos Aires have been the backdrop for extraordinary, history-making events. While some argue that public spaces are a prerequisite for the expression, representation and reinforcement of democracy, they can equally be used in the pursuit of totalitarianism. Indeed, public spaces, in both the past and present, have been the site for the contestation by ordinary people of various stances on democracy and citizenship. By exploring the use and meaning of public spaces in Latin American cities, this book sheds light on contemporary definitions of citizenship and democracy in the Americas.",,,,,,,2008-01-17,2008,2008-01-17,,,,,Closed,Monograph,"Irazábal, Clara","Irazábal, Clara ()",,"Irazábal, Clara ()",58,5,,9.51,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1129093963,"44 Human Society; 4406 Human Geography; 47 Language, Communication and Culture",11 Sustainable Cities and Communities

In response, the Civil Union Act 17 of 2006 came into operation on 30 November 2006. This Act provides for the solemnization and registration of a civil union in the form of either a marriage or a civil partnership. While it can be accepted that the Act allows persons of the same sex to conclude a civil union, the position of heterosexual persons appears to be less certain – a situation which requires urgent attention due to the lack of legal protection currently afforded to cohabitants who have not formalized their relationships. This problem is exacerbated by a number of anomalies created by judicial intervention (prior to the promulgation of the Act), in terms of which certain benefits of civil marriages were extended to same-sex unmarried couples while their heterosexual counterparts were left out in the cold. After elucidating the interpretative difficulties caused by the Act, attempting to shed some light on a number of the anomalies alluded to above and briefly analysing the comparable marriage and marriage-like relationships encountered in Dutch law, this contribution concludes that the Civil Union Act is a badly-drafted piece of legislation that has only served to further fragment an already disjointed legal landscape.",,,International Journal of Law Policy and the Family,,,,2008-09-23,2008,2008-09-23,2008-12-01,22,3,356-392,Closed,Article,"Smith, Bradley S.; Robinson, J.

Este libro es un complemento y no tiene como objetivo sustituir los criterios del profesional, pero sí ofrecer elementos para actualizar sus conocimientos y afinar sus habilidades diagnósticas. En el texto se describen numerosas enfermedades desde el componente clínico, histológico y radiográfico en una forma sencilla, logrando así que los temas sean comprendidos y aplicados fácilmente. En la primera parte se expone lo referente a la historia clínica sin un formato predeterminado, pero sí con una secuencia lógica que permita al profesional investigar según sus propias habilidades sin dejar ningún contenido que podría ser de utilidad en el diagnóstico. La segunda parte es una aproximación a las lesiones más prevalentes en la consulta odontológica. No se profundiza en la histopatología porque este texto tiene una finalidad ante todo clínica; lo más importante es lograr identificar una lesión entre un grupo de posibles diagnósticos diferenciales y así determinar el diagnóstico final, apoyado en estudios paraclínicos y el reporte histopatológico.

Is the result a democratic politics of the ballot box, or is it more like an authoritarian politics of command from on high? Does the evangelical faith of the Bible hinder or promote a politics of the ballot box? At a time when the global-political impact of another revivalist and scriptural religion—Islam—fuels vexed debate among analysts the world over, this book aims to offer an unusual comparative perspective on a critical issue: The often combustible interaction of resurgent religion and the developing world's unstable politics. This book considers the case of Latin America, where evangelical Protestantism is increasingly challenging the historical Catholic hegemony in the religious sphere. In Latin America, Protestant identity was forged in relation to the dominant Catholicism, producing an “adversarial” style of Protestantism. This necessarily colors the role of evangelicalism in Latin America civil society. The Introduction to this book offers a historical overview of evangelicalism in the region.

The contributions of this seminal handbook have been commissioned from leading local and global authorities on South America. Authors present the dynamic evolutionary processes of the ancient societies and principal geographical regions of the continent and consider issues such as environmental setting and ecological adaptations, social equality/inequality, identity formation, long-distance/intercultural interaction, religious systems and their material manifestations, ideological orientations, and political and economic organization as these developed over time. The volume is organized thematically to promote and facilitate geographical comparisons, notably between the Andes and greater Amazonia. The bibliography section of each chapter is a valuable research tool in itself for readers wishing to delve deeper into the particular topics under consideration. Of particular merit and originality is the final section dealing with the ethics and practice of archaeology in South America today with each contribution written by a local scholar. This edited work presents long-term research results while simultaneously highlighting the most exciting new research and greatest archaeological problems recently resolved or still awaiting solution. Chapters are written in accessible language and each contribution includes maps and many other figures and photographs to illustrate the text.

We show that single Mn and Mo atom (Co and Os) strongly bind on 2D-GaAs, and induce local out-of-plane (in-plane) magnetic anisotropy. When a pair of TM atoms is adsorbed on 2D-GaAs in a close range from each other, magnetisation properties change (become tunable) with respect to concentrations and ordering of the adatoms. In all cases, we reveal presence of strong Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction.

Still, it remains unclear whether it comes from a deficit in reactive inhibition (ability to stop the action in progress), proactive inhibition (ability to exert preparatory control), or both.We compared the performance of 39 children with ADHD and 42 typically developing children performing a Simon choice reaction time task. The Simon task is a conflict task that is well-adapted to dissociate proactive and reactive inhibition. Beyond classical global measures (mean reaction time, accuracy rate, and interference effect), we used more sophisticated dynamic analyses of the interference effect and accuracy rate to investigate reactive inhibition. We studied proactive inhibition through the congruency sequence effect (CSE).Our results showed that children with ADHD had impaired reactive but not proactive inhibition. Moreover, the deficit found in reactive inhibition seems to be due to both a stronger impulse capture and more difficulties in inhibiting impulsive responses. These findings contribute to a better understanding of how ADHD affects inhibitory control in children.","The authors warmly thank all children who participated in this study and their parents.

This has mainly been interpreted as a difficulty in inhibiting inappropriate responses. However, it could be due to at least two distinct and independent processes, which are often confounded: The activation or suppression of impulsive responses. The aim of the present study was to separate the contribution of these two processes.
METHOD: We compared performance of 26 children with ADHD to that of 26 nonADHD children using a novel approach based on electromyographic activity (EMG) analysis. EMG allows two distinct indices to be computed: Incorrect activation rate, which is an index of the intensity of impulse capture and correction rate, which provides a direct measure of the ability to suppress automatic responses.
RESULTS: Children with ADHD were slower, committed more errors, and had a larger interference effect than nonADHD children. Moreover, we observed a greater incorrect activation rate and a lower correction rate in the ADHD group.
CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that the difficulties in interference control found in children with ADHD are explained by both impaired inhibitory processes and a greater propensity to activate automatic responses.

Using ab initio calculations we show that a room-temperature metallic collinear antiferromagnet RuO_{2} allows for highly efficient spin-current generation, arising from anisotropically spin-split bands with conserved up and down spins along the Néel vector axis. The zero net moment antiferromagnet acts as an electrical spin splitter with a 34° propagation angle between spin-up and spin-down currents. The corresponding spin conductivity is a factor of 3 larger than the record value from a survey of 20 000 nonmagnetic spin-Hall materials.

These places may foment antibiotic-resistance in bacterial bioaerosol (A.R.B.) due to inadequate pharmaceutical waste disposal. This issue may foster the necessity of using last-generation antibiotics with extra costs in the health care system, and deaths. The aim of this study was to reveal the multi-antibiotic resistant bacterial bioaerosol emitted by a sanitary landfill and the surrounding area. We evaluated the influence of environmental conditions in the occurrence of A.R.B. and biological risk assessment. Antibiotic resistance found in the bacteria aerosols was compared with the AWaRE consumption classification. We used the BIOGAVAL method to assess the workers' occupational exposure to antibiotic-resistant bacterial bioaerosols in the landfill. This study confirmed the multi-antibiotic resistant in bacterial bioaerosol in a landfill and in the surrounding area. Obtained mean concentrations of bacterial bioaerosols, as well as antibiotic-resistant in bacterial bioaerosol (A.R.B.), were high, especially for fine particles that may be a threat for human health. Results suggest the possible risk of antibiotic-resistance interchange between pathogenic and non-pathogenic species in the landfill facilities, thus promoting antibiotic multi-resistance genes spreading into the environment.","Morgado-Gamero thank Universidad de la Costa for financial support of the project for the sampling and analysis of all samples.

This syndrome is more prevalent among older individuals, and chronic kidney disease patients, particularly those on dialysis. Dialysis dose is currently standardized for hemodialysis (HD) patients regardless of their age and functional status. However, it has been postulated that the dialysis dose required in older patients, especially frail ones, should be lower, since it could increase their degree of frailty. Then, the purpose of this study was to evaluate if there would be a correlation between the dose of Kt/V and the degree of frailty in a population of adult patients on HD.Materials and methodsA cross-sectional study with 82 patients on HD in Barranquilla (Colombia) and Lobos (Argentina) was conducted. Socio-demographic and laboratory data, as well as dialysis doses (Kt/V) were recorded and scales of fragility, physical activity, gait and grip strength were applied. Then these data were correlated by a Spearman’s correlation and a logistic regression.ResultsCFS, social isolation, physical activity, gait speed, and prehensile strength tests were outside the reference ranges in the studied group. No significant correlation was found between dialysis dose and all the above mentioned functional tests. However, a significant and inverse correlation between physical activity and CFS was documented (score − 1.41 (CI − 2.1 to − 0.7).ConclusionNo significant correlation was documented between Kt/V value and different parameters of the frailty status, but this status correlated significantly and inversely with physical activity in this group.

Despite being one of the most unequal regions of the world, there is a scarce report of the effect of socioeconomic conditions on COVID-19 mortality in their countries. We aimed to identify the effect of some socioeconomic inequality-related factors on COVID-19 mortality in Colombia.
METHODS: We conducted a survival analysis in a nation-wide retrospective cohort study of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Colombia from 2 March 2020 to 26 October 2020. We calculated the time to death or recovery for each confirmed case in the cohort. We used an extended multivariable time-dependent Cox regression model to estimate the HR by age groups, sex, ethnicity, type of health insurance, area of residence and socioeconomic strata.
RESULTS: There were 1 033 218 confirmed cases and 30 565 deaths for COVID-19 in Colombia between 2 March and 26 October. The risk of dying for COVID-19 among confirmed cases was higher in males (HR 1.68 95% CI 1.64 to 1.72), in people older than 60 years (HR 296.58 95% CI 199.22 to 441.51), in indigenous people (HR 1.20 95% CI 1.08 to 1.33), in people with subsidised health insurance regime (HR 1.89 95% CI 1.83 to 1.96) and in people living in the very low socioeconomic strata (HR 1.44 95% CI 1.24 to 1.68).

We evaluated the effectiveness of CT on reducing fatality from COVID-19 in Colombia.
STUDY DESIGN: The study design is a retrospective cohort study with nation-wide data of suspected and confirmed cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2) infection and their registered contacts.
METHODS: We analyzed confirmed and suspected COVID-19 cases and their chains of contact using a nation-wide registry from March 28, 2020 to January 13, 2021. To estimate the effect of CT on fatality, we adjusted a multilevel negative binomial model using the number of deaths and the number of people within a chain of contacts as the outcome variable and offset variable, respectively. Sensitivity analysis was conducted using different cutoff values of contacts traced and a logistic model for the effect of CT on death at an individual level.
RESULTS: We analyzed 1.4 million cases, 542,936 chains of contact, and 46,087 deaths. Only, 5.8% of total cases and contacts were included in a chain of a case and five or more contacts. We found that tracing of at least five contacts per case reduces fatality by 48% (95% confidence interval: 45-51), and, at the current levels of tracing in Colombia, it prevents 1.8% of deaths. Results obtained from the sensitivity analysis were consistent with the reduction of fatality at an individual level and higher protective effect with the higher number of contacts traced.
CONCLUSIONS: In Colombia, tracing of at least five contacts per case reduces fatality from COVID-19. The coverage and intensity of tracing needs to be increased as a strategy to mitigate fatality in Colombia.",,"This study did not have a specific funding grant.

The objective of this systematic review and meta-analysis is to evaluate the correlation between COVID-19 disease and pleural effusion. A rigorous literature search was conducted using multiple databases. All eligible observational studies were included from around the globe. The pooled prevalence and associated 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated using the random effect model. Mantel-Haenszel odds ratios were produced to report overall effect size using random effect models for severity and mortality outcomes. Funnel plots, Egger regression tests, and Begg-Mazumdar's rank correlation test were used to appraise publication bias. Data from 23 studies including 6234 COVID-19 patients was obtained. The overall prevalence of pleural effusion in COVID-19 patients was 9.55% (95% CI, I2  = 92%). Our findings also indicated that the presence of pleural effusions associated with increased risk of severity of disease(OR = 5.08, 95% CI 3.14-8.22, I2  = 77.4%) and mortality due to illness(OR = 4.53, 95% CI 2.16-9.49, I2  = 66%) compared with patients without pleural effusion. Sensitivity analyses illustrated a similar effect size while decreasing the heterogeneity. No significant publication bias was evident in the meta-analysis. The presence of pleural effusion can assist as a prognostic factor to evaluate the risk of worse outcomes in COVID-19 patients hence, it is recommended that hospitalized COVID-19 patients with pleural effusion should be managed on an early basis.",CONFLICT OF INTERESTS The authors declare that there are no conflict of interests.,,Journal of Medical Virology,,,COVID-19; Female; Humans; Male; Pleural Effusion; Prevalence; Prognosis; Severity of Illness Index,2021-09,2021,2021-09,2022-01,94,1,229-239,All OA; Green,Article,"Rathore, Sawai Singh; Hussain, Nabeel; Manju, Ade Harrison; Wen, Qingqing; Tousif, Sohaib; Avendaño‐Capriles, Camilo Andrés; Hernandez‐Woodbine, Maria Jose; Rojas, Gianpier Alonzo; Vatsavayi, Priyanka; Tera, Chenna Reddy; Ali, Muhammad Adnan; Singh, Romil; Saleemi, Shayan; Patel, Deep Manojkumar","Rathore, Sawai Singh (Dr. Sampurnanand Medical College, Jodhpur, Rajasthan, India); Hussain, Nabeel (Saba University School of Medicine, The Bottom, The Netherlands); Manju, Ade Harrison (Clinical Pathology, Faculty of Biochemical Science, University of Yaounde I, Yaounde, Cameroon); Wen, Qingqing (University of California Los Angeles, Fielding School of Public Health, Los Angeles, California, USA); Tousif, Sohaib (Ziauddin Medical university, Karachi, Pakistan); Avendaño‐Capriles, Camilo Andrés (Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); Hernandez‐Woodbine, Maria Jose (Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); Rojas, Gianpier Alonzo (School of Medicine, Universidad Peruana Cayetano Heredia, Lima, Peru); Vatsavayi, Priyanka (Kamineni Institute of Medical Sciences, Nalgonda, Telangana, India); Tera, Chenna Reddy (Kamineni Institute of Medical Sciences, Nalgonda, Telangana, India); Ali, Muhammad Adnan (Jinnah Sindh Medical University, Karachi, Pakistan); Singh, Romil (Department of Critical Care, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota, USA); Saleemi, Shayan (Department of Pulmonology, Aga Khan University Hospital, Karachi, Pakistan); Patel, Deep Manojkumar (Our Lady of Fatima University College of Medicine, Valenzuela City, Philippines)","Rathore, Sawai Singh (Dr. Sampurnanand Medical College, Jodhpur, Rajasthan, India)","Rathore, Sawai Singh (Dr. Sampurnanand Medical College, Jodhpur, Rajasthan, India); Hussain, Nabeel (Saba University School of Medicine, The Bottom, The Netherlands); Manju, Ade Harrison (University of Yaoundé I); Wen, Qingqing (University of California, Los Angeles); Tousif, Sohaib (Ziauddin University); Avendaño‐Capriles, Camilo Andrés (Universidad del Norte); Hernandez‐Woodbine, Maria Jose (Universidad del Norte); Rojas, Gianpier Alonzo (Cayetano Heredia University); Vatsavayi, Priyanka (Kamineni Institute of Dental Sciences); Tera, Chenna Reddy (Kamineni Institute of Dental Sciences); Ali, Muhammad Adnan (Jinnah Sindh Medical University); Singh, Romil (Mayo Clinic); Saleemi, Shayan (Aga Khan University Hospital); Patel, Deep Manojkumar (Our Lady of Fatima University)",23,13,3.54,7.93,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8662249,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1140697048,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3202 Clinical Sciences; 3207 Medical Microbiology,3 Good Health and Well Being

BACKGROUND: ICUs require a differentiated professional profile to provide quality care, and appropriate working conditions, leading to a transformation of care and management practices.
DESIGN: Descriptive multicentre cross-sectional observational study.
METHODS: An online survey was applied to identify both the characteristics of the professional profile and the working conditions. 1,427 ICU nursing professionals were included. RStudio statistical software was used for the analysis of the information. Descriptive statistics were used for the presentation of the results. The STROBE checklist for cross-sectional studies was used in this study.
RESULTS: Only 33.6% of the professionals had a specialisation degree in intensive care. The skills that were most frequently put into practice were communication (68.5%) and care management (78.5%). The most predominant nurse-to-patient ratios were 1:2, and greater than 1:6. 59.1% of the nurses had an indefinite term contract, 38.8% worked 48 hours per week and 49.8% had rotating shifts. Only 50.4% of them received incentives. The average salary ranged between 348 and 1,500 USD. 64.5% of the participants were satisfied with their job.
CONCLUSION: It is necessary to strengthen nurses' professional profile by promoting both postgraduate education and the development of troubleshooting and teamwork skills. It is necessary to standardise the nurse-to-patient ratio, improve wages and increase incentives to achieve greater job satisfaction.
RELEVANCE TO PRACTICE: The knowledge and the improvement of both the professional profile and the work conditions of nurses working in intensive care units will improve the quality of the care given to critical patients and, therefore, the quality of health outcomes.","ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS This study has been funded by Pontificia Universidad Javeriana.

A cross-sectional study was designed, which participated in students between 13 and 17 years. Participants completed the item for being a victim of cyberbullying of the Youth Risk Behavior Survey for high school students designed by the Center for Disease Control of the United States. A total of 1462 students answered the questionnaire (M = 14.4 years, SD = 0.8). 19.6% (n = 287) reported lifetime cyberbullying victimisation. Cyberbullying victimisation was associated with post-traumatic stress disorder risk (OR = 2.05, 95%CI 1.51–2.79), lifetime cigarette smoking (OR = 1.91, 95%CI 1.42–2.57), female gender (OR = 1.68, 95%CI 1.25–2.26), family dysfunction (OR = 1.68, 95%CI 1.18–2.41), and poor-fair health condition (OR = 1.45, 95%CI 1.08–1.95). Being a victim of cyberbullying is frequent among Colombian high-school adolescents. It is associated with post-traumatic stress disorder risk, cigarette smoking, female gender, family dysfunction, and poor-fair general health condition. Longitudinal investigations are needed to measure better the dynamics of cyberbullying and the nature of such associations.","Carlos Arturo Cassiani-Miranda contributed to the study conception and data interpretation and statistical analysis, drafted the article, and revised and approved the final version.

The program is implemented by multidisciplinary teams comprised of psychologists, social workers, and community facilitators, who step in at the individual, family, and community levels. An attempt has been made to determine the effect generated by the timeframe through which professionals have been engaged with the program-filling positions of centrality and betweenness within the networks of information exchange and user referral, including the potential mediating effect from the structure of the egocentric network of implementers in the two aforementioned networks and the moderating effect of the sense of belonging to a team of professionals. Both centrality and betweenness are positional measures describing the location actors occupied within the network structure. Centrality reflects the nominations made and receipt by an actor in a network and is considered an individual indicator of prominence and power. Betweenness shows the times that an actor act as a bridge among two actors in a network and it is considered an indicator of strategic positioning in social networks. An egocentric network is the local structure of relationships that each implementer maintains with his or her direct contacts. In this study, 112 active implementers were included, mostly women (n = 97, 88.2%), who had been working on the program for 16.9 months on average (SD = 14.7). Through conditional process analysis, it has been shown that the time that the implementers have been working on the program and the sense of belonging to the task team are relevant factors that interact with each other toward explaining the level of centrality and betweenness of professionals in the information exchange and user referral networks.","ACKNOWLEDGMENTS We are indebted to Ilse C.

However, haloperidol often causes extrapyramidal motor disorders such as tardive dyskinesia (TD). So far, there is no effective treatment against TD and alternatives for it have been sought. Isoflafones have been studied as neuroprotector and inhibitor of monoamine oxidase enzyme. Thus, the objective is to evaluate the possible protective effect of isoflavones against the induction of involuntary movements induced by haloperidol in an animal model.Methods and resultsMale Wistar rats were treated with haloperidol (1 mg/kg/day) and/or isoflavones (80 mg/kg) for 28 days. Rats were submitted to behavioral evaluation to quantify vacuous chewing movements (VCM) and locomotor activity. In addition, the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines were measured in the striatum. Haloperidol treatment reduced the locomotor activity and increased the number of VCM in rats. Co-treatment with isoflavones was able to reverse hypolocomotion and reduce the number of VCM. Besides, haloperidol caused significant increase in the proinflammatory cytokines (interleukin-1β:IL-1β, tumor necrosis factor-α: TNF-α and IL-6 and the co-treatment with isoflavones was able to reduce the levels of IL-1β and TNF-α, but not IL-6.ConclusionsIt is believed that the beneficial effect found with this alternative treatment is related to its anti-inflammatory potential and to the action on estrogen receptors (based on scientific literature findings). Finally, further studies are needed to elucidate the mechanisms of isoflavones in reducing motor disorders induced by antipsychotics.",We acknowledge Universidade Franciscana for Izaviany Schmitz da Silva’s scientific initiation grant (PIBIC-UFN).

The authors discuss the risk and predisposing factors for suicidal ideation among mental health patients in four developing countries (Bangladesh, Colombia, India and Pakistan), this aims to grasp the heterogeneity of these motivators and to elaborate specific interventions regarding suicide in the COVID-19 pandemic.
METHODS: We searched PubMed, Medline, and Google Scholar through March, 2021 for articles using a combination of the keywords and generic terms for suicide, suicide ideation, COVID-19, developing countries, low-middle-income countries, Sociocultural factors, Suicidal behavior, predisposing factors and predictive factors, for articles in English language only, and without publication time restriction.
RESULTS: This narrative review summarizes the sociocultural risk and predisposing factors for suicidal behavior in developing countries during the COVID-19 pandemic. The findings reveal those factors such as fear of being infected, growing economic pressure, lack of resources due to lockdown are mostly responsible in the four countries for the current increase in suicides. There are a few cultural differences that are specified in the narrative.
CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic is a public health challenge, in which prevention and intervention of suicidal behavior have been suboptimal, especially in low-middle-income countries. Based on literature results, we provide practical suggestions (e.g., reducing infodemic, specialized helplines, improving mental health services availability) in order to tackle main challenges of suicide prevention, such as lack of adequate manpower, fragile health system and poverty.",None.,No funding was provided for this work.,L Encéphale,,,COVID-19; Communicable Disease Control; Developing Countries; Humans; Pandemics; Risk Factors; SARS-CoV-2; Suicidal Ideation,2021-09-23,2021,2021-09-23,2022-02,48,1,78-82,All OA; Green,Article,"Shoib, Sheikh; Buitrago, Juan Evangelista Tercero Gaitán; Shuja, Kanwar Hamza; Aqeel, Muhammad; de Filippis, Renato; Abbas, Jaffar; Ullah, Irfan; Yasir Arafat, S M","Shoib, Sheikh (Psychiatric Department, Jawar Lal Nehru Memorial Hospital, Rainawari Srinagar, Jammu and Kashmir, 190003, India); Buitrago, Juan Evangelista Tercero Gaitán (CEO, Grupo T.E.C.

The purpose of this study was to assess the relationships between alcohol consumption, PA, and BMI in Hispanic adults.MethodsIn this secondary data analysis of a Mexican-American cohort, we collected self-reported PA, alcohol consumption, and demographics, and measured height and weight. Linear regression assessed the association between PA and alcohol consumption with BMI, controlling for covariates. Total sample for analyses was n = 3897.ResultsWe found an inverse relationship between high PA and BMI in the full sample (adjusted estimate = − 0.03, 95% CI − 0.07, − 0.01) and in females, but not males. We also found an inverse relationship between current alcohol use and BMI in the full sample (adjusted estimate = − 0.05, 95% CI − 0.09, − 0.01) and both sexes. There was no significant interaction between PA and alcohol use on BMI.ConclusionsIn this study of Mexican-origin adults, current alcohol use and high PA were associated with lower BMIs, but there was no interaction between PA and alcohol use. These results can be used to inform multiple behavior change interventions in Mexican-origin adults.","We thank Gary Deyter for the editorial assistance, and Kplola Y Elhor Gbito for assistance with revisions.","This research was supported, in part, by the Cancer Prevention and Research Institute of Texas (RP170259), by MD Anderson’s Cancer Center Support Grant (CA016672), and by the Prevent Cancer Foundation.

Similar trends have been identified in developed countries, and positive changes have been made.
METHODS: We conducted a narrative review to provide an overview of Colombia's social structure, health care system, and health care delivery in relation to cancer, with recommendations for improving cancer survivorship in Colombia based on the model of survivorship care in the United States.
RESULTS: We proposed general recommendations for improving cancer survivors' care including (1) recognizing cancer survivorship as a distinct phase of cancer, (2) strengthening methods and metrics for tracking cancer survivorship, (3) assessing and monitoring cancer symptoms and quality of life of cancer survivors, (4) publishing evidence-based guidelines considering the social, economic, and cultural characteristics of Colombian population and cancer survivors' specific needs.
CONCLUSION: These recommendations could be used to inform and prioritize health policy development in Colombia related to cancer survivorship outcomes.",The authors would like to thank Dr. John Bellquist in the Cain Center for Nursing Research at the University of Texas at Austin for his editing assistance.,"Funding The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This work was supported by the Universidad Nacional de Colombia strengthening research program with young talent in response to health challenges of vulnerable population (2018–2020) Colciencias (grant number 377, 2019).

3164,pub.1144232888,10.1016/j.jaci.2021.12.777,34968529,,Helminth infections and allergic diseases: Systematic review and meta-analysis of the global literature,"BACKGROUND: There is considerable research interest in the role of helminth infections in the development of allergic diseases. However, findings from previous studies are mixed. Existing systematic reviews of these studies are outdated. We performed a systematic review of the global literature on the association between helminth infections and development and clinical outcomes of allergic diseases.
METHODS: We searched Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, ISI Web of Science, PubMed, Global Index Medicus, Scielo, KoreaMed, Google Scholar, and Lilacs for studies published up to January 2020. We included observational epidemiological studies (cohort, case-control, and cross-sectional studies) of children and adults reporting associations between helminth infections and asthma, allergic rhinitis, eczema, and atopy. We performed random-effects meta-analysis to summarize the effect estimates.
RESULTS: We included 80 studies with 99,967 participants. In the meta-analyses, we did not observe an overall association between helminth infections and allergic diseases. There was, however, evidence that Ascaris lumbricoides infections were associated with an increased risk of bronchial hyperreactivity in children (risk ratio, 1.41; 95% CI, 1.17-1.70; I2 = 50; P for I2 = .09), and were associated with an increased risk of atopy among helminth-infected adults (risk ratio, 1.37; 95% CI, 1.18-1.61; I2 = 52; P for I2 = .02). We found no study that addressed the association between helminth infection and clinical outcomes of allergic diseases. The overall strength of the underlying evidence was low to moderate.
CONCLUSIONS: Helminth infections may increase the risk of bronchial hyperreactivity in children and atopy in adults. Well-designed longitudinal cohorts may help clarify potential causal associations between chronic helminth infections and allergic diseases.","We acknowledge Professor João Costa, of the Portuguese Collaborating Center of the IberoAmerican Cochrane Network, Faculty of Medicine, University of Lisbon, Portugal, for his willingness to assist with planned searches for this systematic review in Cochrane Library.",This work was developed without any funding support or financial source.

                    This study aims to evaluate the impact breaking energy of the parts manufactured by the fused filament fabrication (FFF) method. The evaluation considers the use of the epoxy resin coating, different materials and different printing orientations.
                  
                  
                    Design/methodology/approach
                    The authors developed an experimental statistical design using 54 experimental trials. The experiments’ output variable is the impact break energy of the parts manufactured by the FFF method. The input variables for the experiments consist of an epoxy resin coating (XTC-3D®, generic resin and without resin coating), different filament materials (nylon + carbon fiber, polyethylene terephthalate and polycarbonate) and different printing orientations (flat, edge and vertical) used. The authors carried out the tests following the EN ISO 179-1.
                  
                  
                    Findings
                    The use of resin coating has a significant influence on the impact energy of parts manufactured using the FFF method. The resin coating increases the impact resistance of parts processed by FFF by almost 100% of the value as compared to the parts without a resin coating. Post-processing is useful on ductile materials and increases impact breaking energy at weak print orientations.
                  
                  
                    Originality/value
                    This research opens a new opportunity to improve the mechanical properties of parts manufactured using the FFF method. The use of a resin coating reinforces the parts in weak print orientation.","This work was supported by the Universidad del Norte and the call for proposal of Colciencias No. 727 and 753, and also by the Universidad del Atlántico by call for proposal RES001735.

This affects light penetration, which in turn influences Chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) concentration and primary productivity. We used MODIS imagery to identify spatio-temporal patterns of sea surface salinity, temperature, and Chl-a concentrations from 2003 to 2017, to explore relationships between these variables and oceanographic factors, such as streamflows, winds and currents in the mouth of Colombia's Magdalena River, which discharges to the Caribbean Sea. Sea surface salinity (SSS) in the study zone varied in time and space from estuarine to marine. Mean SSS was 10.8 ± 3.4 at Bocas de Ceniza, and 28.4 ± 0.4 in the Caribbean Sea, with the horizontal salinity gradient providing evidence for the existence of a salinity plume. Mean monthly sea surface temperatures (SST) averaged across all years were 27.6 ± 1.5 °C at Bocas de Ceniza, and 27.6 ± 1.3 °C in the Caribbean Sea. A significant, increasing trend in temperature was observed throughout the years of the study period. Average Chl-a values were 3.3 ± 1.4 mg m−3 at Bocas de Ceniza, and 1.5 ± 1.2 mg m−3 in the Caribbean Sea and the calculated average Trophic State Index (TSI) for Bocas de Ceniza indicated that the estuary trophic state varied between oligo-mesotrophic (30 < TSI≤40) and mesotrophic (40 < TSI≤50). The highest concentrations of Chl-a were found in intermediate salinities in the estuarine zone. Outside the saline plume, there is a considerable decrease in Chl-a concentrations (<0.5 mg m−3).

The approximate solution for the mathematical model, including transient heat and mass transfer equations in cylindrical coordinates, was obtained by implementing the Crank-Nicholson approach in a finite difference scheme. Geometrical configuration and physical parameters, including bed material thermal properties and TGA-based kinetic modeling for reaction rate estimation, were used as model data inputs to predict thermal bed distribution, heat flows, and coefficient of performance for a refrigeration system. Results from the model were validated with transient data from a chemical sorption refrigeration test bench. Refrigeration system reactor was made of expanded graphite/activated carbon/lithium chloride (AC/EG/LiCl)-adsorbent (NH3 in solution with a 25% concentration). The model demonstrated excellent agreement and an adequate representation of the physical phenomena, constituting a potential tool for efficiency-enhancing development of adsorption reactors for refrigeration systems.","The authors would like to acknowledge to the Ministry of science, technology and Innovation of Colombia for the support given within the framework of the program “Formación de Capital Humano de Alto Nivel” from Norte de Santander department, and the program “Es tiempo de volver”.",,Applied Thermal Engineering,,,,2021-02,2021,,2021-02,184,,116281,All OA; Green,Article,"Pérez, Eduar; Romero, Iván; Albis, Alberto; Carmona, Mauricio","Pérez, Eduar (Mechanical Engineering Department, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); Romero, Iván (Mechanical Engineering Department, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); Albis, Alberto (Faculty of Engineering, Universidad del Atlántico, Barranquilla, Colombia); Carmona, Mauricio (Mechanical Engineering Department, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia)","Carmona, Mauricio (Universidad del Norte)","Pérez, Eduar (Universidad del Norte); Romero, Iván (Universidad del Norte); Albis, Alberto (University of Atlántico); Carmona, Mauricio (Universidad del Norte)",6,2,,0.82,https://repositorio.ufps.edu.co/bitstream/ufps/1671/1/Modeling%20and%20experiments%20on%20a%20finned%20cylindrical%20reactor%20with%20expanded%20graphite-activated%20carbon-lithium%20chloride-ammonia%20for%20chemisorption%20refrigeration%20systems.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1132960873,40 Engineering; 4004 Chemical Engineering,7 Affordable and Clean Energy

METHODS: We searched seven databases for relevant peer-reviewed articles published between 1 January 2010 and 25 April 2019. Our inclusion criteria required that the study included age-disaggregated data on adolescents, and focused and assessed mental health outcomes associated with pregnancy or sexually transmitted infections. We extracted data on the specific health event, the mental health outcome and the method of measuring this, and comparisons with other age groups.
FINDINGS: After initially screening 10 818 articles by title and abstract, we included 96 articles in our review. We observed that a wide-ranging prevalence of mental ill-health has been reported for adolescents. However, most studies of mental health during pregnancy did not identify an increased risk of depression or other mental disorders among adolescents compared with other age groups. In contrast, the majority of studies conducted during the postpartum period identified an increased risk of depression in adolescents compared with other age groups. Three studies reported on mental health outcomes following abortion, with varying results. We found no studies of the effect of sexually transmitted infections on mental health among adolescents.
CONCLUSION: We recommend that sexual and reproductive health services should be accessible to adolescents to address their needs and help to prevent any adverse mental health outcomes.",,"The study was funded by the UNDP-UNFPA-UNICEF-WHO-World Bank Special Programme of Research, Development and Research Training in Human Reproduction, a co-sponsored programme executed by WHO.

This inefficient way of using conductors in a transmission line can be overcome if the electrical frequency at which energy is transmitted is reduced. This is why this work focuses on the comparison of the Modular Multilevel Matrix Converter (MMMC) and the Back-to-Back Modular Multilevel Converter (BTB-MMC), topologies that have shown qualities as frequency converters. For comparison, an analytical model of each topology is used to relate design considerations to their operational variables. Among the aspects to be compared are, the requirements of the semiconductors, the required reactive components, operating losses and fault tolerance.

However, it is important to assess differences in the territory. This study aimed to analyze the associations between the risk of developing Type 2 Diabetes (T2D) and setting in the Colombian north coast in 2017. Methods: This cross-sectional study included 1005 subjects. It was set-up with secondary sources of urban community and rural-indigenous population. The interaction terms were evaluated as well as the counfounders. Then, adjusted binary logistic regression were used to estimate odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). Results: subjects with a high risk of T2D are more likely to belong to the urban setting (OR=1.908; 95%CI=1.201-2.01) compared with those with lower T2D after adjusting for age, Body Mass Index (BMI), physical activity, history of high levels of glycemia, and diabetes in relatives.

We consider languages to be also complex adaptive systems. Hence, we analyzed the hierarchical organization of historical syntactic networks from German that were created from a corpus of texts from the 11th to 17th centuries. We tracked the emergence of syntactic structures in these networks and mapped them to specific communicative needs. We named these emerging structures communicative hierarchies. We hypothesise that the communicative needs of speakers are the organizational force of syntax. We propose that the emergence of these multiple communicative hierarchies is what shapes syntax, and that these hierarchies are the prerequisite to the Zipf's law. The emergence of communicative hierarchies indicates that the objective of language evolution is not only to increase the efficiency of transferring information. Language is also evolving to increase our capacity to communicate more sophisticated abstractions as we advance as a species.",,,Research Square,,,,2021-12-06,2021,2021-12-06,,,,,All OA; Green,Preprint,"Ravandi, Babak; Concu, Valentina","Ravandi, Babak (Northeastern University); Concu, Valentina (Universidad del Norte)",,"Ravandi, Babak (Northeastern University); Concu, Valentina (Universidad del Norte)",0,0,,0.0,https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-1141072/latest.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1143663782,"47 Language, Communication and Culture; 4704 Linguistics",

En este informe, se afirma que la pandemia fue aprovechada por los grupos armados en dos sentidos. Por un lado, permitió que reforzaran los órdenes sociales que habían construido previamente. El establecimiento de cuarentenas obligatorias en muchas subregiones dio lugar a que los grupos armados se asumieran como autoridades sanitarias (ante la débil presencia estatal) y establecieran toques de queda o, incluso, nuevas cuarentenas con el objetivo de evitar el esparcimiento del virus. Así, lograron consolidar su presencia territorial y asumir funciones de autoridad sanitaria que no tenían previamente. Es decir: aumentaron su capacidad de control. Por otro lado, en la pandemia los grupos armados han reutilizado modalidades de violencia que no habían sido registradas con tanta intensidad, tales como las masacres y secuestros, y darle continuidad a otras que se han mantenido consistentemente durante los últimos tres años (asesinato de defensores de Derechos Humanos, líderes comunitarios y firmantes del PNIS).English Abstract: Despite the pandemic generated by the new coronavirus, 2020 was the year with the most violence stemming from armed conflict since 2018. In this report, it is stated that the pandemic was exploited by armed groups in two ways. On the one hand, it allowed them to reinforce the social orders they had previously constructed. The establishment of mandatory quarantines in many subregions led the armed groups to assume the role of health authorities (in the face of a weak state presence) and to establish curfews or even new quarantines in order to prevent the spread of the virus. In this way, they were able to consolidate their territorial presence and assume health authority functions that they did not previously have. In other words, they increased their control capacity. On the other hand, during the pandemic the armed groups have reused forms of violence that had not been recorded with such intensity, such as massacres and kidnappings, and have given continuity to others that have been consistently maintained during the last three years (assassination of human rights defenders, community leaders and signatories of the PNIS).",,,SSRN Electronic Journal,,,,2021,2021,,,,,,All OA; Green,Preprint,"Trejos, Luis; Badillo, Reynell","Trejos, Luis (Universidad del Norte); Badillo, Reynell (Asistente del Centro de Pensamiento UNCaribe; Universidad del Norte)",,"Trejos, Luis (Universidad del Norte); Badillo, Reynell (Asistente del Centro de Pensamiento UNCaribe; Universidad del Norte)",1,0,,0.78,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1134902929,44 Human Society; 4404 Development Studies; 48 Law and Legal Studies,"16 Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions"

communities remains a challenge for tropical ecology, yet is
increasingly urgent as some long-term studies have shown major declines
in bird communities even in relatively undisturbed sites. In 1982,
Terborgh et al. quantified the structure and organization of the bird
community in a 97-ha. plot in southeastern Peru. We revisited the same
plot in 2018 and repeated the same intense combination of methodologies
as the original study in order to evaluate community-wide changes.
Contrary to the results from studies elsewhere, we found little change
in bird distribution and abundance within the plot, although there were
some declines related to loss of mixed-species flocks with a high level
of species interdependence. This apparent stability suggests that
large-scale forest reserves such as Manu National Park may provide the
conditions necessary for establishing refugia from at least some of the
effects of global change on birds.",,,Authorea,,,,2021-07-19,2021,2021-07-19,,,,,All OA; Green,Preprint,"Martinez, Ari; Ponciano, Jose; Gomez, Juan; Valqui, Thomas; Novoa, Jorge; Camerlenghi, Ettore; Carnes, Blaine; Parra, Eliseo; Fitzpatrick, John; Robinson, Scott K.; Socolar, Jacob; Terborgh, John","Martinez, Ari (California State University Long Beach); Ponciano, Jose (University of Florida); Gomez, Juan (Universidad del Norte); Valqui, Thomas (Universidad Nacional Agraria La Molina Facultad de Ciencias Forestales); Novoa, Jorge (CORBIDI); Camerlenghi, Ettore (Monash University); Carnes, Blaine (California State University System); Parra, Eliseo (San Francisco State University); Fitzpatrick, John (Cornell University); Robinson, Scott K.

By comparison, portable WIM systems are cost effective and much easier to install at any desired highway site/location. However, accuracy, reliability, and data quality have been some of the key challenges of portable WIM systems. As a means of addressing these challenges, this field pilot study was undertaken to comparatively evaluate two different sensor installation methods for routine traffic data measurements: the pocket tape and metal plate methods. The two methods were comparatively evaluated in terms of their practicality, simplicity of installation, cost effectiveness, resource/manpower needs, environmental sensitivity and endurance, consistency, data accuracy, and statistical reliability of the traffic data measurements. Along with a side-by-side field validation using permanent WIM data, the findings from the study indicated that the metal plate sensor installation method is superior to the pocket tape method, particularly in terms of data accuracy, data quality, statistical reliability, and endurance. Its traffic data accuracy rate was found to be 87∼91 % compared with 79 % for the pocket tape method, which exhibited a significant loss of sensitivity and data accuracy after 7 d of traffic measurements. Overall, the conclusions of this study provide technical merit and preference to the metal plate method over the pocket tape sensor installation method, particularly for traffic data measurements exceeding 7 d.",,,Journal of Testing and Evaluation,,,,2021-05-01,2021,2021-05-01,2021-05-01,49,3,1999-2016,All OA; Green,Article,"Walubita, Lubinda F.; Mahmoud, Enad; Fuentes, Luis; Komba, Julius J.; Teshale, Eyoab Zegeye; Faruk, Abu N.

This work presents experimental results for the so-called top-lit updraft fixed bed reactor, in which the ignition front starts at the top and propagates downward while the gas product flows upwards. The study focuses on the ignition front propagation velocity for the co-thermochemical conversion of palm kernel shell and high-volatile bituminous coal. Within the range of assessed air superficial velocities, the process occurred under gasification and near stoichiometric conditions. Under gasification conditions increasing coal particle size from 7.1 to 22 mm decreased ignition front velocity by around 26% regardless of the coal volume percentage. Furthermore, increasing coal volume percentage and decreasing coal particle size result in product gas with higher energy content. For the operation near stoichiometric conditions, increasing coal volume percentage from 10 to 30% negatively affected the ignition front velocity directly proportional to its particle size. Additional experiments confirmed a linear dependence of ignition front velocity on air superficial velocity. Further steps in the development of the top-lit updraft technology are implementing continuous solids feeding and variable cross-sectional area and optimizing coal particle size distribution.",MINCIENCIAS supported this work through the Ph.D. National Scholarship Becas Bicentenario 2019 Contract UN-OJ-2020-47414.

No vaccines against this virus are currently available. RSV infection of a cell is initiated by fusion between the virion membrane and a cellular membrane, but it is not clear if the fusion process takes place at the plasma membrane or within an endosome. Most such experiments have been initiated at the traditional synchronization temperature of 4°C, an abnormal temperature for animal cells and one at which cellular homeostasis may be negatively affected. We have compared two synchronization temperatures (4°C and 22°C) to determine the kinetics of RSV entry into human bronchial epithelial cells. Following inoculation, virus entry was halted at different times by the addition of neutralizing antibody or temperature reduction to 4°C. We engineered a virus that encodes an extra viral gene, beta-lactamase fused to the viral phosphoprotein (P), to enable rapid detection after infection initiation. We found that the synchronization temperature used during inoculation determines the site of fusion. Transition from 4°C to 37°C resulted in RSV entry via the endosomal pathway but also induced F-actin disruption and plasma membrane blebbing, whether the cells were inoculated with RSV or not. Transition from 22°C to 37°C resulted in RSV entry by fusion at the plasma membrane and without the F-actin and plasma membrane disruptions. These results suggest that RSV normally enters cells by fusion at the plasma membrane and that the induction of endocytosis by infection synchronization at 4°C may be an artefact caused by distortion of the plasma membrane-supporting cytoskeleton.  Author Summary In order to understand the overall mechanism driving infection, it is important to determine how the virus enters cells. The pathway that RSV uses to infect cells is unclear. It is a common practice to attach the virions at 4°C to synchronize the viral infection. In this report, we found that warming up primary cultures of undifferentiated normal human bronchial epithelial cells to 37°C from 4°C triggered dramatic changes in their cell membrane and cytoskeleton totally unrelated to the presence of the virions. The assessment of viral content delivery to the cytoplasm using RSV engineered to express BlaM allowed us to find that the virions attached at 4°C or 22°C fused their envelope with endosome or plasma membrane, respectively. Consequently, the entry via endosome after attachment at 4°C is an experimental artefact and RSV infects by fusing its envelope with the plasma membrane. The implications go beyond RSV since the entry of several virus species have been explored by synchronizing the infection after attachment at 4°C.",Research reported in this publication was supported by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases of the National Institutes of Health under Award Number R01AI110385 (HS) and R01 AI093848 (MEP).

Ataxia with Ocular Apraxia type 1 (AOA1) (OMIM: 606350.0006) is characterized by slowly progressive symptoms of childhood-onset and pathogenic mutations in APTX; the only known cause underpinning AOA1. APTX encodes the protein Aprataxin, composed of three domains sharing homology with proteins involved in DNA damage, signaling, and repair. We present four siblings from an endogamic family in a rural, isolated town of Colombia with ataxia and ocular apraxia of childhood-onset and confirmed molecular diagnosis of AOA1, homozygous for the W279* p.Trp279Ter mutation. We predicted the mutated APTX with Alpha Fold to demonstrate the effects of this stop-gain mutation that deletes three beta helices encoded by amino acid 270 to 339 rescinding the C2H2-type zinc fingers (Znf) (C2H2 Znf) DNA-binding and DNA-repair domain and the whole tridimensional structure of the APTX. All siblings exhibited different ages of onset (4, 6, 8, and 11 y/o) and heterogeneous patterns of dysarthria (ranging from absence to mild-moderate dysarthria). Neuropsychological evaluation showed no neurocognitive impairment in three siblings, but one sibling showed temporospatial disorientation, semantic and phonologic fluency impairment, episodic memory affection, constructional apraxia, moderate anomia, low executive function, and symptoms of depression. This heterogeneous phenotype suggests genetic interactions can shape the natural history of AOA1. To our knowledge, this report represents the most extensive series of siblings affected with AOA1 in Latin America, and the genetic analysis completed adds important knowledge to outline this family’s disease and general complex phenotype of hereditary ataxias.",,,Research Square,,,,2021-11-10,2021,2021-11-10,,,,,All OA; Green,Preprint,"Aguillon, David; Vasquez, Daniel; Madrigal, Lucia; Moreno, Sonia; Hernández, Dora; Isaza-Ruget, Mario; Lopez, Juan Javier; Landires, Ivan; Nuñez-Samudio, Virginia; Restrepo, Carlos M; Vidal, Oscar M; Velez, Jorge I; Arcos-Holzinger, Mauricio; Lopera, Francisco; Arcos-Burgos, Mauricio","Aguillon, David (Universidad de Antioquía: Universidad de Antioquia); Vasquez, Daniel (Universidad de Antioquía: Universidad de Antioquia); Madrigal, Lucia (Universidad de Antioquía: Universidad de Antioquia); Moreno, Sonia (Universidad de Antioquía: Universidad de Antioquia); Hernández, Dora (Universidad de Antioquía: Universidad de Antioquia); Isaza-Ruget, Mario (Sanitas University Foundation School of Medicine: Fundacion Universitaria Sanitas Facultad de Medicina); Lopez, Juan Javier (Sanitas University Foundation School of Medicine: Fundacion Universitaria Sanitas Facultad de Medicina); Landires, Ivan (Instituto de Ciencias Medicas); Nuñez-Samudio, Virginia (instituto de Ciencias Medicas); Restrepo, Carlos M (Universidad Del Rosario); Vidal, Oscar M (Universidad del Norte); Velez, Jorge I (Universidad del Norte); Arcos-Holzinger, Mauricio (Universidad de Antioquia); Lopera, Francisco (Universidad de Antioquia); Arcos-Burgos, Mauricio (Universidad de Antioquia)",,"Aguillon, David (University of Antioquia); Vasquez, Daniel (University of Antioquia); Madrigal, Lucia (University of Antioquia); Moreno, Sonia (University of Antioquia); Hernández, Dora (University of Antioquia); Isaza-Ruget, Mario (Sanitas University Foundation School of Medicine: Fundacion Universitaria Sanitas Facultad de Medicina); Lopez, Juan Javier (Sanitas University Foundation School of Medicine: Fundacion Universitaria Sanitas Facultad de Medicina); Landires, Ivan (Instituto de Ciencias Medicas); Nuñez-Samudio, Virginia (instituto de Ciencias Medicas); Restrepo, Carlos M (Universidad del Rosario); Vidal, Oscar M (Universidad del Norte); Velez, Jorge I (Universidad del Norte); Arcos-Holzinger, Mauricio (University of Antioquia); Lopera, Francisco (University of Antioquia); Arcos-Burgos, Mauricio (University of Antioquia)",0,0,,0.0,https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-1026107/latest.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1142515518,31 Biological Sciences; 3102 Bioinformatics and Computational Biology; 52 Psychology,

Proof-of-concept experiments with our novel and innovative STAtor-Rotor VOrtex Chamber (STARVOC) confirm its advantageous features for the sustainable production of chemicals and fuels. STARVOC is a high-g contactor that uses carrier flow (gas or liquid) tangential injection to drive a rotor attached to low-friction bearings. The vortex chamber inside the rotor contains a secondary phase or phases, such as a solids bed, a liquid layer, or a suspension. Carrier fluid passes through the perforated rotor wall and contacts a densely and uniformly distributed secondary phase with enhanced slip velocities. Experiments focused on pressure profiles, rotor angular velocity, and solids azimuthal velocity. With air as the carrier fluid and different solid particle beds as the secondary phase, STARVOC reached bed azimuthal velocities up to four-fold compared to those reached in Gas-Solid Vortex Units with fully static geometry. These results show its potential to improve interfacial heat and mass transfer rates and take advantage of flow energy and angular momentum. Due to its process intensification capabilities, STARVOC is a promising alternative for the state-of-the-art chemical industry.","The SBO project “Bioleum” (IWT-SBO 130039), supported by the Institute for Promotion of Innovation through Science and Technology in Flanders (IWT), is acknowledged.

As a major component of planetary metallic alloys, its immiscibility with silicates plays a major role in planetary formation and differentiation. Information about these processes can be gained by studying the equilibrium Fe isotope fractionation between metal alloys and molten silicates at conditions of core formation. In particular, recent attention has been paid to 56Fe/54Fe equilibrium isotope fractionation at conditions relevant to Earth's core formation and the influence that light elements (O, H, C, Ni, Si and S) have had in this process. Most of these experimental studies relied on the measurement of Fe isotope fractionation from quenched phases of silicate melts and molten iron alloys. The experimental works are extremely challenging, and may suffer different drawbacks. To overcome this, we use ab-initio computational methods to perform a systematic study of the 56Fe/54Fe equilibrium isotope fractionation in molten and solid Fe1−x S x alloys at conditions of the core formation (60 GPa, 3000 K). We show for the first time, that equilibrium isotope fractionation factors from solid systems can be used as proxies for molten systems with differences between these two methods less than 0.01‰ at the relevant P-T conditions. Additionally, we discuss the effect of sulphur concentration on the equilibrium Fe isotope fractionation and show that although there are some structural changes due to atom substitutions, the wide range of studied concentrations produces β-factors that are constant within ∼0.02‰. Finally, we discuss the implications of our results for the interpretation of recent experiments and the understanding of core crystallisation processes.","This work was performed using Granado-HPC from the Universidad del Norte, SCARF from the STFC of the UK, and the HPC resources from CALMIP (Grant 2020 – P1037).

A detailed laboratory programme was carried out to evaluate the influence of NR on the high-intermediate-low temperature performance, including rheological characterisations and performance-related tests (fatigue cracking, thermal cracking, fracture and permanent deformation resistance). The main findings indicate some beneficial effects of NR on the performance-related response for fatigue and permanent deformation. Additional benefits were observed regarding the fracture strength and the thermal cracking resistance (ΔTc ). The viscoelastic effects of NR produced significant changes in the rheological properties of the base bitumen. Overall, the use of NR at a concentration of up to 7% by weight of bitumen proved to be a reasonable option for use in pavement applications, having more substantial benefits in tropical regions in agreement with its predominant effects on the bitumen modification at intermediate-to-high temperature conditions.","Jarurat Witinapanit expresses deep gratitude for the sponsorship offered by the Thailand government to conduct M.Sc. studies at the University of Nottingham (Grant No. 55003/S4117).

UNICEF partnered with USAID to address this important gap by investing in an advance purchase commitment (APC) mechanism to accelerate the development and availability of Zika diagnostics. A central pillar of this initiative was a process for rigorous test evaluations.Methods: A network of EU-funded ZikaPLAN sites in Africa, Asia, Latin America with access to well-characterized clinical specimens were selected to evaluate rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) for the detection of antibodies against Zika virus (ZIKV), chikungunya virus (CHIKV), yellow fever virus (YFV), and dengue virus (DENV) using a standardised protocol. Evaluation panels included Zika specimens collected during acute and convalescent stages of ZIKV outbreaks and specimens that assess potential cross-reactive antibody responses.Findings: Of five Zika RDTs evaluated, three were found to meet criteria for UNICEF procurement. The sensitivity/specificity for ChemBio ZCD system for anti-ZIKV IgM was 79.0%/97.1%, anti-DENV IgM was 90.0%/89.2%, anti-CHIKV IgM was 90.6%/97.2%. The sensitivity and specificity of the test for anti-ZIKV IgM and IgG antibodies was 86.4% and 92.7%, and 82.8% and 59.6%, respectively. The sensitivity/specificity for the SD Biosensor anti-ZIKV IgM was 96.8%/90.8%, anti-DENV IgM was 71.8%/80.7%, the DENV NS1 glycoprotein was 90.0%/90.2%, anti-YFV IgM was 84.6%/98.6%, anti-CHIKV IgM was 86.3%/92.0%.Interpretation: Biobanking networks provide access to specimens that were used to rapidly evaluate diagnostic tests for diseases of epidemic potential and facilitated procurement of tests eligible for procurement by funders.Funding: This work was supported by the USAID grant GHA-G-00-07-00007 and ZikaPLAN (European Union’s Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Programme under Grant Agreement No. 734584).Declaration of Interest: We declare that we have no conflicts of interest.Ethical Approval: All sites have institutional and ethics committee approval for the use of archived left over clinical or surveillance specimens for this evaluation.",,,SSRN Electronic Journal,,,,2021,2021,,,,,,All OA; Green,Preprint,"Boeras, Debra; Diagne, Tidiane; Pelegrino, Jose Luis; Grandadam, Marc; Duong, Veasna; Dussart, Philippe; Brey, Paul; Ruiz, Didye; Adati, Marisa; Wilder-Smith, Annelies; Falconar, Andrew K.; Romero, Claudia M.; Guzman, Maria; Hasanin, Nagwa; Sall, Amadou; Peeling, Rosanna W.","Boeras, Debra (Global Health Impact Group); Diagne, Tidiane (); Pelegrino, Jose Luis (Instituto Pedro Kouri); Grandadam, Marc (Institute Pasteur du Laos); Duong, Veasna (Institute Pasteur du Cambodge); Dussart, Philippe (Institut Pasteur de Madagascar); Brey, Paul (Institute Pasteur du Laos); Ruiz, Didye (Instituto Pedro Kouri); Adati, Marisa (National Institute for Quality Control in Health); Wilder-Smith, Annelies (London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine - Department of Disease Control); Falconar, Andrew K.

The challenge is to select the appropriate process or combination of processes to achieve this based on the wastewater quality. Consequently, the objective of this investigation is to review every technology from conventional through advanced, for reliable and sustainable wastewater treatment and derived sludges, focusing on advantages, disadvantages, and technical gaps for development. Even though there is a wide range of possible technologies, it was evinced that there is huge potential to exploit and make them economically and sustainably viable for waste processing and circular economy, even in the mature massively implemented wastewater treatment technologies in the industry. Overall, we identify that independently from the technology to be studied, the future investigations on every unit, especially on those not vastly implemented, should be focused on: (1) The capacity in removing selected pollutants and decreasing impurities, (2) energy efficiency, (3) environmental safety, (4) economic viability, (5) hybrid processes, and (6) sustainability by waste processing.",,,Research Square,,,,2021-12-17,2021,2021-12-17,,,,,All OA; Green,Preprint,"Mejía, Ricardo; Maturana, Aymer; Gómez, Diego; Quintero, Christian; Arismendy, Luis; Cárdenas, Carlos","Mejía, Ricardo (Universidad del Norte); Maturana, Aymer (Universidad del Norte); Gómez, Diego (Universidad del Norte); Quintero, Christian (Universidad del Norte); Arismendy, Luis (Universidad del Norte); Cárdenas, Carlos (Universidad del Norte)",,"Mejía, Ricardo (Universidad del Norte); Maturana, Aymer (Universidad del Norte); Gómez, Diego (Universidad del Norte); Quintero, Christian (Universidad del Norte); Arismendy, Luis (Universidad del Norte); Cárdenas, Carlos (Universidad del Norte)",2,2,,0.28,https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-1147300/latest.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1143986939,40 Engineering; 4004 Chemical Engineering; 4011 Environmental Engineering,12 Responsible Consumption and Production

These structures induce topological enforced Weyl points on the band intersections. In this work we show that the chirality of each Weyl point is related to the representations of the cyclic group on the bands that form the intersection. To achieve this, we calculate the Picard group of isomorphism classes of complex line bundles over the two-dimensional sphere with cyclic group action, and we show how the chirality (Chern number) relates to the eigenvalues of the rotation action on the rotation invariant points. Then we write an explicit Hamiltonian endowed with a cyclic action whose eigenfunctions restricted to a sphere realize the equivariant line bundles described before. As a consequence of this relation, we determine the chiralities of the nodal points appearing on the hourglass and accordion shape structures on screw invariant lines of the nonsymmorphic materials PI3 (SG: P63), Pd3N (SG: P6322), AgF3 (SG: P6122), and AuF3 (SG: P6122), and we corroborate these results with the Berry curvature and symmetry eigenvalues calculations for the electronic wave function.","The first and the third authors thank the continuous support of the Alexander Von Humboldt Foundation, Germany.

This was unprecedented, given that Colombia was one of the few countries in the world that had a social phenomenon of this magnitude and duration during the largest growth in cases and deaths of the entire pandemic. Objective: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the possible impact of the protests on the transmission of COVID-19 in Colombia based on a previously published analysis, but with a longer observation period and a larger number of cities. Methodology: An interrupted time-series analysis was used for the period April 1 to May 31 for the entire country and 24 capital cities. Results: Cases in Colombia increased by 3,360 additional cases (CI95% =1075 – 5646) 7 days after the protests began. Conclusions: While the causal effect of this event cannot be determined because of the lack of a suitable counterfactual, the evidence found suggests that the social protests were associated with an increase in new COVID-19 cases in Colombia during the study period.

We record the presence of lungfishes ( Lepidosiren ), pacus ( Mylossoma and Piaractus ), armoured catfishes (Callichthyidae), and red‐tail catfishes ( Phractocephalus ). Extant members of all those groups (except the Callichthyidae, due to lack of taxonomic resolution) are found in Amazonian faunas east of the Andes and are absent from faunas west of the Andes, indicating that the riverine systems of the Guajira Peninsula were connected to Amazonia during the middle Miocene. The similarity of La Venta (west of the Andes) and Rio Acre (east of the Andes) fish faunas during the late Miocene further indicates that the northern Andean uplift was not a complete barrier at least until c . 11 Ma. However, there is a continental‐wide structuring of the Miocene fish faunas that is also found in the extant faunas, suggesting that other factors such as ecological conditions, in addition to the uplift of the Andes, have shaped the biogeographic evolution of South American fish faunas.","Acknowledgements We thank Jaime Escobar and Natalia Hoyos (MUN, Universidad del Norte) for allowing access to fossil specimens from the Castilletes Formation and also for their hospitality during a visit to their institution.

that have shown qualities as frequency converters. For comparison, an
analytical model of each topology is used to relate design considerations to
their operational variables. Among the aspects to be compared are, the

However, monitoring these patients is critical to improving the chances of survival, and therefore, a prioritization strategy for these patients is warranted. This study developed a monitoring algorithm for COVID-19 patients for the Colombian Ministry of Health and Social Protection (MOH).   Methods This work included 1) a literature review, 2) consultations with MOH and National Institute of Health officials, and 3) data analysis of all positive COVID-19 cases and their outcomes. We used clinical and socioeconomic variables to develop a set of risk categories to identify severe cases of COVID-19.   Results This tool provided four different risk categories for COVID-19 patients. As soon as the time of diagnosis, this tool can identify 91% of all severe and fatal COVID-19 cases within the first two risk categories.   Conclusion This tool is a low-cost strategy to prioritize patients at higher risk of experiencing severe COVID-19. This tool was developed so public health teams can focus their scarce monitoring resources on individuals at higher mortality risk. This tool can be easily adapted to the context of other lower and middle-income countries. Policymakers would benefit from this low-cost strategy to reduce COVID-19 mortality, particularly during outbreaks.",Many thanks to Yesika Hernandez for her support in designing the figures of appendix 1.,This study was supported by the Colombian Ministry of Health and Social Protection through award number PUJ-04519-20 received by EP.

1497,pub.1142916379,10.1103/physrevb.104.205128,,,Quasinodal lines in rhombohedral magnetic materials,"A well-established result in condensed matter physics states that materials crystallizing in symmetry groups containing glide reflection symmetries possess nodal lines on the energy bands. These nodal lines are topologically protected and appear on the fixed planes of the reflection in reciprocal space. In the presence of inversion symmetry, the energy bands are degenerate and the band crossings on the fixed plane may be one-dimensional, or may intersect in points, including the case of empty intersection. In the latter case, the crossing is partially or totally avoided, thus producing lines on reciprocal space where the energy gap may be small, and in the former, the nodal lines will endure, thus producing Dirac or double nodal lines. In addition, if the material crystallizes in a ferromagnetic phase where the glide reflection symmetry is broken, the nodal lines hybridize, thus defining lines in reciprocal space where the energy gap may be small. In this work, we concentrate our efforts on the study of nodal lines that hybridize due to magnetization; we have coined the term of quasinodal lines for those lines in reciprocal space where the energy gap is small (less than what can be detected experimentally ∼25 meV). We study magnetic trifluorides and trioxides which crystallize in magnetic space groups 167.107 and 161.71 and we show the existence of quasinodal lines on these materials. We furthermore show that whenever the quasinodal lines are located around the Fermi level then interesting charge and spin transport effects are induced and can be used to detect experimentally these lines. Of particular interest are the half-metallic ferromagnetic phases of PdF3 and LiCuF3 where the large signal of the anomalous Hall conductance is due to the presence of the quasinodal lines on the Fermi level.","The first author gratefully acknowledges the computing time granted on the supercomputer Mogon at Johannes Gutenberg University Mainz (hpc.uni-mainz.de).

For this analysis, we selected a sector of the Colombian Caribbean coast with great touristic, historical, economic, cultural and social importance, namely, Cartagena de Indias; specifically, the beach of Bocagrande. By simultaneously considering erosion and flood processes associated with highly energetic waves, the study facilitates the construction of more precise models for assessing threats to coastal zones. SWAN and XBeach nested models were carried out in order to predict morphological changes and flooding during selected cold fronts and hurricanes that affected Cartagena de Indias; those numerical models were calibrated using field campaigns data (pre- and post-storm). The results of this research indicate that flooding on microtidal dissipative beaches under extreme wave conditions should be approached by considering morphodynamics, because ignoring them can underestimate flooding by ~15%. The erosion and flood effects are intensified by sea level rise, resulting in the most unfavorable condition when extreme events are contemporaneous with high tides.",,,EGUsphere,,,,2021-07-19,2021,2021-07-19,,2021,,1-25,All OA; Green,Preprint,"Fonseca, Jairo E.

Therefore, it is necessary to have an efficient fault location strategy to reduce the exposure time and recurrence of the fault. This paper presents an impedance-based method to estimate the fault location in transmission lines. The mathematical formulation considers the distributed parameters transmission line model for the estimation of the fault distance, and it is obtained by the application of Gauss-Newton method. Said method considers available voltage and current measurements at both terminals of the transmission line as well as the line parameters. Moreover, the method can be used for locating high and low impedance faults. Additionally, it is proposed an adjustable HIF model to validate its performance, which allows to generate synthetic high impedance faults by setting specific features of a HIF from simple input parameters. The error in fault location accuracy is under 0.1% for more than 90% of the performance test cases. The easy implementation of this method and encouraging test results indicate its potential for real-life applications.",Declaration of Competing Interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.,,Electric Power Systems Research,,,,2021-07,2021,,2021-07,196,,107202,All OA; Green,Article,"Doria-García, Jose; Orozco-Henao, Cesar; Leborgne, Roberto; Montoya, Oscar Danilo; Gil-González, Walter","Doria-García, Jose (Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia; Electrical Engineering Postgraduate Program, Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul, Porto Alegre, Brazil); Orozco-Henao, Cesar (Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); Leborgne, Roberto (Electrical Engineering Postgraduate Program, Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul, Porto Alegre, Brazil); Montoya, Oscar Danilo (Facultad de Ingeniería, Universidad Distrital Francisco José de Caldas, Bogotá D.C., Colombia; Smart Energy Laboratory, Universidad Tecnológica de Bolívar, Cartagena, Colombia); Gil-González, Walter (Facultad de Ingeniería, Institución Universitaria Pascual Bravo, Medellín, Colombia)","Doria-García, Jose (Universidad del Norte; Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul)","Doria-García, Jose (Universidad del Norte; Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul); Orozco-Henao, Cesar (Universidad del Norte); Leborgne, Roberto (Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul); Montoya, Oscar Danilo (District University of Bogotá; Universidad Tecnológica de Bolívar); Gil-González, Walter (Pascual Bravo Institution University)",19,12,,6.03,https://repositorio.utb.edu.co/bitstream/20.500.12585/10405/1/High%20impedance%20fault%20modeling%20and%20location%20for%20transmission%20line.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1136981956,"40 Engineering; 4009 Electronics, Sensors and Digital Hardware",

A six-nodes high-voltage dc system is used to illustrate the convergence of the graph-based methods under study. Three test feeders composed of 33, 35, and 69 nodes are used to validate the effectiveness of the proposed approaches when compared with classical methods such as Newton-Raphson and Gauss-Seidel.

It is a goal of large international organisations, governments, companies and other entities. Although it is not a new issue, it is important to continue studying it and seek mechanisms and strategies to attract and maintain more women in these areas. In particular, in the field of education and employment, the STEM areas present large gender gaps whose reduction would not only impact the equality of men and women but would also have an impact on the economy of the countries and on improving the economic situation of women. In this context, there are initiatives in Latin America working on this issue, but it is necessary to look more deeply into the elements that influence the decision to study careers in these areas. In this context, two focus groups have been held as roundtables with STEM women from different Latin American and European countries, to answer a series of questions centred on their motivations and decisions before and during their university studies. The results obtained have provided some inputs for defining gender equality action plans in ten Higher Education Institutions from Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, and Mexico. Furthermore, the results show similarities with previous studies involving STEM women with different Latin American profiles.","This work has been possible with the support of the Erasmus+ Programme of the European Union in its Key Action 2 &quot;Capacity-building in Higher Education&quot;.

net magnetization, the energy bands are spin-(Kramers-degenerate. The opposite
case is usually associated with a global time-reversal symmetry breaking (e.g.,
via ferro(i)magnetism), or with the spin-orbit interaction is combined with the
broken spatial inversion symmetry. Recently, another type of spin splitting was
demonstrated to emerge in some fully compensated by symmetry, nonrelativistic,
collinear magnets, and not even necessarily non-centrosymmetric. These
materials feature non-zero spin density staggered not only in real, but also in
momentum space. This duality results in a combination of characteristics
typical of ferro- and antiferromagnets. Here we discuss this novel concept in
application to a well-known semiconductor, FeSb2, and predict that upon certain
alloying it becomes magnetic, and features such magnetic duality. The
calculated energy bands split antisymmetrically with respect to spin degenerate
nodal surfaces (and not nodal points, as in the case of spin-orbit splitting.
This combination of a large (0.2 eV) spin splitting, compensated net
magnetization and metallic ground-state, and a particular magnetic easy axis
generate a large anomalous Hall conductivity (~150 S/cm) and a sizable
magneto-optical Kerr effect, all deemed to be hallmarks of nonzero net
magnetization. We identify a large contribution to the anomalous response
originating from the spin-orbit interaction gapped anti-Kramers nodal surfaces,

For the development of this research, a sample of 500 entrepreneurs located in Colombia who are in the process of creating a company was taken. The research methodology is hypothetical-deductive with a cross-sectional multiple causal correlation design with explanatory scope and is divided into three stages: First, an exploratory analysis of the data relating to the study variables is carried out. Second, a Principal Component Analysis is carried out. Finally, the third stage is the modelling using the Partial Least Squares - Path Modelling methodology. Among the most relevant findings, it is found that Social Capital is significant in explaining Person-Entrepreneurship Fit. In turn, Social Capital and Person-Entrepreneurship Fit are significant in explaining Entrepreneurial Self-Efficacy. Finally, the construct of Venture Creation is only significantly explained by Per-son-Entrepreneurship Fit.

consider languages also to be complex adaptive systems with several intricate

empirically track the emergence of syntactic structures diachronically,

We named these syntactic structures ""syntactic communicative hierarchies."" We
showed that the communicative needs of speakers are the organizational force of
syntax. Thus, we argue that the emergence of syntactic communicative
hierarchies plays a crucial role in shaping syntax over time. This may indicate
that languages evolve not only to increase the efficiency of transferring

crystallizing in symmetry groups containing glide reflection symmetries possess
nodal lines on the energy bands. These nodal lines are topologically protected
and appear on the fixed planes of the reflection in reciprocal space. In the
presence of inversion symmetry, the energy bands are degenerate and the nodal
lines on the fixed plane may hybridize or may cross. In the former case, the
crossing is avoided, thus producing lines on reciprocal space where the energy
gap is small, and in the latter, the nodal lines will endure, thus producing
Dirac or double nodal lines. In addition, if the material crystallizes in a
ferromagnetic phase where the glide reflection symmetry is broken, the nodal
lines hybridize, thus defining lines in reciprocal space where the energy gap
is small. In this work we concentrate our efforts on the study of nodal lines
that hybridize due to magnetization; we have coined the term of quasi-nodal
lines for those lines in reciprocal space where the energy gap is small (less
than what can be detected experimentally). We study magnetic trifluorides and
trioxides which crystallize in magnetic space groups 167.107 and 161.71 and we
show the existence of quasi-nodal lines on these materials. We furthermore show
that whenever the quasi-nodal lines are located around the Fermi level then
interesting charge and spin transport effects are induced and can be used to
detect experimentally these lines. Of particular interest are the half-metallic
ferromagnetic phases of PdF3 and LiCuF3 where the large signal of the anomalous

Through a contingent valuation study, we found that 71% of urban inhabitants were willing to pay 12,119 USD/year to the protected area's inhabitants to implement conservation strategies and also that 100% of the protected area's dwellers were willing to participate of the strategy. Hence, we proposed a payment for ecosystem services scheme. Lastly, we observed that inhabitants’ high participation rates for the proposed strategy related to the high importance given to TDF-provided ecosystem services.","We thank the Universidad de la Costa, and the program in Environmental Management.

of hourglass and accordion shape band structures along screw invariant lines
whenever spin-orbit coupling is nonnegligible. These structures induce
topological enforced Weyl points on the band intersections. In this work we
show that the chirality of each Weyl point is related to the representations of
the cyclic group on the bands that form the intersection. To achieve this, we
calculate the Picard group of isomorphism classes of complex line bundles over
the 2-dimensional sphere with cyclic group action, and we show how the
chirality (Chern number) relates to the eigenvalues of the rotation action on
the rotation invariant points. Then we write an explicit Hamiltonian endowed
with a cyclic action whose eigenfunctions restricted to a sphere realize the
equivariant line bundles described before. As a consequence of this relation,
we determine the chiralities of the nodal points appearing on the hourglass and
accordion shape structures on screw invariant lines of the nonsymmorphic

Walking brings several benefits to inhabitants among money savings and health improvement. Unfortunately, despite its benefits, walking is not a priority in the urban planning agenda of some cities, especially in the Global South. Walkability conditions in some areas of these cities are not particularly friendly for pedestrians, which discourage walking trips and promotes inequities across inhabitants. Evidence supporting inequalities in the provision of adequate conditions for the use of active transport in the Global South cities remain scarce. This paper aims to contribute to filling this gap by first proposing a framework to link pedestrian accessibility with walkability measures. Specifically, we use a macro-scale measure of pedestrian accessibility and a meso-scale measure of walkability to compare walking conditions on different zones in Barranquilla and Soledad, Colombia. After comparing both measures, we found that low-income zones have higher walkability indexes but present lower potential pedestrian accessibility. In contrast, the highest potential pedestrian accessibilities were located in high and medium-income zones, where people rely more on private transport modes. This imbalance regarding supply and demand conditions for walking trips suggest that unfortunately, zones with the highest potential of being walkable are the ones that face more barriers to walk. Then, adequate planning policies when implemented in the right locations could promote higher use of walking and have the potential to reduce current inequalities in pedestrian infrastructure provision.",,,Research in Transportation Economics,,,,2021-05,2021,,2021-05,86,,101024,All OA; Green,Article,"Arellana, Julián; Alvarez, Vilma; Oviedo, Daniel; Guzman, Luis A.","Arellana, Julián (Departamento de Ingeniería Civil y Ambiental, Universidad Del Norte, Colombia); Alvarez, Vilma (Departamento de Ingeniería Civil y Ambiental, Universidad Del Norte, Colombia); Oviedo, Daniel (University College London, UK); Guzman, Luis A.

The method employs two decision algorithms to modularize product families that offer the same functionality in different levels (i.e., scalable functions) based on design parameters such as geometry, size, and functional relationships among components. The proposed approach's benefits are demonstrated through a case study of a family of upper limb prostheses. Significant improvements in the manufacturing stage, such as raw material and energy consumption, manufacturing cost, and complexity, were obtained from implementing the method. Other benefits in the use stage were also obtained from modularization, increasing the product family's reuse of components.","The authors would like to acknowledge the office of the Engineering Technology and Commonwealth Engineering at Penn State University (PA, US) and the Department of Biomechanics at the University of Nebraska (Omaha, US).",This work was supported by COLCIENCIASthrough the Ph.D. National Scholarship Program No 61702.

A concern for building upgrading and rehabilitation has grown considerably in the last decades. However, there is limited information related to the seismic performance of RC buildings retrofitted with steel jacketing. Retrofitting of RC buildings leads to different techniques that have been developed in the last decades. The selection of adequate techniques commonly depends on desired performance levels, financial criteria, or other non-technical judgment. This paper assesses the seismic performance of a six-story RC building retrofitted with steel jacketing that is located in Cartagena de Indias (Colombia). The building was designed and constructed in 2010 without considering the requirements prescribed by the NSR-10 Colombian code. In 2017, another building collapsed in the same city for several non-compliances with Colombian seismic code. This investigation focuses on the seismic upgrading of the building, studying the influence of different material properties of the existing building and load scenarios on the building behavior. The proposed steel jacketing improves the compressive and flexural capacity of retrofitted columns, along with the ductility of the building.","Authors thank the work of two students, Álvaro Hernández, and Roberto Babilonia, during their graduate thesis under the direction of the corresponding author.

This work introduces a new reactor technology for biomass fast pyrolysis, the Gas-Solid Vortex Reactor (GSVR), to obtain high bio-oil yields. The GSVR was designed to decrease the residence time of the pyrolysis vapors; thus, the secondary cracking reactions are reduced, to enhance the segregation of the char and the unreacted biomass and to improve the heat transfer rate. Biomass fast pyrolysis experiments have been carried out for the first time in a Gas-Solid Vortex Reactor (GSVR) at 773 K, using softwood (pine) and hardwood (poplar) as feedstock. Char yields as low as 10 wt. % in the GSVR were comparable to those reported for the same feedstocks processed in conventional fluidized bed reactors. The yields of non-condensable gases in the range of 15–17 wt. % were significantly lower than those reported for other commonly used biomass fast pyrolysis reactors. Two-dimensional gas chromatography (GC × GC) revealed noticeable differences at the molecular level between the bio-oils from the GSVR and bio-oils from other reactors. The aromatics in the pine bio-oil consist almost entirely (85 wt. %) of guaiacols. For poplar bio-oils no predominant group of aromatics was found, but phenolics, syringols, and catechols were the most pronounced. The experimental results highlight the advantages of the GSVR for biomass pyrolysis, reaching stable operation in around 60 s, removing the formed char selectively during operation, and enabling fast entrainment of pyrolysis vapors. Results indicate a great potential for increasing yield and selectivity towards guaiacols in softwood (e.g., pine) bio-oil. Likewise, decreasing pyrolysis temperature could increase the yield of guaiacols and syringols in hardwood (e.g., poplar) bio-oil.",The SBO project “Bioleum” (IWT-SBO 130039) supported by the Institute for Promotion of Innovation through Science and Technology in Flanders (IWT) is acknowledged.

1193,pub.1144064882,10.1017/s0016756821001229,,,Submarine volcanic activity and giant amygdale formation along the Panama island arc as a precursor to 6000-year-old agate exploitation on Pedro González Island,"Abstract
                  An extensive deposit of agate occurs in Pedro González Island in the Gulf of Panama. Previous archaeological research showed that the agate was exploited between 6200 and 5600 cal BP to make stone tools found at the oldest known Preceramic human settlement in the Pearl Island archipelago. We constrain here the origin and geological context of the agate through a geological and geochemical study of the island. We show that it includes primary volcanic breccias, lavas, and tuffaceous marine deposits with sedimentary conglomerates and debris flow deposits, which we define as the Pedro González Formation. This formation records submarine to subaerial volcanic activity along an island arc during the Oligo-Miocene, confirming previous regional models that favour progressive emergence of the isthmus in the early Miocene. The igneous rocks have an extreme tholeiitic character that is interpreted to reflect magmatic cessation in eastern Panama during the early Miocene. The agate is hosted in andesitic lavas in unusually large amygdales up to 20–40 cm in diameter, as well as small amygdales (0.1–1.0 cm) in a bimodal distribution, and in veins. The large size of the agates made them suitable for tool manufacture. Field evidence suggests that the formation of large amygdales resulted from subaqueous lava–sediment interaction, in which water released from unconsolidated tuffaceous deposits at the base of lava flows rose through the lavas, coalesced, and accumulated below the chilled lava top, with subsequent hydrothermal mineralization. These amygdales could therefore be regarded as an unusual result of combined peperitic and hydrothermal processes.","Thanks are due to Richard Cooke, Senior Archaeologist, Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute, Panama City, Panama, for inviting the first author to visit the project in 2009; Juan Guillermo Martin, Professor of Archaeology, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia, and leader of the Playa Don Bernardo rescue archaeology programme in 2015–16, for the invitation to participate in the project and for organizing the site visits; Georges A.

information in commercial spintronic devices. The effects rely on a conserved
spin current passing between a reference and a sensing ferromagnetic electrode
in a multilayer structure. Recently, we have proposed that these fundamental
spintronic effects can be realized in collinear antiferromagnets with staggered
spin-momentum exchange interaction, which generates conserved spin currents in
the absence of a net equilibrium magnetization. Here we elaborate on the
proposal by presenting archetype model mechanisms for the antiferromagnetic
giant and tunneling magnetoresistance effects. The models are based,
respectively, on anisotropic and valley-dependent forms of the non-relativistic
staggered spin-momentum interaction. Using first principles calculations we
link these model mechanisms to real antiferromagnetic materials and predict a
$\sim$100\% scale for the effects. We point out that besides the GMR/TMR
detection, our models directly imply the possibility of spin-transfer-torques
excitation of the antiferromagnets.",,,arXiv,,,,2021-03-23,2021,,,,,,All OA; Green,Preprint,"Šmejkal, Libor; Hellenes, Anna Birk; González-Hernández, Rafael; Sinova, Jairo; Jungwirth, Tomáš","Šmejkal, Libor (); Hellenes, Anna Birk (); González-Hernández, Rafael (); Sinova, Jairo (); Jungwirth, Tomáš ()",,"Šmejkal, Libor (); Hellenes, Anna Birk (); González-Hernández, Rafael (); Sinova, Jairo (); Jungwirth, Tomáš ()",0,0,,0.0,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1136626310,51 Physical Sciences; 5104 Condensed Matter Physics,

In this regard, we propose a market segmentation for incentivising sustainable transport policies. Our analysis builds from the responses of 1,041 car owners towards environmentally friendly transport alternatives in a survey issued in the five largest Colombian metropolitan areas: Bogotá, Medellín, Cali, Barranquilla, and Bucaramanga. Using the collected data, we estimated a Multiple Indicators Multiple Causes (MIMIC) model to evaluate individual attitudes towards the environment, green transport policies, car use, and technology. A cluster analysis based on the MIMIC results identified three groups: Traditionalists, Green Conscious and All Matters. Results make the contradiction between car attachment and environmental concern evident. The lower the environmental concern, the higher the attachment to the car. However, the differences between Traditionalists and All Matters are less pronounced. Finally, we proposed sustainable strategies considering the heterogeneities of each group, analysed the implications of developing custom-made actions and marketing strategies for promoting sustainable transport policies, considering the interests and characteristics of each targeted group in the population.",Declaration of Competing Interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.,,Transportation Research Part D Transport and Environment,,,,2021-10,2021,,2021-10,99,,103013,All OA; Green,Article,"Soto, Jose J.; Cantillo, Victor; Arellana, Julián","Soto, Jose J.

With the aim of finding non-toxic and effective P-gp inhibitors, we investigated a panel of quinolin-2-one-pyrimidine hybrids. Among the active compounds, two of them significantly increased intracellular doxorubicin and rhodamine 123 accumulation by inhibiting the efflux mediated by P-gp and restored doxorubicin toxicity at nanomolar range. Structure-activity relationships showed that the number of methoxy groups, an optimal length of the molecule in its extended conformation, and at least one flexible methylene group bridging the quinolinone moiety favored the inhibitory potency of P-gp. The best compounds showed a similar binding pattern and interactions to those of doxorubicin and tariquidar, as revealed by MD and hybrid QM/MM simulations performed with the recent experimental structure of P-gp co-crystallized with paclitaxel. Analysis of the molecular interactions stabilizing the different molecular complexes determined by MD and QTAIM showed that binding to key residues from TMH 4–7 and 12 is required for inhibition.",,,Research Square,,,,2021-04-27,2021,2021-04-27,,,,,All OA; Green,Preprint,"Laiolo, Jerónimo; Lanza, Priscila Ailin; Parravicini, Oscar; Barbieri, Cecilia; Insuasty, Daniel; Cobo, Justo; Vera, D.

Are we ready for a ‘15-minute city’?","Social distancing and economic lockdown measures implemented in Global North countries have been mimicked in the Global South to contain the spread of COVID-19. However, the consequences of such measures on activity and mobility patterns among social groups in Global South cities remain unclear. This paper seeks to provide reliable evidence from changes in behaviors across income groups at the urban scale. We report a detailed analysis from a web-based survey to understand the effects of the early and complete lockdown adopted to contain the COVID-19 spread on activity and travel patterns in Bogotá. We also performed a geographical proximity analysis of non-work services and facilities located around surveyed households to challenge the rhetoric about the ‘15-minute’ city. We found that low-income people are more socially exposed to contagion being forced to go out to find their daily sustenance and having adverse economic and travel effects than other income groups. However, even though Bogotá is not so far from meeting the goal of 15 min proximity, particularly for non-work-related activities, we found marked inequalities among income groups regarding access to essential services in proximity. The paper’s findings serve as a reminder that travel behavior and accessibility are not the remits of only urban transport planning and that land-use and urban planning play a determining role in redressing social and spatial inequalities in a city.","We would like to express our gratitude to the Development Planning Unit of University College London for facilitating the license for Maptionnaire, the Centro para los Objetivos de Desarrollo Sostenible of Universidad de los Andes, Transmilenio S.A. and INTALInC LAC for their support in distributing the survey, Charly Cepeda from Universidad de los Andes and Orlando Sabogal from INTALInC for their support in data and survey management.",,Travel Behaviour and Society,,,,2021-07,2021,,2021-07,24,,245-256,All OA; Green,Article,"Guzman, Luis A.; Arellana, Julian; Oviedo, Daniel; Aristizábal, Carlos Alberto Moncada","Guzman, Luis A.

Although drink driving has received most of the scholarly attention, there is growing evidence of the risks of alcohol-impaired walking. Alcohol-impaired pedestrians are over-represented in fatal crashes compared to non-impaired pedestrians. Additionally, empirical evidence shows that alcohol intoxication impairs road-crossing judgements. Besides some limited early research, much is unknown about the global prevalence and determinants of alcohol-impaired walking. Understanding alcohol-impaired walking will support health promotion initiatives and injury prevention. The present investigation has three aims: (1) compare the prevalence of alcohol-impaired walking across countries; (2) identify international groups of pedestrians based on psychosocial factors (i.e., Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB) and perceptions of risk); and (3) investigate how segments of pedestrians form their intention for alcohol-impaired walking using the extended TPB (i.e. subjective norm, attitudes, perceived control, and perceived risk). A cross-sectional design was applied. The target behaviour question was ""have you been a pedestrian when your thinking or physical ability (balance/strength) is affected by alcohol?"" to ensure comparability across countries. Cluster analysis based on the extended TPB was used to identify groups of countries. Finally, regressions were used to predict pedestrians' intentions per group. A total of 6,166 respondents (Age M(SD) = 29.4 (14.2); Males = 39.2%) completed the questionnaire, ranging from 12.6% from Russia to 2.2% from Finland. The proportion of participants who reported never engaging in alcohol-impaired walking in the last three months ranged from 30.1% (Spain) to 83.1% (Turkey). Four groups of countries were identified: group-1 (Czech Republic, Spain, and Australia), group-2 (Russia and Finland), group-3 (Japan), and group-4 (final ten countries including Colombia, China, and Romania). Pedestrian intentions to engage in alcohol- impaired walking are predicted by perceptions of risk and TPB-psychosocial factors in group-1 and group-4. Favourable TPB-beliefs and low perceived risk increased alcohol-impaired walking intentions. Conversely, subjective norms were not significant in group-2 and only perceived risk predicted intention in group-3. The willingness of pedestrians to walk when alcohol-impaired differs significantly across the countries in this study. Perceived risk was the only common predictor among the 16 countries.","The authors would like to acknowledge the Centre for Accident Research and Road Safety-Queensland (CARRS-Q) at Queensland University of Technology (QUT) for supporting the present research through an internal grant.

Despite its conservation status, few molecular markers are available to study its population genetic, connectivity and to assist reproduction programs. Thus, the species needs urgent actions to restore its original distribution. Novel polymorphic microsatellites from the genome of N. alessandrii were isolated and characterized using high-through sequencing. A total of 30 primer pairs were synthesized and 18 microsatellites were amplified correctly. Polymorphism and genetic diversity was evaluated in 58 individuals from three populations of N. alessandrii. Sixteen of them were polymorphic and the number of alleles in the pooled sample ranged from 2 to 14, the mean number of alleles was 4.81. The mean values of observed heterozigosity (HO) and excepted heterozygosity (HE) are similar in all studied populations. Linkage disequilibrium was found between a few pairs of loci (five out of 263 tests) suggesting that most of the markers can be considered as independent. Significant deviations from Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium (P < 0.05) were found in four loci probably due to low sampling size. Transferability to the congeneric N. pumilio was successful in only four out of the sixteen polymorphic markers. The microsatellite markers developed in this study will be useful to study the genetic diversity and structure and to develop integrated management plans for the conservation of this endangered species.","This study was supported by the Chilean Agency for Scientific Research and Development (ANID), FONDECYT grant 1181873.

aspects of spherically symmetric charged black holes by performing a
renormalization group improvement of the classical Reissner-Nordström metric
within the framework of the Einstein-Hilbert truncation in quantum Einstein
gravity. In particular, we determine that the event horizon surfaces are stable
except for the extremal case and we corroborate the appearance of a new
extremality condition at the Planck scale that hints at the existence of a
final stage after the black hole evaporation process. We find explicit
expressions for the area and surface gravity of the event horizon and we show
the existence of an exact form $dS$ with the surface gravity as integrating
factor. This result is a first clue towards finding a generalization of the
first law of black hole dynamics, for improved charged spherically symmetric
spacetimes in contrast to a previous no-go result for axially symmetric ones
with null charge. We finally calculate an explicit formula for the Komar mass
at the event horizon, and we compare it with the total mass at infinity for a
wide domain of values of the black hole parameters M, Q and $\bar{w}$, showing
a loss of mass which can be interpreted as a consequence of the antiscreening
effect of the gravitational field between the event horizon and infinity.",,,arXiv,,,,2021-12-23,2021,,,,,,All OA; Green,Preprint,"Ruiz, O.; Tuiran, E.","Ruiz, O. (); Tuiran, E. ()",,"Ruiz, O.

Such inequalities are often the result of urban development trajectories and inherited practices of transport planning marked by spatial segregation and decades of car-centred development. This situation, repeated across Latin American cities, tends to affect mostly the poor in the urban peripheries. Despite available evidence of access inequalities on a case-to-case basis, comparative evidence across cities within the same region is still limited. Our paper addresses this gap by deploying a comparative accessibility assessment of inequalities in accessibility in the two Colombian cities of Bogotá and Barranquilla. Our comparison suggests that by following similar patterns of urban transport development, Bogotá and Barranquilla have reached similar accessibility and affordability patterns. Wealthier areas benefit from the triad of better transport coverage, proximity to opportunities, and higher purchasing power, while the poor in both cities face deep affordability and spatial segregation problems. Despite their similarities, our analysis reveals the effects of long-term decision-making in the number of opportunities which can be reached by different transport modes and population segments. Accessibility per capita in public transport is higher in Bogotá than in Barranquilla, and vice versa in private vehicles. These results are consistent with nearly a decade of implementation of different urban transport policies in both cities, which in Bogotá have been more public-transport-oriented than in Barranquilla. Findings also suggest that public transport-related policies can contribute to redefining urban trajectories, as both cities have experienced demographic and urban footprint increases in years. Similarities and differences in spatial and economic dimensions of accessibility serve as a mirror against which we assess transport's role in urban equality in similar global south cities. The discussion in this paper can be helpful to decision-makers as it recalls that some urban and transport policies and investments may have undesired long-term impacts in urban growth and access equality across the city.",,,Research in Transportation Business & Management,,,,2021-09,2021,,2021-09,40,,100554,All OA; Green,Article,"Arellana, Julian; Oviedo, Daniel; Guzman, Luis A.; Alvarez, Vilma","Arellana, Julian (Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); Oviedo, Daniel (University College London, London, UK); Guzman, Luis A.

Conducting these programs in low and middle-income countries is challenging and there is no evidence of their effectiveness in Latin America. We evaluated the effectiveness of contact tracing on reducing fatality from COVID-19 in Colombia, South America.Methods: We analyzed confirmed and suspected COVID-19 cases and their chains of contact using a nation-wide registry from March 28, 2020 to January 13, 2021. To estimate the effect of contact tracing on fatality we adjusted a multilevel negative binomial model using as outcome variable the number of deaths and off-set variable the number of people within a chain of contacts. Sensitivity analysis was conducted using a logistic model for the effect of contact tracing on death at individual level.Results: We analyzed 1,4 million cases, 542 936 chains of contact, and 46 087 deaths. Only 5,8% of total cases and contacts were included in a chain of a case and five or more contacts. We found that tracing of at least five contacts per case reduce fatality by 48% (95% CI: 45-51) and, at the current levels of tracing in Colombia, it prevents 1.8% of deaths. Results obtained from the sensitivity analysis were consistent with the reduction of fatality.Conclusions: In Colombia, tracing of at least five contacts per case reduces fatality from COVID-19. The coverage and intensity of tracing needs to be increased as a strategy to mitigate fatality in Colombia.",,,SSRN Electronic Journal,,,,2021,2021,,,,,,All OA; Green,Preprint,"Fernández, Julián; Peña, Carlos; Rojas, Maylen; Rodríguez, Laura","Fernández, Julián (); Peña, Carlos (Ministry of Health and Social Protection); Rojas, Maylen (); Rodríguez, Laura ()",,"Fernández, Julián (); Peña, Carlos (Ministry of Health and Social Protection); Rojas, Maylen (); Rodríguez, Laura ()",0,0,,0.0,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1136475142,44 Human Society; 4404 Development Studies,3 Good Health and Well Being

As such, freight logistics impact multiple stakeholders. However, these stakeholders are mostly not taken into consideration when planners and decision makers look into potential solutions to the issues generated by freight operations. In this paper, results are shown from a survey conducted and analyzed unveiling citizens’ perceptions with respect to the urban freight system in a mid-size urban area. Four hypotheses are proposed and tested using a Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) approach. Results show that, unlike what is generally believed, citizens are aware of the freight system and its impact on their daily activities. Moreover, citizens who perceive the infrastructure to be in poor condition also have a greater awareness of the negative externalities generated by freight operations. In addition, having a higher perception of freight’s negative externalities decreases citizens’ perception of the overall performance of freight logistics in the city. Furthermore, the results unveiled heterogeneity in citizens’ perceptions based on their socio-economic characteristics and based on their location. The results shed light on the perceptions citizens have towards urban freight logistics, and confirms the importance that decision makers should place on engaging the public early in the planning process. By raising awareness among planners in a proactive manner, these findings could be used to enhance the level of community engagement in freight planning, and by extension the level of citizen support for programs and initiatives aimed at addressing urban freight issues.",Declaration of Competing Interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.,,Transportation Research Part E Logistics and Transportation Review,,,,2021-08,2021,,2021-08,152,,102390,All OA; Green,Article,"Amaya, Johanna; Delgado-Lindeman, Maira; Arellana, Julian; Allen, Jaime","Amaya, Johanna (Department of Supply Chain and Information Systems, Pennsylvania State University, 454 Business Building, University Park, PA 16802, USA); Delgado-Lindeman, Maira (Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Universidad del Norte, Km 5, Via a Puerto Colombia, Barranquilla, Colombia); Arellana, Julian (Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Universidad del Norte, Km 5, Via a Puerto Colombia, Barranquilla, Colombia); Allen, Jaime (Research Associate, National Laboratory of Materials and Structural Models (LanammeUCR), Universidad de Costa Rica, Sede Rodrigo Facio, Ciudad de la Investigación, Finca 2, Montes de Oca, San José 11501-2060, Costa Rica)","Amaya, Johanna (Pennsylvania State University)","Amaya, Johanna (Pennsylvania State University); Delgado-Lindeman, Maira (Universidad del Norte); Arellana, Julian (Universidad del Norte); Allen, Jaime (University of Costa Rica)",34,23,,13.62,https://scholarsphere.psu.edu/resources/13dc6484-5c6c-4b3a-9c7f-4157df8d6caa/downloads/18289,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1138940963,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3509 Transportation, Logistics and Supply Chains",11 Sustainable Cities and Communities

Therefore, the aim of this study was to validate the Scale of Worry for Contagion of COVID-19 (PRE-COVID-19) in a sample of patients with diabetes mellitus (DM).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 219 patients (66.2% female, mean age 58.5 SD = 18.2) participated, selected through non-probabilistic sampling. The PRE-COVID-19 and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale-2 were applied. Reliability analysis was performed for internal consistency, structural equation modeling and item response theory modeling.
RESULTS: The results show that a unidimensional 5-item model presents satisfactory goodness-of-fit indices and excellent reliability values. Likewise, convergent validity between the PRE-COVID-19 and a measure of anxiety is evident. All items present adequate discrimination parameters, allowing for discerning between those patients with critical concern about COVID-19 contagion from those with severe concern.
CONCLUSION: It is concluded that the PRE-COVID-19 is an instrument with adequate psychometric properties to measure concern about COVID-19 infection and the emotional impact in patients with DM.","Declaration of competing interest Tomás Caycho-Rodríguez, Lindsey W.

Methods We employed rat dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons, Schwann cells (SCs), and human stem cell-derived sensory neurons myelinated with rat SCs as cellular models to screen for IgG and IgM autoantibodies reactive to peripheral nerve in sera of ZIKV patients with and without GBS. In this study, 52 ZIKV-GBS patients were compared with 134 ZIKV-infected patients, and 91 non-ZIKV controls. Positive sera were taken forward for target identification by immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry, and candidate antigens validated by ELISA and cell-based assays. Autoantibody reactions against glycolipid antigens were also screened on an array.   Results Overall, IgG antibody reactivity to rat SCs (6.5%) and myelinated co-cultures (9.6%) were significantly higher, albeit infrequently, in the ZIKV-GBS group compared to all controls. IgM antibody immunoreactivity to DRGs (32.3%) and SCs (19.4%) was more frequently observed in the ZIKV-GBS group compared to other controls, while IgM reactivity to co-cultures was as common in ZIKV and non-ZIKV sera. Strong axonal-binding ZIKV-GBS serum IgG antibodies from one patient were confirmed to react with neurofascin-155 and 186. Serum from a ZIKV non-GBS patient displayed strong myelin-binding and anti-lipid antigen reaction characteristics. There was no significant association of ZIKV-GBS with any anti-glycolipid antibodies.   Conclusion Autoantibodies in ZIKV associated GBS patients’ sera target heterogeneous peripheral nerve antigens suggesting heterogeneity of the humoral immune response despite a common prodromal infection.","We thank Professors Peter Brophy and Sarosh Irani for kindly providing the periaxin antibody and healthy human control sera, respectively.

In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, older adults are the most vulnerable age group; therefore, the aim of the study was to evaluate the psychometric properties of the CAS in this group.
MATERIALS AND METHOD: 274 Peruvian older adults participated (Mage=67.86; SD=6.34, 64.6% women). In addition to the CAS, the 2-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-2), and 2-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD-2) were applied. Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) was used to assess the factor structure of the CAS and Item Response Theory was used to analyze item characteristics. A sequence of hierarchical variance models was used to evaluate the measurement invariance of the CAS according to age. To assess reliability, Cronbach's alpha coefficient (α) and the omega coefficient (ω) were used. The correlations between the CAS score and the scores of the PHQ-2 and GAD-2 scales were calculated with Pearson's correlation coefficient (r).
RESULTS: The results of the CFA indicated that the unidimensional model of the CAS fitted the data adequately and showed very good reliability (α and ω≥.83). Likewise, all items provided high information and adequate discrimination, which allowed for better detection of average and high levels of coronaphobia in the older adult population. However, the CAS did not show evidence of being strictly invariant between older adults aged 60-65 years and 66-86 years. The CAS showed significant correlations with anxiety (r=.72; [95%CI: .66, .87] p<.01) and depression (r=.53; [95%CI: .43, .76] p<.01).
CONCLUSION: The CAS in Spanish shows evidence of validity based on internal structure, convergent and divergent validity, as well as an adequate reliability estimate to assess coronaphobia in older adults. The CAS can be used to detect average and high levels of coronaphobia in the older adult population.",,,Revista Española de Geriatría y Gerontología,,,Aged; Anxiety; COVID-19; Female; Humans; Male; Pandemics; Psychometrics; Reproducibility of Results; SARS-CoV-2; Surveys and Questionnaires,2021-11-12,2021,2021-11-12,2022-01,57,1,20-27,All OA; Green,Article,"Caycho-Rodríguez, Tomás; Vilca, Lindsey W; Peña-Calero, Brian Norman; Barboza-Palomino, Miguel; White, Michael; Reyes-Bossio, Mario","Caycho-Rodríguez, Tomás (Facultad de Ciencias de la Salud, Universidad Privada del Norte, Lima, Peru.

A Matched-Pair, National Study","Background: Although clinical trials showed that vaccines have a high efficacy and safety, differences in study designs and populations do not allow for comparison across products and age groups. The real-world effectiveness in population with the high risk of severe disease or death of a diversified portfolio of vaccines acquired by Colombia becomes important for assessing national vaccination plans and future decision-making.Methods: We carried out a population-based matched-pair cohort study in 2828294 people 60 years and older. The exposed cohort consisted of older adults fully vaccinated with Ad26.COV2.S, BNT162b2, ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, or CoronaVac without history of Sars-CoV-2 infection. The follow-up was made between March 11 and October 26, 2021. To estimate effectiveness, we constructed cause-specific Cox survival models in presence of competitive risks (hospitalisation vs death due to COVID-19). Finally, we estimated the effectiveness of each vaccine adjusting by main potential confounders over each age group.Findings: The overall effectiveness of vaccines to prevent hospitalisation without subsequent death was 61·6% (95% CI 58·0 - 65·0), to prevent death after hospitalisation for COVID-19, 79·8% (95% CI 78·5 - 81·1), and to prevent death without previous COVID-19 hospitalisation, 72·8% (95% CI 70·1 - 75·3). The effectiveness of vaccines to prevent death after hospitalisation for COVID-19 was 22·6 percentage points less in adults 80 and older compared with adults between 60 and 69 years old (68·4% vs 91·0%). We found statistically significant differences in effectiveness between vaccines in preventing hospitalisations and deaths.Interpretation: The Ad26.COV2.S, BNT162b2, ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, and CoronaVac vaccines are effective in preventing hospitalisations and deaths caused by COVID-19 in fully vaccinated adults 60 years and older. BNT162b2 showed the highest effectiveness among this population. Effectiveness decreases with increasing age, regardless of the type of vaccine used in the primary scheme. An additional dose of the vaccine seems to be the best alternative for increase protection in older adults.Funding Information: Colombian Ministry of Health and Social Protection.

For this purpose, a previously validated questionnaire was used, collecting 427 complete responses. Chi-square sta-tistical tests were performed to determine the degree of association of entrepreneurial activity with measured sociodemographic variables such as gender, age, marital status, schooling, family environment, and dependents. Once the existence of associations between the variables was ver-ified, a multiple correspondence analysis was performed to identify patterns and trends. A greater favorability for entrepreneurship was found in those subjects belonging to the upper strata of the population, mostly men, with postgraduate studies, from wealthy families, while the poorest and women are mainly oriented towards job search.",,,Preprints.org,,,,2021-04-09,2021,2021-04-09,,,,202104.0252.v1,All OA; Green,Preprint,"Arias, Francisco; Ribes, Gabriela; Garcés, Luis Fernando; Arango, Diana","Arias, Francisco (); Ribes, Gabriela (); Garcés, Luis Fernando (); Arango, Diana ()","Arias, Francisco ()","Arias, Francisco (); Ribes, Gabriela (); Garcés, Luis Fernando (); Arango, Diana ()",0,0,,0.0,https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202104.0252/v1/download,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1137073131,44 Human Society; 4410 Sociology,

Using an online survey, we explored how the psychosocial effects of the pandemic affected the mental health of LGBTQ+ young adults who were confined with their parents during the lockdown period (N = 1,934), from six countries: Portugal, UK, Italy, Brazil, Chile, and Sweden. South American participants experienced more negative psychosocial effects of the pandemic. Depression and anxiety were higher among participants who were younger, not working, living in Europe and who reported feeling more emotionally affected by the pandemic, uncomfortable at home, or isolated from non-LGBTQ friends. Not attending higher education predicted depression while not being totally confined at home, residing habitually with parents, and fearing more future infection predicted anxiety.

Here we examined the distribution and densities of face masks on some of the main tourist beaches in Chile, and we monitored their daily accumulation rates on one beach in northern-central Chile. Face masks were found on beaches across the country with average densities of 0.006 ± 0.002 (mean ± se) face masks m−2, which are higher than densities reported on Peruvian beaches, but lower than those on some Kenyan beaches. Face masks were also found on more remote beaches and rocky shores in northern-central Chile. Daily accumulation rates on one tourist beach were low during austral fall/winter (0.2 face masks km−1 d−1), but were over ten times higher during austral summer (3.0 face masks km−1 d−1). These values are substantially higher than daily accumulation rates reported from urban streets, which is most likely due to the high densities of beach visitors during the summer tourist season. COVID-19 related infrastructure (signposts and PPE waste bins) was present on most beaches, but while signposts about personal protection were abundant, there were few signposts about littering, and only one of the 12 beaches sampled for COVID infrastructure had a signpost that offered recommendations about the proper disposal of used face masks. Specific waste bins for PPE waste were only available at three beaches. Based on these findings it is recommended to provide sufficient PPE-related signs and waste bins, establish general and strict waste disposal regulations, and to improve enforcement. Educational campaigns should aim at recommending proper use and disposal of face masks, litter prevention, reduction of single-use waste and enhanced pro-environmental behaviors.","Foremost, we would like to thank the volunteer participants of the national survey of litter on the Chilean beaches. We also thank the many members of the BEDIM laboratory of UCN who have participated in the annual surveys of the beaches from the Coquimbo region.

In this model, two dimensions (valence and dominance) underpin social judgements of faces. Because this model has primarily been developed and tested in Western regions, it is unclear whether these findings apply to other regions. We addressed this question by replicating Oosterhof and Todorov’s methodology across 11 world regions, 41 countries and 11,570 participants. When we used Oosterhof and Todorov’s original analysis strategy, the valence–dominance model generalized across regions. When we used an alternative methodology to allow for correlated dimensions, we observed much less generalization. Collectively, these results suggest that, while the valence–dominance model generalizes very well across regions when dimensions are forced to be orthogonal, regional differences are revealed when we use different extraction methods and correlate and rotate the dimension reduction solution.Protocol registrationThe stage 1 protocol for this Registered Report was accepted in principle on 5 November 2018.

Participants are either victims of conflict, ex-combatants or members of vulnerable groups, sharing socioeconomic characteristics with victims with the exception of conflict exposure. Participants are paired and they make unconditional contributions to a public good, and then conditional on the contribution of their counterpart using the strategy method. By comparing decisions across pairs we elicit outgroup discrimination (towards ex-combatants) and discrimination towards the ‘other ingroup’ (non-victims for victims, and victims for non-victims). By comparing unconditional and conditional decisions, we distinguish between beliefs- and preferences-based discrimination. We also elicit participants’ expectations (empirical and normative) in every interaction and study the role played by social norms. Both victims and non-victims discriminate ex-combatants significantly more than they discriminate each other, being their discrimination preference-based. However, victims discriminate ex-combatants significantly less than non-victims. While victims do not discriminate non-victims, they are discriminated by nonvictims, and their behavior is consistent with different social norms: ingroup discrimination of victims is supported by discriminatory norms held by non-victims. However, victims and non-victims hold the same discriminatory expectations towards ex-combatants and only non-victims conform to the norm.",,,SSRN Electronic Journal,,,,2021,2021,,,,,,All OA; Green,Preprint,"Fatas, Enrique; Restrepo-Plaza, Lina","Fatas, Enrique (University of Pennsylvania - School of Arts & Sciences; Universidad ICESI); Restrepo-Plaza, Lina (Universidad del Valle)",,"Fatas, Enrique (University of Pennsylvania - School of Arts & Sciences; Universidad ICESI); Restrepo-Plaza, Lina (University of Valle)",0,0,,0.0,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1145049803,38 Economics; 3801 Applied Economics; 3803 Economic Theory,"16 Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions"

Nowadays, people have access the affordable mobile devices equipped with advanced integrated cameras and powerful image processing applications. Technological development facilitates not only the generation of multimedia content, but also the intentional modification of it, either with recreational or malicious purposes. This is where forensic techniques to detect manipulation of images and videos become essential. This paper proposes a forensic technique by analysing compression algorithms used by the H.264 coding. The presence of recompression uses information of macroblocks, a characteristic of the H.264-MPEG4 standard, and motion vectors. A Vector Support Machine is used to create the model that allows to accurately detect if a video has been recompressed.",,This work was supported by the European Union’s Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Program under Agreement 101021801.,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,,,,2021-12-30,2021,2021-12-30,2022-03-01,23,3,2596-2605,All OA; Green,Article,"Fernández, Edgar González; Orozco, Ana Lucila Sandoval; Villalba, Luis Javier García","Fernández, Edgar González (INFOTEC, Center for Research and Innovation in Information and Communication Technologies, Aguascalientes, 20313, Mexico; Group of Analysis, Security and Systems (GASS), Department of Software Engineering and Artificial Intelligence (DISIA), Faculty of Computer Science and Engineering, Office 431, Universidad Complutense de Madrid (UCM), 28040, Madrid, Spain); Orozco, Ana Lucila Sandoval (Group of Analysis, Security and Systems (GASS), Department of Software Engineering and Artificial Intelligence (DISIA), Faculty of Computer Science and Engineering, Office 431, Universidad Complutense de Madrid (UCM), 28040, Madrid, Spain); Villalba, Luis Javier García (Group of Analysis, Security and Systems (GASS), Department of Software Engineering and Artificial Intelligence (DISIA), Faculty of Computer Science and Engineering, Office 431, Universidad Complutense de Madrid (UCM), 28040, Madrid, Spain)","Villalba, Luis Javier García (Complutense University of Madrid)","Fernández, Edgar González (INFOTEC, Center for Research and Innovation in Information and Communication Technologies, Aguascalientes, 20313, Mexico; Complutense University of Madrid); Orozco, Ana Lucila Sandoval (Complutense University of Madrid); Villalba, Luis Javier García (Complutense University of Madrid)",7,6,,2.59,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.07891,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1144294624,46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4603 Computer Vision and Multimedia Computation,

solution of the discrete in time $N$-dimensional heat equation. We give a
convergence rate with which the solution tends to the discrete fundamental
solution, and the asymptotic decay, both in $L^p(\R^N).$ Furthermore we prove
optimal $L^2$-decay of solutions. Since the technique of energy methods is not
applicable, we follow the approach of estimates based on the discrete
fundamental solution which is given by an original integral representation and

Governments worldwide also rely on test-trace-isolate (TTI) programs for additional risk mitigation. This study aims to estimate the cost-effectiveness of implementing a national TTI strategy to reduce the number of severe and fatal cases of COVID-19 in Colombia. Methods: We developed a simulation model of COVID-19 infection combined with a Susceptible-Infected-Recovered structure. We estimated the incremental cost-effectiveness of a comprehensive TTI strategy compared to no intervention over a one-year horizon, from both a health system and a societal perspective. Hospitalization and mortality rates were retrieved from Colombian surveillance data. We included program costs of TTI intervention, health services utilization, PCR diagnosis test, productivity lost, and government social program costs. We used the number of deaths and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) as health outcomes. Sensitivity analyses were performed. Findings: Compared with no intervention, the TTI strategy reduced COVID-19 mortality by 67%. In addition, the program saved an average of $1,045 and $850 per case in the social and health system perspective, respectively. These savings are equivalent to almost four to ten times the annual Colombia per capita healthcare spending.Interpretation: The TTI strategy in Colombia is a highly cost-effective public health intervention to reduce the burden of COVID-19. TTI is dependent on its capacity to identify and give early medical and social assistance to new cases. Our findings exemplify the success of using comprehensive strategies integrating telemedicine and predictive analysis to improve prevention programs.Funding Information: This study was supported by the Colombian Ministry of Health through award number PUJ-04519-20 received by E.P.

enable learning on small hyperspectral datasets where training a network from

training adaptors and evaluate them on a benchmark consisting of multiple
hyperspectral datasets. We find that simple schemes such as linear projection
or subset selection are often the most effective, but can lead to a loss in
performance in some cases. We also propose a novel multi-view adaptor where of
the inputs are combined in an intermediate layer of the network in an order

Geomagnetic storms may affect the generation of these irregularities in a way that is not yet fully understood. To improve the forecasting of this phenomenon, we need to study the ionosphere in different regions of the world, and in particular in the equatorial ionization anomaly (EIA) where irregularities are usually more intense. This study analyses the effect of geomagnetic storms on ionospheric irregularities. We examined the occurrence of irregularities at the southern crest of the EIA in Argentina (Tucumán, 26.9°S, 294.6°E, dip latitude 15.5° S) during three intense and one moderate geomagnetic storm of different solar sources, between 2015 and 2018. We used data from an ionosonde, a Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver and magnetometers. Ionogram spread-F, the F-layer bottom side (h'F), the critical frequency of the F2-layer (foF2), the rate of TEC index (ROTI) and the S4 scintillation index were analysed. The data show irregularities were present as range spread-F and moderate TEC fluctuations in one storm: 27 May 2017 (a coronal mass ejection CME-driven storm occurred on local winter), and were absent in the other events. We suggest that eastward disturbance dynamo electric field and over-shielding prompt penetration electric fields may create favourable conditions for developing these irregularities. Whereas, westward storm time electric fields might inhibit the growth of irregularities during the other storms considered. During co-rotating interaction region CIR-driven storms, the westward disturbance dynamo electric field may be associated with the non-occurrence of irregularities.",,,Research Square,,,,2021-08-31,2021,2021-08-31,,,,,All OA; Green,Preprint,"González, Gilda de Lourdes","González, Gilda de Lourdes (Universidad Nacional de Tucumán (UNT))",,"González, Gilda de Lourdes (National University of Tucumán)",0,0,,0.0,https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-831490/latest.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1140786603,37 Earth Sciences; 3701 Atmospheric Sciences; 40 Engineering; 4001 Aerospace Engineering,

non-equilibrium phase diagrams are, in general, qualitatively similar to those
obtained with quenched randomness at equilibrium in past works. Accordingly,
through this dynamics the essential critical behavior at finite temperatures
can be grasped for this model. The advantage is that simulations spend less
computational resources, since the system does not need to be replicated or

Informed by systematic reviews of the English‐ and Latin American academic literature in Spanish and Portuguese and key informant interviews with international stakeholders, this paper fosters global dialogue with some Global South and Global North perspectives about the interconnections of children's rights. It explores current conceptualisations of child participation and protection, and concludes that children's rights will only progress after recognition of limitations inherent to current conceptualisations.","ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS The co‐authors acknowledge with gratitude Dr. Philip Cook&#x27;s engagement during this project phase including conducting several interviews.

Here, we present field and experimental evidence that frictional melting can occur in hydrothermal fluid-rich faults hosted in the continental crust. Pseudotachylytes were found in the >40 km-long Bolfín Fault Zone of the Atacama Fault System, within two ca. 1 m-thick (ultra)cataclastic strands hosted in a damage-zone made of chlorite-epidote-rich hydrothermally altered tonalite. This alteration state indicates that hydrothermal fluids were active during the fault development. Pseudotachylytes, characterized by presenting amygdales, cut and are cut by chlorite-, epidote- and calcite-bearing veins. In turn, crosscutting relationship with the hydrothermal veins indicates pseudotachylytes were formed during this period of fluid activity. Rotary shear experiments conducted on bare surfaces of hydrothermally altered rocks at seismic slip velocities (3 m s-1) resulted in the production of vesiculated pseudotachylytes both at dry and water-pressurized conditions, with melt lubrication as the primary mechanism for fault dynamic weakening. The presented evidence challenges the common hypothesis that pseudotachylytes are limited to fluid-deficient environments, and gives insights into the ancient seismic activity of the system. Both field observations and experimental evidence, indicate that pseudotachylytes may easily be produced in hydrothermal environments, and could be a common co-seismic fault product. Consequently, melt lubrication could be considered one of the most efficient seismic dynamic weakening mechanisms in crystalline basement rocks of the continental crust.","The authors would like to acknowledge the support of ERC CoG No 614705 NOFEAR.

This study examined the effects of different combinations of temperature (12, 15, 18 °C) and salinity (10, 20, 30 psu) on the growth of Chilean strains of these two species. The results showed that the optimal growth conditions for H. akashiwo and P. verruculosa differed, with a maximum rate of 0.99 day-1 obtained at 15 °C and a salinity of 20 psu for H. akashiwo, and a maximum rate of 1.06 day-1 obtained at 18 °C and a salinity of 30 psu for P. verruculosa. Cytotoxic assays (2 × 101 - 2 × 105 cell mL-1; cells, filtrates, and cell lysates) performed at salinities of 20 and 30 psu showed a 100% reduction in the viability of embryonic fish cells exposed to intact cells of H. akashiwo and a 39% reduction following exposure to culture filtrates of P. verruculosa. Differences in the fish-killing mechanisms (direct cell contact vs. extracellular substances) and physiological traits of H. akashiwo and P. verruculosa explain the recent occurrence of very large blooms under contrasting (cold-brackish vs. hot-salty) extreme climate conditions in Chile.","Declaration of competing interest We have not financial interests/personal relationships which may be considered as potential competing interests.

The study of EV secretion and EV characterization remains challenging due to the small size of these particles, a lack of universal EV markers, and sample loss or technical artifacts that are often associated with EV separation techniques. We developed a method for in-cell EV labeling with fluorescent lipids (DiI), followed by DiI-labelled EV characterization in the conditioned medium by imaging flow cytometry (IFC). Direct IFC analysis of EVs in the conditioned medium, after removal of apoptotic bodies and cellular debris, significantly reduces sample processing and loss compared to established methods for EV separation, resulting in improved detection of quantitative changes in EV secretion and subpopulations compared to protocols that rely on EV separation by ultracentrifugation. In conclusion, our optimized protocol for EV labeling and analysis reduces EV sample processing and loss, and is well suited for cell biology studies that focus on modulation of EV secretion by cells in culture.","This work was supported by grants from the Alberta Innovates/Alberta Prion Research Institute (201800001/RES0039430) and Synergies in Alzheimer Disease Research (SynAD) to S.

Les effets de ces mesures, nécessaires pour empêcher la propagation du virus, doivent être étudiées. En particulier, on sait que les quarantaines ont un impact sur la qualité de vie et le bien-être (par exemple, les symptômes associés tels que la dépression, l'anxiété, le stress post-traumatique et autres conséquences psychosociales). En outre, on suppose que ces effets sont plus prononcés dans des populations déjà vulnérables, comme les personnes LGBT. Cet article décrit les principales mesures adoptées par la population LGBT, au Chili, en réponse à la situation de quarantaine pour éviter le COVID-19 et ses conséquences psychosociales.
Méthode : Un échantillonnage non probabiliste a été construit. Une enquête en ligne auto-administrée a permis de recueillir 1181 questionnaires. Il s'agissait de lesbiennes, de gays, de bisexuels et de transgenres âgés de plus de 18 ans au Chili.
Résultats : Près de huit participants sur dix étaient en situation de quarantaine totale. 18,2 % d'entre eux étaient en isolement partiel et seulement 4,6 % n'étaient pas en quarantaine. Le COVID-19 a touché la majorité des participants LGBT et en outre, et en outre, dans une certaine mesure, il a affecté émotionnellement la grande majorité d’entre eux. En d'autres termes. La pandémie a affecté leur vie. Cet impact psychosocial de la COVID a été plus important pour les personnes qui se définissent comme *sexuelles (y compris les homosexuels, les asexués, les pansexuels, les démisexuels).
Discussion : Les mesures prises pour prévenir la transmission du virus affectent de manière significative les personnes LGBT. Les personnes *sexuelles doivent affronter la discrimination dont elles sont les victimes ainsi que la stigmatisation de leur identité dans de nombreux contextes, notamment leur famille.","Les auteurs remercient tous les participants à cette étude pour leurs contributions à cette étude, particulièrement le soutien institutionnel fourni par le Mouvement pour la Diversité Sexuelle (MUMS, acronyme en Espagnol).",,Sexologies,,,,2021-01-01,2021,2021-01-01,2021-01,30,1,34-41,All OA; Green,Article,"Barrientos, Jaime; Guzmán-González, Mónica; Urzúa, Alfonso; Ulloa, Francisco","Barrientos, Jaime (Facultad de Psicología, Universidad Alberto Hurtado, Chile); Guzmán-González, Mónica (Escuela de Psicología, Universidad Católica del Norte, Chile); Urzúa, Alfonso (Escuela de Psicología, Universidad Católica del Norte, Chile); Ulloa, Francisco (Facultad de Ciencias Sociales, Universidad de Chile, Chile & Movimiento por la Diversidad Sexual, Chile)","Barrientos, Jaime (Alberto Hurtado University)","Barrientos, Jaime (Alberto Hurtado University); Guzmán-González, Mónica (Catholic University of the North); Urzúa, Alfonso (Catholic University of the North); Ulloa, Francisco (University of Chile)",3,1,,,https://europepmc.org/articles/pmc7775649?pdf=render,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1134272800,,

However, high energy consumption and associated greenhouse gas emissions are some of the main environmental impacts. This is notable for many arid and semi-arid countries where desalination and water recycling are considered options for ensuring water resources availability. This research presents the incorporation of the quantification of greenhouse gas emissions generated during the operation of desalination and wastewater treatment plants in the assessment of water stress levels using the water stress indicator adopted by the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. Chile was chosen as a case study, as it is a country where there is a considerable difference between the availability of conventional water sources and the water demand, and the electrical grid is fed mainly by fossil fuels. The methodology proposed allows calculating the indirect greenhouse gas emissions due to electrical consumption for the operation of desalination and wastewater treatment plants, and the direct greenhouse gas emissions coming from biological processes used in wastewater treatment plants. The results showed that Chilean arid climate zones will not experience water stress in the future at the regional level, mainly because of the installation of several desalination plants by 2030. Meanwhile, recycled water from the urban sector will slightly contribute to the reduction in the level of water stress in almost all Chilean regions by 2030. Moreover, desalination and wastewater treatment plant will contribute only between 0.34% and 0.75% of total greenhouse gas emitted in Chile by 2030. Therefore, the operation of these industrial systems for facing water scarcity problems in northern and central zones of Chile is a suitable alternative because it does not generate large environmental problems.",Declaration of competing interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.,,The Science of The Total Environment,,,Chile; Dehydration; Greenhouse Effect; Greenhouse Gases; Humans; Seawater; Wastewater; Water Purification,2021-11-22,2021,2021-11-22,2022-04,818,,151853,All OA; Green,Article,"Herrera-León, Sebastián; Cruz, Constanza; Negrete, Moira; Chacana, Jaime; Cisternas, Luis A; Kraslawski, Andrzej","Herrera-León, Sebastián (Departamento de Ingeniería Química, Universidad Católica del Norte, Antofagasta, Chile; School of Engineering Science, Lappeenranta-Lahti University of Technology (LUT University), Lappeenranta, Finland.

Here we investigate what factors drive diversification in two tropical, morphologically similar macrolichens that occupy a similar range but differ in altitudinal and habitat preferences, testing for isolation by distance (IBD), environment (IBE), and fragmentation (IBF).   Location Neotropics, Hawaii, Macaronesia.   Taxon  Sticta andina , S. scabrosa (Peltigeraceae).    Methods We analysed 395 specimens from 135 localities, using the fungal ITS barcoding marker to assess phylogenetic diversification, through maximum likelihood tree reconstruction, TCS haplotype networks, and Tajima's D. Mantel tests were employed to detect structure in genetic vs. geographic, environmental, and fragmentation distances. Habitat preferences were quantitatively assessed by statistical analysis of locality‐based BIOclim variables.   Results  Sticta andina exhibited high phenotypic variation and reticulate phylogenetic diversity across its range, whereas the phenotypically uniform S. scabrosa contained two main haplotypes, one unique to Hawaii. Sticta andina is restricted to well‐preserved andine forests and paramos, naturally fragmented habitats due to disruptive topology, whereas S. scabrosa thrives in lowland to lower montane zones in exposed or disturbed microsites, representing a continuous habitat. Sticta scabrosa showed IBD only across its full range (separating the Hawaiian population) but not within continental Central and South America, there exhibiting a negative Tajima's D. Sticta andina did not exhibit IBD but IBE at continental level and IBF in the northern Andes.    Main conclusions  Autecology, particularly preference for either low or high altitudes, indirectly drives phylogenetic diversification. Low diversification in the low altitude species, S. scabrosa , can be attributed to rapid expansion and effective gene flow across a more or less continuous niche due to disturbance tolerance. In contract, high diversification in the high altitude species, S. andina , can be explained by niche differentiation (IBE) and fragmentation (IBF) caused by the Andean uplift.","ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS Funding for field and laboratory work for this study was provided by a grant from the National Science Foundation (NSF) to The Field Museum: DEB‐1354884 ‘Collaborative Research: Evolution, Diversification, and Conservation of a Megadiverse Flagship Lichen Genus’ (PI HTL, CoPI RL).

Chagas Disease is the leading cause of death associated with heart disease in Latin America, affecting mostly low-resources populations and the presence of the vector is associated to poor house constructions. Methods: A multi-institutional project named “Alliances for the elimination of Chagas in Central America” was created to help reduce the incidence of the disease in the region.  Each institution performing specific role including aspects of vector control, quality of housing, surveillance implementation, diagnosis and treatment of individuals, health promotion, and training of human resources. Results: Eleven villages were entomologically evaluated; five villages were found to have high infestation rates (>20%), three had average infestation rates (10-20%) and three had low-infestation rates (<10%), coinciding with the type of risk-dwelling found in each of one. Additionally, all the villages had colonization rates greater than 50%, and several showed important levels of triatomine overcrowding. This high colonization dynamic represents a high risk of vector transmission of Chagas disease; it was necessary to improve the household so as to make them refractory to infestation, reducing those characteristics that are appropriate for colonization. Serological tests carried out in two of the 11 villages showed that children under five years of age were not infected and the prevalence of infection was higher in women than men, showing the importance of women in the disease transmission dynamics, making education and empowerment directed towards women critical for transmission control.

The different garments and ornaments come from the excavation of two important pre-Columbian cemeteries of the Tarapacá region: Tarapacá-40 attributed to the Formative period (1100 BC - 660 AD) and Pica-8 to the Late Intermediate period (900 - 1450 AD). For the first time, a multi-analytical approach with non-invasive techniques using Fiber Optics Reflectance Spectroscopy (FORS), Attenuated Total Reflection Infrared Spectroscopy (FT-IR) and Surface-enhanced Raman Scattering (SERS) were applied on samples of less than 2 cm of length for physicochemical characterization of the raw materials and the dyes employed in the textile production of northern Chile. The fibers are from animal origin. Blue, green, and yellow are identified as indigo, but we cannot discard a mixture with other dyes to vary hue and shade; while carminic acid and alizarin - to a lesser extent - are found on red, orange and brown samples. This research provides new elements for the discussion about the textile technology developed in this desertic region, its changes and continuities along with the history. Our results are compared to recent findings on neighbouring regions from northern Chile, to improve the current knowledge and discuss the existence of dyeing textile cultural traditions.",,,Research Square,,,,2021-02-25,2021,2021-02-25,,,,,All OA; Green,Preprint,"Sepulveda, Marcela; Urzúa, Cecilia Lemp; Vega, José Cárcamo-; Gónzalez, Edgar Casanova-; Rojas, Miguel Ángel Maynez-; Gutiérrez, Sebatian; Ballester, Benjamin; Sil, José Luis Rulvacaba-","Sepulveda, Marcela (Pontifical Catholic University of Chile: Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile); Urzúa, Cecilia Lemp (Universidad Austral de Chile); Vega, José Cárcamo- (Universidad de Tarapacá: Universidad de Tarapaca); Gónzalez, Edgar Casanova- (CONACYT: Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia); Rojas, Miguel Ángel Maynez- (Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México: Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico); Gutiérrez, Sebatian (Universidad de Tarapacá: Universidad de Tarapaca); Ballester, Benjamin (Universite Paris 1 Pantheon-Sorbonne); Sil, José Luis Rulvacaba- (Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México: Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico)",,"Sepulveda, Marcela (Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile); Urzúa, Cecilia Lemp (Austral University of Chile); Vega, José Cárcamo- (University of Tarapacá); Gónzalez, Edgar Casanova- (CONACYT: Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia); Rojas, Miguel Ángel Maynez- (National Autonomous University of Mexico); Gutiérrez, Sebatian (University of Tarapacá); Ballester, Benjamin (Université Paris 1 Panthéon-Sorbonne); Sil, José Luis Rulvacaba- (National Autonomous University of Mexico)",0,0,,0.0,https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-03241658/file/Sep%C3%BAlveda%20et%20al%202021%20-%20Colors%20and%20dyes%20of%20archaeological%20textiles%20from%20Tarapac%C3%A1%20in%20the%20Atacama%20Desert.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1135741077,"43 History, Heritage and Archaeology; 4301 Archaeology; 4302 Heritage, Archive and Museum Studies",

In particular, the crisis highlights the need for local communities reliant on rural tourism to enhance their resilience to the risks simultaneously generated by the pandemic and accelerating impacts of climate change. This is important as the effects of these hazards are intertwined and cannot be treated in isolation. We explore community responses and resilience through case study Quebrada Verde, Peru, a small rural community in the Andes Mountains. Specifically, we report on a qualitative examination involving in-depth semi-structured interviews and focus groups with key informants from the community, supplemented by relevant documentary analysis. Drawing on community resilience and social networks perspectives, we find that the community's preparedness to both threats is unbalanced. On one hand, the community eco-tourism system has developed sufficient tools to adapt to the temporary effects of COVID-19 derived from the community's self-organization skills and topophilia. Specifically, the community possesses a cohesive social structure, it has a solid cultural identity rooted in its customs and traditions, and maintains a social humour that enables it to see the positive aspects of adversity. On the other hand, the analysis of the measures towards strengthening the resilience to climate change delivers mixed results. In particular, the relationship that the community has built with other local organizations to successfully prevent and react to climate change is weak. Therefore, stronger efforts towards bridging this gap must be implemented in order to sustain the wider social network of such organizations, of which the community is a part. This would enable further development and implementation of appropriate risk management strategies to counteract climate change, enhancing the community's resilience of its eco-tourism system to this emergent threat. Importantly, this finding might be relevant to other local communities seeking to improve their resilience to COVID-19 and climate change.",Declaration of competing interest None.,,Journal of Hospitality and Tourism Management,,,,2021-08-05,2021,2021-08-05,2021-09,48,,416-427,All OA; Green,Article,"Gabriel-Campos, Edwin; Werner-Masters, Katarzyna; Cordova-Buiza, Franklin; Paucar-Caceres, Alberto","Gabriel-Campos, Edwin (Universidad Continental, Peru); Werner-Masters, Katarzyna (Manchester Metropolitan University, UK); Cordova-Buiza, Franklin (Universidad Privada del Norte, Peru); Paucar-Caceres, Alberto (Manchester Metropolitan University, UK)","Paucar-Caceres, Alberto (Manchester Metropolitan University)","Gabriel-Campos, Edwin (Universidad Continental); Werner-Masters, Katarzyna (Manchester Metropolitan University); Cordova-Buiza, Franklin (Private University of the North); Paucar-Caceres, Alberto (Manchester Metropolitan University)",75,51,,38.5,https://repositorio.upn.edu.pe/bitstream/11537/28458/1/Community%20eco-tourism%20in%20rural%20Peru_Resilience%20and%20adaptive%20capacities%20.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1140208561,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3504 Commercial Services; 3506 Marketing; 3508 Tourism",11 Sustainable Cities and Communities; 13 Climate Action

However, few population-based seroprevalence surveys have been conducted to quantify attack rates and characterize drivers of transmission.Methods: We conducted a population-based cross-sectional study to assess the seroprevalence of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in ten cities in Colombia between September and December, 2020. The study involved multi-stage cluster sampling at each city. Participants provided a serum sample and answered a demographic and risk factor questionnaire. Prior infection by SARS-CoV-2 was ascertained using the ""SARS-CoV-2 Total (COV2T) Advia Centaur - Siemens"" chemiluminescence assay.Findings: A total of 17863 participants from 7075 households participated in the study. Seroprevalence varied substantially between cities, ranging from 21% (95%CI 16-25%) in Medellín to 78% (95%CI 65-91%) in Guapi. There were no differences in seroprevalence by sex, but seropositivity was lower in adults 60 years or older and higher in certain ethnic groups. There was substantial heterogeneity in seroprevalence within cities, driven to a large extent by a strong association between socio-economic stratum and seropositivity.Interpretation: Colombia has been one of the Latin American countries most affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. This study documented very high attack rates in several Colombian cities by the end of 2020 and identified key drivers of heterogeneities including ethnicity and socio-economic stratum. Few studies of seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 have been conducted in Latin America, and therefore this study contributes to the fundamental understanding of the pandemic in the region.",,,SSRN Electronic Journal,,,,2021,2021,,,,,,All OA; Green,Preprint,"Mercado-Reyes, Marcela; Malagón-Rojas, Jeadran N.; Zapata, Silvana; Rodriguez-Barraquer, Isabel; Wiesner, Magdalena; Toloza-Pérez, Yesith Guillermo; Cucunubá, Zulma M.; Hernández-Ortíz, Juan P.; Acosta-Reyes, Jorge; Estupiñan, Maria I.; Galindo, Marisol; Rubio, Vivian V.; Muñoz-Galindo, Lyda; Osorio-Velázquez, Ericson Gabriel; Ibáñez-Pinilla, Edgar A.; Barrera, Eliana L Parra; del Pilar Bermúdez, Andrea; Quinche, Gianni G.; Puerto-Castro, Gloria M.; Villar, Luis A.; Franco-Muñoz, Carlos; Castellanos, Jaime; Navarro-Lechuga, Edgar; Valle, Edna Margarita; Pinto, Nelson; Gore-Saravia, Nancy; ARANGO, Juan Daniel OVIEDO; Ospina-Martínez, Martha Lucía; Miranda, Maria C.","Mercado-Reyes, Marcela (Independent); Malagón-Rojas, Jeadran N.

the possible representations around fixed points, while their torsion subgroups
are isomorphic to the direct sum of the Bogomolov multipliers of the Weyl
groups of representatives of conjugacy classes of all subgroups of $G$. We
present an alternative proof of the fact that surfaces with free actions which
induce non-trivial elements in the Bogomolov multiplier of the group cannot
equivariantly bound. This result permits us to show that the 2-dimensional

In this contribution, we present the Colombian Geochronological Database (CGD), which contains a curated compilation of ca. 67,406 individual published U-Th-Pb, K-Ar, Ar-Ar, Rb-Sr, Sm-Nd, Lu-Hf, Fission-track, U-Th-He, and Re-Os mineral and whole rock ages that are reported in the published literature. Each date includes geographic coordinates, geological setting, petrologic and chemical information extracted from the respective publications. The structure of the database provides a powerful interface for constructing queries and allows searching and extracting information on geographic domains, provinces, stratigraphic units, isotopic systems, date interpretations, references, etc. This information establishes a framework for regional and global geological interpretations with geochronological, stratigraphic, structural and palaeogeographic implications. With the present effort we present to the geoscience community a clear insight, from a regional perspective, to the geology and tectonics of Colombia since Precambrian times. The comparison of all (detrital and magmatic) single zircon U-Pb dates from the Colombian (Gondwana sourced) geochronological database with the Global and North American (Laurentia sourced) databases provides a temporal constraint on the evolution of the South American continent. U-Pb zircon ages in Colombia define 13 peak clusters centred at 1767, 1530, 1325, 1178, 1007, 605,540, 468, 271, 237, 182, 76 and 10 Ma but of those, only few have a good correlation in all three databases: 1007 (Grenvillian/Orinoquian/Putumayo Orogeny), 605 (Braziliano/Pan-African Orogeny), 468 (Famatinian/Taconic Orogeny), and 182 Ma (Break-up of Pangea) zircon peaks. This correlation suggests that some tectonic events in Colombia are global and might represent crustal production and preservation while the other peaks might just represent local arc magmatic events.","We thank Los Andes University and especially the Faculty of Science and the Department of Geoscience for their support during the Semillero stage as well as other students who helped in our initial compilation stage (Daniel Guarin, Daniel Reyes, Daniela Gallo, Luisa Acosta, Luisa Rengifo, Sebastian Duran, Sergio Silva, Nicolas Palacios, Maria Jose Delgado, Luis Fernando Posada and Tatiana Aldana).

                  Snakebite envenoming is a Neglected Tropical Disease affecting mainly deprived populations. Its burden is normally underestimated because patients prefer to seek for traditional medicine. Thus, applying strategies to optimize disease’ management and treatment delivery is difficult. We propose a framework to estimate snakebite incidence at a fine political scale based on available data, testing it in Colombia. First, we produced snakebite fine-scale risk maps based on the most medically important venomous snake species (
                  Bothrops asper
                  and
                  B. atrox
                  ). We validated them with reported data in the country. Then, we proposed a generalized mixed effect model that estimates total incidence based on produced risk maps, poverty indexes, and an accessibility score that reflects the struggle to reach a medical center. Finally, we calibrated our model with national snakebite reported data from 2010 to 2019 using a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm and estimated underreporting based on the total incidence estimation. Our results suggest that 10.3% of total snakebite cases are not reported in Colombia and do not seek medical attention. The Orinoco and Amazonian regions (east of Colombia) share a high snakebite risk with a high underreporting. Our work highlights the importance of multidisciplinary approaches to face snakebite.","We thank to the natural history museums of the Universidad Industrial de Santander (UIS), Universidad de los Andes, Institución Universitaria ITM, Universidad del Tolima, Universidad del Valle, Universidad de la Salle (MLS), Instituto Nacional de Salud (INS), Universidad del Magdalena and Universidad Javeriana.

702,pub.1133397875,10.1029/2020jb020242,,,A Systematic Approach to Mapping Regimes of Earthquake‐Induced Static Stress Changes Acting on Magmatic Pathways,"Abstract Large earthquakes alter the crustal stress field across great distances (hundreds to thousands of kilometers) over geologically short timescales (seconds to years). These stress changes can affect magmatic systems, triggering (or suppressing) volcanic unrest and eruption, along with other deeper processes. We use simple kinematic source models in an isotropic elastic half‐space to assess earthquake‐induced static stress changes (>1 kPa) over the entire thickness of the lithosphere and consider the implications for magma ascent and storage. Modeling subduction zone earthquakes, we calculate static normal stress changes with depth on three mutually perpendicular end‐member magma pathways: vertical arc‐parallel, vertical arc‐perpendicular, and horizontal. From this, we define seven stress change regimes within the adjacent volcanic arc. Three of these regimes may strongly encourage magma ascent in dykes by inducing unclamping (decreased compressive normal stress) of vertical pathways which increases in magnitude toward the surface and clamping of horizontal pathways. Two of the regimes may encourage stalling and storage of magma in sills near the base of the crust by inducing unclamping of horizontal pathways at depth. The spatial distribution of the regimes is largely dependent on earthquake magnitude, but also varies with slip distribution and interface dip. We show how the responses of magmatic systems to earthquakes also depends on the stress change magnitude and the state of the magmatic system, with a greater impact expected for larger stress changes acting on weaker, more thermally mature systems.
Key Points    We map seven normal stress change regimes (>1 kPa) on three perpendicular magma pathways after subduction thrust earthquakes   Slip magnitude, distribution, and dip control regime distribution, with hotter, mature arcs more sensitive to stress changes   We show how rapid stress field variations caused by earthquakes could affect patterns of magma ascent and storage","This work was supported by the Natural Environment Research Council [NE/L002434/1].

Blooms of the two species coincided during summer 2019 in a highly stratified fjord system (Puyuhuapi, Chilean Patagonia). High vertical resolution measurements of physical parameters were carried out during 48 h sampling to i) explore physiological status (e.g., division rates, toxin content) and ii) illustrate the fine scale distribution of D. acuta and D. acuminata populations with a focus on water column structure and co-occurring plastid-bearing ciliates. The species-specific resources and regulators defining the realized niches (sensu Hutchinson) of the two species were identified. Differences in vertical distribution, daily vertical migration and in situ division rates (with record values, 0.76 d-1, in D. acuta), in response to the environmental conditions and potential prey availability, revealed their niche differences. The Outlying Mean Index (OMI) analysis showed that the realized niche of D. acuta (cell maximum 7 × 103 cells L-1 within the pycnocline) was characterized by sub-surface estuarine waters (salinity 23 - 25), lower values of turbulence and PAR, and a narrow niche breath. In contrast, the realized niche of D. acuminata (cell maximum 6.8 × 103 cells L-1 just above the pycnocline) was characterized by fresher (salinity 17 - 20) outflowing surface waters, with higher turbulence and light intensity and a wider niche breadth. Results from OMI and PERMANOVA analyses of co-occurring microplanktonic ciliates were compatible with the hypothesis of species such as those from genera Pseudotontonia and Strombidium constituting an alternative ciliate prey to Mesodinium. The D. acuta cell maximum was associated with DSP (OA and DTX-1) toxins and pectenotoxins; that of D. acuminata only with pectenotoxins. Results presented here contribute to a better understanding of the environmental drivers of species-specific blooms of Dinophysis and management of their distinct effects in Southern Chile.","This work was funded by ANID-FONDECYT 11170682 from the National Agency of Research and Development (ANID), Chile, and by projects REDES170101 and REDI170575 from ANID International Cooperation Programme.

Are data subjects able to determine themselves in this data-driven society? The emerging debates about autonomy and communal responsibility in the context of data access or protection, highlight a pressing imperative to re-imagine the ‘self’ in the digital space. Empowerment, autonomy, sovereignty, human centricity, are all terms often associated with the notion of digital self-determination in current policy language. More academics, industry experts, policymakers, regulators are now advocating self-determination in a data-driven world. The attitudes to self-determination range from alienating data as property through to broad considerations of communal access and enrichment. Digital self-determination is a complex notion to be viewed from different perspectives and in unique spaces, re-shaping what we understand as self-determination in the non-digital world. This paper explores the notion of digital self-determination by presenting a foundational theoretical framework based on pre-existent self-determination theories and exploring the implications of the digital society in the determination of the self. Only by better appreciating and critically framing the discussion of digital self-determination, is it possible to engage in trustworthy data spaces, and ensure ethical human centric approaches when living in a data driven society.",,,SSRN Electronic Journal,,,,2021,2021,,,,,,All OA; Green,Preprint,"Remolina, Nydia; Findlay, Mark","Remolina, Nydia (Singapore Management University - Centre for AI & Data Governance); Findlay, Mark (Singapore Management University - School of Law; Singapore Management University - Centre for AI & Data Governance)",,"Remolina, Nydia (Singapore Management University); Findlay, Mark (Singapore Management University)",8,6,,6.06,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1137450135,"47 Language, Communication and Culture; 4701 Communication and Media Studies",

Despite the undeniable improvement in cancer diagnostics and therapy, there is an urgent need for new therapeutic and preventive strategies with improved efficacy and fewer side effects. In this context, purinergic signaling emerges as an interesting candidate as a cancer biomarker or therapeutic target. There is abundant evidence that tumor cells have significant changes in the expression of purinergic receptors, which comprise the G-protein coupled P2Y and AdoR families of receptors and the ligand-gated ion channel P2X receptors. Tumor cells also exhibit changes in the expression of nucleotidases and other enzymes involved in nucleotide metabolism, and the concentrations of extracellular nucleotides are significantly higher than those observed in normal cells. In this review, we will focus on the potential role of purinergic signaling in the ten most lethal cancers (lung, breast, colorectal, liver, stomach, prostate, cervical, esophagus, pancreas, and ovary), which together are responsible for more than 5 million annual deaths.",,,Purinergic Signalling,,,"Adenosine Triphosphate; Animals; Autocrine Communication; Humans; Neoplasms; Paracrine Communication; Receptors, Purinergic; Signal Transduction",2021-05-12,2021,2021-05-12,2021-09,17,3,345-370,All OA; Green,Article,"Reyna-Jeldes, M.; Díaz-Muñoz, M.; Madariaga, J.

The purpose of the qualitative exploration was to gain an understanding of students’ perceptions of the adoption of social media, namely Facebook and Twitter, in an academic library setting. The study applied the constructs as described by the UTAUT, namely, performance expectancy, effort expectancy, social influence and facilitating conditions, to explore students’ perceived behavioural intentions to use social media. A sample of 30 students were selected from two universities, one in Belgium (University of Antwerp) and one in South Africa (University of Limpopo), to gain better insight of the students’ perceptions regarding the adoption and use of social media, in particular Facebook and Twitter, by the academic libraries at these two universities. The study showed that the adoption of social media is positively influenced by effort expectancy, performance expectancy and social influence. A major challenge reported by most respondents at the University of Limpopo was poor internet access and the non-adoption of Facebook and Twitter, whilst respondents at the University of Antwerp had mixed feelings about the adoption of Facebook and Twitter for scholarly communication.",,,Communicatio,,,,2021-01-02,2021,2021-03-11,2021-01-02,47,1,76-94,All OA; Green,Article,"Williams, Marion Lucille; Saunderson, Ian Peter; Dhoest, Alexander","Williams, Marion Lucille (University of Limpopo, South Africa); Saunderson, Ian Peter (University of Limpopo, South Africa); Dhoest, Alexander (University of Antwerp, Belgium)","Williams, Marion Lucille (University of Limpopo)","Williams, Marion Lucille (University of Limpopo); Saunderson, Ian Peter (University of Limpopo); Dhoest, Alexander (University of Antwerp)",12,5,,9.09,https://repository.uantwerpen.be/docstore/d:irua:5027,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1136335189,"47 Language, Communication and Culture; 4701 Communication and Media Studies",3 Good Health and Well Being

The explanation for such low efficacy is unclear. This study examined the associations of parasite genetic variations with binding affinity to human immunological proteins including human leukocyte antigen (HLA) and T cell receptors (TCR) involved in RTS,S-induced immune responses.    Methods  Multiplicity of infections was determined by amplicon deep sequencing of merozoite surface protein 1 ( PfMSP1 ). Genetic variations in the C-terminal of circumsporozoite protein ( PfMSP1 ) gene were examined across 88 samples of P. falciparum collected from high and low transmission settings of Ghana. Binding interactions of PfMSP1 variants and HLA/TCR were analyzed using NetChop and HADDOCK predictions. Anti-CSP IgG levels were measured by ELISA in a subset of 10 samples.    Findings  High polyclonality was detected among P. falciparum infections. A total 27 CSP haplotypes were detected among samples. A significant correlation was detected between the CSP and MSP multiplicity of infection (MOI). No clear clustering of haplotypes was observed by geographic regions. The number of genetic differences in PfCSP between 3D7 and non-3D7 variants does not influence binding interactions to HLA/T cells nor anti-CSP IgG levels. Nevertheless, PfCSP peptide length significantly affects its molecular weight and binding affinity to the HLA.    Interpretations  The presence of multiple non-3D7 strains among P. falciparum infections in Ghana impact the effectiveness of RTS,S. Longer PfCSP peptides may elicit a stronger immune response and should be considered in future version RTS,S. The molecular mechanisms of RTS,S cell-mediated immune responses related to longer CSP peptides warrants further investigations.","We thank the field team from The University of Ghana for their technical assistance in sample collection; the communities and hospitals, for their support and willingness to participate in this research; and undergraduates at The University of North Carolina Charlotte who were involved in sample processing.","This research was funded by the 2019 University of North Carolina at Charlotte Faculty Research Grant.

Additionally, the supply has a moderate impeding influence on water-use efficiency efforts. Consequently, we draft a priority ladder for water provision in water-scarce regions to: ensure access; reduce consumption; apply reuse; and explore renewable water resources – and if a combination of previous steps is insufficient, desalination may be applied to meet water supply shortages.","Our gratitude is extended to those interviewed in Chile, whose participation in interviews was crucial to this investigation: Alday Walter, Buljan Muñoz Hrvoj, Corvacho Betzabe, Corvalan Neira Mario, Gómez Corral Jaime, Gonzalez Dias Carlos, Guerra Carlos, Herrera Patricio, Honores Jorge, Jeria Zuvic Vicente, Merino Patricia, Jorquera Carlos, Letelier Andres, Merino Nicole, Nunez Urrutia Paula, Portilla Norberto, Quiquincha Claudio, Remonsellez Fuentes Francisco, Reyes Arturo, Rodriquez Marcela, Valencia Santander Patricio.

289,pub.1139246595,10.1063/5.0048692,,,Nonreciprocity of spin waves in magnetic nanotubes with helical equilibrium magnetization,"Spin waves (SWs) in magnetic nanotubes have shown interesting nonreciprocal properties in their dispersion relation, group velocity, frequency linewidth, and attenuation lengths. The reported chiral effects are similar to those induced by the Dzyaloshinskii–Moriya interaction but originating from the dipole–dipole interaction. Here, we show that the isotropic-exchange interaction can also induce chiral effects in the SW transport; the so-called Berry phase of SWs. We demonstrate that with the application of magnetic fields, the nonreciprocity of the different SW modes can be tuned between the fully dipolar governed and the fully exchange governed cases, as they are directly related to the underlying equilibrium state. In the helical state, due to the combined action of the two effects, every single sign combination of the azimuthal and axial wave vectors leads to different dispersions, allowing for a very sophisticated tuning of the SW transport. A disentanglement of the dipole–dipole and exchange contributions so far was not reported for the SW transport in nanotubes. Furthermore, we propose a device based on coplanar waveguides that would allow to selectively measure the exchange or dipole induced SW nonreciprocities. In the context of magnonic applications, our results might encourage further developments in the emerging field of 3D magnonic devices using curved magnetic membranes.",J.A.O. gratefully acknowledges the financial support from the Fondecyt Iniciación Grant No. 11190184.

The ring in its topological nontrivial and trivial phases is analyzed to show that the tunneling conductance, shot noise, and Fano factor present unique characteristics to distinguish the hallmark of MBSs. The findings are reinforced by taking advantage of the full correspondence between the quantum topological interferometer and a quantum‐dot effectively coupled to a single Majorana state in a straight topological superconductor wire configuration. It is shown that besides the characteristic zero‐bias conductance and the already known shot noise features, the Fano factor provides significant information to distinguish the MBSs presence.","Acknowledgements J.A.O and P.A.O gratefully acknowledge financial support by the Fondecyt IniciaciŮn grant No 11190184 and FONDECYT Regular grant 1201876, respectively.

Specifically, the kinetic energy for the scalar field Lagrangian is that of the Chiral model and defines a two-dimensional maximally symmetric space with negative curvature. For the background space we assume the locally rotational spacetime which describes the Bianchi I, the Bianchi III and the Kantowski–Sachs anisotropic spaces. We work on the H -normalization and we investigate the stationary points and their stability. For the exponential potential we find a new exact solution which describes an anisotropic inflationary solution. The anisotropic inflation is always unstable, while future attractors are the scaling inflationary solution or the hyperbolic inflation. For scalar field potential different from the exponential, the de Sitter universe exists.","The research of AG was funded by Agencia Nacional de Investigación y Desarrollo - ANID through the program FONDECYT Regular Grant No. 1200293.

Narrative maps are a visual representation framework that can aid analysts in this process. They allow analysts to understand the big picture of a narrative, uncover new relationships between events, and model connections between storylines. As a sensemaking tool, narrative maps have applications in intelligence analysis, misinformation modeling, and computational journalism. In this work, we seek to understand how analysts construct narrative maps in order to improve narrative map representation and extraction methods. We perform an experiment with a data set of news articles. Our main contribution is an analysis of how analysts construct narrative maps. The insights extracted from our study can be used to design narrative map visualizations, extraction algorithms, and visual analytics tools to support the sensemaking process.",We would like to thank the InfoVis Lab at Virginia Tech and the Social Computing Lab at the University of Washington for their valuable comments and feedback on early drafts of the paper.

In spite of the emergence of vaccines that mitigate illness and death, no effective measures exist to control the contagion. Testing, tracing, and isolation (TTI) in conjunction with disciplined social distancing were expected to achieve negligible-contagion levels and avoid, for example, superspreading events 1. However, the logic sustaining these strategieshas proven insufficient and a commitment to implementing them leads to controversial ethical challenges. This paper focuses on the effectiveness of contagion control policies that are independent of the ethical challenges that the chosen strategies pose, and of the complex realities of different countries, that are applicable both country-wide and at the local level. Even more relevant is that our performance measure indicators are given by variables that provide an early warning as to when the epidemic might expand, despite some temporal case decrements. We show that if case reduction is not sustained for more than 7-14 days, the risk growth is considerable, warranting immediate attention and action. To draw these conclusions, our research does not only follow the contagion change but its velocity, and applies these indicators to a sample of prototypical countries, finding strong evidence for our conclusions. The latter are independent of different applied NPI and country differences, suggesting that they can be used as ""universal"" indicators for epidemic control policies. Our main conclusion is that if the spread reduction is lost during one, or at most two weeks, immediate measures have to be implemented to avoid undesirable scenarios.",,,Research Square,,,,2021-03-17,2021,2021-03-17,,,,,All OA; Green,Preprint,"Gonzalez, Rafael; Pablo, Moya; Bringa, Eduardo; Bacigalupe, Gonzalo; Ramirez-Santana, Muriel; Kiwi, Miguel","Gonzalez, Rafael (Universidad Mayor); Pablo, Moya (University of Chile); Bringa, Eduardo (University of Mendoza); Bacigalupe, Gonzalo (University of Massachusetts Boston); Ramirez-Santana, Muriel (Catholic University of the North); Kiwi, Miguel (University of Chile)",,"Gonzalez, Rafael (Universidad Mayor); Pablo, Moya (University of Chile); Bringa, Eduardo (University of Mendoza); Bacigalupe, Gonzalo (University of Massachusetts Boston); Ramirez-Santana, Muriel (Catholic University of the North); Kiwi, Miguel (University of Chile)",0,0,,0.0,https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-305039/latest.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1136475827,50 Philosophy and Religious Studies; 5001 Applied Ethics,3 Good Health and Well Being

As host resistance is an efficient tool to control diseases, the findings of a previous report showed that some corn hybrids are resistant to D. maidis . In this work, we assessed the probing behavior of D. maidis on susceptible and resistant corn hybrids using EPG (Electrical Penetration Graph) technology. Fifteen-day-old females were monitored for 20 hours, with access to hybrids DK390, DK670, DK79-10, and DK72-10. Hybrids DK390 and DK72-10 showed resistance to D. maidis in phloem, since insects feeding on these hybrids presented more salivation events in phloem without subsequent ingestion, which are seen as failed attempts to ingest. A reduction of the total duration of phloem ingestion was observed, and accordingly of the time spent by insects with access to these hybrids on xylem ingestion. The hybrid DK390 also had mesophyll resistance, seen as less probing time and a higher number of probes of short duration. These findings support and are consistent with previous research, providing useful information to characterize maize hybrids resistant to D. maidis , and so to corn stunt.","To Jazmín and Antonella Carpane, for their love, time, and patience while carrying out this work.

251,pub.1137305428,10.1029/2021gl092889,,,The Crustal Stress Field Inferred From Focal Mechanisms in Northern Chile,"Abstract We ​study the spatial variability of the crustal stress in northern Chile. A margin‐parallel compressive crustal stress regime is inferred along the coastal region between 19° and 23.5°S, similar to stress observations in Cascadia and Japan. The Andean Precordillera shows a distinct stress field associated with a strike‐slip faulting regime around 21°S. These results are constrained by over a decade of observations, for which earthquake catalogs report thousands of events in the continental crust. We present focal mechanisms for 817 of these crustal earthquakes, including mechanism qualities. The best mechanisms were grouped and inverted to infer the stress‐field variability. We interpret the margin‐parallel compression to be caused by the concave shape of the margin and the locking of the plate interface. The inferred strike‐slip regime in the Andes agrees with previous studies and has been proposed to be mostly caused by local stresses imposed by a thicker crust.
Plain Language Summary New observations of thousands of earthquakes occurring within the continental crust (depths <60 km) in northern Chile provide an opportunity to study the tectonic forces acting in this region of the South American continent. We obtain fault orientations and slip directions of 817 crustal earthquakes. The orientations are used to understand the stresses that cause deformation of the crust. With hundreds of earthquakes studied, we can resolve differences in the stress between coastal and inland regions: The coastal region experiences a compression along an approximate north‐south direction. Further east, near the Andes mountains, compression is nearly east‐west, almost parallel to the collision direction of the tectonic plates. This could be mostly due to local stresses acting in higher topography regions. Here, earthquakes occur mostly in nearly vertical faults with slip in the horizontal direction. Conversely, the compression near the coast is likely due to the bending of this region along the coastline, in combination with the locking on the plate interface between the Nazca and South American tectonic plates. The results are remarkably similar to western North America and Japan, where the shape of plate boundaries cause similar stresses.
Key Points    We resolve spatial variability of the regional crustal stress field in northern Chile based on focal mechanisms of crustal earthquakes   Margin‐parallel compressional crustal stress is observed along the coast and may be due to the concave margin and friction on the interface   A strike‐slip regime is observed toward the Andean Precordillera at 21°S, where the elevated topography could affect the local stress","This research was supported by Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC) grants and funding from the University of Victoria.

The diameter, structure, morphology, composition and element valence state of the wear scar were obtained by multifunctional universal tool microscope, scanning electron microscope and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Result In the RGO-MoS2 white oil system, when 0.4 wt% RGO-MoS2 was added, the anti-friction effect was the best, and the average friction coefficient (AFC) reduced by 21.8%. When 0.2 wt% RGO-MoS2 was added, the anti-wear effect was the optimal, and the average wear scar diameter (AWSD) decreased by 12.4%. In the OA-RGO-MoS2 white oil system, when 0.2 wt% OA-RGO-MoS2 was added, the anti-friction and anti-wear effects were the best, and the AFC reduced by 33.3%, and AWSD reduced by 14.1%. Conclusion Compared with RGO-MoS2, OA-RGO-MoS2 has a higher degree of graphitization, larger interlayer spacing, lower degree of layered accumulation, higher MoS2 load, and weaker thermal stability. Both lubricating additives have good anti-friction and anti-wear effects at low concentrations, and the anti-friction and anti-wear effects are more prominent after being modified by oleic acid. Analysis of friction mechanism shows that a lubricating protective film containing iron, oxygen, molybdenum, carbon, and sulfur is formed through adsorption or tribochemical reaction during the friction process, which improves the lubrication state and plays a role in reducing friction and anti-wear.",,,Research Square,,,,2021-11-09,2021,2021-11-09,,,,,All OA; Green,Preprint,"LIU, TianXia; Qin, jian; Wang, Jian; Li, jing","LIU, TianXia (North Minzu University); Qin, jian (North Minzu University); Wang, Jian (North Minzu University); Li, jing (North Minzu University)",,"LIU, TianXia (North Minzu University); Qin, jian (North Minzu University); Wang, Jian (North Minzu University); Li, jing (North Minzu University)",0,0,,0.0,https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-1042992/latest.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1142481776,40 Engineering; 4018 Nanotechnology,

The dehydration equipment included devices to absorb thermal energy from incident sunlight, such as a trombe wall and a parabolic cylindrical collector, and a thermo bank system. In addition, the influence of three types of heat transfer fluids (water, oil and oil nanofluid + silver nanoparticles) was evaluated. This dehydration system was applied to process the Pouteria lucuma fruit. The results indicate the reduction of the dehydration time by 58.19% using nanofluid. This treatment prevents the modification of the physicochemical properties of the product and helps preserving its organoleptic properties.","We thank the Dirección de Investigación e Innovación of the Universidad Privada del Norte for their support in the publication of this manuscript.

In contrast, these chiral effects stem from isotropic exchange or dipole-dipole interaction, present in all magnetic materials, which acquire asymmetric contributions in case of curved geometry of the specimen. As a result, for example, the spin-wave dispersion in round magnetic nanotubes becomes asymmetric; namely, spin waves of the same frequency propagating in opposite directions along the nanotube exhibit different wavelenghts. Here, using time-resolved scanning transmission x-ray microscopy experiments, standard micromagnetic simulations, and a dynamic-matrix approach, we show that the spin-wave spectrum undergoes additional drastic changes when transitioning from a continuous to a discrete rotational symmetry, i.e., from round to hexagonal nanotubes, which are much easier to fabricate. The polygonal shape introduces localization of the modes to both the sharp, highly curved corners and flat edges. Moreover, due to the discrete rotational symmetry, the degenerate nature of the modes with azimuthal wave vectors known from round tubes is partly lifted, resulting in singlet and duplet modes. For comparison with our experiments, we calculate the microwave absorption from the numerically obtained mode profiles, which shows that a dedicated antenna design is paramount for magnonic applications in 3D nanostructures. To our knowledge these are the first experiments directly showing real space spin-wave propagation in 3D nano-objects.","The experiments were mainly performed at the MAXYMUS endstation of BESSY II at Helmholtz-Zentrum Berlin (HZB), Germany.

In many cases, it has also led to more sustainable lifestyles and a more efficient use of natural resources. But despite the relevance of innovation as a tool to support sustainable development, there is a need for research that analyses current trends in order to guide future efforts. The present paper addresses this research need. It examines existing methods and tools for fostering social innovation in matters related to sustainable development, within the framework of the SDGs. By means of an online survey undertaken among sustainability and innovation experts in a sample of industrialised and developing nations, this study has identified some of the means via which social innovation is being pursued, along with its applications and limitations. A number of case studies showing examples of sustainable innovation have been mapped to demonstrate its usefulness. A causal loop diagram, which links the factors associated with social innovation within the context of the UN Sustainable Development Goals, is also presented, offering a greater understanding of their interconnections.

This co‐evolution is largely undocumented over thousands of years. Uncertainties on incision and widening laws limit the ability of models to reproduce erosion rates and responses to tectonics and climate over geologic timescales. We studied two 1 km‐deep canyons in northern Chile, both characterized by valley widening after the upward migration of a major knickzone but with a diachronous incision initiation. We use 10 Be concentrations measured in colluvial deposits to quantify the erosion rates E of along‐stream valley flanks. We observe that E increases in the knickzone, with well‐defined relationships ( R 2 = 0.7): E increases quasilinearly with the valley‐bed slope and decreases with the valley width (exponent ∼‐0.4). Our results suggest that E decreases with time but that valley flank weathering may sustain a significant lateral erosion rate. Our results provide data for testing erosion laws governing valley widening. 
Plain Language Summary  A common feature of river landscapes is the widening of valleys downstream (i.e., floodplains). Several studies have explored valley width controls, considering that different processes can control it, such as lithology and river hydraulic variations downstream. However, little is currently known about how the widening of valleys, in particular, occurs. To understand these processes, we studied two 1 km‐deep canyons in northern Chile, both characterized by a different valley width downstream, a sharp change in valley slope (or knickzone), and different timings for the beginning of the incision. In an original way, we measured the concentrations of 10 Be in the colluvial deposits at the foot of the valley flanks to quantify the rate at which the flanks are eroded at different locations along the valley. Our results show that the erosion rates increase toward the knickzone, given that they are positively correlated with the slope of the valley floor and they decrease as the valley width increases. Our results suggest that the widening rate decreases with time but that the concomitant weathering of the valley flanks favors their lateral erosion. Our results give confidence in this new approach and provide the first data set to test the existing valley widening laws.

This study aims to contribute to the understanding of the relationship between the different meanings and materialities of water in the Tarapacá region of northern Chile prior to the introduction of neoliberal reforms using a geohistorical perspective. By reviewing historical archives and undertaking terrain analyses, we examine the respective roles of the state, capitalism, and science/technology in the commodification/modernization of water in Tarapacá from the 19th to the early 20th centuries. We propose that the 19th-century insertion of Tarapacá’s nitrate mining into the world capitalist circuit of minerals attracted explorers and scientists, who proffered modern discourses on nature and water while denying any local knowledge about water. These discourses then became prominent in the political sphere and were hegemonized through laws and norms. In parallel, the modernization of the nitrate mining resulted in the introduction of cutting-edge technologies for water infrastructure, a process that introduced changes in everyday practices regarding water, leading to the creation of the modern waterscapes in Tarapacá.","The author appreciates the helpful comments from Margreet Zwarteveen, Sofía De la Rosa Solano, Bibiana Duarte-Abadía, Shahnoor Hasan and Gabriela Russo on early draft of this paper and the comments and constructive criticism of two anonymous reviewers.

We evaluated antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) present in pre-transmission infant and maternal plasma and breast milk (BM) against the contemporaneous maternal HIV-1 variants. HIV-1 exposed uninfected as compared to HIV-1 exposed infected infants had higher ADCC and a combination of ADCC and nAb responses against their corresponding mother’s strains. ADCC did not correlate with nAbs suggesting they are independent activities. The infected infants with high as compared to low ADCC, but not those with higher ADCC plus nAbs, had lower morbidity and mortality up to 1 year after birth. ADCC was lower in BM supernatants as compared to BM isolated IgG, but was not significantly different in the transmitting versus non-transmitting mothers’ BM or plasma. A high IgA to IgG ratio, as in BM supernatants, was also more prevalent in the infected infants, and it was also associated with lower infant ADCC. Overall, ADCC, more so than nAbs, against the exposure strains associates with lower mother-to-child-transmission (MTCT) and decreased post-infection infant morbidity.

OSL and TL sensitivities were compared with the characteristic dose of dose response curves. Additionally, we estimated electron trap parameters of quartz from sediments with contrasting OSL sensitivities. Our results show that the natural sensitivities of quartz OSL (initial 0.8 s) and TL (110 °C peak) are positively correlated and range over six and four orders of magnitude respectively. The corresponding characteristic doses range from around 30 Gy–3000 Gy for dose response curves described by a single exponential function. Quartz from igneous and metamorphic rocks and Andean short-transported sediments report low-sensitivity OSL and high characteristic dose. The studied initial OSL signal has significant contribution of medium and slow components in quartz from rocks and Andean short-transported sediments, while in quartz from Brazilian long-transported sediments, the initial OSL signal is dominated by the fast component. The trend of sensitivity increase and characteristic dose decrease is attributed to the relative contribution of medium and low components to the initial OSL emission. Regarding the electron trap parameters, high, medium and low sensitivity quartz has statistically similar values of the activation energy and the frequency factor, but both parameters have larger variations in medium and low sensitivity quartz.",We are grateful to the Editor Geoff Duller and two anonymous Reviewers for the remarkable suggestions and comments that greatly contribute to improve this manuscript.

                    We present 63 new multi-site radial velocity (RV) measurements of the K1III giant HD 76920, which was recently reported to host the most eccentric planet known to orbit an evolved star. We focused our observational efforts on the time around the predicted periastron passage and achieved near-continuous phase coverage of the corresponding RV peak. By combining our RV measurements from four different instruments with previously published ones, we confirm the highly eccentric nature of the system and find an even higher eccentricity of

Intriguingly, at periastron, the planet comes to within 2.4 stellar radii of its host star’s surface. However, we find that the planet is not currently experiencing any significant orbital decay and will not be engulfed by the stellar envelope for at least another 50–80 Myr. Finally, while we calculate a relatively high transit probability of 16%, we did not detect a transit in the TESS photometry.","CB was supported by Australian Research Council Discovery Grant DP170103491.

Most of the modeling strategies for the flotation and grinding stages have followed separate developmental paths. This paper presents a strategy based on using flotation studies to model flotation and grinding via an integrated approach. The methodology, which is an approximate method that allows one to study of the effects of grinding on flotation circuits, is applied to a copper sulfide mineral with appropriate results. Given its nature, the application of this method will help preliminary studies on the design, improvement, and simulation of flotation circuits. The major advantages of this method are its simplicity and low cost. Thus, the main contribution of this work is a new strategy to model grinding for integration into the modeling of flotation circuits. This new strategy can be extended to other concentration technologies that include grinding.","This work was supported by financial assistance from ANID (Fondecyt 1180826).

                    C determinations on single specimens of an assortment of biogenic carbonates. A reduced major axis regression shows a strong relationship between direct carbonate and graphite percent Modern Carbon (pMC) values (m = 0.996; 95% CI [0.991–1.001]). An analysis of differences and a 95% confidence interval on pMC values reveals that there is no significant difference between direct carbonate and graphite pMC values for 76% of analyzed specimens, although variation in direct carbonate pMC is underestimated. The difference between the two methods is typically within 2 pMC, with 61% of direct carbonate pMC measurements being higher than their paired graphite counterpart. Of the 36 specimens that did yield significant differences, all but three missed the 95% significance threshold by 1.2 pMC or less. These results show that direct carbonate

Camera for Surveys onboard the Hubble Space Telescope and near-infrared data
from GeMS/GSAOI to construct a high-resolution extinction map in the direction
of the bulge stellar system Liller 1. In spite of its appearance of a globular
cluster, Liller 1 has been recently found to harbor two stellar populations
with remarkably different ages, and it is the second complex stellar system
with similar properties (after Terzan5) discovered in the bulge, thus defining
a new class of objects: the Bulge Fossil Fragments. Because of its location in
the inner bulge of the Milky Way, very close to the Galactic plane, Liller 1 is
strongly affected by large and variable extinction. The simultaneous study of
both the optical and the near-infrared color-magnitude diagrams revealed that
the extinction coefficient R$_V$ in the direction of Liller 1 has a much
smaller value than commonly assumed for diffuse interstellar medium (R$_V=2.5$,
instead of 3.1), in agreement with previous findings along different light
paths to the Galactic bulge. The derived differential reddening map has a
spatial resolution ranging from $1''$ to $3''$ over a field of view of about
$90''$X$90''$. We found that the absorption clouds show patchy sub-structures

Defect energies and structural properties at the GGA and hybrid (B3LYP, HSE06) levels of theory are very similar. Our results for isolated Li and N dopants agree with previous work in that they are not suitable candidates for shallow n-type donors. Here, we investigate the effects of addition of N atoms as a co-dopant with Li, which vary with the Li:N ratio and whether Li is interstitial or substitutional. Reaction energies, geometries, bonding and densities of states (DOS) are examined. Nitrogen stabilises substitutional rather than interstitial lithium. Atom-projected DOS show that the chief contributions to the defect states are not from orbitals on the dopant atoms themselves but from states associated with neighbouring carbon atoms. Only the tetrahedral 1:4 cluster, LiCN4, with substitutional Li is likely to behave as a shallow donor. We propose a non-molecular synthetic route for preparation of the LiCN4-doped material via prior generation of the N4V centre at temperatures at which Li is mobile but LiCN4 clusters are not.","The authors are grateful to the Public Service Department, Government of Malaysia, EPSRC grant EP/K030302/1 for financial support and Ben Truscott for his help with the software.

This research analyzes the events in Huaraz province, of Ancash department, in the central Andes of Peru, to find relationships between their occurrence and geographical factors such as altitude, slopes, climate, and extreme meteorological events. An inventory of events was made and classified as floods, mass gravitational movements, waterlogging or snow avalanches. Using QGIS software, spreadsheets and digital elevation models, information on natural disasters, altitude levels, physiography, river basins, meteorological data, and earthquakes were analyzed. As a result, it was obtained that the Quechua region registered 60% of all events; the Santa River basin 76%; the wet season of the Peruvian Andes 78%; and places with slopes between 8% and 50% (wavy relief) 72% of disasters. It is concluded that the best conditions for these events are the intense rainfall and the undulating reliefs, predominant in the Quechua region. Likewise, floods are the disasters that register the most significant number and generate the most damage in Huaraz province.

cluster (GC) candidates towards the Milky Way bulge. These new candidates need
to be confirmed as real GCs and properly characterised. We investigate the
physical nature of FSR 1776. This object was originally classified as an
intermediate-age open cluster and has recently been re-discovered independently
and classified as a GC candidate (Minni 23). Firstly, we aim at confirming its
GC nature; secondly we determine its physical parameters. The confirmation of
the cluster existence is checked using the radial velocity (RV) distribution of
a MUSE data cube centred at FSR 1776. The cluster parameters are derived from
isochrone fitting to the RV-cleaned colour-magnitude diagrams (CMDs) from
visible and near-infrared photometry. The predicted RV distribution for the FSR
1776 coordinates, considering only contributions from the bulge and disc field
stars, is not enough to explain the observed MUSE RV distribution. The extra
population (12\% of the sample) is FSR 1776 with an average RV of $-103.7\pm
0.4~{\rm km}\,{\rm s}^{-1}$. The CMDs reveal that it is 10$\pm$1~Gyr old and
metal-rich, with [Fe/H]$_{phot}\approx + 0.2\pm$0.2,
[Fe/H]$_{spec}=~+0.02\pm0.01~(\sigma~=~0.14$~dex), located at the bulge
distance of 7.24$\pm$0.5~kpc with A$_{\rm V}$ $\approx$ 1.1~mag. The mean
cluster proper motions are
($\langle\mu_{\alpha}\rangle,\langle\mu_{\delta}\rangle$) $=$
($-2.3\pm1.1,-2.6\pm0.8$) ${\rm mas\, yr^{-1}}$.} FSR 1776 is an old GC located
in the Galactic bulge with a super-solar metallicity, among the highest for a
Galactic GC. This is consistent with predictions for the age-metallicity
relation of the bulge, being FSR 1776 the probable missing link between typical
GCs and the metal-rich bulge field. High-resolution spectroscopy of a larger
field of view and deeper CMDs are now required for a full characterisation.",,,arXiv,,,,2021-10-02,2021,,,,,,All OA; Green,Preprint,"Dias, B.; Palma, T.; Minniti, D.; Fernández-Trincado, J.

                    Design/methodology/approach
                    Development and validation of the scale involved a five-stage process. Data were collected from 430 customers of a QSR belonging to an international brand located in Barcelona. Surveys were applied immediately after the service encounter, using the face-to-face method. The scale development procedure involved exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses.
                  
                  
                    Findings
                    The results suggest a specific and parsimonious measurement scale, whose structure comprises 14 items in four dimensions. In contrast to previous studies, this study identified the appropriateness of splitting the interaction quality dimension into two single dimensions, one focusing on the interaction time and other on staff–customer interaction. Furthermore, these indicate that a speedy service, pleasant treatment and food quality are the most valued attributes in QSR.
                  
                  
                    Practical implications
                    This scale is a useful instrument to administer and assure service quality standards within QSR management systems. Its practical approach and short survey length ease data collection, considering that customers spend short amounts of time in this type of restaurant. Furthermore, it could also be used by franchisors and restaurant operators as a tool to monitor continuing compliance with service quality standards.

                  The effects in the local U–V velocity field due to orbital trapping by bar resonances have been studied computing 15 resonant families in a non-axisymmetric Galactic potential, considering the bar’s angular velocity between 35 and 57.5 ${\rm \, km\, s^{-1}{kpc}^{-1}}$. Only cases in the low, 37.5, 40 ${\rm \, km\, s^{-1}{kpc}^{-1}}$, and high, 55, 57.5 ${\rm \, km\, s^{-1}{kpc}^{-1}}$, velocity ranges give trapping structures that have some similarity with observed features in the velocity distribution. The resulting structures in the local U–V plane form resonant bands appearing at various levels in velocity V. Cases with angular velocity 40 and 55 ${\rm \, km\, s^{-1}{kpc}^{-1}}$ show the greatest similarity with observed branches. Our best approximation to the local velocity field by orbital trapping is obtained with a bar angular velocity of 40 ${\rm \, km\, s^{-1}{kpc}^{-1}}$ and a bar angle of 40°. With this solution, three main observed features can be approximated: (i) the Hercules branch at V = $-50\, {\rm \, km\, s^{-1}}$ produced by the resonance 8/1 outside corotation, and the close features produced by resonances 5/1 and 6/1, (ii) the newly detected low-density arch at V ≃ 40 ${\rm \, km\, s^{-1}}$ produced approximately by the resonance 4/3, (iii) the inclined structure below the Hercules branch, also observed in the Gaia DR2 data, produced by tube orbits around Lagrange point L5 at corotation. Some predicted contributions due to orbital trapping in regions of the U–V plane corresponding to the Galactic halo are given, which could help to further restrict the value of the angular velocity of the Galactic bar. No support by orbital trapping is found for the Arcturus stream at V$\approx \, -100\, {\rm \, km\, s^{-1}}$.","We thank an anonymous referee for comments and suggestions that helped to improve this paper.

We say that Λ is universally realizable if it is realizable for each possible Jordan canonical form allowed by Λ. This work studies the universal realizability of spectra in low dimension, that is, realizable spectra of size n ≤ 5 . It is clear that for n ≤ 3 the concepts of universally realizable and realizable are equivalent. The case n = 4 is easily deduced from previous results in [7]. We characterize the universal realizability of real spectra of size 5 and trace zero, and we describe a region for the universal realizability of nonreal 5-spectra with trace zero.

With GUGGENEX's investment, the exploitation of copper entered into the open-pit mining era. Nine years later, the Guggenheims applied the industrial experience acquired in Bingham Canyon in the opening of the Chuquicamata Mine (northern Chile). In both cases, all the crucial decisions about the mining were made in Manhattan, New York, while the local territories faced these projects' outcomes. From a geohistorical standpoint, and through the analysis of several archives, in this paper, we explore how the extractive territories associated with these mines were remotely produced, transformed, and redefined; becoming “teleconnected miningscapes”. We aimed to visualize how the cross-sector partnership between large economic groups—GUGGENEX—and scientific personalities was essential in the emergence of open-pit copper mining. We argue that the miningscapes produced in Bingham Canyon and Chuquicamata mines are an entanglement of scientific discourses, research (geology and metallurgy), materialities (capital and technology), human bodies (workers) and nature (copper porphyries, water, air, etc.) that were unevenly and remotely produced from the headquarters of GUGGENEX.","Acknowledgements The authors appreciate the helpful comments from the three anonymous reviewers and the Guest Editor Iva Peša.

We prove that the set of DLR measures contains the set of conformal measures associated with Walters potentials. In the BIP case, or when the potential normalizes the Ruelle’s operator, we prove that the notions of DLR and conformal coincide. On the standard renewal shift, we study the problem of describing the cases when the set of the eigenmeasures jumps from finite to infinite measures when we consider high and low temperatures, respectively. For this particular shift, we prove that there always exist finite DLR measures, and we have an expression to the critical temperature for this volume-type phase transition, which occurs only for potentials with the infinite first variation.","The authors thank Ricardo Freire for his assistance for the proof of proposition 29.

BP) through the circulation of obsidian artefacts,"In the pre-Columbian Andes, ceremonial centres were places for large-scale periodic celebrations that facilitated interaction and the reproduction of social life; however, little is known about their role and emergence in early periods. In order to explore the nature and scale of social aggregations, we study the circulation of obsidian artefacts from two early ceremonial centres: Tulan-52 (5300 to 4200 cal. BP) and Tulan-54 (3200 to 2400 cal. BP). Compositional analyses indicate the exploitation of local obsidian, but with a significant contribution from several extra-local sources in the north of the Salar de Atacama (Chile), the Andes highlands (4000 masl) and the northwest of Argentina. According to technological studies and other complementary data, obsidian was employed mainly for the production of bifacial projectile points used in collective hunts and ritual feasts. Our data supports the existence of wide, decentralised inter-community networks fostered by inclusive access to these periodic congregations. We argue that early ceremonial centres were intended to maintain social cohesion and cooperative labour between trans-egalitarian groups in the face of the profound socio-economic changes introduced by the adoption of a more sedentary, pastoralist way of life.","We would like to first thank the two anonymous reviewers who not only helped us improve the manuscript with their suggestions but also challenged us to go further in our original interpretations.

                  The distribution of stellar metallicities within and across galaxies is an excellent relic of the chemical evolution across cosmic time. We present a detailed analysis of spatially resolved stellar populations based on >2.6 million spatial bins from 7439 nearby galaxies in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey-IV (SDSS-IV) Mapping Nearby Galaxies at APO (MaNGA) survey. To account for accurate inclination corrections, we derive an equation for morphology-dependent determination of galaxy inclinations. Our study goes beyond the well-known global mass–metallicity relation and radial metallicity gradients by providing a statistically sound exploration of local relations between stellar metallicity [Z/H], stellar surface mass density Σ⋆, and galactocentric distance in the global mass–morphology plane. We find a significant resolved mass density–metallicity relation $r\Sigma _\star ZR$ for galaxies of all types and masses above $10^{9.8}\, \mathrm{M_\odot }$. Different radial distances make an important contribution to the spread of the relation. Particularly, in low- and intermediate-mass galaxies, we find that at fixed Σ⋆ metallicity increases with radius independently of morphology. For high masses, this radial dependence is only observed in high Σ⋆ regions of spiral galaxies. This result calls for a driver of metallicity, in addition to Σ⋆ that promotes chemical enrichment in the outer parts of galaxies more strongly than in the inner parts. We discuss gas accretion, outflows, recycling, and radial migration as possible scenarios.","We thank the anonymous referee for comments that helped to improve the paper.

The Friedmann equations governing the dynamics of the Universe under this entropy modification can be calculated through the gravity-thermodynamics conjecture. We investigate two models, one considering only a matter component and the other including matter and radiation, which have new terms compared to the standard model sourcing the late cosmic acceleration. A Bayesian analysis is performed in which using five cosmological observations (observational Hubble data, type Ia supernovae, HII galaxies, strong lensing systems, and baryon acoustic oscillations) to constrain the free parameters of both models. From a joint analysis, we obtain constraints that are consistent with the standard cosmological paradigm within 2σ confidence level. In addition, a complementary dynamical system analysis using local and global variables is developed which allows obtaining a qualitative description of the cosmology.

To analyze the effects of selective fishing of multiple species and small scale fisheries we addressed temporal changes at fishing level and the response of fishermen. The fishery reduced production and CPUE (catch per unit effort standardized), decreased the large sizes and growth rates of Prochilodus magdalenae and Pseudoplatystoma magdaleniatum, changed the abundance of trophic levels (decreased carnivores and increase of detritivores, omnivores), and increased exploitation rates. The fishermen have responded by implementing self-control measures, diversifying fishing gear and mesh size, including new species and sizes in the catch with a higher CPUE of small sized fish, adjusting the fishing effort to the abundance. We conclude that selective fishing has had ecological effects and fishermen have empirically self-regulated to optimize the cost–benefit ratio of their activity, developing a fishery that is more in line with ecosystemic structures. We address the balanced harvest strategy as a management alternative.","The authors declare no specific funding for this work.

discovered a faint 36' diameter Halpha emission nebula centered around the
periodic variable YY Hya. Although this star has been classified as RR-Lyr
variable, such a classification is inconsistent Gaia distance of ~450 pc. GALEX
image data also shows YY Hya to have a strong UV excess, suggesting the
existence of a hot, compact binary companion. In addition to our discovery
image data, we obtained image of the region with CHILESCOPE time-series
spectroscopy at MDM observatory. Also, we used data from various space missions
to derive an exact orbital period and a SED. We find that YY Hya is a compact
binary system containing a K dwarf star which is strongly irradiated by a hot
WD companion. The spectral characteristics of the emission lines, visible only
during maximum light of the perfectly sinusoidal optical}light curve shows
signatures much like members of the BE UMa variable family. These are post
common envelope pre-cataclysmic variables. However the companion star here is
more massive than found in other group members and the progenitor of the white
dwarf must have been a 3 to 4 Mo star. The nebula seems to be an ejected common
envelope shell with a mass in the order of one Mo and an age of 500000 years.
This makes it to be the biggest hitherto known such shell. Alignment of
neighboring nebulosities some 45' to the northeast and southwest of YY Hya
suggests that the system had strong bipolar outflows. We briefly speculate it
might be related to the 1065 BP ""guest-star"" reported in ancient Chinese
records as well.",,,arXiv,,,,2021-10-08,2021,,,,,,All OA; Green,Preprint,"Kimeswenger, Stefan; Thorstensen, John R.; Fesen, Robert A.; Drechsler, Marcel; Strottner, Xavier; Germiniani, Maicon; Steindl, Thomas; Przybilla, Norbert; Weil, Kathryn E.; Rupert, Justin","Kimeswenger, Stefan (Univ.

                  We report the discovery of four new hot Jupiters with the Next-Generation Transit Survey (NGTS). NGTS-15b, NGTS-16b, NGTS-17b, and NGTS-18b are short-period (P < 5 d) planets orbiting G-type main-sequence stars, with radii and masses between 1.10 and 1.30RJ and 0.41 and 0.76MJ, respectively. By considering the host star luminosities and the planets’ small orbital separations (0.039–0.052 au), we find that all four hot Jupiters are highly irradiated and therefore occupy a region of parameter space in which planetary inflation mechanisms become effective. Comparison with statistical studies and a consideration of the planets’ high incident fluxes reveal that NGTS-16b, NGTS-17b, and NGTS-18b are indeed likely inflated, although some disparities arise upon analysis with current Bayesian inflationary models. However, the underlying relationships that govern radius inflation remain poorly understood. We postulate that the inclusion of additional hyperparameters to describe latent factors such as heavy element fraction, as well as the addition of an updated catalogue of hot Jupiters, would refine inflationary models, thus furthering our understanding of the physical processes that give rise to inflated planets.","Based on data collected under the Next Generation Transit Survey (NGTS) project at the European Southern Observatory (ESO) La Silla Paranal Observatory.

Over this time, a parallel increase in HABs has also been observed in the Chilean southern austral region (Patagonia fjords). HAB species like Alexandrium catenella—responsible for Paralytic Shellfish Poisoning (PSP)—are of great public concern due to their negative socioeconomic impacts and significant northward geographical range expansion. Many toxic dinoflagellate species (like A. catenella) produce benthic resting cysts, yet a holistic understanding of the physical-chemical and biological conditions influencing the distributions of cysts in this region is lacking. In this study, we measured a combination of hydrographic (temperature, salinity, and dissolved oxygen) and sediment physical-chemical properties (temperature, pH and redox potential), in addition to meiofaunal abundances –as sediment bioturbators and potential cyst predators– to determine the factors influencing dinoflagellate cyst distribution, with emphasis on A. catenella in and around a “hotspot” area of southern Chile. An analysis of similarities (ANOSIM) test revealed significant differences (p < 0.011) in cyst assemblages between the fjords and oceanic environments. Permutational Analysis of Variance (PERMANOVA) showed significant effects of sediment temperature and silt proportion in explaining differences in the cyst assemblages. A generalized linear model (GLM) indicated that sediment temperature, silt/sand, anoxic conditions, and low abundances of Harpacticoida —a meiofauna herbivore group and potential bioturbator— are associated with the higher resting cyst abundances of the harmful species A. catenella. The implications for A. catenella resting cysts dynamics are discussed, highlighting physical-chemical and biological interactions and their potential for PSP outbreak initiation.","This work was funded by Comité Oceanográfico Nacional [CONA-C24F, 2018] by projects CONA C24F 18-06 (Patricio A.

176,pub.1138064431,10.1111/bre.12568,,,"Neogene basin infilling from cosmogenic nuclides (10Be and 21Ne) in Atacama, Chile: Implications for palaeoclimate and supergene copper mineralization","Abstract  Increasing evidence suggests that supergene exotic copper deposits were emplaced during periods of geomorphic quiescence and pulses of humidity in arid environments. We tested this idea in the Centinela Mining District in the Atacama Desert (northern Chile). We collected 14 sand samples at depth (up to 110 m) in two open‐pit mines (Central Tesoro and Mirador) exposing Miocene sediment, and located in the El Tesoro Basin, which hosts two exotic copper‐rich orebodies. We inverted the 10 Be and 21 Ne concentrations by using a two‐box model (IMIS, inversion of multi‐isotopes in a sedimentary basin) composed of an eroding source of sediment and a depositional sedimentary basin, and by selecting denudation and sedimentation rate histories that can explain our data. The ages found demonstrate that the two exotic orebodies were deposited during a narrow period between 14 Ma (10 Ma younger than previously thought) and 9.5 Ma, when an ignimbrite covered the sedimentary sequence. The dated lower exotic copper orebody was deposited during or just before a sharp decrease in the sedimentation rates (from >100 to 0.5–5 m/Ma), which is consistent with published sedimentological and carbonate isotopic data in this district. This confirms the idea that exotic deposits form during a quiescence of the geomorphic activity. Nevertheless, our model suggests that the back‐ground denudation rate providing sediment to these basins between ca. 14 Ma and ca. 9.5 Ma was surprisingly high (>250 m/Ma) for such an arid environment. These denudation rates can be explained by a relatively rapid local back‐scarp retreat providing most of the sediment to these basins and possibly a wetter climate compared to the present. Then, during the period 10–7 Ma, the denudation rates decreased to >50 m/Ma. This decrease may correspond to a local progressive decrease in the slope of the surrounding hills, or to a progressive aridification, or a combination of both phenomena.","This work received support (both field and laboratory expenses) from the IRD.

174,pub.1137198947,10.1093/mnras/stab1051,,,APOGEE view of the globular cluster NGC 6544,"ABSTRACT
                  The second phase of the APOGEE survey is providing near-infrared (near-IR), high-resolution, high signal-to-noise spectra of stars in the halo, disc, bar, and bulge of the Milky Way. The near-IR spectral window is especially important in the study of the Galactic bulge, where stars are obscured by the dust and gas of the disc in its line of sight. We present a chemical characterization of the globular cluster NGC 6544 with high-resolution spectroscopy. The characterization of the cluster chemical fingerprint, given its status of ‘interloper’ towards the Galactic bulge and clear signatures of tidal disruption in its core is crucial for future chemical tagging efforts. Cluster members were selected from the DR16 of the APOGEE survey, using chemodynamical criteria of individual stars. A sample of 23 members of the cluster was selected. An analysis considering the intracluster abundance variations, known as anticorrelations is given. According to the red giant branch (RGB) content of the cluster, the iron content and α-enhancement are [Fe/H] = −1.44 ± 0.04 dex and [α/Fe] = 0.20 ± 0.04 dex, respectively. Cluster members show a significant spread in [Fe/H] and [Al/Fe] that is larger than expected based on measurement errors. An [Al/Fe] spread, signal of an Mg–Al anticorrelation is observed and used to constrain the cluster mass budget, along with C, N, Mg, Si, K, Ca, and Ce element variations discussed. Across all the analysed evolutionary stages (RGB and asymptotic giant branch), about ∼2/3 (14 out of 23) show distinct chemical patterns, possibly associated with second-generation stars.","Support for some of the authors is provided by the BASAL Center for Astrophysics and Associated Technologies (CATA) through grant PFB-06, and the Ministry for the Economy, Development, and Tourism, Programa Iniciativa Cientifica Milenio through grant IC120009, awarded to the Millennium Institute of Astrophysics (MAS).

170,pub.1135920040,10.1101/2021.03.03.433356,,,Exploring the microdiversity within marine bacterial taxa: Towards an integrated biogeography in the Southern Ocean,"Abstract The phylogeography traditionally correlates the genetic relationships among individuals within a macroorganism species, to their spatial distribution. Most microbial phylogeographic studies so far have been restricted to narrow geographical regions, mainly focusing on isolated strains, either obtained by culture or single-strain natural enrichments. However, the laborious culture-based methodology imposes a low number of studied individuals, leading to poor resolution of haplotype frequency estimation, making difficult a realistic evaluation of the genetic structure of natural microbial populations in the environment. To tackle this limitation, we present a new approach to unravel the phylogeographic patterns of bacteria combining (i) community-wide survey by 16S rRNA gene metabarcoding, (ii) intra-species resolution through the oligotyping method, and (iii) genetic and phylogeographic indices, as well as migration parameters, estimated from populational molecular data as traditionally developed for macroorganisms as models.  As a proof-of-concept, we applied this methodology to the bacterial genus Spirochaeta , classically reported as a gut endosymbiont of various invertebrates inhabiting the Southern Ocean (SO), but also described in marine sediment and in open waters. For this purpose, we centered our sampling into three biogeographic provinces of the SO; maritime Antarctica (King George Island), sub-Antarctic Islands (Kerguelen archipelago) and Patagonia in southern South America. Each targeted OTU was chaLRracterized by substantial intrapopulation microdiversity, a significant genetic differentiation and a robust phylogeographic structure among the three distant biogeographic provinces. Patterns of gene flow in Spirochaeta populations support the role of the Antarctic Polar Front (APF) as a biogeographic barrier to bacterial dispersal between Antarctic and sub-Antarctic provinces. Conversely, the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC) appears as the main driver of connectivity between geographically distant sub-Antarctic areas such as Patagonia and Kerguelen archipelago, and between Kerguelen archipelago and maritime Antarctica. Additionnally, we found that historical processes (drift and dispersal limitation) together govern up to 86% of the spatial turnover among Spirochaeta populations. Overall, our approach represents a substantial first attempt to bridge the gap between microbial and macrobial ecology by unifying the way to study phylogeography. We revealed that strong congruency with macroorganisms patterns at the populational level shaped by the same oceanographic structures and ecological processes.","We thank Dr Peter Beerli and Dr Franz-Sebastian Krah for their technical supports.

169,pub.1139517699,10.1021/acs.chemmater.1c01417,,,Rich Polymorphism of Layered NbS3,"Layered group V transition-metal trichalcogenides are paradigmatic low-dimensional materials providing an ever increasing series of unusual properties. They are all based on the same basic building units, one-dimensional MX3 (M = Nb, Ta; X = S, Se) trigonal-prismatic chains that condense into layers, but their electronic structures exhibit significant differences leading to a broad spectrum of transport properties, ranging from metals with one, two, or three charge density wave instabilities to semimetals with potential topological properties or semiconductors. The different physical and chemical properties are shown to be related with subtle structural differences within the layers that result in half-, third-, or quarter-filled quasi-one-dimensional Nb d z 2-type bands, providing a clear-cut illustration of the intimate link between structural and electronic features within a family of solids. An interesting yet not sufficiently explored feature of these solids is the polymorphism. Based on both experimental and new theoretical results, we examine this aspect for NbS3 and show that at least seven different polymorphs with a stability compatible with the presently known phases of this compound are possible. We discuss a simple rationale for the physical properties of the presently known polymorphs as well as predictions for those that have still not been characterized or prepared. It is argued that some of the presently unknown polymorphs may have been prepared in an uncontrolled way as mixtures of different phases which could not be structurally characterized. The rich landscape of structures and properties found for this van der Waals material is suggested to represent an ideal platform for the preparation of flakes with fine-tuned properties for applications in new electronic and optoelectronic devices.","This work was supported by the Spanish MICIU through grants PGC2018-096955-B-C44 and PGC2018-093863-B-C22, the Severo Ochoa FUNFUTURE (CEX2019-000917-S) Excellence Centre distinction, the Maria de Maeztu Units of Excellence Program (MDM-2017-0767), and Generalitat de Catalunya (grants nos. 2017SGR1506 and 2017SGR1289).

168,pub.1140588176,10.1111/twec.13185,,,Trade agreements and participation in global value chains: Empirical evidence from Latin America,"Abstract The rise of global sourcing implies a heterogeneous relationship between buyers and suppliers regarding the liberalisation scenarios in emerging countries. This paper analyses the effect of regional trade agreements (RTAs) on participation in the Global Value Chains of Latin American countries between 1995 and 2015. We combine the framework of gravity equations with the trade in value‐added, applying a Pseudo Poisson Maximum Likelihood (PPML) estimator with panel data and fixed effects to deal with endogeneity and heteroscedasticity. Heterogeneous estimations show that the deepest RTAs reinforce the position of lower technology‐industry suppliers, driven by an extra‐regional strategy of Latin American trade policy. The geography of value chains has little effect on industrial upgrading in the region, reducing the development potential. The study concludes that the region's trade policy could reduce the dependent relationship between distant partners and pay more attention to creating shorter value chains as a strategy to generate local capacities to gain competitiveness in value chains.",,,World Economy,,,,2021-09-07,2021,2021-09-07,2022-03,45,3,702-738,All OA; Green,Article,"Sanguinet, Eduardo Rodrigues; Alvim, Augusto Mussi; Atienza, Miguel","Sanguinet, Eduardo Rodrigues (Instituto de Economía Agraria, Facultad de Ciencias Agrarias y Alimentarias, Universidad Austral de Chile, Valdivia, Chile, Chile; Escola de Negócios, Pontificia Universidade Catolica do Rio Grande do Sul, Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil; Departamento de Economía, Universidad Católica del Norte, Antofagasta, Chile); Alvim, Augusto Mussi (Escola de Negócios, Pontificia Universidade Catolica do Rio Grande do Sul, Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil); Atienza, Miguel (Departamento de Economía, Universidad Católica del Norte, Antofagasta, Chile)","Sanguinet, Eduardo Rodrigues (Austral University of Chile; Pontifical Catholic University of Rio Grande do Sul; Catholic University of the North)","Sanguinet, Eduardo Rodrigues (Austral University of Chile; Pontifical Catholic University of Rio Grande do Sul; Catholic University of the North); Alvim, Augusto Mussi (Pontifical Catholic University of Rio Grande do Sul); Atienza, Miguel (Catholic University of the North)",13,10,,5.96,https://repositorio.pucrs.br/dspace/bitstream/10923/22109/2/Trade_agreements_and_participation_in_global_value_chains_Empirical_evidence_from_Latin_America.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1140588176,38 Economics; 3802 Econometrics,
163,pub.1144123027,10.1093/mnras/stab3724,,,Orbits of globular clusters computed with dynamical friction in the Galactic anisotropic velocity dispersion field,"ABSTRACT
                  We present a preliminary analysis of the effect of dynamical friction on the orbits of part of the globular clusters in our Galaxy. Our study considers an anisotropic velocity dispersion field approximated using the results of studies in the literature. An axisymmetric Galactic model with mass components consisting of a disc, a bulge, and a dark halo is employed in the computations. We provide a method to compute the dynamical friction acceleration in ellipsoidal, oblate, and prolate velocity distribution functions with similar density in velocity space. Orbital properties, such as mean time-variations of perigalactic and apogalactic distances, energy, and z-component of angular momentum, are obtained for globular clusters lying in the Galactic region R ≲ 10 kpc, |z| ≲ 5 kpc, with R, z cylindrical coordinates. These include clusters in prograde and retrograde orbital motion. Several clusters are strongly affected by dynamical friction, in particular Liller 1, Terzan 4, Terzan 5, NGC 6440, and NGC 6553, which lie in the Galactic inner region. We comment on the more relevant implications of our results on the dynamics of Galactic globular clusters, such as their possible misclassification between the categories ‘halo’, ‘bulge’, and ‘thick disc’, the resulting biasing of globular-cluster samples, the possible incorrect association of the globulars with their parent dwarf galaxies for accretion events, and the possible formation of ‘nuclear star clusters’.","We thank the referee for comments and suggestions which improved this paper.

163,pub.1143610672,10.1093/mnras/stab3483,,,Transit timings variations in the three-planet system: TOI-270,"ABSTRACT
                  We present ground- and space-based photometric observations of TOI-270 (L231-32), a system of three transiting planets consisting of one super-Earth and two sub-Neptunes discovered by TESS around a bright (K-mag = 8.25) M3V dwarf. The planets orbit near low-order mean-motion resonances (5:3 and 2:1) and are thus expected to exhibit large transit timing variations (TTVs). Following an extensive observing campaign using eight different observatories between 2018 and 2020, we now report a clear detection of TTVs for planets c and d, with amplitudes of ∼10 min and a super-period of ∼3 yr, as well as significantly refined estimates of the radii and mean orbital periods of all three planets. Dynamical modelling of the TTVs alone puts strong constraints on the mass ratio of planets c and d and on their eccentricities. When incorporating recently published constraints from radial velocity observations, we obtain masses of $M_{\mathrm{b}}=1.48\pm 0.18\, M_\oplus$, $M_{\mathrm{c}}=6.20\pm 0.31\, M_\oplus$, and $M_{\mathrm{d}}=4.20\pm 0.16\, M_\oplus$ for planets b, c, and d, respectively. We also detect small but significant eccentricities for all three planets : eb = 0.0167 ± 0.0084, ec = 0.0044 ± 0.0006, and ed = 0.0066 ± 0.0020. Our findings imply an Earth-like rocky composition for the inner planet, and Earth-like cores with an additional He/H2O atmosphere for the outer two. TOI-270 is now one of the best constrained systems of small transiting planets, and it remains an excellent target for atmospheric characterization.","This research received funding from the European Research Council (ERC) under the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme (grant agreement no. 803193/BEBOP) and from the Science and Technology Facilities Council (STFC; grant no.

140,pub.1137262297,10.1101/2021.04.13.439755,,,"Living to the high extreme: unraveling the composition, structure, and functional insights of bacterial communities thriving in the arsenic-rich Salar de Huasco – Altiplanic ecosystem","ABSTRACT  Microbial communities inhabiting extreme environments like Salar de Huasco (SH) are adapted to thrive while exposed to several abiotic pressures and the presence of toxic elements like arsenic (As). Hence, we aimed to uncover the role of arsenic in shaping bacterial composition, structure, and functional potential in five different sites in this Altiplanic wetland using a shotgun metagenomic approach. The sites exhibit wide gradients of arsenic (9 to 321 mg/kg), and our results showed highly diverse communities and a clear dominance exerted by the Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes phyla. Functional potential analyses showed broadly convergent patterns, contrasting with their great taxonomic variability. Arsenic-related metabolism is different among the five communities, as well as other functional categories like those related to the CH 4 and S cycles. Particularly, we found that the distribution and abundance of As-related genes increase, following along the As concentration gradient. Approximately 75% of the detected genes for As-metabolism belong to expulsion mechanisms, being arsJ and arsP pumps related to sites with higher As concentrations and present almost exclusively in Proteobacteria . Furthermore, taxonomic diversity and functional potential are reflected in the 12 reconstructed high-quality MAGs (Metagenome Assembled Genomes) belonging to the Bacteroidetes (5), Proteobacteria (5), Cyanobacteria (1) and Gemmatimonadota (1) phyla. We conclude that SH microbial communities are diverse and possess a broad genetic repertoire to thrive under extreme conditions, including increasing concentrations of the highly toxic As. Finally, this environment represents a reservoir of unknown and undescribed microorganisms, with a great metabolic versatility, which needs further study.   IMPORTANCE Microbial communities inhabiting extreme environments are fundamental for maintaining the ecosystems; however, little is known about their potential functions and interactions among them. We sampled the microbial communities in Salar de Huasco (SH) in the Chilean Altiplano, a fragile and complex environment that comprises several stresses. We found that microbes in SH are taxonomically diverse; nonetheless, their functional potential seems to have an important convergence degree, suggesting high adaptation levels. Particularly, arsenic metabolism showed differences associated with increasing concentrations of the metalloid throughout the area, and it is effectively exerting a clear and significant pressure over these organisms. Thus, this research’s significance is that we described highly specialized communities thriving in little-explored environments under several pressures, considered analogous of early Earth and other planets, and can have the potential for unraveling technologies to face climate change repercussions in many areas of interest.","We would like to thank the illustrator Florence Gutzwiller for the SH landscape painting (https://spideryscrawl-illustration.webnode.com/).

A one-volume introduction to academic resources and ideas that are relevant for today's debates on issues from reproductive justice to climate justice, food security, water conflicts, artificial intelligence, and global financial transactions, this handbook is divided into two sections. The first, ‘Perspectives and Approaches’, accessibly explains a variety of frameworks through which the relationship between law and society is addressed and understood, with emphasis on contemporary perspectives that are relatively new to many socio-legal scholars. Following the book's overall interest in social justice, the entries in this section of the book show how conceptual tools originate in, and help to illuminate, real-world issues. The second and largest section of the book (42 short well-written pieces) presents reflections on topics or areas concerning law, justice, and society that are inherently interdisciplinary and that are relevance to current – but also classical – 
struggles around justice. Informing readers about the lineage of ideas that are used or could be used today for research and activism, the book attends to the full range of local, national and transnational issues in law and society. The authors were carefully chosen to achieve a diverse and non-Eurocentric view of socio-legal studies. This volume will be invaluable for law students, those in inter-disciplinary programs such as law and society, justice studies and legal studies, and those with interests in law, but based in other social sciences. It will also appeal to general readers interested in questions of justice and rights, including activists and advocates around the world.",,,,,"Mariana Valverde, Kamari Clarke, Eve Darian-Smith, Prabha Kotiswaran",,2021-03-03,2021,2021-03-03,,,,,All OA; Green,Edited Book,,,,,4,3,,8.79,https://eprints.bbk.ac.uk/id/eprint/29796/3/29796.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1134944686,48 Law and Legal Studies; 4804 Law In Context; 4807 Public Law,"16 Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions"

Los organizadores agradecen el esfuerzo y el interés que, una vez más, todos los ponentes han mostrado en la consecución de un proyecto que trata de aunar el trabajo de profesores consagrados, investigadores predoctorales y estudiantes de Grado para desarrollar nuevas investigaciones en relación al fenómeno cultural de las reliquias a lo largo de la historia. Como el lector podrá comprobar a partir de aquí, los estudios que se presentan en las páginas que siguen analizarán cuestiones muy diversas del tema que toca, abordando para ello cuestiones tocantes a las diferentes épocas históricas (desde la Antigüedad a la Edad Contemporánea) y refiriéndose a su vez a latitudes de lo más variado (no solamente al occidente europeo, sino también a diversas partes del continente asiático, de África y de América). Esperamos que, en esta cuarta edición dedicada al culto a las reliquias, puedan extraerse conclusiones valiosas capaces de acercarnos a cuestiones sobre las cuales la historiografía actual está prestando especial interés: los usos políticos de las devociones; el influjo del poder sobre las masas populares; o la importancia del coleccionismo como forma de representación social y como elemento identitario.

49,pub.1138427647,10.1016/j.pocean.2021.102613,,,System controls of coastal and open ocean oxygen depletion,"The epoch of the Anthropocene, a period during which human activity has been the dominant influence on climate and the environment, has witnessed a decline in oxygen concentrations and an expansion of oxygen-depleted environments in both coastal and open ocean systems since the middle of the 20th century. This paper provides a review of system-specific drivers of low oxygen in a range of case studies representing marine systems in the open ocean, on continental shelves, in enclosed seas and in the coastal environment. Identification of similar and contrasting responses within and across system types and corresponding oxygen regimes is shown to be informative both in understanding and isolating key controlling processes and provides a sound basis for predicting change under anticipated future conditions. Case studies were selected to achieve a balance in system diversity and global coverage. Each case study describes system attributes, including the present-day oxygen environment and known trends in oxygen concentrations over time. Central to each case study is the identification of the physical and biogeochemical processes that determine oxygen concentrations through the tradeoff between ventilation and respiration. Spatial distributions of oxygen and time series of oxygen data provide the opportunity to identify trends in oxygen availability and have allowed various drivers of low oxygen to be distinguished through correlative and causative relationships. Deoxygenation results from a complex interplay of hydrographic and biogeochemical processes and the superposition of these processes, some additive and others subtractive, makes attribution to any particular driver challenging. System-specific models are therefore required to achieve a quantitative understanding of these processes and of the feedbacks between processes at varying scales.","The undertaking of this review paper was an activity prioritized by the Global Ocean Oxygen Network (GO2NE) in an effort to synthesize our knowledge and to provide an inclusive perspective of the drivers of deoxygenation in both coastal and open ocean systems.

Multimodal learning is approached in terms of the levels of multimodality and specifically blended learning and the mixing of modes of delivery (contact and distance education). As such, this publication will provide a unique snapshot of multimodal practices within higher education through a self-directed learning epistemological lens. The book covers issues such as what self-directed multimodal learning entails, mapping of specific publications regarding blended learning, blended learning in mathematics, geography, natural science and computer literacy, comparative experiences in distance education as well as situated and culturally appropriate learning in multimodal contexts.

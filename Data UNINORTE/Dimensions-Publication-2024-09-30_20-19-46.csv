Unlike the profiles observed with the rabbits, similar antibody reaction profiles were generated by mice and humans with severe D-2V disease (dengue hemorrhagic fever [DHF]/dengue shock syndrome [DSS]). Many of these epitopes contained the core acidic-hydrophobic-basic (tri-amino-acid; ELK-type) motifs present in the positive or negative orientations. Antibody responses generated to these ELK/KLE-type motifs and the epitope LX1 on this protein were influenced by class II molecules in mice during D-2V infections; but these antibodies cross-reacted with human fibrinogen and platelets, as implicated in DHF/DSS pathogenesis. The core LX1 epitope (113YSWKTWG119), identified by the dengue virus complex-specific monoclonal antibody (MAb) 3D1.4, was prepared so that it contained natural I-Ad-binding and ELK-type motifs. This AFLX1 peptide, which appropriately displayed the ELK-type and LX1 epitopes in solid-phase immunoassays, generated a similar, but lower, immunodominant anti-ELK-motif antibody reaction in I-Ad-positive mice, as generated in mice and humans during D-2V infections. These antibody responses were much stronger in the high-responding mouse strains and each of the DHF/DSS patients tested and may therefore account for the association of DHF/DSS resistance or susceptibility with particular class II molecules and autoantibodies, antibody-stimulating cytokines (e.g., interleukin-6), and complement product C3a being implicated in DHF/DSS pathogenesis. These results are likely to be important for the design of a safe vaccine against this viral disease and showed the AFLX1 peptide and MAb 3D1.4 to be valuable diagnostic reagents.","This work received financial support from the Sir Jules Thorn Charitable Trust and the Instituto Colombiano para el Desarrollo de la Ciencia y la Technologia Francisco Jose de Caldas (COLCIENCIAS) (grant 1215-04-14364).

In this study, some of these MAbs cross-reacted with the DENV type 2 (DENV-2) E glycoprotein and with synthetic peptides representing X-ray crystallographically confirmed surface-exposed regions on this glycoprotein. MAb 1G5.3 cross-reacted with the flavivirus-conserved 101-WGNGCGLFG-109 fusion sequence, the 273-SSGNL-277 DENV-2 hinge region sequence, and the 156-GKHGKEIKIT-165 sequence of virulent DENV-2 strains. MAb 1G5.4-A1-C3 cross-reacted with the 67-NTTTESRCPT-76 and 156-GKHGKEIKIT-165 sequences of virulent DENV-2 strains, the 338-EIMDLDNRHV-347 sequence from a highly virulent DENV-2 (M2) strain, and two epitopes on a virulent DENV-3 strain (288-KMDKLELKG-296 and 323-RVEYRGEDAP-332), which all contained target ELK/KLE-type motifs (underlined). These MAbs showed reduced cross-reactions with the corresponding sequences from weakly pathogenic strains of all four DENV serotypes and had either no (MAb 1G5.4-A1-C3) or weak (MAb 1G5.3) neutralizing activity against them. MAb 1G5.3 more strongly neutralized DENV-2 strains with higher pathogenic capacities, while MAb 1G5.4-A1-C3 showed increasing neutralizing titers against the virulent DENV-3 strain and the moderately virulent and highly virulent (M2) DENV-2 strains. These cross-reactions with the E glycoprotein accord with the observation that MAb 1G5.3 caused dramatic and lethal antibody-enhanced replication (AER) of a DENV-2 strain in vivo. Together with in vivo AER studies of these DENV strains using MAb 1G5.4-A1-C3, these results may account for the increased pathogenic capacities of such strains, which is likely to have important implications for pathogenesis and vaccines.","This work received financial support from the Sir Jules Thorn Charitable Trust and the Instituto Colombiano para el Desarrollo de la Ciencia y la Technologia Francisco Jose de Caldas (COLCIENCIAS) (no. 1215-04-14364).

Because the causes of morphological differentiation of Fueguian populations are still a controversial subject, the comparison with neutral variation could contribute to elucidate them. Samples of human remains from South America regions were used to analyze the evolutionary relationships. Several craniofacial traits observed in frontal and lateral view were analyzed by means of geometric morphometrics techniques, and the evolutionary relationships based on morphological and molecular data were established in base to ordination analyses. The results from the facial skeleton agree with those obtained from mtDNA haplogroup frequencies, with La Pampa/Chaco samples detached from the Patagonian samples. Hence, the same mechanism that accounts for the pattern of frequency of haplogroups could explain the variation found in facial skeleton among the samples. It is suggested that such geographic pattern of craniofacial and molecular diversity may reflect the effect of genetic drift that occurred in the small founding populations isolated by distance or geographic barriers. Conversely, the results obtained using the traits from the lateral view slightly differ from the molecular results, showing differences between southernmost Patagonian and the other samples. Therefore, mechanisms other than genetic drift (e.g., natural selection) could have acted to shape the pattern observed in some craniofacial structures present in the lateral view, characterized by the fact that the southernmost Patagonian samples display the most robust and dolichocephalic crania.",,,American Journal of Biological Anthropology,,,"Adolescent; Adult; Cephalometry; DNA, Mitochondrial; Female; Geography; Haplotypes; History, Ancient; Humans; Indians, South American; Male; Middle Aged; Population Dynamics; Skull; South America",2007-05-25,2007,2007-05-25,2007-08,133,4,1067-1079,Closed,Article,"Perez, S.

This study hypothesizes that morphological responses to high-altitude hypoxia should also be evident in pre-Contact Andean groups. Thoracic skeletal morphology in four groups of human skeletons (N = 347) are compared: two groups from coastal regions (Ancón, Peru, n = 79 and Arica, Chile, n = 123) and two groups from high altitudes (San Pedro de Atacama, Chile, n = 102 and Machu Picchu and Cuzco, Peru, n = 43). Osteometric variables that represent proportions of chest width and depth include sternal and clavicular lengths and breadths and rib length, curvature, and area. Each variable was measured relative to body size, transformed into logarithmic indices, and compared across sex-specific groups using ANOVA and Tukey multiple comparison tests. Atacama highlanders have the largest sternal and clavicular proportions and ribs with the greatest area and least amount of curvature, features that suggest an antero-posteriorly deep and mediolaterally wide thoracic skeleton. Ancón lowlanders exhibit proportions indicating narrower and shallower chests. Machu Picchu and Cuzco males cluster with the other highland group in rib curvature and area at the superior levels of the thorax, whereas chest proportions in Machu Picchu and Cuzco females resemble those of lowlanders. The variation in Machu Picchu and Cuzco males and females is interpreted as the result of population migrations. The presence of morphological traits indicative of enlarged chests in some highland individuals suggests that high-altitude hypoxia was an environmental stressor shaping the biology of highland Andean groups during the pre-Contact period.",,,American Journal of Biological Anthropology,,,Acclimatization; Altitude; Biological Evolution; Body Weights and Measures; Chile; Clavicle; Female; Humans; Hypoxia; Male; Peru; Thorax,2007-05-14,2007,2007-05-14,2007-09,134,1,36-49,Closed,Article,"Weinstein, Karen J.","Weinstein, Karen J.

The lattice constant and the bulk modulus present a small bowing in both structures. We have also analyzed the relative stability of this ternary compound in the two studied phases.

Shoaling in the Port's access channel from the mouth of the Magdalena River to the terminal of the Regional Port Society of Barranquilla has historically restricted navigation for vessels with drafts as shallow as 30 feet. The existing harbor facilities in Barranquilla will require a 40-foot deep access channel in order to allow permanent access for larger ships without navigation restrictions. A feasibility study proposed several flow training structures to scour the channel and maintain navigable access to the Port. In this study, a hydrodynamic and morphological model was constructed using the Delf3D system to test the validity of the solution defined in the feasibility study. The model was further applied to improve that solution in order to guarantee a stable navigation channel with a depth of 40 feet and a width of 150 feet as required for safe navigation. The model prediction suggests that the improved solution will create and maintain the design navigation channel within 3–4 years after construction.",,,,Coastal Sediments '07,,,2007-05-11,2007,2012-04-26,2007-05-11,,,2345-2357,Closed,Proceeding,"Cañizares, Rafael; Alfageme, Santiago; Mahoney, Tucker","Cañizares, Rafael (Moffatt & Nichol, 104 West 40th Street, New York, NY 10018.

DESIGN: Descriptive, cross-sectional study using quantitative and qualitative approaches.
SETTING: Department of Pharmacy, University of Limpopo, South Africa.
RESULTS: Most of the 582 pharmacy graduates from UNIN (1966 - 2003) work in South Africa. The questionnaire was sent to 233 graduates and 129 (55.4%) responses were received, of which 121 were analysed. Eighty five (70.2%) respondents were of rural origin; 46.3% work in rural areas and 62.8% in the public sector. Graduates of rural origin were more likely to work in rural areas and the public sector than those of urban origin. Job satisfaction was not related to income. Professional development and service to the community were more commonly cited motivations for taking up the present job than pay. However, 25% of respondents would change jobs for better pay. The most fulfilling aspects of pharmacy practice were interactions with patients, while the most frustrating ones were doctors, restrictive legislation, lack of recognition for the pharmacy profession and poor pay. The focus group discussions and interviews reinforced the above views, with suggested areas for improvement e.g. conditions of service, rural infrastructure and pharmacist involvement in the health system.
CONCLUSIONS: Most UNIN-trained pharmacists are within South Africa. Pharmacists of rural origin were more likely to work in rural areas and the public sector than those of urban origins.

This paper presents a kinetic analysis of the transesterification reaction of palm oil extracted in the Colombian north coast with ethanol to produce biodiesel. The analysis is based in actual lab scale production and it considers a set of three reactions in a batch reactor with dynamic behavior. It was found that the kinetics does not adjust to the common Arrhenius equation model, therefore an extended Arrhenius equation model was proposed. This extended model captures temperature effects better than the standard Arrhenius form. New reaction constants were found using computer-based regression analysis, and the model was later used to simulate a continuous biodiesel production plant.Copyright © 2007 by ASME",,,,Volume 15: Sustainable Products and Processes,,,2007-01-01,2007,2009-05-22,2007-01-01,,,261-265,Closed,Proceeding,"Giraldo, Jorge; García, Jaime; Bula, Antonio; Sanjuan, Marco; Ávila, Adrián","Giraldo, Jorge (Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); García, Jaime (Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); Bula, Antonio (Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); Sanjuan, Marco (Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); Ávila, Adrián (Universidad Pontifícia Bolivariana, Monteria, Colombia)",,"Giraldo, Jorge (Universidad del Norte); García, Jaime (Universidad del Norte); Bula, Antonio (Universidad del Norte); Sanjuan, Marco (Universidad del Norte); Ávila, Adrián (Pontifical Bolivarian University)",0,0,,0.0,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1092766518,40 Engineering; 4002 Automotive Engineering,

The study was carried out in the structures wurtzite and rocksalt because the former is the most stable structure of the GaN, whereas the latter is the most stable structure of the VN. In order to determine the best parameters in the wurtzite structure, the total energy was optimized in function of: (i) the volume of the unit cell, (ii) the relation c/a and (iii) the internal parameter u. For the rocksalt structure the energy was optimized in function of unit cell volume only. As a result we have found that the lattice constant approximately follows Vegard’s law. We have also observed that for vanadium (V) concentrations less than 75%, the most favorable structure is wurtzite. However, for concentrations larger than 75% of vanadium, the most stable structure is the rocksalt.","AcknowledgementsThe authors wish to thank Colciencias, DIB Universidad Nacional, Bogotá and Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla for economic support.",,Solid State Communications,,,,2007-10,2007,,2007-10,144,3-4,109-113,Closed,Article,"González, Rafael; López, William; M., Jairo Arbey Rodríguez","González, Rafael (Condensed Matter Physics Group, Department of Physics, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); López, William (Condensed Matter Physics Group, Department of Physics, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); M., Jairo Arbey Rodríguez (GEMA - Group of Study of Materials, Department of Physics, Universidad Nacional de Colombia, Sede Bogotá, Colombia)","González, Rafael (Universidad del Norte)","González, Rafael (Universidad del Norte); López, William (Universidad del Norte); M., Jairo Arbey Rodríguez (National University of Colombia)",10,0,,1.95,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1041032982,51 Physical Sciences; 5104 Condensed Matter Physics,

(Diptera: Culicidae) pupae in water-storage containers (20–6,412-liter capacities at different water levels) throughout their main dengue virus transmission temperature range was evaluated. Using this method, one set of three calibration factors were derived that could accurately estimate the total Ae. aegypti pupae in their principal breeding sites, large water-storage containers, found throughout the world. No significant differences were obtained using the method at different altitudes (14–1,630 m above sea level) that included the range of temperatures (20–30°C) at which dengue virus transmission occurs in the world. In addition, no significant differences were found in the results obtained between and within the 10 different teams that applied this method; therefore, this method was extremely robust. One person could estimate the Ae. aegypti pupae in each of the large water-storage containers in only 5 min by using this method, compared with two people requiring between 45 and 90 min to collect and count the total pupae population in each of them. Because the method was both rapid to perform and did not disturb the sediment layers in these domestic water-storage containers, it was more acceptable by the residents, and, therefore, ideally suited for routine surveillance purposes and to assess the efficacy of Ae. aegypti control programs in dengue virus-endemic areas throughout the world.","We thank Rosmery Llanos (Universidad del Norte), Leonardo Vera (Puerto Triunfo), Pedro Arango Padilla (Secretaría Distrital de Salud de Barranquilla), Luis Fernando Rendón Villegas y César Augusto Castellanos (Dirección Territorial de Salud de Caldas), Lizbeth Jiménez, Liliana Aristizabal, Consuelo Giraldo Zuluaga (Victoria, Caldas), Gildardo Hernández, Henry Hernández (Viterbo, Caldas), Carlos Alberto Piedrahita and Ferney Cuellar Gallego (Palestina, Caldas) for support during the field work.

In addition to providing a user interface, a P2P host handles query messages and serves requested files. In this paper, we describe the development of a prototype Gnutella-like P2P power management proxy sub-system that handles query messages. This can allow desktop PCs acting as P2P hosts to enter a low-power sleep state for most of the time and be woken-up by the proxy only when needed to serve files. TCP connections with neighbors are maintained by the host when it is awake and by the proxy when the host is sleeping. Experiments show that a low-cost Freescale ColdFire processor can effectively proxy for a P2P host. This suggests that a controller for a Gnutella P2P proxy could be co-located on an Ethernet NIC at low cost. This could lead to significant energy savings by allowing P2P hosts to power manage into a low-power sleep state when not in active use.",This material is based on work supported by the National Science Foundation under Grant No. 0520081.,,,32nd IEEE Conference on Local Computer Networks (LCN 2007),,,2007-10-01,2007,,2007-10-01,,,210-212,All OA; Green,Proceeding,"Jimeno†, Miguel; Christensen, Ken","Jimeno†, Miguel (Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of South Florida, 33620, Tampa, Florida; Universidad del Norte, Colombia); Christensen, Ken (Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of South Florida, 33620, Tampa, Florida)",,"Jimeno†, Miguel (University of South Florida; Universidad del Norte); Christensen, Ken (University of South Florida)",31,0,,9.55,http://www.csee.usf.edu/~christen/energy/lcn07_1_proceedings.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1094806466,"40 Engineering; 4009 Electronics, Sensors and Digital Hardware; 46 Information and Computing Sciences",

Another major problem in modeling the response to policy measures is the potential correlation or dependence between the choices made by a given individual over time (i.e., serial correlation). The two phenomena are closely related. This paper discusses the effects of considering inertia and serial correlation on travel choices. We formulate a fairly general discrete choice model that incorporates randomly distributed inertia thresholds and allow for serial correlation. The inertia thresholds may also be a function of an individual’s socioeconomic characteristics and choice conditions. The model can be applied with panel data as well as with mixed revealed and stated preference data. We applied it to real and simulated data, confirming that if these phenomena exist in the population but are not considered, serious errors in model estimation and prediction may arise, especially in the case of large policy impacts.",,,Transportation Science,,,,2007-05,2007,,2007-05,41,2,195-205,All OA; Green,Article,"Cantillo, Víctor; Ortúzar, Juan de Dios; Williams, Huw C.

However, a high endomorphy rating has been associated with hypertension in adults, posing a serious threat to their health status, while receiving little attention in children.
AIM: The study examined the association between somatotypes, body mass index (BMI) and blood pressure (BP) in 6-13-year-old rural children, in Ellisras, South Africa.
SUBJECTS: A total of 1902 subjects (980 boys and 922 girls) aged 6-13 years were studied as part of the Ellisras Longitudinal Study. Height, weight, four skinfold sites, two breadths, and two girths were measured according to the International Society for the Advancement of Kinanthropometry (ISAK). The Heath-Carter method of somatotyping was used, together with internationally recommended cut-off points for BMI in children. Hypertension, defined as the average of three separate BP readings, where the systolic or diastolic BP is greater than or equal to the 95th percentile for age and sex, was determined.
RESULTS: The prevalence of hypertension ranges from 1 to 5.8% in boys and 3.4-11.4% in girls. The prevalence of overweight ranges from 1.1 to 2.9% in boys and 0.6-4.6% in girls. Systolic BP and BMI showed a significant positive correlation at age 6 years (r = 0.436) and 10-13 years (r = 0.180-0.246 in boys and r = 0.221-0.271 in girls). Diastolic BP showed an insignificant correlation with the BMI and somatotype components in boys and girls.
CONCLUSION: A significant association exists between BP and BMI, and ectomorphy components even after being adjusted for age, gender and height. The need to manage hypertensive individuals is evident in this sample to combat this chronic disease from an early age. Follow-up studies should investigate the relationship between BP and the dietary intake of these children.",,,Annals of Human Biology,,,Adolescent; Age Factors; Anthropometry; Blood Pressure; Body Mass Index; Body Weights and Measures; Child; Female; Humans; Hypertension; Longitudinal Studies; Male; Prevalence; Rural Population; Sex Factors; Somatotypes; South Africa,2007-01,2007,2009-07-09,2007-01,34,2,240-251,Closed,Article,"Makgae, P.

Two hundred naturally growing aspen saplings of similar size and form were randomly selected in a 20-ha area near the endowment lands of the University of Northern British Columbia, Prince George, British Columbia, Canada. Plants were randomly assigned to treatment categories so that the apical meristems of 50 plants each were assigned to a control or were clipped on one of the following dates 6 weeks apart: 1 June, 16 July, and 30 August 2005. The leader of each aspen was clipped and dieback was left to progress until the onset of winter dormancy. Our results showed that the earlier the simulated browsing occurs in the growing season, the greater the length of stem dieback, up to the maximum of the subapical axillary node below the point of clipping. The average rate at which dieback progressed varied between treatments and decreased throughout the growing season. Our results suggest that the ratio of the actual length of stem dieback to the overall length of stem between the clip point and the subapical axillary node serves as a good indicator for estimating the time at which aspen meristems have been browsed during the growing season.Se aplicaron tratamientos de ramoneo simulado a una importante especie arbustiva para el alce de Norte América (Alces alces L.), para ver si el desarrollo y la cantidad de muerte descendente de los tallos del “Trembling aspen” (Populus tremuloides Michx.) pudieran ser usados para determinar el periodo de ramoneo durante la estación de crecimiento. En un área de 20 ha, cercana a los terrenos de la Universidad del Norte de Columbia Británica en Prince George, British Columbia, Canadá, se seleccionaron, en forma aleatoria, 200 plántulas de “Aspen” de una población natural, todas de tamaño y forma similar. Las plantas se asignaron aleatoriamente a los tratamientos, de tal forma que los meristemos ápicales de 50 plantas fueron asignados a un control o fueron cortadas en una de las siguientes fechas con seis semanas de separación entre ellas: 1 de junio, 16 de julio, y 30 de agosto del 2005. El tallo principal de cada plántula fue cortado y se dejo que ocurriera la muerte descendente hasta el inicio de la dormancia invernal. Nuestros resultados mostraron que entre más temprano ocurra la simulación del ramoneo en la estación de crecimiento mayor es la longitud de la muerte descendente de los tallos, hasta el máximo del nudo subápical axilar abajo del punto de corte. La tasa promedio a la cual progresó la muerte descendente varió entre tratamientos y disminuyó a través de la estación de crecimiento. Nuestros resultados sugieren que la relación de la longitud actual de la muerte descendente con la longitud del tallo entre el punto de corte y el nudo subápical axilar sirve como un buen indicador para estimar la época en la que los meristemos del “Aspen” han sido ramoneados durante la estación de crecimiento.",The authors would like to thank Adam Kantakis and Dorianna Hoekstra for their assistance with the clipping trials.

The purpose of the study was to assess the effect of dissolved oxygen concentration on nitrite accumulation in the SBR. As the dissolved oxygen concentration in the SBR depends on the balance between oxygen consumption and oxygen transfer rates, ammonium conversion was measured for different air flowrate values to obtain different dissolved oxygen concentration profiles during the cycle. The ammonia concentration in the feeding medium was 500 mg ammonium as nitrogen (N-NH4(+))/L, and the maximum nitrite concentration achieved during a cycle was approximately 50 mg nitrite as nitrogen (N-NO2)/L. The air flow supplied to the reactor was identified as a suitable parameter to control nitrite accumulation in the SBR. This identification was carried out based on experimental results and simulation with a calibrated model. At a low value of the volumetric mass-transfer coefficient (kLa), the maximum nitrite concentration achieved during a cycle depends strongly on k(L)a, whereas, at a high value of k(L)a, the maximum nitrite concentration was practically independent of kL(a).",,,Water Environment Research,,,"Ammonia; Biodegradation, Environmental; Bioreactors; Kinetics; Models, Biological; Nitrites; Oxygen; Sewage",2007-08,2007,2007-08,2007-08,79,8,845-850,Closed,Article,"Sánchez, Omar; Bernet, Nicolas; Delgenès, Jean-Philippe","Sánchez, Omar (Department of Chemical Engineering, Catholic University of the North, Antofagasta, Chile. osanchez@ucn.cl); Bernet, Nicolas (); Delgenès, Jean-Philippe ()",,"Sánchez, Omar (Catholic University of the North); Bernet, Nicolas (); Delgenès, Jean-Philippe ()",11,0,0.13,0.91,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1077479092,40 Engineering; 4004 Chemical Engineering; 4011 Environmental Engineering,

We also conducted control experiments to show that the use of the proposed mixture of hierarchical models improves the classification performance over bag of feature models.

In spite of the many studies carried out, there are still some points concerning the origin of some of the luminescence emissions in ZnO crystals that require additional study; in particular, the role of extended defects remains to be a matter of controversy. We present here a cathodoluminescence analysis of the defects generated by Vickers indentation in hydrothermal HTT crystals. Special emphasis was paid to the luminescence band peaking around 3.3 eV. The origin of this band is a matter of controversy, since it has been related to different causes, extended defects being one of the candidates for this emission. The CL images were acquired around crystal defects. It is observed that the 3.3 eV emission is enhanced around the crystal defects; though it is also observed, but weaker, out of the defect regions, which suggests that there exist two luminescence emissions peaking very close to 3.3 eV.

The data extracted from the film can be analysed and used to learn the physics of motion of the participating athletes, and to draw conclusions from their hands-on experience. As a main factor of the proposal, this latter characteristic aims at motivating the students to work and participate within a collaborative framework, so as to motivate them to reason and respond the questionnaire issues that stems from a real experience. A significant improvement of knowledge transference is thus attained by promoting teaching (and self-teaching) through reality-based perception, analysis and learning).

It is one of the most economically important species in the littoral benthic systems of the southeastern Pacific region of South America and has been used as a food source since pre-Columbian times and by indigenous Chilean coastal populations. L. albus has a semispherical shell, is middle- to large-sized, and is green in color with reddish or purple shades in ambulacra and interambulacra of large individuals. It is one of the most important benthic grazers in intertidal and shallow subtidal ecosystems. The small individuals of L. albus feed on crustose calcareous algae, benthic diatom films, and pieces of drift algae. Large individuals heavily graze intertidal and subtidal kelps, benthic seaweed turf, and may also feed on drift algae. The reproductive period of L. albus varies with latitude, showing a temporal displacement of the spawning period. The foraging behavior of L. albus is influenced mainly by the degree of wave surge and hunger.",,,Developments in Aquaculture and Fisheries Science,Edible Sea Urchins: Biology and Ecology,,,2007,2007,,2007,37,,227-241,Closed,Chapter,"Vásquez, Julio A","Vásquez, Julio A (Departamento de Biología Marina, Universidad Católica del Norte, Centros Estudios Avanzados en Zonas Aridas, Coquimbo (Chile))",,"Vásquez, Julio A (Catholic University of the North)",12,0,,1.12,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1038886480,"30 Agricultural, Veterinary and Food Sciences; 3005 Fisheries Sciences",

This paper focused on the involvement of males in promoting reproductive health through prevention of unplanned and unwanted pregnancies. A total of 71 males (48 adults and 23 adolescents) were selected conveniently from two health care centres, North of Tshwane, Gauteng province. Structured questionnaires having open and closed questions were used for data collection. Results indicated that most males (young and old) had general information about contraceptives and common side effects associated with contraceptive use. Despite this knowledge, only (29.2%) adults and almost half the number (50.0%) adolescents reportedly used condoms every time when having sex, whilst (35.0%) adults and only (13.6%) adolescents had never used condoms when having sex. Generally, males felt positive and wished to be involved in issues affecting their relationships, such as open communication about contraceptives used by their partners, discussing contraceptive problems together, planning families jointly with partner only, being informed about contraceptive failures and also playing a role in resolving such problems. Recommendations were made to encourage more visible involvement of males in promoting sexuality issues and reproductive health.",,,Curationis,,,"Adolescent; Adult; Condoms; Contraception Behavior; Family Planning Services; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Humans; Male; Men; Middle Aged; South Africa",2007-03,2007,2007-09-28,2007-03,30,1,71-76,All OA; Gold,Article,"Maja, T M M","Maja, T M M (Tshwane University of Technology, PO Box 58858, Karenpark. majatmm@tut.ac.za)",,"Maja, T M M (Tshwane University of Technology)",5,0,0.15,0.87,https://curationis.org.za/index.php/curationis/article/download/1054/990,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1072218036,42 Health Sciences; 4203 Health Services and Systems,3 Good Health and Well Being

Two hundred naturally growing aspen saplings of similar size and form were randomly selected in a 20-ha area near the endowment lands of the University of Northern British Columbia, Prince George, British Columbia, Canada. Plants were randomly assigned to treatment categories so that the apical meristems of 50 plants each were assigned to a control or were clipped on one of the following dates 6 weeks apart: 1 June, 16 July, and 30 August 2005. The leader of each aspen was clipped and dieback was left to progress until the onset of winter dormancy. Our results showed that the earlier the simulated browsing occurs in the growing season, the greater the length of stem dieback, up to the maximum of the subapical axillary node below the point of clipping. The average rate at which dieback progressed varied between treatments and decreased throughout the growing season. Our results suggest that the ratio of the actual length of stem dieback to the overall length of stem between the clip point and the subapical axillary node serves as a good indicator for estimating the time at which aspen meristems have been browsed during the growing season.",The authors would like to thank Adam Kantakis and Dorianna Hoekstra for their assistance with the clipping trials.

In its ground state, Cu3N crystallizes in an anti-ReO3 type cell and it is a semiconductor material with a small indirect gap. In this paper, we report a study of Cu3MN compounds with M=Ni, Cu, Zn, Pd, Ag, and Cd. In the calculations, we have used the same anti-ReO3 type cell of Cu3N, but with the extra transition metal atom at the center of the cube. In particular, our calculated lattice parameters for copper nitride (a=3.82Å) and copper palladium nitride (a=3.89Å) are in excellent agreement with the experimental values of a=3.807Å and a=3.86Å, respectively. In all the cases we have studied, the addition of the transition metal atom modifies the electronic structure of Cu3N, turning all copper-transition metal nitrides into metals.","AcknowledgementsThis work was supported by the Supercomputer Center DGSCA-UNAM, DGAPA Grants IN104803 and IN101103, and Conacyt Grant 48549.

The aim of the present study was to evaluate the association between apolipoprotein E genotype and plasma lipid levels among a rural black population in South Africa.
METHODS: Lipid levels and apoE genotypes were studied in 505 volunteer subjects (363 women, 142 men) resident in the Dikgale demographic surveillance site.
RESULTS: Allele frequencies were found to be 0.190 for epsilon2, 0.518 for epsilon3, and 0.293 for epsilon4, indicating a relatively low frequency of the epsilon3 allele and a high frequency of the epsilon4 allele. To determine the effect of apoE polymorphism on lipid levels three groups were formed: namely epsilon2-, epsilon3-, and epsilon4-expressing groups. A significant effect of the apoE genotype on total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C)/Total cholesterol (TC) ratio, and triglycerides was observed. LDL-C was significantly lower and the HDL-C/TC ratio was significantly higher in the epsilon2 group compared with the epsilon3 and epsilon4 groups. Triglyceride levels were significantly higher in the epsilon2 group than in the epsilon3 group.
CONCLUSIONS: With the unfavourable apoE allele distribution, and the lifestyle changes taking place in rural South African populations, preventive strategies need to be developed to limit a potential epidemic of cardiovascular disease in the black population of South Africa.",,,Scandinavian journal of public health.

The temporal patterns of the main components of these ecosystems, which included Macrocystis integrifolia, Lessonia trabeculata, echinoids and asteroids, were evaluated seasonally between 1996 and 2004. M. integrifolia demonstrated high interannual variability in temporal patterns of abundance. The 1997–1998 ENSO did not significantly modify the temporal patterns of Macrocystis, although local extinction of M. integrifolia beds occurred during negative thermal anomalies in 1999–2000 (La Niña event), facilitating the establishment of urchin dominated “barren grounds”. The abundance of Lessonia trabeculata showed little temporal variability, and this species dominated the deeper regions of the kelp assemblage (8–13m depth).The structure of the kelp communities in the study area is regulated by a trophic cascade which modulates alternation between kelp dominated areas and sea urchin barrens. In this context, frequent and intense upwelling of cold water high in nutrients favors the establishment and persistence of kelp assemblages. During ENSO, coastal upwellings can mitigate superficial warming of coastal water and increase the nutrient concentration in the water column. Superficial warming during the 1997–1998 ENSO induced spawning by different species of echinoderms, which resulted in major recruitment of these species during 1999. Top-down events, such as the decrease in densities of the asteroids after the 1997–1998 ENSO event, favored increases in densities of benthic grazers, which caused significant decreases in abundance of M. integrifolia. The re-establishment of the adult fraction of the carnivore (starfish) guild coincided with a decrease in the density of sea urchins and thus re-establishment of the kelp. In the temperate south eastern Pacific, oceanographic events, which act on different spatial-temporal scales, trigger trophic cascades that act at local levels, producing interannual variability in the structure of kelp communities. On the other hand, considering the high macroinvertebrate diversity associated with kelp assemblages, the transitions between kelp-dominated areas and sea urchin barrens do not appear to significantly affect the biodiversity of these assemblages of benthic invertebrates.",,,Developments in Applied Phycology,Eighteenth International Seaweed Symposium,"Robert Anderson, Juliet Brodie, Edvar Onsøyen, Alan T.

Due to the lack of accurate information and understanding, some adolescents are forced to succumb to early motherhood from unplanned pregnancies or opt for back-street abortion with at times fatal results. A qualitative exploratory study was conducted in 2003 to determine the adolescents' perceptions towards factors on the Choice on Termination of Pregnancy (CTOP) and the constraints in accessing TOP services. A purposive sampling technique that enabled experts such as health workers to identify suitable candidates for the investigation was employed. Twenty-four (24) adolescents residing in the predominantly rural area of Nkumpi-Lepelle in the Limpopo Province agreed to participate in the focus group interviews. The major findings indicated that most adolescents were uninformed about CTOP. This is attributed to the lack of coordination among health professionals and educators in the dissemination of information. The overwhelming majority of the respondents expressed discomfort at receiving termination of pregnancy services from the local public clinics and hospitals as they regarded such facilities as youth unfriendly. The adolescents also required provision of pre- and post-counselling services for adolescents who would like to terminate pregnancy. The following hypotheses were formulated for future in-depth studies: If adolescents continue to lack information about CTOP, they will not be able to utilize available services to terminate unplanned and unwanted pregnancies. If CTOP services remain inaccessible to the youth, the problem of backstreet abortion will not be eradicated.",,,Curationis,,,"Abortion, Legal; Adolescent; Adult; Child; Decision Making; Female; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Health Services Accessibility; Humans; Poverty; Pregnancy; Pregnancy in Adolescence; South Africa",2007-03,2007,2007-09-28,2007-03,30,1,26-31,All OA; Gold,Article,"Ratlabala, M.E.; Makofane, M.D.M.; Jali, M.N.","Ratlabala, M.E.

One of them, such as the fluorescence bleaching from highest intensity to lowest signal of fluorescence is a common problem with several DNA fluorochromes and especially for DAPI stain. The fluorescence of DAPI fades rapidly when it is exposed to UV light, under optimal conditions of observation. Although the fading process can be retarded using a mounting medium with antifading reagents, the photochemical process underlying the fluorescence decay has not yet been fully explained. In addition, no relationship between fluorescence fading and nuclear DNA content has been tested. In order to test this relationship, we measured by means of image analysis the DAPI-fluorescence intensity in several cellular types (spermatozoa, erythrocytes and haemocytes) during their fluorescence bleaching. An algorithm specifically built in MATLAB software was used for this approach. The correlation coefficient between nuclear DNA content and DAPI-fluorescence fading was found equal to 99%. This study demonstrates the feasibility to measure nuclear DNA content by fluorescence fading quantification, as an alternative method concurrently with image analysis procedures.",,,Biological Research,,,"Algorithms; Animals; Cell Nucleus; Chickens; DNA; Feasibility Studies; Flow Cytometry; Fluorescent Dyes; Indoles; Microscopy, Fluorescence; Models, Theoretical; Oncorhynchus mykiss; Software; Tilapia",2007,2007,2007,2007,40,1,29-40,All OA; Gold,Article,"GALLARDO-ESCRATE, CRISTIAN; LVAREZ-BORREGO, JOSU; VON BRAND, ELISABETH; DUPR, ENRIQUE; DEL RO-PORTILLA, MIGUEL NGEL","GALLARDO-ESCRATE, CRISTIAN (Universidad de Concepcin Facultad de Ciencias Naturales y Oceangraficas Departamento de Oceanografa, Concepcin, Chile); LVAREZ-BORREGO, JOSU (Centro de Investigacin Cientfica y de Educacin Superior de Ensenada Departamento de ptica, Ensenada, Mxico); VON BRAND, ELISABETH (Universidad Catlica del Norte Departamento de Biologa Marina, Coquimbo, Chile); DUPR, ENRIQUE (Universidad Catlica del Norte Departamento de Biologa Marina, Coquimbo, Chile); DEL RO-PORTILLA, MIGUEL NGEL (Centro de Investigacin Cientfica y de Educacin Superior de Ensenada Departamento de Acuicultura, Ensenada, Mxico)",,"GALLARDO-ESCRATE, CRISTIAN (University of Concepción); LVAREZ-BORREGO, JOSU (Centro de Investigacin Cientfica y de Educacin Superior de Ensenada Departamento de ptica, Ensenada, Mxico); VON BRAND, ELISABETH (Catholic University of the North); DUPR, ENRIQUE (Catholic University of the North); DEL RO-PORTILLA, MIGUEL NGEL (Centro de Investigacin Cientfica y de Educacin Superior de Ensenada Departamento de Acuicultura, Ensenada, Mxico)",20,2,0.34,1.35,http://www.scielo.cl/pdf/bres/v40n1/art04.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1045711243,31 Biological Sciences; 3105 Genetics,14 Life Below Water

This study was designed to characterize strains of A. marginale at the molecular level from cattle raised in communal and commercial farms in the north-eastern and south-western regions of the Free State Province, South Africa, that varied in rainfall and vegetation. Seroprevalence to A. marginale was determined in 755 cattle by an Anaplasma spp. competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and ranged from 44% to 98% and was similar in both regions. While Anaplasma centrale was not targeted in this study, A. marginale infections were identified by species-specific msp1alpha polymerase chain reaction in 129 of 215 of the samples studied. Similar genetic diversity of A. marginale strains was found in both the north-eastern and south-western regions. The sequences of 29 A. marginalemsp1alpha amplicons from South African strains revealed considerable genetic diversity providing 14 new repeat sequences. However, 42% of MSP1a repeat sequences were not unique to this region. These results indicated the presence of common genotypes between South African, American and European strains of A. marginale. Cattle movement between different parts of South Africa was suggested by the presence of identical A. marginale MSP1a genotypes in north-eastern and south-western regions of the Free State Province. Control strategies for anaplasmosis in South Africa should therefore be designed to be protective against genetically heterogeneous strains of A. marginale.","We gratefully acknowledge the cooperation of farmers from the Free State Province in the collection of blood samples from their cattle.

METHODS: Thirty-six participants who reside at sea level were transported to an altitude of 3696 m (Ollagüe). The participants were divided into 3 groups and received G biloba (n=12) 80 mg/12 h, acetazolamide (n=12) 250 mg/12 h, or placebo (n=12) 24 hours before ascending and during their 3-day stay at high altitude. The Lake Louise Questionnaire constituted the primary outcome measurement at sea level and at 3696 m. A Lake Louise Self-Report Score greater than 3 was indicative of AMS. Oxygen saturation, heart rate, and arterial pressure were taken with each evaluation for AMS.
RESULTS: A significant reduction in AMS was observed in the group that received G biloba (0%, P<.05) comparison with the groups receiving acetazolamide (36%, P<.05) or placebo (54%). No difference was observed in arterial oxygen saturation in the G biloba (92+/-2) vs the acetazolamide (89+/-2) groups. However, a marked increased saturation in arterial oxygen was seen in comparison with the placebo group (84+/-3, P<.05). No statistically significant differences were observed in mean arterial pressure or heart rate.
CONCLUSIONS: This study provides evidence supporting the use of G biloba in the prevention of AMS, demonstrating that 24 hours of pretreatment with G biloba and subsequent maintenance during exposure to high altitude are sufficient to reduce the incidence of AMS in participants with no previous high-altitude experience.",,,Wilderness and Environmental Medicine,,,Acetazolamide; Adult; Altitude; Altitude Sickness; Blood Pressure; Chile; Ginkgo biloba; Heart Rate; Humans; Male; Oxygen Consumption; Phytotherapy; Plant Extracts; Surveys and Questionnaires; Time Factors; Treatment Outcome,2007-12,2007,,2007-12,18,4,251-257,All OA; Bronze,Article,"Moraga, Fernando A.; Flores, Alejandro; Serra, Jordi; Esnaola, Carla; Barriento, Corina","Moraga, Fernando A.

1144,pub.1061317233,10.1109/jsac.2007.070615,,,G+: Enhanced Traffic Grooming in WDM Mesh Networks using Lighttours,"In this article, a new technique for grooming low-speed traffic demands into high-speed optical routes is proposed. This enhancement allows a transparent wavelength-routing switch (WRS) to aggregate traffic en route over existing optical routes without incurring expensive optical-electrical-optical (OEO) conversions. This implies that: a) an optical route may be considered as having more than one ingress node (all inline) and, b) traffic demands can partially use optical routes to reach their destination. The proposed optical routes are named ""lighttours"" since the traffic originating from different sources can be forwarded together in a single optical route, i.e., as taking a ""tour"" over different sources towards the same destination. The possibility of creating lighttours is the consequence of a novel WRS architecture proposed in this article, named ""enhanced grooming"" (G+). The ability to groom more traffic in the middle of a lighttour is achieved with the support of a simple optical device named lambda-monitor (previously introduced in the RingO project). In this article, we present the new WRS architecture and its advantages. To compare the advantages of lighttours with respect to classical lightpaths, an integer linear programming (ILP) model is proposed for the well-known multilayer problem: traffic grooming, routing and wavelength assignment The ILP model may be used for several objectives. However, this article focuses on two objectives: maximizing the network throughput, and minimizing the number of optical-electro-optical conversions used. Experiments show that G+ can route all the traffic using only half of the total OEO conversions needed by classical grooming. An heuristic is also proposed, aiming at achieving near optimal results in polynomial time",,,IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications,,,,2007-06,2007,,,25,5,1034-1047,All OA; Green,Article,"Solano, F.; Caro, L.F.; de Oliveira, J.C.; Fabregat, R.; Marzo, J.L.","Solano, F.

Nonetheless, so far only two paleoindian skeletons have been exhumed from the local rockshelters. The oldest one (9870 +/- 50 BP; CAL 11060 +/- 50), uncovered in Toca dos Coqueiros and known as ""Zuzu,"" represents a rare opportunity to explore the biological relationships of paleoindian groups living in northeastern Brazil. As previously demonstrated, South and Central America Paleoindians present skull morphology distinct from the one found nowadays in Amerindians and similar to Australo-Melanesians. Here we test the hypothesis that Zuzu shows higher morphological affinity with Paleoindians. However, Zuzu is a controversial skeleton since previous osteological assessments have disagreed on several aspects, especially regarding its sex. Thus, we compared Zuzu to males and females independently. Morphological affinities were assessed through clustering of principal components considering 18 worldwide populations and through principal components analysis of the individual dispersion of five key regions for America's settlement. The results obtained do not allow us to refute the hypothesis, expanding the known geographical dispersion of the Paleoindian morphology into northeast Brazil. To contribute to the discussion regarding Zuzu's sex, a new estimation is presented based on visual inspection of cranial and post-cranial markers, complemented by a discriminant analysis of its morphology in relation to the paleoindian sample. The results favor a male classification and are consistent with the mortuary offerings found in the burial, yet do not agree with a molecular determination.",,,American Journal of Biological Anthropology,,,Brazil; Classification; Cluster Analysis; Female; Fossils; Humans; Male; Sex Characteristics; Skull,2007-06-27,2007,2007-06-27,2007-10,134,2,285-291,Closed,Article,"Hubbe, Mark; Neves, Walter A.; do Amaral, Heleno Licurgo; Guidon, Niéde","Hubbe, Mark (Instituto de Investigaciones Arqueológicas y Museo‐Universidad Católica del Norte, Calle Gustavo LePaige 380, 141‐0000 San Pedro de Atacama, Chile); Neves, Walter A.

These complexes can alter the structure of chromatin by mechanisms that involve nucleosome sliding, dissociation, or replacement over a specific promoter. The SWI/SNF chromatin-remodeling complex is required for transcriptional activation or repression in a subset of genes. In the present study we have isolated the spSWI/SNF complex from Schizosaccharomyces pombe, which has at least seven subunits among them spSwi1-like and the catalytic subunit spBrg1. These subunits are homologues to Swi1 and Swi2/Snf2, respectively in Sacharomyces cerevisiae. Moreover, we have demonstrated that spSWI/SNF is able to promote in vitro transcription by RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) in a reconstituted system. In our transcription assays with cellular extracts of Sc. pombe we did not observe inhibition when α-Swi1 antibodies were utilized, indicating that other chromatin-remodeling complexes may allow transcription in Sc. pombe.","We thank Mrs. Cecilia Olivares for critical reading of the manuscript.

Paleoenvironmental information reveals high amplitude and rapid changes in effective moisture during the Holocene period and, consequently, dramatically changing environmental conditions. Therefore, this area is suitable to study the response of hunting and gathering societies to environmental changes, because the smallest variations in the climatic conditions have large impacts on resources and the living space of humans. This chapter analyzes environmental and paleoclimatic information from lake sediments, ice cores, pollen profiles, and geomorphic processes and relates these with the cultural and geographic settlement patterns of human occupation in the different habitats in the area of southern Peru, southwest Bolivia, northwest Argentina, and north Chile and puts in perspective of the early and late Holocene to present a representative range of environmental and cultural changes. It has been found that the largest changes took place around 9000 cal yr BP when the humid early Holocene conditions were replaced by extremely arid but highly variable climatic conditions. These resulted in a marked decrease of human occupation, “ecological refuges,” increased mobility, and an orientation toward habitats with relatively stable resources (such as the coast, the puna seca, and “ecological refuges”).",,,,Climate Change and Cultural Dynamics,,,2007,2007,,2007,,,51-115,Closed,Chapter,"Grosjean, Martin; Santoro, Calogero M.; Thompson, Lonnie G.; Núñez, Lautaro; Standen, Vivien G.","Grosjean, Martin (Department of Anthropology, University of Tennessee, Knoxville, TN 37996, USA NCCR Climate and Institute of Geography, University of Bern, 9a Erlachstrasse, 3012 Bern, Switzerland); Santoro, Calogero M.

The article shows the methodology applied in the design process, its modeling and the building of a novel underwater parallel robot (UPR). The designed robot is based on the well-known Stewart-Gough (S-G) platform that leads us to a new concept of geometry-variable underwater robot. The main advantage of this study is that the S-G platform allows not only a relative orientation between the two rings, but also a relative displacement, which increases the navigation capabilities of other gimbaled thruster designs.

However, there is now more evidence supporting the hypothesis that these compounds also act through noncholinergic pathways, especially those related to cognitive processes. The enzyme acylpeptide hydrolase was identified as a new target for organophosphate pesticides. This enzyme is more sensitive than AChE to some organophosphates (OP), including dichlorvos, which is the parent compound for metrifonate, a therapeutic agent used in the treatment of cognitive impairment associated to Alzheimer's disease. Therefore, there is some doubt as to whether the mechanism of action of this drug is mediated by a potentiation of cholinergic transmission. However, the direct action of acylpeptide hydrolase in cognitive processes and the physiological and molecular mechanisms underlying subacute exposure to OP have yet to be demonstrated. This review deals with evidence demonstrating the existence of mechanisms of actions of OP, which are independent of cholinergic pathway potentiation and which have an effect on cognitive processes. In addition, the possible participation of the enzyme acylpeptide hydrolase in these processes is also discussed. Finally, the possibility of using this enzyme activity as a new biomarker for exposure to OP is considered.","This work was supported by the General Direction of Investigation and Postgraduate of the Universidad Católica del Norte for F.

Cultures were carried out in lantern and basket nets suspended in seawater tanks having a constant flow of fresh seawater from La Herradura Bay. A total of 900 juveniles were observed, starting with individuals having an average length of 20 mm. The abalone juveniles were fed with two species of macroalgae, half of which was Gracilaria chilensis, and the other was half Ulva sp (mass basis), fed ad libitum. Artificial pelletized food was fed as a supplement, at a rate of 2% of the body mass of the abalones daily. Water quality in the cultures was monitored twice daily, included water temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen, and water flow rate. The average survival of the abalones at the termination of the experimental period was 96.2% in the lantern nets, and 94.6% in the culture baskets, although these differences were not statistically significant (P > 0.05; nested ANOVA). The highest mean specific growth rates were obtained in the lantern net systems with rates of 0.34% per day in length and 1.02% per day in weight; comparative values for the basket systems were 0.31% per day and 0.86% per day. Higher growth rates for weight and length of the shell were obtained in the lantern systems than in the basket culture systems. An analysis of covariance of values for growth in weight and length of the abalones showed significant differences between results from the lantern and basket systems (P < 0.05). Based on the results of the study, the lantern systems should be considered as an interesting alternative for the culture of Haliotis discus hannai both in land-based cultures, and at sea, because they have a larger carrying capacity for abalones compared with the baskets in the culture tanks and only occupy one third of the water column space. The lantern nets not only provided the best growth, but were also more economical, and easier to handle than the baskets.",,,Journal of Shellfish Research,,,,2007-09,2007,,2007-09,26,3,769-776,Closed,Article,"PEREIRA, LUIS; RASSE, SALVADOR","PEREIRA, LUIS (Universidad Cat, lica del Norte, Faculty of Marine Science, Aquaculture Department, Casilla 117.

Common themes that emerged from the analysis included the attribution of illnesses and disorders to spiritual factors, punishment and superstitious beliefs. Treatment approaches included the use of natural substances, prayer and rituals, and procedures that were designed to restore equilibrium.

OBJECTIVE: The main objective of the present study was to evaluate radiodiagnosis services in two public hospitals with x-ray equipment in the city of Rio Branco, Acre, Brazil. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Interviews, measurements and direct observation were performed, following the Brazilian legislation in force, especially the Order (Portaria) SVS/MS 453 of 1998 of the Ministry of Health establishing the basic guidelines for radiation exposure protection in medical and odontological x-ray facilities. RESULTS: The data indicated a high rate of non-compliance with the legislation in both radiological services, especially concerning poor equipment operation, and non-compliance with some safety protocols. CONCLUSION: Basically, technical and operational infractions have occurred as a result of a broad unfamiliarity with the legislation, the absence of a preventive equipment maintenance program, besides low investment in training and/or courses for professional updating.

The first event was the extrusion of a thick lava series of the La Negra Formation, dated at 159.9 ± 1.0 Ma (2σ) from the upper part of the series. A contemporaneous intrusion is dated at 159.6 ± 1.1 Ma, and later intrusive events are dated at 145.5 ± 2.8 and 137.4 ± 1.1 Ma, respectively. Analyzed alteration minerals such as adularia, sericite, and actinolite apparently give valid 40Ar/39Ar plateau and miniplateau ages. They indicate the occurrence of several alteration events at ca. 160–163, 154–157, 143–148, and 135–137 Ma. The first alteration event, being partly contemporaneous with volcanic and plutonic rocks, was probably produced in a high thermal gradient environment. The later events may be related either to a regional low-grade hydrothermal alteration/metamorphism process or to plutonic intrusions. The Cu mineralization of the Michilla district is robustly bracketed between 163.6 ± 1.9 and 137.4 ± 1.1 Ma, corresponding to dating of actinolite coexisting with early-stage chalcocite and a postmineralization barren dyke, respectively. More precisely, the association of small intrusives (a dated stock from the Michilla district) with Cu mineralization in the region strongly suggests that the main Michilla ore deposit is related to a magmatic/hydrothermal event that occurred between 157.4 ± 3.6 and 163.5 ± 1.9 Ma, contemporaneous or shortly after the extrusion of the volcanic sequence. This age is in agreement with the Re–Os age of 159 ± 16 Ma obtained from the mineralization itself (Tristá-Aguilera et al., Miner Depos, 41:99–105,2006).","This work was financially supported by the Institut de Recherche pour le Développement (IDR), a MECESUP-Chile scholarship (D Tristá–Aguilera), and Minera Michilla S.A.

This mountainous semiarid realm occupies an area of 40,656 km2 between 29° and 32°S. Given that the area has a long historical record of mining activities, important environmental disturbances were expected. However, despite the detection of three major geochemical anomalies for Cu, Zn, or As, only one can be unmistakably linked to the development of mining–metal recovery procedures (Andacollo–Panulcillo). An investigation of the other two anomalies (Elqui and Hurtado) reveals three major causes that fully or partially account for them: (1) the type of ore deposit and associated hydrothermal alteration; (2) the regional structural setting (intensity of fracturing); and (3) climate–landscape. Cu–Au–As epithermal deposits/prospects along the so-called El Indio belt are here regarded as the sources of both the Elqui and Hurtado anomalies. The strong advanced argillic alteration present in some of the epithermal deposits/prospects of the El Indio belt may have induced the loss of the buffering capacity of rocks, and therefore favoured metal dispersion during later oxidation–leaching of sulphides. This applies to the Elqui and Hurtado anomalies. Conversely, given that the potassic, propylitic and phyllic alterations do not affect the buffering capacity of rocks, only minor metal dispersion is observed in relation to the Los Pelambres porphyry copper deposit. Besides, the epithermal belt is located within a highly fractured Andean domain (3,000–4,000 m of altitude), which may have conditioned the fast unroofing of ore deposits, contributed to enhanced circulation of meteoric waters, and eventually, to strong oxidation, and leaching of metals. Metal dispersion is aggravated during rainy years in response to strong El Niño episodes.","This research was funded by Grant PPQ2003-01902 (Spanish Ministry of Education and Science).

Scallop spat was collected at 16-m depth and grown at 1- and 16-m depths. An initial settlement of ca. 13,000 post-larvae per bottom collector (2 cohorts) was observed on 3 February 2001. Two new cohorts settled in bottom collectors on 3 March, while no spat settlement occurred in surface collectors. The four cohorts exhibited substantial and different mortality rates over the study period, depending on the cohort and on-growing depth. The first and second cohorts exhibited mortality rates of 80.3 and 53.1% in bottom collectors, respectively, versus 29 and 43.6% in surface structures. The third and fourth cohorts exhibited mortality rates of 21.4 and 59.7% in bottom collectors, respectively. Mean shell height of scallop spat after 88 days of culture was 6.46 mm for the first cohort and 4.37 mm for the second cohort in bottom collectors, versus 10.33 and 7.31 mm in surface collectors, respectively. Mean post-larval growth rate in bottom collectors (86 μm day−1) was significantly lower than growth rate in surface collectors (146 μm day−1). Factors explaining the depth-related mortality and growth rates are discussed to improve scallop culture in the Reserve. It was concluded from the results that culture improvement in Antofagasta Bay would require collecting spat in bottom waters and raising it near the surface during initial cultivation stages.","The present study benefited from the framework of a FNDR Project, code BIP 20127869-0, and from an ECOS-CONICYT (France–Chile) program (Action No. C98B02).

Such work can occur through community development, a community-driven process in which communities are supported in identifying and addressing their health priorities.
PURPOSE: This paper presents the qualitative findings of a study that explored the experiences of occupational therapists in Canada working in community development including how they understand community development and how they designed their role in this field.
METHODS: Occupational therapists working in community development shared their experiences and understanding of community development during 12 interviews.

Information systems in Health appeared more than 3 decades ago but decisions are usually taken on considerations directed to the solution of a manifestation without modification of causal factors. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the usefulness of available data to identify population groups with similar characteristics associated to health problems and to identify simple markers to serve as a basis for decisions directed to solve them. Methods: Ecological study. Data were identified, collected and collated from public institutions and from recent studies for analysis. Association and correlation among the different variables identified those with the capacity to discriminate population groups. Household socio economic stratum had a significant association with most variables and was used to divide «Barrios» in four conglomerates. Results: Lower conglomerates presented deficiencies in household and education, larger proportion of young population, lower mean death age, higher mortality caused by accidents and violence, and lower stature. Middle and higher income conglomerates had better household conditions and the principal cause of death was tumors and chronic diseases. Public services were similar for all except telephone. Weighed household stratum by neighborhood «barrio» explained more that 80% of variance for most variables.

The neurotrophin BDNF, by acting through its receptor TrkB, has been implicated in such reorganization. In the present work we investigated, by Western blot and immunohistochemistry, whether regional changes of TrkB expression within the rat brain cortex are correlated with altered neuronal morphology and/or with apoptotic cell death. We found that the full-length TrkB protein decreased within the cortex when measured 24 h to 1 week after induction of SE. Analysis by immunohistochemistry revealed that TrkB staining diminished within layer V of the retrosplenial granular b (RSGb) and motor cortices, but not within the auditory cortex. In layer II/III, differential changes were also observed: TrkB decreased in the motor cortex, did not change within the RSGb but increased within the auditory cortex. Reduced TrkB was associated with dendritic atrophy and decreased spine density in pyramidal neurons within layer V of the RSGb. No correlation was observed between regional and cellular changes of TrkB protein and apoptosis, measured by the TdT-mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) method. The global decrease of TrkB within the neocortex and the associated dendritic atrophy may counteract seizure propagation in the epileptic brain but may also underlie cognitive impairment after seizures.","AcknowledgmentsWe are grateful to Mauricio Sandoval for careful reading of this manuscript.

Lo anterior pretende contribuir con mayor evidencia emprica a la discusin acerca de las dinmicas sociales e interaccin econmica entre las tierras bajas y altas de los Desarrollos Regionales (perodo Intermedio Tardo) de esta parte de los Andes Centro Sur In this paper we study the ceramic material from the archaeological villages of the Tarapaca region, located in the high ravines, the low valleys, and the coast to the west and east of Pampa del Tamarugal. Our objective is to do a systematic review of earlier studies by ourselves and by other investigators of domestic pottery in the region, to update knowledge about the culture history and social processes related to the still poorly known Pica Tarapaca cultural complex of nor then Chile. We propose that this cultural complex developed during the Late Intermediate Period in at least two phases, initial and classic, that we have named Tarapaca Phase (ca. A.D. 900-1,250) and Camina Phase (ca. A.D. 1,250-1,450), respectively. We propose a local pottery tradition that began toward the end of the Formative Period and then, in the absence of Tiwanaku stylistic influences, incorporated new elements from the southern altiplano. This was the panorama that dominated the region when the Inka arrived. This work is intended to contribute with greater empirical evidence to the discussion about social dynamics and economic interaction between lowlands and highlands of this part of the South Central Andes during the Regional Developments of the Late Intermediate Period",,,Chungara - Revista de Antropología Chilena,,,,2007-12,2007,2007-12,,39,2,143-170,All OA; Gold,Article,"Uribe, Mauricio; Sanhueza, Lorena; Bahamondes, Francisco","Uribe, Mauricio (Universidad de Chile Facultad de Ciencias Sociales Departamento de Antropologa, Santiago, Chile); Sanhueza, Lorena (Universidad de Chile Facultad de Ciencias Sociales Departamento de Antropologa, Santiago, Chile); Bahamondes, Francisco (Universidad de Chile Facultad de Ciencias Sociales Departamento de Antropologa, Santiago, Chile)",,"Uribe, Mauricio (University of Chile); Sanhueza, Lorena (University of Chile); Bahamondes, Francisco (University of Chile)",49,5,,28.49,http://www.scielo.cl/pdf/chungara/v39n2/art01.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1024913167,"44 Human Society; 47 Language, Communication and Culture; 4702 Cultural Studies",

Plankton sampling and spat collection were used to characterize larval and post-larval stages of the Argopecten purpuratus population within this reserve, between December 1995 and March 2000. Main goals were to determine optimal scallop spat collection area, temporal variations of spat settlement and the effect of collector distance off the bottom, and spat growth within the collectors. Larval sampling showed the almost continuous presence, although in variable abundances, of scallop larvae, except for late August–September. Greatest larval abundances were consistently observed from November–December to April–May of the following year. This pattern was altered during the La Niña event of 1998–2000 with unusual peaks of larvae in late July 1999 and November–December 1999. A significant positive relationship was found between the abundance of the large-sized larvae and Chl a concentration ca. 2 weeks before, between February 1999 and February 2000. Larval growth rates ranged from 3.5 to 7.3 μm day−1. Shallow waters were not appropriate for spat collection; the best spat collection area was located in the northwestern part of the Reserve, in water depths ranging from 15 to 20–25 m. Spat settlement was significantly higher at 1 m and 2 m off the bottom, compared with 3 m off the seabed. There was no clear pattern of differential spat growth with collector distance from the bottom in a given site, but spatial variations were observed in the Bay at 1 m off the bottom depending on depth-related bottom-water temperature. Spat settlement occurred almost continuously between November 1997 and March 2000, but in variable proportions: spat abundance ranged from 12 to 6540 ind.coll.−1. Mean spat growth rate was 175 μm day−1 during the ENSO period, vs. 143 μm day−1 during La Niña. Culture improvements are discussed from these new insights on the reproductive cycle and spat collection of A. purpuratus. The former would facilitate future management practices and would help to restore stocks in the Rinconada Bay.","AcknowledgmentsThis research was financed through the Regional Development National Fund (FNDR), Antofagasta, Chile No. 20124810-0 and No.20127869-0, and an ECOS–CONICYT (France–Chile) program (Action No. C98B02).

In South America the situation is less dramatic. Two important archaeological regions have generated important collections that allow the analysis of the cranial morphological variation of the Early Americans: Lagoa Santa, Brazil, and Sabana de Bogotá, Colombia. Human crania from the former region have been studied by one of us (WAN) and collaborators, showing that the cranial morphology of the first South Americans was very different from that prevailing today in East Asia and among Native Americans. These results have allowed for proposing that the New World may have been colonized by two different biological populations in the final Pleistocene/early Holocene. In this study, 74 human skulls dated between 11.0 and 3.0 kyr, recovered in seven different sites of Sabana de Bogotá, Colombia, were compared with the world cranial variation by different multivariate techniques: Principal Components Analysis, Multidimensional Scaling, and Cluster of Mahalanobis distance matrices. The Colombian skeletal remains were divided in two chronological subgroups: Paleocolombians (11.0-6.0 kyr) and Archaic Colombians (5.0-3.0 kyr). Both quantitative techniques generated convergent results: the Paleocolombians show remarkable similarities with Lagoa Santa and with modern Australo-Melanesians. Archaic Colombians exhibited the same morphological patterns and associations. These findings support our long-held proposition that the early American settlement may have involved two very distinct biological populations coming from Asia. On the other hand, they suggest the possibility of late survivals of the Paleoamerican pattern not restricted to isolated or marginal areas, as previously thought.",,,American Journal of Biological Anthropology,,,"Cephalometry; Colombia; Female; Geography; History, Ancient; Humans; Indians, South American; Male; Multivariate Analysis; Population Dynamics; Skull",2007-06-06,2007,2007-06-06,2007-08,133,4,1080-1098,All OA; Bronze,Article,"Neves, Walter A.; Hubbe, Mark; Correal, Gonzalo","Neves, Walter A.

Paleoclimatological evidence indicates that both Amazonia and the Brazilian coast were cooler and drier prior to ca. 7000 14C yr BP. In both regions, the forest was substantially reduced and the predominant vegetation was grass and shrubs as a result of climatic changes. These ameliorations permitted larger and more sedentary communities, but inherent limitations to intensive agriculture and dependence on wild protein sources placed a ceiling on population concentration throughout the lowlands. This study summarizes the evidence for paleoclimatological fluctuations and prehistoric cultural changes since ca. 13,000 14C yr BP (uncal.) separately for the Coastal Strip and the Amazon Basin. Both the climatological and cultural data indicate that these now distinct regions experienced long- and short-term environmental fluctuations during and since the Pleistocene that favored the emergence and perpetuation of similar general cultural configurations. The achievement of Holocene climatic conditions and stabilization of sea level ca. 5000 14C yr BP had major environmental consequences. It created an ecological barrier between Amazonia and the Coastal Strip and divided each region into a narrow aquatic zone and a large hinterland. Finally, it suggests that in contrast to other parts of the planet, Holocene climatic changes did not significantly improve the opportunities for agricultural intensification and associated cultural development.",,,,Climate Change and Cultural Dynamics,,,2007,2007,,2007,,,117-155,Closed,Chapter,"Meggers, Betty J.","Meggers, Betty J.

Isotope analyses, unlike the evidence from botanical, faunal and artifactual remains from archaeological sites, and from dental and skeletal pathologies, gave information of which resources were really eaten by each individual during the last years of their life. The human data were evaluated against isotopic values of marine and terrestrial resources from central Chile. These results were interpreted taking into consideration different lines of paleodiet evidence. The main contributions are: empirical evidence of dietary differences according to cultural groups; low dependence on marine foods for most people living on the coast; indirect evidence of mobility strategies that show differences between Early and Late Intermediate societies; increased dependence on maize with time, especially among the Aconcagua people; gender differences in maize consumption for the same Aconcagua groups, men showing the greatest levels of maize intake.

The filling status of the xylem vessels was determined by xylem sap extraction (using jet-discharge, gravity-discharge, and centrifugation) and by 1H nuclear magnetic resonance imaging of wood pieces. Simultaneously, pressure bomb experiments were performed along the entire trunk of the trees up to a height of 57 m. Clear-cut evidence was found that the balancing pressure (Pb) values of leafy twigs were dictated by the ambient relative humidity rather than by height. Refilling of xylem vessels of apical leaves (branches) obviously mainly occurred via moisture uptake from the atmosphere. These findings could be traced back to the hydration and rehydration of mucilage layers on the leaf surfaces and/or of epistomatal mucilage plugs. Xylem vessels also contained mucilage. Mucilage formation was apparently enforced by water stress. The observed mucilage-based foliar water uptake and humidity dependency of the Pb values are at variance with the cohesion–tension theory and with the hypothesis that Pb measurements yield information about the relationships between xylem pressure gradients and height.",,,Protoplasma,,,Adhesives; Atmosphere; Dehydration; Glycosaminoglycans; Gravitation; Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy; Plant Leaves; Pressure; Trees; Water; Xylem,2007-12,2007,2008-01-07,2007-12,232,1-2,11,Closed,Article,"Zimmermann, D.; Westhoff, M.; Zimmermann, G.; Geßner, P.; Gessner, A.; Wegner, L.

This is not the only arena where listening to pupils counts. This article examines the ways in which two young people, making a significant choice about which university to attend, felt unable to discuss their interests and concerns with their teachers. In one case, this resulted in a young woman doing less well in her examinations in order to avoid getting her first preference of Oxbridge, and securing her ‘real choice’ at another Russell Group university. The other was not invited by his school to apply to Oxbridge, despite a desire to go there which he felt unable to articulate at school.

458,pub.1046122235,10.1108/14676370710726689,,,Rural‐based universities in South Africa,"Purpose The purpose of this paper is to focus on how two rural‐based universities in South Africa can contribute towards sustainable development especially in their immediate rural communities. It addresses the following questions: what conditions or policy frameworks exist that can engender a sustainable development trajectory? How can rural‐based universities reconstitute themselves so they can become effective agents for sustainable rural development? Historically, because of apartheid policies, these and other black universities were on the margins of the knowledge production process and have not effectively engaged in real development activities that would meaningfully improve the livelihoods of rural dwellers. The research identified policy and legislative instruments and strategies that can promote a dynamic interaction with other institutions thus empowering and promoting sustainability. The aim of the paper is to raise awareness about existing possibilities at the disposal of these institutions.   Design/methodology/approach The paper is the outcome of two research initiatives: one was a doctoral study by one of the authors, and the other was a study conducted at both universities. Both studies involved extensive interviews with a wide spectrum of stakeholders (local and provincial authorities, members of the business and university communities). Both also involved document analyses.   Findings That rural‐based universities are advantageously situated and possess a variety of characteristics that can enable them to effectively contribute to sustainable development. These include their strategic location within the rural communities; reinventing their mission orientation so as to enhance their research capacity; expanding their intellectual/entrepreneurial/social capital; and the establishment of strong collaborative relationships.   Practical implications The first aim of the paper is to raise the awareness of policy makers and other stakeholders about the strategic value of these institutions. The awareness should lead to a series of engagements with appropriate individuals with the view to develop appropriate strategies for application.   Originality/value The contribution of rural‐based universities to sustainable development has not been sufficiently researched in South Africa and, therefore, the study fills the gap by adding valuable knowledge, new perspectives, and presents possibilities for consideration.",,,International Journal of Sustainability in Higher Education,,Kathleen Kevany,,2007-04-17,2007,,2007-04-17,8,2,234-246,All OA; Green,Article,"Nkomo, Mokubung; Sehoole, Chika","Nkomo, Mokubung (Assessment Technology and Education Evaluation, Human Sciences Research Council, Department of Education Management and Policy Studies, Faculty of Education, University of Pretoria, Pretoria, South Africa); Sehoole, Chika (Faculty of Education, University of Pretoria, Pretoria, South Africa)",,"Nkomo, Mokubung (Assessment Technology and Education Evaluation, Human Sciences Research Council, Department of Education Management and Policy Studies, Faculty of Education, University of Pretoria, Pretoria, South Africa); Sehoole, Chika (University of Pretoria)",21,7,,,https://repository.up.ac.za/bitstream/2263/2544/1/Nkomo_Rural-based%282007%29.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1046122235,39 Education; 41 Environmental Sciences,11 Sustainable Cities and Communities; 4 Quality Education

People, governments, leaders, laws, ideas and indeed everything else is ever changing. Great care should, however, be taken as to what, how and why things should be changed. This article looks at the renaming of geographical entities, especially after the advent of democracy in South Africa. The article is necessitated by the fact that such changes affect the community profoundly with regard to their emotions, finances and culture, among others. The effects of change, such as fear, excitement, negative attitudes and resistance, are likely to stay with the affected community for some time, and can cause instability within the community. For instance, resistance is evident in Limpopo with the proposed renaming of Tzaneen, and in Durban, where certain community members feel aggrieved by the proposed renaming of some streets.

A survey of participating fishers in Chile's Fourth and Fifth regions examined four social benefits predicted to result from this type of co-management: (1) improved rapport between fishers and the state, (2) greater awareness among fishers of ecology and the benefits of management, (3) cooperation between fishers and scientists, and (4) unity between fishers. A discussion analyzes the principal benefit encountered—fishers’ newfound “consciousness” of the value of management—within the context of co-management and territorial use rights.","AcknowledgementsSarah Schumann would like to thank the following entities for providing advice and information: Subsecretaría de Pesca, Servicio Nacional de Pesca, Universidad Católica de Valparaíso, Universidad del Mar, Universidad Andres Bello, Biomar, Bitecma, and OCAC.

In the present study we analysed the feeding habits of this species over a 2‐year cycle. The samples were obtained from landings of the artisanal fishery at two sites on the Uruguayan coast: one representing a transitional habitat between estuarine and marine conditions (Piriápolis), the other representing a typical marine ecosystem (La Paloma). Different approaches were considered (Index of Relative Importance, IRI; graphical methods and multivariate techniques of cluster analysis and Principal Component Analysis). The ontogenetic changes in the diet were also assessed. Stomach contents of 870 individuals were analysed and a total of 24 prey species identified. The shirmp Artemesia longinaris has the highest IRI (89.9%) score followed by Cynoscion guatucupa (IRI = 4.3%). Molluscs were only marginally represented (IRI < 0.01%). Both the graphical method of Cortés and the method of Amundsen indicate the specialization of Brazilian codling to A. longinaris. However, a trend to a generalist diet evolves in bigger fishes, which also consume fishes in important quantities, mainly C. guatucupa. Moreover, opportunism is occasionally present both seasonally and spatially, and responds to variations of the availability of prey items throughout its distribution. U. brasiliensis predation plays an important role in the trophic dynamics of the SW Atlantic ecosystem. It is dependent on shrimp for feeding, a reason for an integrated management of coastal habitat and fisheries of both resources. The dependence of Brazilian codling, mainly when it is small, on shrimp calls for an integrated management of both the coastal habitat and fisheries.","We thank the artisanal fishermen of Piriápolis and La Paloma, especially Alfredo Hargain.

It sets ambitious targets for scientific production (PhD graduates; world share of scientific publications) whose attainment in part rests on the effectiveness of the universities. The paper commences with a thumbnail sketch of the system of innovation. This is followed by a discussion of the international ranking of universities and South Africa's standing. Next we provide a comparative analysis of the domestic ranking of universities. A limited survey of five countries shows that concentration of research in a cluster of universities is ‘normal’. Turning to the South African case we use the national R&D Surveys (HSRC, 2008) to examine the changing diversity among the universities over the merger period. This reveals two concentrations, the first comprising the ‘Big Five’ research institutions and second the ‘Next Six. ’ This implies a double gap in the distribution of universities according to research expenditure and appears to be a feature unique to the South African higher education system. We then unpack the meaning of the targets of the Ten Year Plan and analyze the potential of the universities to meet these in the light of the gaps.

The results indicate that the extrusion of the unfired clayey body was not impaired by the grog addition.

This is associated with the increase in porosity during the firing stage due to the grog behavior.",AcknowledgementsThe authors thank the Brazilian federal agencies CNPq (Process 150444/2003-6) and CAPES for supporting this investigation as well as the Rio de Janeiro state agencies FAPERJ and FENORTE/TECNORTE for providing scientific initiation scholarships and technical grants.,,Construction and Building Materials,,,,2007-08,2007,,2007-08,21,8,1754-1759,Closed,Article,"Vieira, C.M.F.; Monteiro, S.N.","Vieira, C.M.F.

It has also stimulated the proliferation of particularistic media representing their interests. However, little is known about the effects of their cultural values on the treatment of some issues in the public sphere. This article explores the relevance of taboos among African diasporas and their implications for the African press. A questionnaire was created as an instrument of collecting data about taboo subjects and preferred treatment of these subjects in the press. Furthermore, an interview was conducted with the editor of the African Voice to reflect on some of the issues emanating from the data, and a content analysis of selected taboo themes covered by the newspaper was performed.",,,Journal of Black Studies,,,,2007-03-20,2007,2007-03-20,2008-07,38,6,862-882,Closed,Article,"Ogunyemi, Olatunji","Ogunyemi, Olatunji (University of Lincoln, Lincolnshire, United Kingdom)",,"Ogunyemi, Olatunji (University of Lincoln)",7,4,,1.89,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1053999183,44 Human Society; 4410 Sociology,

It is important to notice the impact of climatic conditions on plant and animal performances. The maize treatments (without a companion crop) resulted, on average over years, the highest grazing capacity (30 SSU ha−1 100 days−1). The average highest animal gain was on maize + soybean, with 502.2 kg ha−1, while the grazing capacity was relatively low (24.9 SSU ha−1 100 days−1). The maize and maize + Japanese radish treatments resulted both in an average animal gain of 494.8 kg ha−1. The best ADG for ewes (130.1 g day−1) was measured on maize + Japanese radish in 1997/98 and the highest ADG for lambs (255g day−1) were recorded on maize + Japanese radish in 1996/97.",,,Cereal Research Communications,,,,2007-06,2007,2007-12-31,2007-06,35,2,1269-1272,Closed,Article,"Van Zyl, Erika; Dannhauser, Chris S.; Orosz, Szilvia","Van Zyl, Erika (School of Agriculture & Environmental Science, University of the North, Budapest, Hungary); Dannhauser, Chris S.

This makes the study of the effect of low temperature on bacterial activity important for the design and optimization of the bioleaching process. In this study bacterial activity of iron and sulphur oxidizing microorganisms was analyzed in the laboratory at various temperatures. Flask tests were carried out at a range of temperatures to determine the bacterial activity in pregnant leaching solution (PLS) from a pilot plant at the Escondida Mine. Ratkowsky curves were constructed by monitoring the concentration of ferrous iron and acid production during the tests. Also leaching tests were carried out at ~10 and ~20°C on a 1 m column using a copper ore sample. In an industrial solution in flask tests, iron oxidizing activity was observed until the temperature was reduced to 20°C. In the same culture, after an adaptation process, iron oxidizing activity was observed down to 5°C. In the column tests, 41.2% of copper was recovered after 91 days of leaching at 10 °C and 57.2 % at ~20°C.

The study of biodiversity in those systems has revealed the occurrence of several acidophilic organisms, forming a dynamic community including Bacteria and Archaea. Despite the importance of the heap bioleaching process, the metabolic behaviour of a microbial community in bioleaching systems remains unknown. The role played by members of the community inhabiting a bioheap environment has been estimated by the phenotypic characteristics of pure cultures, such as iron oxidation, sulphur oxidation, resistance to high ion concentration and metal tolerance, among others. The global genomic expression of the community inhabiting an industrial bioheap of low-grade copper sulphide ore at Escondida mine in Chile was investigated by random arbitrary primed polymerase chain reaction (RAP-PCR). Three random primers were used and twenty differentially expressed bands were cloned and sequenced. Several sequences were related to 16S rRNA of members of the microbial community; two sequences were related to the α subunit of pyruvate dehydrogenase from Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans. The expression levels of the pyruvate dehydrogenase gene in samples from an industrial bioleaching operation at different stages were checked by quantitative real-time PCR.",,,Advanced Materials Research,,,,2007-07,2007,2007-07,2007-08-11,20-21,,435-438,Closed,Article,"Galleguillos, Pedro A.; Zepeda, V.; Galleguillos, F.; Castillo, Danny; Guiliani, Nicolas; Remonsellez, Francisco; Ortiz, E.; Demergasso, Cecilia","Galleguillos, Pedro A.

It is known that a consortium of different microorganisms participates in this process. Therefore identification and quantification of communities inhabiting heap bioleaching operations is a key step for understanding the dynamics and role of these microorganisms in the process. A quantitative real-time PCR approach was used to investigate the microbial dynamics in this process. To study the microbial population inhabiting a low-grade copper sulphide ore bioleaching industrial heap process at Escondida Mine in Chile, 16S rRNA genetic libraries were constructed using bacterial and archaeal universal primers. Phylogenetic analyses of sequences retrieved from genetic libraries showed that the community is mainly composed by microoganisms related to Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans (2 strains), Acidithiobacillus thiooxidans, Leptospirillum ferrooxidans, Leptospirillum ferriphilum and the archaea Ferroplasma. Specific primers for real-time PCR determination were designed and tested to amplify each of the sequences obtained by cloning. Standard curves for real time PCR were performed using plasmid DNA from selected clones. This methodology is actually being used to monitor relevant microorganisms inhabiting this low-grade copper sulphide ore bioleaching industrial heap.",,,Advanced Materials Research,,,,2007-07,2007,2007-07,2007-08-11,20-21,,539-542,Closed,Article,"Remonsellez, Francisco; Galleguillos, F.; van Rensburg, Sonestie Janse; Rautenbach, G.F.; Galleguillos, Pedro A.; Castillo, Danny; Demergasso, Cecilia","Remonsellez, Francisco (Universidad Católica del Norte, Centro de Biotecnología, Antofagasta, Chile, Avda.

Psychologist/activist Forrest Tyler emphasizes individuals’ collective responsibilities—to themselves, each other, and society—and describes a coordinated balance of discrete social changes brought about by civic action, policy changes initiated by officials, and collaboration between professionals and the community. Instructive examples from locales as varied as Colombia, Jordan, and the United States offer models from which readers can form unique, innovative solutions. And the author’s multicultural/ multiethnic approach clearly maps out the road from theoretical concepts to real-world action: Defining the prosocial community—core characteristics and elemental relationships. Observing communities: assessing their potential for intervention, determining change objectives. Thinking beyond traditional psychological/mental health approaches to community change. Prosocial effects of community projects involving multiple levels of action. Questscope: an extended example of community change in the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan Tyler’s decades of experience, and the lucid perspective of Developing Prosocial Communities across Cultures, brings social and community psychologists new assurance that social programs can have greater relevance to the people and groups they serve.",,,,,,,2007,2007,,2007,,,,Closed,Monograph,"Tyler, Forrest B.","Tyler, Forrest B.

In this paper, we challenge the view that corpus planning should precede acquisition planning and show how terminology can be developed for discipline-specific purposes through pedagogic processes. We believe that African languages in their current state can be used as media of instruction if the focus is on getting learners to engage with cognitively-challenging tasks for grasping new concepts. The absence of specialist terms can be compensated for by the efforts of teachers and learners to create terminology by using the well-documented practices of translators, such as transference, transliteration and omission. We provide several examples from the domains of materials development, classroom interaction and assessment to uphold our view that acquisition planning can drive corpus planning. The examples are all from the Sesotho sa Leboa strand of the dual-medium degree and show how teachers and learners cope with terminology for academic purposes. Such a pedagogically-responsive and discourse-embedded use of terminology locates the site of resource building for African languages within the pedagogic use of these languages as media of instruction.",,,Southern African Linguistics and Applied Language Studies,,,,2007-06,2007,,2007-06,25,2,207-223,Closed,Article,"Ramani, Esther; Kekana, Tebogo; Modiba, Mamphago; Joseph, Michael","Ramani, Esther (); Kekana, Tebogo (); Modiba, Mamphago (); Joseph, Michael ()",,"Ramani, Esther (); Kekana, Tebogo (); Modiba, Mamphago (); Joseph, Michael ()",36,5,,17.24,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1070957802,"47 Language, Communication and Culture; 4703 Language Studies; 4704 Linguistics",

It turns out that the chemical potential stabilizes the behavior of the Skyrmion discussed previously in the literature. This analysis is carried on in the framework of a variational approach using different ansatze for the radial profile of the Skyrmion. We found a divergent behavior for the size of the Skyrmion, associated to a certain critical value μ

Specimens were then obtained from this porcelain mixture by uniaxially pressing samples until a dry density of 2.0 g/cm3 was achieved. These specimens were then fired at 1180°C in a laboratory furnace. Physical and mechanical properties related to linear shrinkage, water absorption and flexural rupture strength, determined by Weibull statistical method, were evaluated. Microstructural analysis for the experimental body was performed by scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction and mercury porosimetry. The technological properties of the elaborated composition satisfied the porcelain tile standard specifications. The microstructural analysis displayed small pores as well as a glassy matrix.

We analyze the conductance spectrum as a function of the frequency and strength of the field. We found that above a critical value of the field intensity, an enhancement of the conductance, or suppressed resistance, as a function of the field strength occurs. The conductance increases displaying oscillations which amplitude shows a strong dependence on the field frequency. For low radiation energies in comparison with the lead–carbon-nanotube coupling energies, the oscillations evolve toward a structure of well defined steps in the conductance. We have shown that in this range of frequencies, the field intensity dependence of the conductance can give direct information of single-walled carbon nanotube energy spectra.",P.A.O. and M.P. would like to thank Millenium ICM P02-054-F and FONDECYT under Grants No. 1060952 and No. 1050521 for financial support.,,Physical Review B,,,,2007-03-15,2007,2007-03-29,2007-03-15,75,11,115427,All OA; Green,Article,"Orellana, P.

Phycologia 46: 467–470. DOI: 10.2216/06-56.1 This study examined the recovery capacity of early life stages of the South Pacific kelps Lessonia nigrescens and Lessonia trabeculata after exposure to artificial ultraviolet radiation (UV-B280–315 nm, UV-A315–400 nm). Spores (3 h postrelease) were exposed to different UV doses applied as daily pulses (0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4 h) during 6 days. Afterwards cultures were kept under PAR condition and fertility of gametophytes and formation of sporophytes measured up to day 45 (for L. nigrescens) and 65 (for L. trabeculata). The irradiation with UV-B radiation for 6 days strongly impaired spore germination: at biologically effective UV doses (BEDCaldwell > 2 kJ m−2; pulses > 2 h per day), complete mortality of the spores was observed. In contrast, spores irradiated with UV-A retained a germination capacity close to 80 and 70% under high doses (75 kJ m−2; 4 h per day). The surviving spores from both treatments exhibited a recovery during their further development as the fertility of gametophytes and formation of sporophytes increased with age of culture. In the intertidal L. nigrescens, fertility of gametophytes from spores irradiated with UV-B during 0.5 and 1 h per day was between 70 and 100% after 45 days. Treatments with UV-A did not affect markedly the fertility and production of sporophytes, as values were always between 80 and 100% after 45 days. In the subtidal L. trabeculata, recovery of cultures irradiated with UV-B and UV-A were lower, in particular the formation of sporophytes, as compared to L. nigrescens. Two major findings are outlined: (1) exposure of spores to UV-B radiation affects the further development of the life cycle, and (2) the surviving spores retained their viability and were able to complete the life history.",The research was supported by grants from the Universidad Católica del Norte (DGICT-2003/2004 to F.T. and M.E.) and CONICYT (FONDECYT No 1030343 to I.G.).

While these studies have helped researchers understand the dynamics and importance of such changes, they have less often taken a deeper historical approach in combination with their traditional strengths of geographic information analysis. In this study, we explore historical land use changes in one of South Africa's former bantustans, Lebowa, from 1963 to 2001. We argue that changes in land use arise from both current socioeconomic dynamics but also from historical precedent established by the apartheid regime. Our methods couple historical aerial photography to recent household surveys to elucidate the national, regional and local influences over land use change. We conducted extensive field research in the study site between 2003 and 2006. Our findings show a high degree of urbanization, a loss of grassland and agricultural land and a dramatic pattern of increasing spatial concentration near growth points.

The present study attempted to replicate the Burkholder et al. study using African American and South African college students, but the findings were inconsistent with the aforementioned study. AA respondents had higher social stigma of PWA and gays and higher condom self‐efficacy.

A bio-technological simulation model was used that describes the physical and biological performance variables for the fishery. An economic submodel was incorporated to the original model in order to perform an integrated analysis of the crustacean fishery, including the catch and processing sub-sectors. The economic results, in conjunction with the data on catch and stock size, explained this fishery's dynamic off northern-central Chile during the study period. The total catch increased 21% between 1997 and 2000 and the final production increased 24%, but the quasi rent of the variable costs increased only 11%. The same period saw costs associated with fishing trips increase 117% and the total production cost increased 93%. The study results showed that part of the profits were lost due to the decreased biomass of both resources and the excessive increase in the average production costs, which were explained by the increased fishing trip costs. In order to obtain a better representation of the fishery's performance, economic references points should be incorporated to complement the traditional biological (biomass) and fishery (CPUE, catches) proxies Se analiz el efecto econmico debido a la disminucin de la captura por unidad de esfuerzo (CPUE) en la pesquera de camarn nailon y langostino amarillo en la zona norte y central de Chile durante el periodo 1997-2000.

The predisposing conditions are neuropathy, ischemia and infections. Aim: To report the incidence of healing, relapse, amputation and mortality of diabetic foot in a period of eight years. Material and methods: A cohort of 134 patients hospitalized in a Surgical Service with the diagnosis of diabetic foot was studied; however in 13 patients, the clinical history was not available. Therefore the series included 81 males aged 68 + 11 years and 40 females aged 72 + 11 years. Results: Diabetic foot was predominantly neuropathic in 52 patients (43%), predominantly ischemic in 44 (36%) and mixed in 25 (21%). An associated infection was found in 78 patients (65%). The mean ulcer duration was 11 weeks. The rate of healing was 31% and the mean healing lapse was 6.2 weeks. The rate of relapse in the first year was 52%. The mean relapse time was 5.1 months. The amputation rate was 96% one year after diagnosis and 98%, three years after diagnosis. Minor and major amputation rates were 55 and 24%, respectively. The mean lapse between treatment onset and amputation was 11 weeks. Rescue surgical procedures did not modify the evolution of diabetic foot. Four percent of patients died.

The first of them assumes that the initial state of the system is unknown, and the evolution is attained only with the help of two non-commuting observables. For this method, the overall success probability is maximized when the eigentstates of the involved observables constitute mutually unbiased bases. The second method assumes the initial state is known and it uses N observables which are consecutively measured to make the state of the system approach the target state. The probability of success of this procedure converges to 1 as the number of observables increases.",,,Journal of Physics Conference Series,,,,2007-10-01,2007,2007-10-12,2007-10-01,84,1,012017,All OA; Gold,Article,"Roa, L; de Guevara, M L Ladrón; Delgado, A; Olivares-Rentería, G; Klimov, A B","Roa, L (Center for Quantum Optics and Quantum Information, Departamento de Física, Universidad de Concepción, Casilla 160-C, Concepción, Chile); de Guevara, M L Ladrón (Departamento de Física, Universidad Católica del Norte, Casilla 1280, Antofagasta, Chile); Delgado, A (Center for Quantum Optics and Quantum Information, Departamento de Física, Universidad de Concepción, Casilla 160-C, Concepción, Chile); Olivares-Rentería, G (Center for Quantum Optics and Quantum Information, Departamento de Física, Universidad de Concepción, Casilla 160-C, Concepción, Chile); Klimov, A B (Departamento de Física, Universidad de Guadalajara, Revolución 1500, 44420 Guadalajara, Jalisco, Mexico)",,"Roa, L (University of Concepción); de Guevara, M L Ladrón (Catholic University of the North); Delgado, A (University of Concepción); Olivares-Rentería, G (University of Concepción); Klimov, A B (University of Guadalajara)",9,2,,2.27,https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1742-6596/84/1/012017/pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1053503795,51 Physical Sciences; 5108 Quantum Physics,

Objectives: The aims of this study was to determine the level of physical activity (LPA) of diabetes patients of the Diabetes clinic of the Pretoria Academic Hospital (DCPAH), to compare the LPA between male and female diabetes patients and to explore the reasons for possible differences. Design: A descriptive and comparative quantitative study. Setting: Diabetes Clinic of the Pretoria Academic Hospital. Subjects: The convenience sample consisted of 65 subjects (29 males and 36 females) between the ages of 18 and 83 years Results: The average physical activity of male subjects was 5164.05 METs compared to 4843.83 METs in female subjects. A p-value of 0.3660 was calculated. Of the subjects, 46,15% achieved a high LPA, 27,69% achieved a moderateLPA and 26.15% achieved a low LPA according to the IPAQ scoring system. The seven main barriers found was health, diabetes, time, laziness, socio-economic circumstances, perceptual adequate exercise and other. Conclusion: The overall LPA of diabetes patients is high according to the IPAQ Categorical scoring. The difference between LPA of males and females is not significant as indicated by the p-value (p>0.05). It was however found that males have higher levels of work related activities than females and that females have higher home and garden related activities than males. The two most frequently mentioned barriers for male and female subjects were time and health related conditions.",,,South African Journal of Physiotherapy,,,,2007-02-18,2007,2007-02-18,,63,3,2-6,All OA; Gold,Article,"Nel, C.; van Rooijen, A.

This task can be achieved by means of a discrete sequence of von Neumann measurements only, introducing N observables which are consecutively measured in order to make the state of the system approach the target state. We show that the probability of projecting onto the target state can be increased meaningfully by adding suitable observables to the process, that is, it converges to 1 when N increases. These observables depend on the initial state and on the target state. We compare this scheme with one for which the initial state is not known [see L. Roa , Phys. Rev. A 73, 012322 (2006)]. This comparison shows that the knowledge of the initial density operator does not always increase the probability of success.","One of the authors (G. A.

Eighty largemouth yellowfish Labeobarbus kimberleyensis were collected in the Vaal Dam (26°52.249′S, 28°10.249′E) with the aid of gill nets during a study between April 2005 and February 2006. The fish were killed and the weight and length determined. Thereafter the intestines were removed, the length determined and the intestines opened to expose the tapeworms. The distance between the beginning of the intestine and the attachment position of the first tapeworm was measured, and thereafter all the worms were collected. The prevalence, abundance and mean intensity was calculated for all the surveys. Seasonality and intensity of tapeworms were compared to the intestine and total lengths of the fish. All the tapeworms were identified as the Asian Tapeworm Bothriocephalus acheilognathi Yamaguti, 1934. The position of the first tapeworm was located between 10% and 20% from the anterior end of the intestine in close proximity to the bile opening. A total of 100% prevalence was recorded for all the surveys and the highest mean intensity of 231.1 was recorded during the autumn survey. The lowest mean intensity of 73.7 was recorded during the summer survey. Although the infection rates were very high, the fish condition was good and apparently the fecundity of the fish was not negatively affected as young fish fry was collected during the summer survey. Parasite numbers are higher and differ from a study conducted in 2000 and this is attributed to water temperature and water quality. No correlation was observed between parasite intensity and total length of each fish. This indicates that intensity is not dependant on host size and that infection is not the result of a buildt of over years.",AcknowledgementsWe thank the Rand Water Board for providing us with the Vaal Dam water data.

Against the backdrop of these societal changes, the objectives of this cross-sectional study were to trace continuity and change in reproductive attitudes on an individual level, through three generations of women linked to each other by kin in the Limpopo Province, South Africa. This study is defined within the psychological theoretical framework called Values of Children, and the specific aims for this study were to explore the three generations of women's preferred timing of their first childbirth, their desired number of children and sex of the offspring, and the women's deeper motivations behind the wish for children. Participants ( n = 516) were chosen using a multi-stage cluster sampling procedure, and face-to-face structured interviews were conducted. Factor analysis indicated that the women have two main motivations to have children, namely Social/Emotional values of children and Traditional/ Utilitarian values of children. However, the motivations to bear children seemed to be less emphasised by the teenage women as compared to their mothers and maternal grandmothers. Likewise, the data revealed a change in reproductive attitudes in that teenage women wished to have fewer children later in their lives than the older generations. Stronger daughter preferences than son preferences were presented in one-child scenarios in all generations, yet the strongest emphasis on a daughter was found in the young generation. In the light of the huge social changes in the country, such as the explosion of HIV infections and the abolishment of the apartheid regime including its racial family planning programmes, we expected more dramatic changes in reproductive attitudes in three generations of women than those which we found.",,,South African Journal of Psychology,,,,2007-11,2007,2016-08-02,2007-11,37,4,856-877,Closed,Article,"Spjeldnaes, Ingrid O.; Sam, David L.; Moland, Karen Marie; Peltzer, Karl","Spjeldnaes, Ingrid O.

The study clearly showed that national parks are important destinations for an African wildlife experience, along with other natural attractions that they have to offer. It also highlighted the scope for further visitor education, specifically aimed at improving the quality of their visits to the park. The relationship between elephant (Loxodonta africana) density and level of viewing success by visitors requires further investigation. Since the reintroduction of large predators, especially lion (Panthera leo), in the early 2000s, the daytime sighting rate of buffalo (Syncerus caffer) by visitors has increased markedly. Ongoing surveys, to monitor and expand on some of the aspects addressed in this study, are considered necessary in order to assist park staff to achieve conservation and management goals.","Our grateful thanks go to Lucius Moolman, former manager of the Addo Elephant National Park, for his support for the survey and to the AENP management staff who assisted in distributing blank questionnaires, and receiving completed ones.

In general, this kelp is reported to be reproductive all year round. Annual populations present in wave-protected areas of southern Chile suggest that the reproductive strategies of this population can be different. In this study we explore the reproductive strategies of annual M. pyrifera present in wave-protected areas and perennial populations encountered in exposed areas of southern Chile (41°S). Our results showthat M. pyrifera present in wave-exposed locations has a reproductive strategy that is similar to populations in the northern hemisphere. These populations reproduce all year round and their strategy is to produce high numbers of sporophylls and ensure that most of them (over 90%) become sporogenous. On the other hand, the protected populations with an annual life cycle, produce more spores per area of sorus. In a few months, they are able to produce sufficient propagules to recolonize areas before the adult plants disappear in autumn.",,,Developments in Applied Phycology,Eighteenth International Seaweed Symposium,"Robert Anderson, Juliet Brodie, Edvar Onsøyen, Alan T.

The colormass trend is often converted to a metallicity‐mass trend under the assumption that age effects are small or negligible. While direct estimates of the ages of MRGC populations neither can rule out nor reliably support the populations' age trend, key data on timing of the formation of spheroids and other indirect evidence imply it in the sense: the more massive spheroid the older on average its MRGC population. We show that the contribution of an allowable age trend of the MRGC populations to their peak color trend can achieve up to ∼50% or so. In this event the comparable value of the color trend, ∼30%, is due to alpha‐element ratio systematic variations of the order of Δ[ α /Fe] ≈ 0.1 to 0.2 dex because of a correlation between the [ α /Fe] ratios and age. Hence a systematic variation of exactly [Fe/H] ratios may turn out to be less significant among the contributors, and its range many times lower, i.e. of the order of Δ[Fe/H]∼0.1 or even none, than the corresponding range deduced by assuming no age trend.

Lithium (7Li) lineshapes and spin–lattice relaxation times were measured as a function of temperature. The results suggest that the chemical functionality of QO, particularly the amine group, participate in coordinating lithium ion in the composites. The competition between QO and PEO for lithium ions is evident in the binary system. In the ternary electrolyte containing PEO, QO and pAPS, it is observed that the lithium ions can competively interact with the two polymers. The heterogeneity, at a local microscopic scale, is revealed by a temperature-dependent equilibrium of lithium ion concentration between at least two different microphases; one dominated by the interactions with chitosan and the other one with polyether. The data of the ternary electrolyte was analysed by assuming two lithium dynamics, the first one associated to the motion of the lithium ion dissolved in PEO and the second one associated to those complexed by the chitosan.","AcknowledgmentsThe authors are grateful to Dr. O.R.

Digital images of the rock shrimp Rhynchocinetes typus were digitally processed in order to obtain their diffraction pattern by means of Fast Fourier Transformation (FFT). All diffraction patterns were correlated with a phase-only filter using images of rock shrimp before and after one molt. To determine the degree of similarity of color patterns among rock shrimps, correlation of diffraction pattern was performed. This approach showed that among shrimps the color pattern of the cephalothorax is mainly homogenous $(\sim 83\% )$ in both distribution and intensity. However, the observed degree of variability $(\sim 17\% )$ was sufficient to distinguish between individuals. Furthermore the general color pattern of each individual persisted after one molt and all 14 individuals could be recognized based on their color pattern. It is concluded that this non-intrusive method for distinguishing among shrimp individuals may be a useful tool that could be developed and used in the future instead of expensive and intrusive tagging techniques.","We are grateful to I.

Field and laboratory evidence suggested that the postlarval juveniles crawled away from incubational substrates and assumed a drifting existence in the water column, as demonstrated by their recruitmernt on experimentally placed off-bottom fouling plates between May and December 1989 at Herradura Bay, Coquimbo, northern Chile. Further observations were made on recruitment of this species into mesh-bag scallop spat collectors 1.5 km away from the inshore brooding areas. Planktonic dispersal was observed for individuals of this calyptraeid primarily in the 1–3 mm size range. Most specimens were caught on collectors suspended 2 m above the bottom, and the recruitment was continuous throughout the study period, with a significant peak between September and October. Long distance dispersal of the juvenile calyptraeids was inferred from their appearance in the deep, off-shore scallop spat collectors, where 2200 individuals were counted, with greater abundance in shallow than in near-bottom collectors. The mechanisms promoting dispersal of this species included seasonal water movement which swept newly hatched juveniles into the water column, morphological attributes of the snails which enhanced their capacity for drifting and, particularly, the presence of a gas-bubble retained between the juvenile mantle cavity and the anterior end of the foot which produced buoyancy. The drifting habit of this species is a remarkable feature when compared with life cycles of other gastropod species having direct development, since postlarval juveniles typically recruit to the benthos near their sites of incubation. These findings were interesting from the standpoint of fisheries management, as T. calyptraeaformis is a commercially exploited species undergoing significant harvesting pressure.","AcknowledgementsThe authors thank to: Departamento de Acuacultura, Universidad Católica del Norte for facilities provided to carry out the project funding this study, to CORFO and Regional Corporation for Development, Chile (CIDERE IV Región), for financial support and sponsorship, respectively, to Dr. Louis H.

There is a class of differential models that is the diffusive-reaction type models that have a very large number of applications in different chemical engineering problems. These include transport and reaction in catalytic processes, heat and mass transfer in more than one phase, and electrostatic potentials in many current electrokinetic processes, just to name a few. Solutions to these models are either by linear approximations of the non-linear source, by other approximations of such non-linearity, or by numerical methods that frequently are heavily dependent of the mesh size for a successful convergence. In this contribution, an analytical–logarithmic approach is introduced and applied to unbounded domains of a rectangular, cylindrical, and spherical geometry for the case of electrostatic potential around a particle or an electrode in a given solution. Due to the lack of general methods to derive analytical solutions for differential models with non-linear sources, this study has focused on developing an efficient and economical procedure to obtain a formal analytical solution for such models that is used in a simple predictor–corrector approach to predict the correct solution. The proposed method involves the use of a recursive function, fAO, of the non-linear dependable variable that work as a corrector function. The procedure converts the non-linear ordinary differential equation in a simpler pseudo-linear ordinary differential equation whose analytical solution is later modified by means of the fAO correction function to obtain the correct solution. The start of the algorithmic approach uses the case of fAO=1, that is the “true” solution to the linear approximation. Afterwards, the correction function is updated until convergence to the solution of the original non-linear equation is achieved.","AcknowledgementsThe support provided by Universidad Católica de Norte, Chile, and the Fulbright Commission to the doctoral work of Mario A.

This study was undertaken to obtain information on the occurrence of florfenicol-resistant bacteria in a farm (LF1) under florfenicol therapy two weeks before sampling date, located in the Rupanco Lake, and a farm (LF2) with no recent history of antibacterial therapy, located in the Llanquihue Lake. Samples from surface water, pellet, Salmo salar fingerlings and control and under-cage sediments were collected from each salmon farm. Total and florfenicol-resistant culturable counts were determined by a spread plate method, observing low (<9%) proportions of florfenicol resistance in water and fingerling samples, whereas sediment samples from LF1 farm showed proportions ranging from 18.55±2.85% (control) to 26.40±1.56% (under-cage) and were significantly higher (P<0.05) than those from LF2 farm, with 0.29±0.30% (control) and 0.69±1.00% (under-cage) values, not observing a direct correlation with sediment organic enrichment. Also, unmedicated pelletized feed from LF1 farm showed high levels of resistance (34.79±11.87%), and were significantly (P<0.05) higher than those from LF2 farm (<0.001%). A number of 34 and 36 representative isolates recovered from LF1 and LF2 farms respectively, were selected and identified by using the Biolog Microbial ID System, observing that mainly belonged to Pseudomonas genus (67.65 and 66.67% in LF1 and LF2 farms) and the predominant species were P. putida and P. viridilivida (14.71%) in LF1 farm, and P. fluorescens (36.11%) in LF2 farm. Antibacterial susceptibility patterns of resistant strains from both Lakes were similar, showing important proportions of isolates resistance to ampicillin, erythromycin, furazolidone and cotrimoxazole and susceptibility to gentamicin, kanamycin and enrofloxacin. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of florfenicol against these selected bacteria were determined, observing MIC ranges of 256–>1024 and 64–>1024 μg ml−1 for strains recovered from LF1 and LF2 farms, respectively. The important occurrence of florfenicol-resistant and antibacterial-multiresistant microorganisms in unpolluted and farm-impacted sites in Rupanco Lake suggests that use of florfenicol is not a necessary causal condition for the development of elevated frequencies of florfenicol resistance. Otherwise, considering that intrinsic resistance to many antibacterials has been extensively reported for Pseudomonas species, observed levels of resistance to florfenicol could be overestimated by the occurrence of innately resistant bacteria with multiple non-specific resistances. Our results prompt the necessity for maintaining a continuous surveillance of florfenicol resistance in salmon farms, as well as to characterize the molecular elements involved in these resistances to evaluate the feasibility of their dissemination among environmental microbiota.",AcknowledgementsThis study was supported by the Science and Technology National Council (CONICYT) of Chile by the Project Grant No. 1040924.

Aims.We search for luminous narrow-line type 2 AGN, characterise their properties, and compare them with broad-line type 1 AGN. Methods.Combining the ISOCAM parallel survey at 6.7 μm with 2MASS, we have selected AGN via near-mid-infrared colours caused by the hot nuclear dust emission. We performed spectroscopy in the optical and, for a subset of the sample, also in the mid-infrared with Spitzer. Results.We find nine type 2 AGN at redshift , three of them have even quasar-like [] luminosities. At the given redshift and luminosity range the number of type 2 AGN is at least as high as that of type 1s. At we did not find type 2 AGN, probably because the hottest dust emission, still covered by the NIR filters, is obscured. The optical spectra of the type 2 host galaxies show young and old stellar populations. Only one object is an ultraluminous infrared galaxy with starburst. The 5–38 μm spectra of the two type 2 sources observed show a strong continuum with PAH emission in one case and silicate absorption in the other case. Conclusions. The near-mid-infrared selection is a successful strategy to find luminous type 2 AGN at low z. The objects exhibit a large range of properties so that it is difficult to infer details by means of popular SED fitting with simple average templates.",,,Astronomy & Astrophysics,,,,2007-01-11,2007,2007-01-11,2007-03,464,3,895-901,All OA; Bronze,Article,"Leipski, C.; Haas, M.; Meusinger, H.; Siebenmorgen, R.; Chini, R.; Drass, H.; Albrecht, M.; Wilkes, B.

This is done against the background of a new trend in South African fiction where previously disadvantaged and silenced groups, especially women, have begun to articulate their problems and to assert themselves.This new trend may perhaps be an outcome of the influence of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, where victims of discrimination could reveal their innermost feelings. Mda increasingly empowers his female characters to reveal themselves and their plight. This article investigates the role of the present-day female characters in Mda's third novel, The heart of redness (2000).

                  Villablanca, R., Luna-Jorquera, G., Marín, V. H., Garthe, S., and Simeone, A. 2007. How does a generalist seabird species use its marine habitat? The case of the kelp gull in a coastal upwelling area of the Humboldt Current. – ICES Journal of Marine Science, 64: 1348–1355. The distribution of kelp gulls (Larus dominicanus) was studied by ship-based transect counts in the SE Pacific Ocean off Chile, South America. Some 96–98% of the kelp gulls were in a band less than 20 km from the coast, mainly near the breeding colony on Pájaros Island and the City of Coquimbo. Abundance did not change significantly among years, but was influenced significantly by distance to land. Principal component analysis yielded two components that jointly explain 53% of the standardized variance. The first (explaining 36% of the variance) includes distance to the nearest coast and water depth, the second (17%) associates with the presence of fishing vessels. The results suggest that the stability of the summer distribution of kelp gulls is generated by the large and semi-permanent offer of food at fish markets and city sewage works, as well as the location of the breeding colonies. Further analysis on other temporal scales (seasonal, decadal) associated with reproductive or non-reproductive changes within the population and/or ENSO cycles will be necessary to confirm the multiscale stability of the pattern described.","This study was partly funded by projects from the Volkswagen–Stiftung (Az.

En esta contribucion se presenta un analisis sedimentologico y paleontologico de la recientemente reconocida Formacion Quebrada Grande, una secuencia marina de ca. 1.600 m de espesor, que cubre, mediante discordancia angular, al CISL, y en la cual es posible definir tres asociaciones de facies que, en orden estratigrafico, son: 1) conglomerados matriz soportados, 2) intercalaciones de areniscas con lutitas y 3) conglomerados clastosoportados. La fraccion detritica deriva principalmente de la erosion del arco volcanico representado por el CISL ( Cambrico-Ordovicico inferior?), ademas de rocas plutonicas que formaron la raiz del arco, y de rocas metamorficas provenientes de su basamento continental. La facies (1), que constituye la parte inferior de la formacion, se interpreta como el producto de flujos de detritos en posicion proximal de un 'fan delta' marino. Las areniscas y lutitas (2), de la parte media de la formacion, representan un ambiente de plataforma marina abierta. Los conglomerados clasto-soportados (3) corresponderian a flujos de alta energia que alcanzaron las partes mas distales del delta. La edad de la Formacion Quebrada Grande se puede precisar por la presencia de braquiopodos (Paralenorthis sp., Monorthis transversa Benedetto y Mollesella? sp.) en la base y de graptolitos (Tetragraptus sp. y Cryptograptus? sp.) en el medio de la sucesion, que indican el lapso Arenigiano-Llanvirniano inferior (Darriwiliano). La asociacion de braquiopodos del Cordon de Lila presenta afinidades con las faunas de la cuenca de Famatina del oeste de Argentina. La ausencia de taxones comunes entre el AMO y la 'Faja Eruptiva de la Puna Occidental' (FEPO) del noroeste de Argentina podria deberse a algun tipo de barrera ambiental o a una separacion geografica respecto del margen de Gondwana.

Agardh) Greville (Gigartinales, Rhodophyta) in controlled environments","Increased market demand for algal raw materials has stimulated research and development into new cultivation technologies, particularly in countries with economically important seaweed industries. Chondrus canaliculatus is a red alga endemic to the temperate Pacific coast of South America and produces a complex carrageenan. In Chile, this potential marine resource has been underutilized since the early 1990s, after it was replaced mainly by imports of Kappaphycus and Eucheum from Asia. The study of the cultivation of C. canaliculatus in outdoor tanks demonstrates the potential to produce large quantities of algal material due to the high productivity observed. The material produced may be important in Chile as feed for cultured algal herbivores such as Haliotis spp. Data were obtained on the key factors affecting the growth of this alga, including light, temperature, and nutrient concentrations. The results showed that, on a dry weight basis, productivity varied seasonally between 40 g m−3 wk−1 in autumn and 200 g m−3 wk−1 in spring, and the optimal stocking density in our experiments was 8 kg m−3. Effects of self-shading were among the most important limiting factors in the culture. Discussion is presented on the interactions between temperature, pH, salinity, enrichment with N and P, and water exchange on the maximal growth of C. canaliculatus in this culture.","This study was made possible by support from Multiexport Algas SA (Chile).

Several authors indicate that the application of β-glucans and mannan-oligosaccharides (βG MOS) in rearing water should improve the larval health, diminishing the effects of physiological stress and physical damage that the aquaculture activities cause to the individuals. In order to evaluate the effect of βG MOS on P. adspersus incorporation on P. adspersus larval survival and growth in intensive culture, experiments were carried out with six-days post-hatch larvae, which had only just begun to feed on live prey (rotifers), and fifteen-day post-hatch larvae. Three treatments were used, applying 5 mg.L-1, 10 mg.L-1, and 15 mg.L-1 of βG MOS to the rearing water during the first five days of the experiment and then comparing the results with a control. The results indicate that applications of 5 mg.L-1 of βG MOS in the rearing water enhance larval survival and growth with respect to the control, whereas additions of 15 mg.L-1 of βG MOS suppressed both of these parameters. This effect increases for larvae that have recently absorbed the yolk sac. An histological analysis of the intestinal epithelium of the larvae suggests that βG MOS promotes the expression of monocytes (forerunner cells of macrophages) associated with the non-specific immune system of the fish Para el xito del cultivo del lenguado Paralichthys adspersus es importante optimizar el crecimiento y la supervivencia en los primeros estadios de desarrollo larval. Diversos autores sealan que la aplicacin de B-glucanos y manano-oligosacridos (βG MOS) en el agua de cultivo debera mejorar la salud de las larvas, disminuyendo los efectos del estrs fisiolgico y el dao fsico de los individuos causado por las actividades propias de la acuicultura. Con el objetivo de evaluar el efecto de la incorporacin del βG MOS en la supervivencia y el crecimiento de larvas de P. adspersus en cultivos intensivos, se realizaron experimentos utilizando larvas de seis das post-eclosin que recin han comenzado la alimentacin con presas vivas (rotferos) y larvas de quince das post-eclosin. Tres tratamientos aplicando 5 mg.L-1, 10 mg.L-1 y 15 mg.L-1 de βG MOS al agua de cultivo fueron contrastados durante los primeros cinco das de experimentacin con una condicin control. Los resultados indican que aplicar 5 mg.L-1 de βG MOS en el agua de cultivo aumenta la supervivencia y el crecimiento de las larvas con respecto al control, mientras que 15 mg.L-1 de βG MOS tiene un efecto supresor en ambos parmetros poblacionales. Este efecto aumenta si se aplica en larvas que recin han absorbido el saco vitelino.

The analyses acknowledge the importance of quantifying the probability of failure or success when making investment decisions. Risk is incorporated into a standard net present value analysis using risk simulation. De-trended historical auction prices of live game and on-the-hoof prices of weaner cattle were used to quantify price variability. The stochastic net present value analyses indicate that game ranching is more profitable than cattle farming. Although an investment in a limited number of common game species is financially feasible, the cash flow analysis indicates a decreasing probability of making more money with game when annual cash flows are compared to those generated by means of cattle farming. Both the high-value game species scenarios are financially unfeasible during the first five years. These infeasibilities stem from a high probability of not covering instalments to finance game purchases, the extent to which these instalments are not covered, and the high probability of shortfalls in consecutive years.",,,Agrekon,,,,2007-12,2007,,2007-12,46,4,514-531,All OA; Green,Article,"Grové, B; Taljaard, P R; Cloete, P C","Grové, B (Department of Agricultural Economics, University of the Free State, PO Box 339, Bloemfontein, 9300, South Africa, E-mail:, groveb.sci@ufs.ac.za); Taljaard, P R (Unit for Livestock and Wildlife Economics, Department of Agricultural Economics, University of the Free State, PO Box 339, Bloemfontein, 9300, South Africa, E-mail:, pieter-sci@ufs.ac.za, cloetepc.sci@ufs.ac.za); Cloete, P C (Unit for Livestock and Wildlife Economics, Department of Agricultural Economics, University of the Free State, PO Box 339, Bloemfontein, 9300, South Africa, E-mail:, pieter-sci@ufs.ac.za, cloetepc.sci@ufs.ac.za)",,"Grové, B (University of the Free State); Taljaard, P R (University of the Free State); Cloete, P C (University of the Free State)",2,0,,0.67,http://ageconsearch.umn.edu/bitstream/7048/2/46040514.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1018951064,38 Economics; 3801 Applied Economics,

The treatment extended from 1 to 6 days leading to belt-like and wire-like structures of a metastable phase of sodium titanate, with typical widths and diameters between 8 and 40nm, and lengths from 100nm to several micrometers. These conclusions are supported by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy and high resolution transmission electron microscopy. The latter method revealed two set of space fringes with characteristic distances of 0.29 and 0.34nm. These distances could correspond to the lattice spacing of [-311] and [-111] planes in Na2Ti6O13 compounds. The nanomaterial was found to be stable up to temperatures as high as 200 or 400∘C depending on the reaction time and the concentration.","AcknowledgmentsThis work was partially supported by the DGIP of the Universidad Católica del Norte.

Diving observations showed that the degree to which the sea urchin Strongylocentrotus droebachiensis covers itself in the field decreases with size. We performed laboratory experiments to examine how the sea urchin's covering behaviour is affected by the presence of predators, sea urchin size, wave surge, contact with moving algae blades and sunlight. The presence of two common sea urchin predators did not influence the degree to which sea urchins covered themselves. Covering responses of sea urchins that were exposed to a strong wave surge and sweeping algal blades were significantly greater than those of individuals that were maintained under still water conditions. The degree to which sea urchins covered themselves in the laboratory also tended to decrease with increasing size. Juveniles showed stronger covering responses than adults, possibly because they are more vulnerable to dislodgement and predation. We found that UV light stimulated a covering response, whereas UV-filtered sunlight and darkness did not, although the response to UV light was much weaker than that to waves and algal movement. Our observations suggest that the covering behaviour of S. droebachiensis has evolved as an adaptation to protect it from mechanical injuries associated with abrasion and dislodgement, and to a lesser extent as a defence against UV radiation. The covering behaviour may reduce the sea urchin's ability to move and this would limit its ability to forage and to flee from predators. In this case, the covering behaviour may have evolved as a trade-off between locomotion and limiting environmental stresses.","AcknowledgmentsWe are grateful to C. Vallières, P. Grondin, S.-P.

Data were gathered for fish between 0.17 and 108g wet mass. Three commercial diets were used in this study: Nippai “Ambrose 600”® for fish from 0.17 to 0.7g; BioKyowa 1000® for fish from 1.5 to 3.0g; BioKyowa 2000® for fish from 6 to 40g; EWOS 2® for fish from 10 to 20g; and EWOS 3® for fish from 35 to 110g. A top-loading settling column was used to characterize the settling properties of the solids. Settling velocities were found to vary among feeds used regardless of fish size. Average settling velocities were 1.7cm/s for Nippai™ 600, 2.2cm/s for BioKyowa™ 1000, 4.4cm/s for BioKyowa™ 2000, 1.7cm/s for EWOS™ 2, and 2.0cm/s for EWOS 3. The measurements indicate that solids produced by feeding fish with BioKyowa™ pellets had the fastest settling velocity among the diets tested. The settling velocity curves obtained in this research contain valuable information that can be used to select appropriate devices for the removal of solids.","AcknowledgementsThe fish used in this work were supplied as eggs or larvae by the California Halibut Hatchery Program in Redondo Beach, California.

This competition is viewed as a conflict by the fishermen because sea lions prey on fish caught in their fishing gear, often causing its damage. The objective of the study was to describe the interaction between sea lions and fishermen, and to evaluate the effects of operational interference caused by sea lions on their artisanal fishery. Descriptions of the interactions cited were made during 69 observational trips on fishing vessels plus interviews of 384 fishermen. Evaluation of the interactions was based on minimum and maximum scenarios. Almost all the artisanal fishermen complained of frequent problems with sea lions, however, such interactions were observed in 14.5% of the observer trips on fishing vessels. The results showed that loss of catch due to sea lions, varied between 1.83 and 21.1% of the CPUE (under minimal) and from 1.98 to 33.8% (under maximal) interactive scenarios. Although proportions of interactive fishing events and number of sea lions were different between the locations studied, CPUE per fishing gear did not differ significantly between interactive and non-interactive fishing trips among the areas. Also, no significant relation was found between the numbers of sea lions interacting during the fishing trip and the CPUE. Our results suggest that sea lions do not produce a significant effect on variations in the CPUE obtained by artisanal fishermen. Nevertheless, these findings must be confirmed with more intensive monitoring. A cooperative design of a co-management plan, which considers biological, social, and economical features will contribute to make consensus within the stakeholders looking for management options with the aim of reducing the conflicts.","AcknowledgementsWe dedicate this paper to Juan Soto “Juanillo”, who helped various generation of marine biologist of Montemar in the sea lion research.

Effects on growth and survival of larvae and juveniles,"Argopecten purpuratus, as several other scallops of commercial importance is a functional hermaphrodite. The usual methods for breeding cause an unavoidable degree of self-fertilization with the subsequent deleterious effects on survival and growth rates. Some researchers have unsuccessfully attempted to eliminate self-fertilization in these bivalves. Applying our knowledge of the cellular mechanisms of spawning in this species we have developed a method by which self-fertilization was eliminated. By this in vitro fertilization method, oocytes were obtained by scraping the female portion of the gonad, meiosis resumption was induced by serotonin, and then the oocytes were fertilized with sperm from different individuals. The progeny obtained by this method were compared with others obtained by cross-fertilization and self-fertilization. In all these procedures, the oocytes were fertilized at a ratio of 60 sperm per oocyte. The fertilization rates and D larvae survival were determined at 2 and 48 h, respectively. After the D larval stage, the hatchery culture of larvae continued as usual with sampling for survival and growth rates every three days. When larvae looked ready to settle and metamorphose, netlon collectors were introduced into the tanks. After 12 days the collectors were placed in 1 mm mesh collection bags and transferred to the sea. Juveniles were brought back to the hatchery every 40–70 days, to be counted, measured, and placed in mesh pearl nets. The assay of the three procedures for fertilization showed similar fertilization rates but low survival for D larvae obtained from the in vitro method. However, this procedure resulted in the highest size and survival rates of larvae. Survival of juveniles coming from this fertilization procedure was also the highest. The growth of juveniles obtained by in vitro fertilization was also higher than that of those obtained by self-fertilization. We conclude that this in vitro fertilization procedure provides a methodology that results in higher survival and growth rates of juveniles than obtained by procedures involving any degree of inbreeding. This in vitro procedure should be applicable to other simultaneous hermaphroditic scallops.","AcknowledgmentsThis work was supported by a grant from FONDECYT (N° 1050590).

Estos minerales pueden ser subdivididos en dos grupos principales sobre la base de sus relaciones parageneticas. Carbonatos parageneticamente tempranos se encuentran junto a cuarzo y sulfuras en vetas bandeadas y estan estrechamente asociados con la mineralizacion de metales preciosos. Estos carbonatos son composicionalmente complejos, consistiendo en calcita entrecrecida con ankerita, kutnohorita, rhodocrosita y dolomita, pero tambien contienen hasta 0,8% en peso de PbC03 y hasta 4,1% en peso de ZnC03. En contraste, los carbonatos parageneticamente tardios son calcita relativamente pura, aunque localmente tambien se ha reconocido dolomita. Las calcitas tardias contienen menos de 3,5% en peso MnC03, menos de 0,5% en peso de ZnC03 y menos de 2,7% en peso de FeC03 y tambien son distintas a los carbonatos tempranos en que se caracterizan por una fluorescencia roja moderada a intensa bajo luz ultravioleta de onda corta. El color rojo de fluorescencia bajo luz ultravioleta probablemente esta relacionado con contenidos en algun porcentaje de Mn, combinado con trazas de Pb y bajos contenidos de Fe. Los carbonatos tardios se interpretan como precipitados de fluidos ricos en C02 condensados de vapor ('steam-heated') y no tienen relacion directa con la mena. Las composiciones de 8180 de carbonatos, tanto tempranos como tardios, varian entre 21,1 y 14,1 %0 relativo al estandar VSMOW 'Standard Mean Ocean Water'. Sin embargo, dos muestras de calcita tardia arrojan valores de 8180 de 3 y 5%o. Los valores calculados para la composicion de agua en equilibrio con calcita en las temperaturas estimadas de precipitacion de 230°C entregan valores de 8180 entre 6 y 13%o pero valores negativos de -3,1 y -5,1%o para dos muestras de calcita tardia. A pesar de que el valor bajo de 8180 de algunas calcitas tardias y datos isotopicos para cuarzo en vetas de estudios anteriores, sugieren precipitacion desde un fluido meteorico, la signatura isotopica pesada de la mayoria de las muestras de carbonato indican que el fluido en general ha sido heterogeneo. Los valores de 813C varian entre -8,9%o y +1,5%o relativo al estandar VPDB 'Pee Dee Belemnite' son consistentes con un origen meteorico o magmatico, en algunas muestras probablemente con una contribucion menor de carbono organico. Un aporte periodico de fluido con un importante componente magmatico o, alternativamente, agua meteorica que ha sufrido extensa evaporacion probablemente jugo un rol importante en el sistema hidrotermal. Los isotopos estables en carbonatos en El Peñon se interpretan como evidencia de condiciones climaticas aridas, ya que el origen meteorico del fluido no esta tan bien definido como en yacimientos epitermales similares en regiones mas pluviales.",,,Andean Geology,,,,2007-12-24,2007,2007-12-24,,34,2,291-304,All OA; Hybrid,Article,"Bissig, Thomas; Donoso, Daisy; Guerra, Nelson C.; Dipple, Gregory M.","Bissig, Thomas (Universidad Católica del Norte); Donoso, Daisy (Minera Meridian Ltda); Guerra, Nelson C.

253,pub.1055601030,10.1021/ie070236c,,,Role of Soil Porosity and Electrical and Thermal Resistivities on Free-Convective Transport. Heat Transfer and Hydrodynamic Aspects in an Annular Geometry,"The electrokinetic process of soil remediation is affected by different transport driving forces that are responsible for the motion of the bulk fluid and solute species. In particular, the electro-mechanisms, that is, electroosmosis, electrophoresis, and electromigration, may compete with buoyancy and advection promoting distinct flow regimes. The earlier applications of electrokinetic phenomena, that is, electro-assisted drug delivery, micro-electrophoretic separations, and material processing, just to name a few, mainly in the area of electrophoresis, neglected this competition and therefore the hydrodynamics of electrokinetic systems was considered simpler. Field test results demonstrate that this is not the case with soil cleanup processes. The unique characteristics of soil porous media call for a different approach and are in need of further analysis. In this contribution, the basic aspects of the behavior of such a system are captured by using an annular capillary model. Under the proposed geometry, a differential model is formulated using simplifying assumptions to maintain the mathematical aspects to a minimum level, and a solution is presented for the different fields, that is, the temperature and the velocity. Several numerical examples are shown to portray the flow situations found in the system for a selection of values of the parameter space. From the analysis of these graphic representations, a qualitative and semiquantitative description of the different flow regimes inside the annular channel is obtained. Particularly interesting in this study is the inclusion of the resistive heating effect in the core of the annular capillary channel as a force term. Temperature developments are explained and analyzed under different scenarios. This information is useful to identify further aspects for the investigation and delineate a systematic approach for a more rigorous description. Implications for design of devices and cleaning strategies are also included. The results obtained in this study are useful to promote a deeper understanding of the behavior of the system, to have a better idea about the experimental effort needed for validation of the different trends, and to lead to important guidelines for improving the separation or cleaning efficiency in a given application.","The support given to M.A.O. by Universidad Católica del Norte, Antofagasta, Chile, is gratefully acknowledged.

The Atacama Desert is among the most important ones. Sixty-two, non-paired, meteorites have been collected in different places of Atacama since the late 19th century to date. Practically all types, classes and groups of meteorites have been recovered. In this work a review of the Atacama meteorites is carried out, listing all past recoveries, determining the principal strewnfield distribution patterns and providing a general overview of the features of the find locations. Principal find locations are concentrated in the Atacama Central Depression. Most of them coincide with ancient mining industries (metallic or non-metallic) or are located near towns, rail stations, tracks or human settlements. Whatever the meteorite find location was, all meteorite samples were collected on the desert surface and normally: (1) showed more than a quarter of their body exposed; (2) underwent some sign of terrestrial weathering; (3) stone meteorites have a brownish desert-varnish on hand specimen; (4) are non-oriented pieces and (5) are commonly members of a greater mass distributed in a certain place. The distribution of find locations in Atacama Desert is not as simple as it would seem on a first approach, as Atacama salt phases (environmental conditions and mineralogical alterations) have a crucial importance on meteorites weathering.","AcknowledgmentsWe thank the institutional support and facilities of the Laboratorio de Geoquímica Aplicada and Laboratorio de Geoinformática (Departamento de Ciencias Geológicas—UCN), Chile, and Centro de Astrobiologia, Spain.

This layer is an important component of permafrost regions because most geomorphic, hydrological, and biological activity occurs within it. The thickness is highly variable in time and over space and is proportional to summer temperature. The spatial variability is determined by a suite of physical-geographical factors, including topoclimate, moisture content, substrate thermal properties, and surface cover. Sustained climatic warming could induce a widespread increase of active-layer thickness. Although empirical records are not long enough to establish a firm link between active-layer thickness and contemporary climatic change, abundant evidence exists in the Quaternary stratigraphic record for large increases in the depth of thaw. In areas where massive ground ice occurs in the upper layers of permafrost, a widespread increase in active-layer thickness could lead to differential thaw settlement and development of thermokarst terrain, with profound effects on ecosystems and human settlements.",,,,Encyclopedia of Quaternary Science,,,2007,2007,,2007,,,2138-2147,Closed,Chapter,"Shiklomanov, N.I.; Nelson, F.","Shiklomanov, N.I.

We tested three possible hypotheses to explain the richness gradient: (1) Rapoport's effect; (2) the mid‐domain effect (MDE); and (c) the source–sink hypothesis.   Location  South‐eastern Pacific coast of Chile.   Methods  The bathymetric gradient in richness was evaluated using the reported ranges of bathymetric distribution of 498 polychaete species, from the intertidal to abyssal zone ( c. 4700 m). Rapoport's effect was evaluated by examining the relationship between bathymetric mid‐point and bathymetric range extent, and species richness and depth. The MDE was tested using the Monte Carlo simulation program. The source–sink hypothesis was tested through nestedness analysis.   Results  Species richness shows significant exponential decay across the bathymetric gradient. The pattern is characterized by a high presence of short‐ranged species on the continental shelf area; while only a few species reach abyssal depths, and they tend to show extremely wide bathymetric ranges. Our simulation analyses showed that, in general, the pattern is robust to sampling artefacts. This pattern cannot be reproduced by the MDE, which predicts a parabolic richness gradient. Rather, results agree with the predictions of Rapoport's effect. Additionally, the data set is significantly nested at species, genus and family levels, supporting the source–sink hypothesis.   Main conclusions  The sharp exponential decay in benthic polychaete richness across the bathymetric gradient supports the general idea that abyssal environments should harbour fewer species than shallower zones. This pattern may be the result of colonization–extinction dynamics, characterized by abyssal assemblages acting as ‘sinks’ maintained mainly by shallower ‘sources’. The source–sink hypothesis provides a conceptual and methodological framework that may shed light on the search for general patterns of diversity across large spatial scales.","We thank Patricio A.

We examined the effect of detachment on the relative palatability of the two kelp species Lessonia nigrescens and Macrocystis integrifolia to mesograzers. Laboratory and field experiments were conducted on the northern-central coast of Chile to investigate whether (i) time after detachment and (ii) grazing on detached and attached algae could trigger internal defence mechanisms in the algae, which may have acted as deterrents to grazing. In order to examine palatability, feeding assays were run after each experiment using fresh algal pieces and artificial food. Time after detachment had a significant influence on palatability of L. nigrescens but not of M. integrifolia. During the first 12 days of detachment, detached L. nigrescens held in grazer-free laboratory tanks were not significantly more palatable than attached conspecifics from the field but thereafter detached individuals became more palatable. Floating individuals of M. integrifolia showed no effect of detachment, indicating that this alga maintains its defence after detachment. An experiment conducted in the field confirmed these results for M. integrifolia. An additional laboratory experiment confirmed that attachment status plays an important role on algal defence reaction for L. nigrescens when exposed to grazers. Detached and previously grazed individuals of this species were less palatable than grazer-free control algae, but grazing had no effect on palatability of attached algae. Our results indicate that kelps have varying capacities for development of anti-grazing responses once they become detached, possibly depending on their capacity to float and survive after detachment.",,,Developments in Applied Phycology,Eighteenth International Seaweed Symposium,"Robert Anderson, Juliet Brodie, Edvar Onsøyen, Alan T.

Current water velocity, a factor closely related to water flow rate, can significantly affect fish performance in culture tanks. A study was carried out to test the effect of three relative water velocities of 0.5, 1.0, and 1.5 body lengths per second (bl/s) on the growth of California halibut (Paralichthys californicus) juveniles over 10 weeks of culture. Nine rectangular tanks were used in this experiment to provide the velocities to be tested, which were stocked with 15 fish each. Weaned California halibut 90 days post hatch (dph), 5.4 cm average total length, and 1.53 g average wet weight were used for this study. All fish were sampled every other week to record their biomass and morphometric data. This research has shown that California halibut juveniles can be raised between 0.5 and 1.5 bl/s without affecting their survival. However, California halibut juveniles grew faster and made more efficient use of the feed provided at 0.5 and 1.0 bl/s than at 1.5 bl/s. Moreover, it was determined that maximum fish growth was achieved for velocities up to 1.0 bl/s.","AcknowledgementsThe fish used in this work were supplied as eggs or larvae by the California Halibut Hatchery Program in Redondo Beach, California.

243,pub.1047567860,10.1007/s10971-007-1663-2,,,Magnetic resonance study of a vanadium pentoxide gel,"In this work we report results from continuous-wave (CW) and pulsed electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and proton nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) studies of the vanadium pentoxide xerogel V2O5:nH2O (n ≈ 1.6). The low temperature CW-EPR spectrum shows hyperfine structure due to coupling of unpaired V4+ electron with the vanadium nucleus. The analysis of the spin Hamiltonian parameters suggests that the V4+ ions are located in tetragonally distorted octahedral sites. The transition temperature from the rigid-lattice low-temperature regime to the high temperature liquid-like regime was determined from the analysis of the temperature dependence of the hyperfine splitting and the V4+ motional correlation time. The Electron Spin Echo Envelope Modulation (ESEEM) data shows the signals resulting from the interaction of 1H nuclei with V4+ ions. The modulation effect was observed only for field values in the center of the EPR absorption spectrum corresponding to the single crystals orientated perpendicular to the magnetic field direction. At least three protons are identified in the xerogel by our magnetic resonance experiments: (I) the OH groups in the equatorial plane, (ii) the bound water molecules in the axial V=O bond and (iii) the free mobile water molecules between the oxide layers. Proton NMR lineshapes and spin-lattice relaxation times were measured in the temperature range between 150 K and 323 K. Our analysis indicates that only a fraction of the xerogel protons contribute to the measured conductivity.","The authors are grateful to L. V. S. Lopes and Dr. C. E.

A method of free association of words as stimuli and an image of movement survey (that takes the form of a semantic differential) were used for the analysis of these representations. The results obtained by free association of words were analyzed by multivariated methods (hierarchical cluster analysis, multidimensional scaling and correspondences analysis). The results on the image survey were summarized in seven principal factors. The averages of these factors were compared according to the criterion of political self-categorization. The principal effect observed was a rejection, from a part of the subjects of the sample, in using the cultural categories that in other studies appeared as the most pertinent fo the elaboration of social representations about the anti-globalization movement (AMG).",,,Psicologia & Sociedade,,,,2007-12,2007,2008-01-28,2007-12,19,3,76-87,All OA; Gold,Article,"Castro, Manuel Cárdenas; López, Roberto Rodríguez","Castro, Manuel Cárdenas (Universidad Católica del Norte, Escuela de Psicología); López, Roberto Rodríguez ()",,"Castro, Manuel Cárdenas (Catholic University of the North); López, Roberto Rodríguez ()",0,0,,0.0,https://www.scielo.br/j/psoc/a/7txp5hHx5dXR676Ghh8sNZL/?lang=es&format=pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1043294331,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3504 Commercial Services; 52 Psychology",

In the course of the near-mid-infrared AGN search combining the 6.7 μm ISOCAM Parallel Survey and 2MASS we have discovered 24 type-1 quasars about a third of which are too red to be discriminated by optical/UV search techniques. Aims.Here we report on a detailed case study of the reddest type-1 quasar of our sample, 2MASS J23410667-0914327 (for short J2341) at redshift with and . This source has a very red optical appearance but lacks the far-infrared emission typically seen in known dust enshrouded AGN. Therefore we here explore its enigmatic nature. Methods.We performed spectroscopy in the optical with VLT/FORS1 and in the mid-infrared (5–38m) with the Spitzer Space Telescope as well as near-infrared (NIR) imaging with ISPI at the CTIO 4m-telescope. To explain the red optical continuum of the quasar we examine nuclear dust reddening of an intrinsically blue quasar continuum in combination with dilution by stellar light of the host galaxy. Results.The optical and NIR observations reveal a star forming emission-line galaxy at the same redshift as the quasar with a projected linear separation of 18 (6.7 kpc). The quasar and its companion are embedded in diffuse extended continuum emission. Compared with its companion the quasar exhibits redder optical-NIR colours, which we attribute to hot nuclear dust. The mid-infrared spectrum shows only few emission lines superimposed on a power-law spectral energy distribution typically seen in type-1 AGN. However, the lack of strong far-infrared emission suggests that our potentially interacting object contains much less gas and dust and is in a stage different from dust reddened ULIRG-AGN like Mrk 231. The optical spectrum shows signatures for reddening in the emission-lines and no post-starburst stellar population is detected in the host galaxy of the quasar. The optical continuum emission of the active nucleus appears absorbed and diluted. Conclusions. Even the combination of absorption and host dilution is not able to match J2341 with standard quasar templates. While the BLR shows only a rather moderate absorption of , the continuum shorter than 4500 Å requires strong obscuration with , clearly exceeding the constraints from the low upper limit on the silicate 9.7 μm absorption. This leads us to conclude that the continuum of the quasar J2341 is intrinsically redder than that of typical quasars.",,,Astronomy & Astrophysics,,,,2007-07-16,2007,2007-07-16,2007-10,473,1,121-128,All OA; Bronze,Article,"Leipski, C.; Haas, M.; Siebenmorgen, R.; Meusinger, H.; Albrecht, M.; Cesarsky, C.; Chini, R.; Cutri, R.; Drass, H.; Huchra, J.

spectrum shows signatures for reddening in the emission-lines and no
post-starburst stellar population is detected in the host galaxy of the quasar.
The optical continuum emission of the active nucleus appears absorbed and
diluted. Even the combination of absorption and host dilution is not able to
match J2341 with standard quasar templates. While the BLR shows only a rather
moderate absorption of E_(B-V)=0.3, the continuum shorter than 4500 AA requires
strong obscuration with E_(B-V)=0.7, exceeding the constraints from the low
upper limit on the 9.7 mu silicate absorption. This leads us to conclude that
the continuum of J2341 is intrinsically redder than that of typical quasars.",,,arXiv,,,,2007-08-22,2007,,,,,,All OA; Green,Preprint,"Leipski, C.; Haas, M.; Siebenmorgen, R.; Meusinger, H.; Albrecht, M.; Cesarsky, C.; Chini, R.; Cutri, R.; Drass, H.; Huchra, J.

The effect of stocking densities between 100 and 300% of coverage area (PCA) on growth of juvenile (11.6 g) fish was tested in experiments that lasted 8 to 10 weeks. The experiments were carried out in a recirculation system in small rectangular tanks and raceways with water depths under 6 cm. It was found that maximum fish growth was achieved for fish stocked initially at 100% PCA. The results showed that California halibut can be grown in shallow tanks and raceways at a relatively high stocking density without significantly compromising growth rate and survivability.","AcknowledgementsThe fish used in this work were supplied as eggs or larvae by the California Halibut Hatchery Program in Redondo Beach, California.

In order to determine physiological response of A. purpuratus under different salinities and temperature conditions, two groups of juvenile scallops (small: h=6.5 mm and large: h=25.5 mm) were acclimated and close-cultured at salinities of 34, 38, and 42 g/l, at 16 and 22 °C and fed on Isochrysis galbana and Chaetoceros calcitrans. Survival, shell growth and scope for growth were determined at the end of the trials. Survival showed an inverse relationship with temperature and ammonia levels. In small scallops an increase in salinity at 16 °C increased survival. However, this relationship was not evident at 22 °C. On the other hand, salinity did not affect survival of large juveniles. Small juveniles had a lower survival (approximately 40%) than larger scallops (up to 85%) throughout the trials. Oxygen consumption was not affected by salinity. Small scallops showed similar oxygen consumption at 16 and 22 °C but in large juveniles higher values were registered at 22 °C. In large juveniles routine consumption at 16 °C was higher (up to 35%) than standard consumption. This pattern was not evident at 22 °C, suggesting that oxygen demand is higher regardless of feeding condition. NH4+–N excretion rate is inversely related to salinity. Only small juveniles showed a higher NH4+–N excretion rate at 22 °C. Scope for growth was positive in all treatments, although the upper limit of salinity should not be based only in this index. Higher scope for growth values at 38 and 42 g/l was related with a reduction in ammonia excretion and high absorption efficiency. In addition, an increase in salinity produced a reduction in NH3–N proportion and under hypersaline conditions scallops tended to decrease excretion as a way of osmoconformation. This explains our findings of higher survival rates at higher salinities. Even though the scope for growth is positive at 42 g/l, the osmotic stress reduces the survival chances. The data obtained can be considered useful information for A. purpuratus culture under controlled conditions.","AcknowledgementsThe study was supported by a Master&#x27;s scholarship from InterAmerican Bank of Development-Japan Government granted to G.

However, the perception of Black people as one Black group has skewed our understanding of how different groups within the Black communities project their linguistic and visual distinctiveness through their media. Subsequently, we have little understanding of the press for and by Black African diasporas in the United Kingdom. Therefore, the article explores the dynamic relationship between the Black African community and its press through a case study of African Voice, interview with the editor, and audience survey. Furthermore, it explores the news agenda of the African Voice from the theoretical paradigms of alternative and tabloid popular press.

By using a qualitative approach, open interviews were developed to understand the meaning that men assign to the feminine leadership. The speeches were analyzed on the basis of the Strauss/Corbin-theory (2003). The results show that men agree with the changes experienced by the gender roles. In a specific way, men agree that women need to have more societal-economic opportunities, which are necessary for more equitable relationship inside the family. However, within this positive framework emerging tensions configure a dissatisfaction of the masculinity that, in turn, impact the intimate sphere questioning the present day inter-gender relationship. Finally, there is a men's group with more progressive speeches which venture towards a positive evaluation of the women's capacities and their assumed public space-roles. However this positive evaluation is vigilant, ambivalent, and influenced by a perception of confidence/uncertainty, efficiency/inefficiency of the effective societal contribution that women are able to reach.",,,Revista Estudos Feministas,,,,2007-12,2007,2008-07-23,2007-12,15,3,541-562,All OA; Gold,Article,"Meruane, Paulina Irene Salinas","Meruane, Paulina Irene Salinas (Universidad Católica del Norte, Escuela de Periodismo)",,"Meruane, Paulina Irene Salinas (Catholic University of the North)",6,1,,1.66,https://www.scielo.br/j/ref/a/t4CcKRNnRRnrCYLgc5HJRrM/?lang=es&format=pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1052850525,44 Human Society; 4405 Gender Studies,5 Gender Equality

Fouling assemblages grown on artificial settlement substrata were disturbed by mechanical removal of biomass at different time intervals. Using one single disturbance frequency (10 disturbance events over 5 months) we applied 7 different temporal disturbance treatments: a constant disturbance regime (identical intervals between disturbance events), and 6 variable treatments where both variableness and sequences of intervals between disturbance events were manipulated. Two levels of temporal variableness (low and high, i.e. disturbance events were either dispersed or highly clumped in time) in the disturbance regime were applied by modifying the time intervals between subsequent disturbance events. To investigate the temporal coupling between disturbance events and other ecological processes (e.g. larval supply and recruitment intensity), three different sequences of disturbance intervals were nested in each of the two levels of temporal variableness. Species richness, evenness, total abundance, and structure of communities that experienced the various disturbance regimes were compared at the end of the experiment (15 days after the last disturbance event). Disturbance strongly influenced the community structure and led to a decrease in evenness and total abundance but not species richness. In undisturbed reference communities, the dominant competitor Pyura chilensis (Tunicata) occupied most available space while this species was suppressed in all disturbed treatments. Surprisingly, neither temporal variableness in the disturbance regime nor the sequence of intervals between disturbance events had an effect on community structure. Temporal variability in high disturbance regimes may be of minor importance for fouling communities, because they are dominated by opportunistic species that are adapted to rapidly exploit available space.","AcknowledgementsWe thank P.

Such inconsistency makes the ‘Department of English’ as it currently exists unable to contribute towards the intellectualisaton of African languages (Alexander, 2005) and the transformation of South Africa's universities, particularly with regard to the use of African languages for learning and teaching. The article thus proposes that the ‘Department of English’ and the ‘Department of Eiterature’ should be separated. The former should take its place alongside other language departments and, at English-language universities, be primarily responsible for English language teaching and support (for those students to whom English-medium instruction presents a barrier to learning).

Lessonia nigrescens Bory de Saint‐Vincent in the intertidal and Lessonia trabeculata Villouta et Santelices in the subtidal, are the most important habitat constructors in rocky coastal communities in northern and central Chile. In both species, the seasonal production and erosion of distal tissue were estimated in biomass units using the Area of Constant Biomass Model that combined the individual blade elongation, obtained with the traditional hole‐punching method, with the blade length and biomass distribution along the blade. In austral late spring (December 96) and autumn (May 97), blade production and erosion were transformed to the level of population from standing stock measurements (number and biomass of blades and plants per substrate area), considering that previous blade weight analysis showed the highest and lowest values at these times, as well as the population parameter extremes that were expected to occur. Both species displayed a seasonal pattern, with a production increase in later winter and spring and decrease towards the end of summer that coincided with higher distal tissue erosion. At the level of individual blades, Lessonia trabeculata showed higher mean production (0.026 g dw d −1 ) and erosion (0.01 g dw d −1 ) than L. nigrescens (production 0.01 g dw d −1 and loss 0.002 g dw d −1 ). The standing stocks, with respect to density and biomass, were similar in spring and autumn for both populations. Nevertheless, the net productivity (production minus erosion) of the intertidal L. nigrescens showed greater values due to the greater density of blades (2112 ± 1360 (SE) blades m −2 ) compared with the subtidal L. trabeculata (527 ± 151 (SE) blades m −2 ). Spring net productivities of 42 g dw m −2 d −1 (254 g ww m −2 d −1 ; 11.46 gC m −2 d −1 ) for L. nigrescens and 11 g dw m −2 d −1 (64 g ww m −2 d −1 ; 2.46 gC m −2 d −1 ) for L. trabeculata were estimated.

225,pub.1038224692,10.1080/01490450701266605,,,Microbial Precipitation of Arsenic Sulfides in Andean Salt Flats,"An abiotic origin has traditionally been assumed for the arsenic minerals realgar and orpiment associated with thermal springs. Microbial precipitation of arsenic, however, has been studied in pure cultures and the isotopic composition of arsenic sulfides associated with some borate deposits suggests a biotic origin for those minerals. The aim of the present study is to demonstrate the role of bacterial arsenic precipitation in the biogeochemical cycle of arsenic in such borate deposits. For this purpose both enrichment and pure cultures were obtained from the natural arsenic minerals and the composition and isotopic signatures of the arsenic sulfide minerals precipitated by the cultures and those associated with boron deposits from an Andean salt flat in northern Chile were compared. Based on the microbiological and chemical evidence gathered, it is concluded that bacteria contributed to the formation of the arsenic minerals. This interpretation is based on the consistent association of a variety of features that strongly indicate microbial involvement in the precipitation process. These include: (1) enrichment and isolation of cultures with arsenic precipitation capacity from arsenic mineral samples, (2) high numbers of arsenic-precipitating bacteria in the Andean minerals and brines, (3) chemical and mineralogical properties of precipitates experimentally formed under biotic and abiotic conditions, (4) similarities in stoichiometry between natural and laboratory obtained minerals, and (5) the consistent depletion in δ34S values for natural versus laboratory obtained sulfides. Thus, microbial precipitation of arsenic sulfides is a geochemically relevant metabolism.","This work was supported by funds provided by the Chilean Government through FONDECYT Project 1030441, FONDEF Project D99I1026 from the Science and Technology Chilean Commission (CONICYT), CICYT BTE2001-3225 project of the Spanish Government and BBVA Foundation project BIOARSENICO.

Some critical comments on the influences in the forthcoming data privacy bill in South Africa,"There is a worldwide concern growing regarding the increasing potential threats to the personal privacy of individuals caused by technologies and governments. The international response of governments has been to draught comprehensive privacy legislation in order to protect their citizen's personal information and to enable their citizens to have control over their personal information. In South Africa, the right to privacy is protected by both Section 14 of the Constitution and the provisions of the Common Law, but at this stage no formal privacy legislation is in place to enforce fair data protection principles. A new Data Privacy Bill is in the process of being draughted by the South African Law Commission and it is taking into account South Africa's unique political and social context as well as international demands made by the global economy. The prime influences acting upon the new Data Privacy Bill are the mandate in the Constitution, the EU Data Protection Directive and the Ubuntu worldview. Ubuntu can be described as a community-based mindset in which the welfare of the group is greater than the welfare of a single individual in the group. In this article, we argue that the EU Data Protection Directive is one of the best articulated privacy laws in existence today and the Ubuntu philosophy has been pressed into service very successfully in diverse arenas in South Africa. This paper argues that both influences will be seen in the future Data Privacy Act, but that the EU Data Protection Directive's influence will be pre-eminent.",,,The International Information & Library Review,,,,2007-03,2007,,2007-03,39,1,31-43,All OA; Green,Article,"Olinger, Hanno N.; Britz, Johannes J.; Olivier, Martin S.","Olinger, Hanno N.

Rates of total ammonia nitrogen (TAN) and urea-N excretion were measured for California halibut of 4.2, 7.2, 10.4, 20.1, 112 and 199 g mean mass. The fish were fed with a feed of a size-appropriate pellet containing 43–45% protein continuously over 12 h during the light hours (photoperiod of 16 h daylight and 8 h dark). Feeding was started 2 h into the light period after the tanks had been cleaned and routine water analyses had been made. Daily average TAN excretion rates ranged from 4.3 to 8.5 mg TAN/g feed, and urea-N excretion rates ranged from 0.8 to 1.8 mg urea-N/g feed. Corresponding values relative to fish mass were between 91 and 113 mg TAN/kg fish d and between 13 and 20 mg urea-N/kg fish d. Peaks of TAN excretion occurred 4–6 h after feeding had started and 6–10 h after conclusion for the 4–20 g fish. Corresponding values for the 112 and 199 g fish were 10–12 h after feeding had started and 8–10 h after feeding ended. Some minor fluctuations in the urea excretion rates were noted, but there were no consistent peaks. TAN excretion accounted for 81.6 to 88.1% of the total daily urea-N plus TAN excretion by California halibut with the balance consisting of urea-N excretion. Although urea-N makes up a relatively small portion of the total daily nitrogen excretion by California halibut, there were times during the day during when the hourly urea-N excretion rate was similar to or larger than the corresponding TAN excretion rate. All excretion measurements were made under farm-like conditions with fish reared in a marine recirculating system.","AcknowledgementsThis work was funded primarily by the National Sea Grant College Program of the U.S. Department of Commerce&#x27;s National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration under NOAA Grant no.

Specifically, we study the level both of the horizontal (HB) and red giant branches (RGB) relative to the main-sequence turnoff (TO) in the U magnitude. Methods.Along with the presented photometry of M 75, we use our collection of photometric data on GCs belonging to the metal-poor range, [Fe/H] dex, obtained from observations with different equipment, but calibrated by standard stars situated in the observed cluster fields. Results.We confirm our earlier finding, and extend it to a larger magnitude range. We demonstrate that expressing the difference in U magnitude between the TO point and the level of the blue HB, near its red boundary, of the metal-poor GCs observed with the EMMI camera of the NTT/ESO telescope is about 0.4–0.5 mag smaller as compared to GCs observed with the 100″ telescope and 1.3 m Warsaw telescope of the Las Campanas Observatory. At the same time, , the difference in U magnitude between the TO and RGB inflection (brightest) points, does not show such an apparent dependence on the characteristics of U filters used, but it depends on cluster metallicity. We have shown, for the first time, the dependence of the parameter on [Fe/H] and have estimated its analytical expression, by assuming a linear relation between the parameter and metallicity. Its slope, /Δ[Fe/H] ~ 1.2 mag/dex, is approximately a factor of two steeper than that of the dependence of the RGB bump position in the V magnitude on metallicity.

Changes in macrofaunal community, feeding mode structure, and biomass size spectra are contrasted over time with changes in oceanographic and sediment settings, in order to assess intra- and inter-annual changes in faunal composition during both ENSO periods.During EN, there was a decrease in biomass and abundance of species known to be well adapted to organic-rich, oxygen-deficient environments, such as the interface-feeding polychaete Paraprionospio pinnata. On the other hand the abundance of highly mobile, burrowing polychaetes remained unaffected, or even increased in biomass. The decline of P. pinnata lasted several years after the demise of warm conditions, possibly due to negative interactions with those more mobile burrowing polychaetes. The percent contribution of subsurface-deposit feeders to total biomass increased during EN (49.3±12.4% during summer) and declined only in the summer-fall period of 2002–03 (11.1±4.1%). An opposite trend was observed for interface and surface-deposit feeders. From EN to summer-fall 2002–03 (i.e., normal to low oxygen conditions) the size-structure of the macrobenthos switched from a larger to a smaller-sized assemblage. However, biomass was maintained due to successful recruitment and high abundance of both P. pinnata and the squat lobster, Pleuroncodes monodon.Our results suggest that the shelf macrofaunal community structure exhibit fluctuations at various time scales, and that these changes are more pronounced during and after a strong EN event. In such cases, the effects of such an event may be recorded at latitudes as far south as 36°S, with consequences in the biota lasting for many years after the demise of warm conditions.","AcknowledgmentsWe specially thank the captain and crew of the R.V.

This is aggravated during winter by the topography and meteorological conditions of the city. Although public policies have been developed to minimise the atmospheric aerosol pollution, there is a lack of adequate knowledge and poor characterisation of these aerosols (in its PM2.5 and PM10 fractions). In this study we sampled atmospheric particles during winter in two distinct areas of Santiago: downtown (Teatinos Street) and in a more residential area (Macul). Major (Si, Al, Fe, Ca and K) and some trace element (S, Cl, Ti, P, Cr, Cu and Zn) compositions were obtained by proton-induced X-ray emission (PIXE). Morphological, type and chemical characterisation was also performed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) coupled with an energy dispersive X-ray microanalysis system (SEM–EDX). Besides the carbon particles, the contribution of which can be quite important in the atmospheric aerosol, especially in downtown, unambiguously lithogenic (i.e. of geological origin) particles and elements are the second highest contributors. Enrichment factor calculation, together with particle identification and element correlation allow the origin of some elements and particles to be traced, revealing anthropogenic origins for some of them that are specific to the Santiago area.","This work was supported by the National Themes Program of the University of Chile (D.I.

Some critical comments on the influences in the forthcoming data privacy bill in South Africa,"There is a worldwide concern growing regarding the increasing potential threats to the personal privacy of individuals caused by technologies and governments. The international response of governments has been to draught comprehensive privacy legislation in order to protect their citizen's personal information and to enable their citizens to have control over their personal information. In South Africa, the right to privacy is protected by both Section 14 of the Constitution and the provisions of the Common Law, but at this stage no formal privacy legislation is in place to enforce fair data protection principles. A new Data Privacy Bill is in the process of being draughted by the South African Law Commission and it is taking into account South Africa's unique political and social context as well as international demands made by the global economy. The prime influences acting upon the new Data Privacy Bill are the mandate in the Constitution, the EU Data Protection Directive and the Ubuntu worldview. Ubuntu can be described as a community-based mindset in which the welfare of the group is greater than the welfare of a single individual in the group. In this article, we argue that the EU Data Protection Directive is one of the best articulated privacy laws in existence today and the Ubuntu philosophy has been pressed into service very successfully in diverse arenas in South Africa. This paper argues that both influences will be seen in the future Data Privacy Act, but that the EU Data Protection Directive's influence will be pre-eminent.",,,The International Information & Library Review,,,,2007-03,2007,2013-12-02,2007-03,39,1,31-43,All OA; Green,Article,"Olinger, Hanno N.; Britz, Johannes J.; Olivier, Martin S.","Olinger, Hanno N.

A large proportion of nitrofurans were previously shown to be TR inhibitors and some of them have in vitro trypanocidal action as well. The analysis of data collected from the docking procedure was undertaken both from the numeric and graphical standpoints, including the comparison of force field energies, molecular contacts and spatial location of the different orientations that ligands acquired at the binding sites. The results clearly suggest that nitrofurans are not able to selectively bind at the active site of the parasite TR, attaining even larger interaction energies at GR active site. The reason for inhibitor specificity is two-fold: (a) the nitrofuran group acts as a strong electrostatic anchor in GR; (b) the compounds form more stable complexes when binding at the non-selective dimmer interface. Therefore, these two aspects should be specially considered when seeking good candidates for leaders in regards the development of drugs with selective inhibition of TR.","AcknowledgmentsF.I., S.A. and M.P. thank NASA (National Aeronautics Space Administration), donation number: NAG5-11146, for the financial support received.

For a while after the collapse of apartheid, such exposé seemed to have become passé because it was assumed that the new democratic government would address the problems that such work had exposed and find means to remedy them. Moreover, it seemed inappropriate, at least in the early years of the new government, to be seen to be attacking its policy implementation. Although such criticism is often labelled as reactionary racism, continuing inequalities suggest a need to re-open the door for such critique and to return to the fray, drawing our students with us. To do that we need to ask: what are the imperatives that drive the post-apartheid generation of social anthropology students, and are they such that they will permit students to become critical citizens rather than subservient subjects? The article suggests that South Africa is today marked by a coalescence of neo-liberal imperatives and a media-driven hegemony of that ideology; by a growing embourgeoisement of the population from which South African higher education students are drawn and who are increasingly polarised from the poor. It argues that those factors have led to tertiary level students developing a set of aspirations that, without the students being carefully mentored, constrain most from adopting a substantively critical perspective, and that the challenge our discipline faces is to rekindle in that kind of student population an interest in, indeed to revive a passion for, criticality in a way that will enable a public anthropology of good citizenship. It also provides some indication as to how that rekindling might be effected.",,,Anthropology Southern Africa,,,,2007-01,2007,2015-09-25,2007-01,30,3-4,119-128,Closed,Article,"Spiegel, Andrew D.","Spiegel, Andrew D.

These can be used to derive gas fractions, and thereby to evaluate how BCDs have evolved with respect to dIs. Oxygen abundances have been derived for four BCDs in the Virgo Cluster from a run at Gemini-North in 2003. Combining these new abundances with published values, we study the correlations among the metallicity, Ks luminosity, gas mass, baryonic mass, and gas fraction. Within errors, the two types of dwarfs appear to share a common relation between the oxygen abundance and the luminosity in Ks. The correlation between metallicity and the gas fraction is the same for BCDs as for dIs, indicating that BCD evolution has been similar to that of dIs. Since dIs appear to have evolved as isolated systems, the BCD bursts are unlikely to be a consequence of gas infall or merging.",,,The Astronomical Journal,,,,2007-06-13,2007,2007-06-13,2007-08,134,2,604-616,All OA; Bronze,Article,"Vaduvescu, Ovidiu; McCall, Marshall L.; Richer, Michael G.","Vaduvescu, Ovidiu (Instituto de Astronomía, Universidad Católica del Norte, Avenida Angamos 0610, Antofagasta, Chile); McCall, Marshall L.

While the artist explicitly displays the process of laboratory analysis as an `object' itself, his critique is not directed to nor informed by any particular theoretical school within the discipline. However, Dion's representation of the archaeological process resonates with some elements of postprocessualism. Knowing the genealogy of the artist is vital to understanding such an affinity. In addition, Dion's classifications have an impact on the audience in terms of the construction and reproduction of historical identity, something apparent in the different reception of his work in England and in the USA.

Such patterns were examined at four kelp-dominated sites along the northern coast of Chile (19° through 30° S) over 1 year. Fish species richness, diversity and abundance estimates obtained via observational and destructive sampling methods were compared among sites as were habitat and environmental variables that characterised the sites; including sea water temperature below the surface, nutrients, productivity, visibility, density of macroalgae stands, and percentage cover of observed microhabitats (including understorey algae and faunal assemblages). In total, 19 fish species belonging to 14 families were observed from all sites. Species richness and diversity were highest in sites where kelp canopy was composed of two species and where kelp was densest, although only species diversity was significantly different among sites. The sites with high kelp density, in turn, sustained abundant habitat-forming species in the kelp understorey. Principal coordinate analysis indicated that the composition and structure of the fish assemblages varied significantly with depth at all study sites. The depth distribution of fishes was correlated with the arrangement of site-specific biological microhabitats, defined by the algae or invertebrate species that form the microhabitat. Temperature, productivity, and nutrients did not vary consistently across study sites, but did vary within individual sites. We suggest that kelp cover and composition strongly affects the diversity and distribution of fishes at shallow coastal habitats in northern Chile through the availability of microhabitats.","We thank Francisco Diáz, Horacio Bastias, and Natalio Godoy for the assistance in the field and Sergio Fuentes for assistance in the analyses of nutrients and primary productivity.

Sediment cores were obtained using a multiple corer and were analyzed mainly for 210Pb, total pigments, and macrofauna abundance. The 210Pb inventories and fluxes were estimated for surface sediments (0–5cm) and bioturbation coefficients were inferred using chlorophyll-a (reactive) profiles. In general, 210Pb content was inversely correlated with phytodetritus fluxes. High photosynthetic pigment contents in surface sediments were consistently associated with lower 210Pb contents. Macrofaunal activity responded to oxygen and organic matter supplies at the sediment surface, generally concentrated in the first centimeters, but particularly so during months of high organic matter fluxes and deficient bottom water oxygen conditions. At this study site, several processes involved in the 210Pb surface distribution make it difficult to accurately estimate ages at the surface. We postulate that the organic fluxes promote changes in the faunal activity, which, in combination with sediment resuspension and water circulation over the shelf, produce seasonal variations in the 210Pb inventories.","AcknowledgementsWe would like to express our gratitude to Dr. Laurent Dezileau from the Laboratoire de Dynamique de la Lithosphère (LDL) of the Université de Montpellier 2, France, who provided the facilities to count some samples in the alpha counter; to Dr. Rodolfo Araya Durán, Departamento de Ingeniería Matemática, Universidad de Concepción, who helped us run the mixing model; and to all the laboratory technicians from the Universidad de Concepción and Universidad Católica del Norte, who supported us during sample collection and analysis.

203,pub.1020460483,10.1029/2006jg000318,,,Comparing different methods for assessing ground truth of rover data analysis for the 2005 season of the Life in the Atacama Project,"The scientific success of a remote exploration rover mission depends on the right combination of technology, teamwork and scientific insight. In order to quantitatively evaluate the success of a rover field trial, it is necessary to assess the accuracy of scientific interpretations made during the field test. This work compares three structured approaches to assessing the ground truth of scientific findings from a science team conducting a remote investigation of a locale using an autonomous rover. For the first approach, independent assessment, the daily science summaries were analyzed and reduced to a series of 1082 factual statements, which were treated as hypotheses. An independent scientist traveled to the field area to assess these hypotheses. For the second approach, guided self‐study, the mission scientists themselves traveled to the field area and evaluated their own scientific interpretations. The third approach, discrepancy investigation, searched for the root causes of differences between the scientific interpretations made in the control room and those made in the field. The independent investigation provided sensitive, quantitative data, but suffered from the lack of context and continuity developed in the mission control room. The guided evaluation benefited from the context of the mission, but lacked clarity and consistency. The discrepancy investigation provided insight into the root causes behind the discrepancies, but was expensive and time consuming. The independent investigation method yielded particularly compelling results, but each method offers advantages and a comprehensive rover field trial assessment should include a combination of all three.","We are grateful to the science team for their patience and assistance with this effort throughout the LITA project.

How is ‘academic freedom’ protected by the law in each country? What are the threats to ‘academic freedom’—from government micro-management of universities, from commercial sponsors of university research, from managerialism/corporatism within university governance, from political correctness on the campus, from alumni-donors and the funders? Specifically, is academic freedom within UK universities challenged by recent anti-terrorism legislation; and in the USA by the neo-conservative ‘Academic Bill of Rights’ campaign? The conclusion is not pessimistic concerning the viability of academic freedom in both countries, but counsels wariness in watching out for threats if another McCarthy era is to be avoided.",,,Education and the Law,,,,2007-03,2007,,2007-03,19,1,19-40,Closed,Article,"Palfreyman, David","Palfreyman, David ()",,"Palfreyman, David ()",16,3,,4.02,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1021904362,"39 Education; 3902 Education Policy, Sociology and Philosophy; 3903 Education Systems","16 Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions"

The paper focuses on broadly-defined economics-related projects, which are expected to help the DPRK start economic transition and development by providing the country with necessary information and knowledge. North Korea's knowledge partnership were very active during 2001-2004 but decreased after their announcement of nuclear weapons in 2005. Despite this, some countries and organizations have been very successful in continuing their efforts for KP, including during the post-announcement years of 2005-2006.

183,pub.1036302159,10.1029/2006jg000301,,,Robotic ecological mapping: Habitats and the search for life in the Atacama Desert,"As part of the three‐year ‘Life in the Atacama’ (LITA) project, plant and microbial abundance were mapped within three sites in the Atacama Desert, Chile, using an automated robotic rover. On‐board fluorescence imaging of six biological signatures (e.g., chlorophyll, DNA, proteins) was used to assess abundance, based on a percent positive sample rating system and standardized robotic ecological transects. The percent positive rating system scored each sample based on the measured signal strength (0 for no signal to 2 for strong signal) for each biological signature relative to the total rating possible. The 2005 field experiment results show that percent positive ratings varied significantly across Site D (coastal site with fog), with patchy zones of high abundance correlated with orbital and microscale habitat types (heaved surface crust and gravel bars); alluvial fan habitats generally had lower abundance. Non‐random multi‐scale biological patchiness also characterized interior desert Sites E and F, with relatively high abundance associated with (paleo)aqueous habitats such as playas. Localized variables, including topography, played an important, albeit complex, role in microbial spatial distribution. Site D biosignature trends correlated with culturable soil bacteria, with MPN ranging from 10‐1000 CFU/g‐soil, and chlorophyll ratings accurately mapped lichen/moss abundance (Site D) and higher plant (Site F) distributions. Climate also affected biological patchiness, with significant correlation shown between abundance and (rover) air relative humidity, while lichen patterns were linked to the presence of fog. Rover biological mapping results across sites parallel longitudinal W‐E wet/dry/wet Atacama climate trends. Overall, the study highlights the success of targeting of aqueous‐associated habitats identifiable from orbital geology and mineralogy. The LITA experience also suggests the terrestrial study of life and its distribution, particularly the fields of landscape ecology and ecohydrology, hold critical lessons for the search for life on other planets. Their applications to robotic sampling strategies on Mars should be further exploited.",The authors thank the LITA rover engineering team for their unstinting efforts in the field.

During the Life in the Atacama (LITA) 2004 field experiment, satellite imagery and ground‐based rover data were used in concert with a ‘follow‐the‐water’ exploration strategy to target regions of biological interest in two (1 coastal, 1 inland) desert study sites. Within these regions, environments were located, studied and mapped with spectroscopic and fluorescence imaging (FI) for habitats and microbial life. Habitats included aqueous sedimentary deposits (e.g., evaporites), igneous materials (e.g., basalt, ash deposits), rock outcrops, drainage channels and basins, and alluvial fans. Positive biological signatures (chlorophyll, DNA, protein) were detected at 81% of the 21 locales surveyed with the FI during the long‐range, autonomous traverses totaling 30 km. FI sensitivity in detecting microbial life in extreme deserts explains the high percentage of positives despite the low actual abundance of heterotrophic soil bacteria in coastal (<1–104 CFU/g‐soil) and interior (<1–102 CFU/g‐soil) desert soils. Remote habitat, microbial and climate observations agreed well with ground‐truth, indicating a drier and less microbially rich interior compared to the relatively wetter and abundant biology of the coastal site where rover sensors detected the presence of fog and abundant surface lichens. LITA project results underscore the importance of an explicit focus by all engineering and science disciplines on microbially relevant scales (mm to nm), and highlight the success of satellite‐based and ‘follow‐the‐water’ strategies for locating diverse habitats of biological promise and detecting the microbial hotspots within them.","The authors thank the LITA rover engineering team for their unstinting efforts in the field.

This work purposely investigates each of the three topics separately. Our findings reveal that: (1) a majority of the schools require that one or more of these topics be covered in their MBA curriculum and one-third of the schools require coverage of all three topics as part of the MBA curriculum, (2) there is a trend toward the inclusion of sustainability-related courses, (3) there is a higher percentage of student interest in these topics (as measured by the presence of a Net Impact club) in the top 10 schools, and (4) several schools are teaching these topics using experiential learning and immersion techniques. We note a fivefold increase in the number of stand-alone ethics courses since a 1988 investigation on ethics, and we include other findings about institutional support of centers or special programs; as well as a discussion of integration, teaching techniques, and notable practices in relation to all three topics.","It is important for us to acknowledge the support of the Ethics Resource Center in Washington, DC, and the Center for Business Ethics at Bentley College.

167,pub.1019264632,10.1016/j.geomorph.2006.09.004,,,Late Cenozoic geomorphologic signal of Andean forearc deformation and tilting associated with the uplift and climate changes of the Southern Atacama Desert (26°S–28°S),"We analyze remarkable examples of the large (∼10,000 km2) and local-scale (∼100 km2) landscape forms related to Late Cenozoic geomorphologic evolution of the Andean forearc region in the Southern Atacama Desert. We also consider the continental sedimentary deposits, so-called “Atacama Gravels”, which are related to the degradation of the landscape during the Neogene. Our analysis integrates 1:50,000 field cartography, Landsat TM images observations, ∼1:1000 sedimentary logging data, and 50 m horizontal resolution topographic data to reconstruct the Late Cenozoic geomorphologic evolution of this region and discuss the factors that control it, i.e., Miocene aridification of the climate and Neogene Central Andean uplift. We determine that the Precordillera was already formed in the Oligocene and most of the present-day altitude of the Precordillera was reached before that time. Afterward, five episodes of geomorphologic evolution can be differentiated: (1) the development of an Oligocene deep incised drainage system cutting the uplifted Precordillera (up to 2000 m of vertical incision) and connecting it to the Ocean; followed by (2) the infilling of deep incised valleys by up to 400 m of Atacama Gravels. This infill started in the Early Miocene with the development of fluvial deposition and finished in the Middle Miocene with playa and playa lake depositions. We propose that playa-related deposition occurs in an endorheic context related to tectonic activity of the Atacama Fault System and Coastal Cordillera uplift. However, the upward sedimentologic variation in the Atacama Gravels evidences a progressive aridification of the climate. Subsequently, we have identified the effects of the Middle–Upper Miocene slow tectonic deformation: the Neogene Andean uplift is accommodated by a tilting or flexuring of the inner-forearc (Central Depression and Precordillera) related to some hundreds of meters of uplift in the Precordillera. This tilting or flexuring results in (3) the Middle Miocene re-opening of the valley network to the Pacific Ocean. Upper Miocene aridification, from arid to hyperarid, induces alluvial fans backfilling in the Central Depression (4) resulting in up to 50 m of Atacama Gravel deposition. Finally, in response to an increase in the rate of tilting, a new phase of vertical incision (up to 800 m in the Precordillera) allows the development of the canyon that crosses the forearc (5).","AcknowledgmentsFieldwork and laboratory analyses were supported by Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement, France and by the INSU Grand “Reliefs de la Terre.

162,pub.1010689848,10.1111/j.1365-3091.2007.00878.x,,,Lacustrine sedimentation in active volcanic settings: the Late Quaternary depositional evolution of Lake Chungará (northern Chile),"Lake Chungará (18°15′S, 69°09′W, 4520 m above sea‐level) is the largest (22·5 km2) and deepest (40 m) lacustrine ecosystem in the Chilean Altiplano and its location in an active volcanic setting, provides an opportunity to evaluate environmental (volcanic vs. climatic) controls on lacustrine sedimentation. The Late Quaternary depositional history of the lake is reconstructed by means of a multiproxy study of 15 Kullenberg cores and seismic data. The chronological framework is supported by 10 14C AMS dates and one 230Th/234U dates. Lake Chungará was formed prior to 12·8 cal kyr bp as a result of the partial collapse of the Parinacota volcano that impounded the Lauca river. The sedimentary architecture of the lacustrine succession has been controlled by (i) the strong inherited palaeo‐relief and (ii) changes in the accommodation space, caused by lake‐level fluctuations and tectonic subsidence. The first factor determined the location of the depocentre in the NW of the central plain. The second factor caused the area of deposition to extend towards the eastern and southern basin margins with accumulation of high‐stand sediments on the elevated marginal platforms. Synsedimentary normal faulting also increased accommodation and increased the rate of sedimentation in the northern part of the basin. Six sedimentary units were identified and correlated in the basin mainly using tephra keybeds. Unit 1 (Late Pleistocene–Early Holocene) is made up of laminated diatomite with some carbonate‐rich (calcite and aragonite) laminae. Unit 2 (Mid‐Holocene–Recent) is composed of massive to bedded diatomite with abundant tephra (lapilli and ash) layers. Some carbonate‐rich layers (calcite and aragonite) occur. Unit 3 consists of macrophyte‐rich diatomite deposited in nearshore environments. Unit 4 is composed of littoral sediments dominated by alternating charophyte‐rich and other aquatic macrophyte‐rich facies. Littoral carbonate productivity peaked when suitable shallow platforms were available for charophyte colonization. Clastic deposits in the lake are restricted to lake margins (Units 5 and 6). Diatom productivity peaked during a lowstand period (Unit 1 and subunit 2a), and was probably favoured by photic conditions affecting larger areas of the lake bottom. Offshore carbonate precipitation reached its maximum during the Early to Mid‐Holocene (ca 7·8 and 6·4 cal kyr bp). This may have been favoured by increases in lake solute concentrations resulting from evaporation and calcium input because of the compositional changes in pyroclastic supply. Diatom and pollen data from offshore cores suggest a number of lake‐level fluctuations: a Late Pleistocene deepening episode (ca 12·6 cal kyr BP), four shallowing episodes during the Early to Mid‐Holocene (ca 10·5, 9·8, 7·8 and 6·7 cal kyr BP) and higher lake levels since the Mid‐Holocene (ca 5·7 cal kyr BP) until the present. Explosive activity at Parinacota volcano was very limited between c. >12·8 and 7·8 cal kyr bp. Mafic‐rich explosive eruptions from the Ajata satellite cones increased after ca 5·7 cal kyr bp until the present.","The Spanish Ministry of Science and Education funded the research at Lake Chungará through the projects ANDESTER (BTE2001‐3225), BTE2001‐5257‐E and LAVOLTER (CGL2004‐00683/BTE).

En el presente ensayo me propongo dar cuenta de la naturaleza de este neoindigenismo tanto a travs del anlisis de la produccin de conocimientos por las agencias de Estado a nivel macro como a travs del estudio microsociolgico de las relaciones de poder y del tipo de saber generado por los agentes estatales y paraestatales a cargo de la ejecucin de ese programa. Centrando mi presentacin en uno de los componentes de Orgenes, muestro que la llamada Salud Intercultural representa una nueva ingeniera social que toma sentido dentro de un nuevo diagrama de saber/poder que llamo etnogubernamentalidad. Constituye una nueva gestin de la alteridad y un recorte del cuerpo social en clave tnica. Veremos por lo tanto que este nuevo objeto de la salud pblica debe ser aprehendido en su dimensin poltica.

Called Origins, this unprecedented political initiative aims at establishing a new deal between the State and rural ethnic groups and claims to be based on the respect of cultural difference. This paper offers an interpretation of the nature of this new kind of indigenism through the analysis of the state-produced knowledge on indigenous peoples, on the one hand, and by focusing on the new power relations and subjectifying effects created by state agents in specific localities, on the other. I shall show, using a discourse and socio-ethnographic analysis of its intercultural health component, that Orgenes represents a powerful device of subject-making and ethnification. I shall focus on the classifying, spatializing and hegemonizing effects produced by what I call, taking up on Foucault's approach on biopower and drawing on recent ethnographies of the neoliberal state, the multicultural governmentality. I shall finally contend that, closely intertwined with this new social engineering, indigenous counterhegemonic discourses, knowledges and practices are starting to emerge that fully contribute to the shaping of this new intercultural battlefield.

The remote science team, using only orbital and rover data sets, identified areas with a high potential for life as targets for further inspection by the rover. Orbital data in the visible/near infrared (VNIR) and in the thermal infrared (TIR) were used to examine the mineralogy, geomorphology, and chlorophyll potential of the field sites. Field instruments included two spectrometers (VNIR reflectance and TIR emission) and a neutron detector: this project represents the first time a neutron detector has been used as part of a “science‐blind” rover field test. Rover‐based spectroscopy was used to identify the composition of small scale features not visible in the orbital images and to improve interpretations of those data sets. The orbital and ground‐based data sets produced consistent results, suggesting that much of the field sites consist of altered volcanic terrains with later deposits of sulfates, quartz, and iron oxides. At one location (Site A), the ground‐based spectral data revealed considerably greater compositional diversity than was seen from the orbital view. One neutron detector transect provided insight into subsurface hydrogen concentrations, which correlated with life and surface features. The results presented here have implications for targeting strategies, especially for future Mars rover missions looking for potential habitats/paleohabitats.","We would like to thank Wendy Calvin, Phil Christensen, Jeff Johnson, Jack Mustard, and Hugh Kieffer for use of their co‐owned D&amp;P spectrometer in the 2003 and 2004 seasons; Paul Lucey and Keith Horton of U.H. for letting us use their D&amp;P in the 2005 season; Win Wadsworth of D&amp;P for real‐time trouble‐shooting of the instrument via e‐mail while we were in the field; Pedro Ramirez for help with hardware trouble‐shooting in the field; Carl Pilcher and Liz Williams of NASA HQ for help in coordinating permissions for the neutron experiment; Sean Brandenburg of Transgroup Worldwide Logistics for exceptional service in helping us get the Californium source shipped to Chile; Julio Bahuer Pizarro Maluenda of the Laboratorio de Investigación y Ensayes de Materiales Universidad Católica del Norte for assistance with the source after it arrived in Chile; the staff of the U.S. Embassy in Santiago for help in facilitating the neutron experiment; and Steve Ruff for the use of his zeolite spectral library.

Three major stages of Cu-Mo mineralization are observed. Following the barren hydrothermal stage 1, the stage 2 mineralization is characterized by quartz-anhydrite stockwork veins and breccias with chalcopyrite, bornite, and molybdenite. Both stages 1 and 2 are associated with pervasive potassic alteration. Quartz-anhydrite veins with chalcopyrite, bornite, and molybdenite associated with phyllic alteration represent stage 3 mineralization. Stage 4 mineralization, linked to the formation of the large Braden diatreme, is characterized by breccias and rare veins containing a lower temperature assemblage with tourmaline, sericite, and lesser tennantite, bornite, and chalcopyrite with late gypsum in local vugs. Ten fluid types are distinguished in this study based on petrographic and microthermometric criteria, such as phase proportions, daughter minerals, homogenization behavior, and salinity. The hydrothermal evolution across the stages of Cu deposition is characterized by the contraction of a vapor phase originating by phase separation during stage 2. Overall cooling of the system at pressures fluctuating around the two-phase fluid surface led to a transition from a two-phase fluid state dominated by vapor at ~410°C and 300 bars in stage 2, to a single-phase low-salinity fluid derived from cooling and contraction of magmatic vapor to a liquid, which dominates during stage 3 mineralization at <350°C and 200 bars. Copper mineralization mainly formed from the vapor phase and its low-salinity liquid derivatives, representing a large volume of fluid with an initially high Cu content (1.2 ± 0.4 wt % Cu). Copper sulfides precipitated upon cooling between 410° and 320°C, indicated by a drop of Cu/(Na + K + Mn + Fe) ratios of over four orders of magnitude through the evolution of the deposit from stage 2 to stage 4. The highest Mo concentrations occur in residual brines resulting from extreme boiling, as indicated by concurrent halite saturation. Recent geochronology (Cannell, 2005; Maksaev et al., 2004) suggests a relatively long-lived magmatic-hydrothermal system at El Teniente. Our fluid chemical data show no evidence for major crystal fractionation in a large fluid-generating upper-crustal magma chamber, because Cs/(Na + K + Mn + Fe) is constant from pre-ore to all syn-ore fluids. However, the initiation of copper mineralization was associated with a 4- to 10-fold increase in the concentration of Cu, Mo, Li, and Fe in the inferred main ore-forming input fluid, compared with pre-ore fluids of intermediate salinity and otherwise very similar major and trace-element ratios. These data indicate that injection from depth of an exceptionally Cu, Mo, Li, and, probably, also S-rich volatile phase into an already actively evolving upper-crustal magmatic-hydrothermal system triggered the formation of this unusually large and rich copper deposit.",,,Economic Geology,,,,2007-09-01,2007,,2007-09-01,102,6,1021-1045,Closed,Article,"Klemm, Leonhard M.; Pettke, Thomas; Heinrich, Christoph A.; Campos, Eduardo","Klemm, Leonhard M.

Particularmente para las universidades más antiguas o que poseen un marcado perfil investigador, y que se concentran más en su reputación y en la búsqueda del conocimiento, sin considerar su entorno más cercano. Sin embargo, las políticas públicas al respecto han empezado a cambiar. La posición nacional e internacional y el compromiso regional de las instituciones de educación superior ahora son considerados como complementos y existe un nuevo enfoque en la competitividad regional asociada a ellas y en los sistemas de innovación regional. Se espera que las instituciones de educación superior se comprometan con otros actores en la región, incluyendo a las empresas privadas y a los pequeños negocios. Asimismo, deben ofrecer oportunidades de educación continua y contribuir al desarrollo de empleos basados en el conocimiento, los cuales permitirán a los graduados encontrar empleos locales y permanecer en sus comunidades.¿Cómo pueden las instituciones de educación superior enfrentarse a este reto? La presente publicación explora un amplio abanico de medidas de políticas y reformas institucionales.

We sought to create biogeologic maps through survey traverses across the desert using a rover carrying biologic and geologic instruments. Elements of our science approach were to: Perform ecological transects from the relatively wet coastal range to the arid core of the desert; use converging evidence from science instruments to reach conclusions about microbial abundance; and develop and test exploration strategies adapted to the search of scattered surface and shallow subsurface microbial oases. Understanding the ability of science teams to detect and characterize microbial life signatures remotely using a rover became central to the project. Traverses were accomplished using an autonomous rover in a method that is technologically relevant to Mars exploration. We present an overview of the results of the 2003, 2004, and 2005 field investigations. They include: The confirmed identification of microbial habitats in daylight by detecting fluorescence signals from chlorophyll and dye probes; the characterization of geology by imaging and spectral measurement; the mapping of life along transects; the characterization of environmental conditions; the development of mapping techniques including homogeneous biological scoring and predictive models of habitat location; the development of exploration strategies adapted to the search for life with an autonomous rover capable of up to 10 km of daily traverse; and the autonomous detection of life by the rover as it interprets observations on‐the‐fly and decides which targets to pursue with further analysis.",The Life in the Atacama project was supported by the NASA Astrobiology Science and Technology for Exploring Planets (ASTEP) under grant NAG5‐12890.

We call this condition backward contraction. We show this condition is weaker than the Collet–Eckmann condition, and than the summability condition with exponent one. Our main result is a connecting lemma for backward-contracting rational maps, roughly saying that we can perturb a rational map to connect each critical orbit in the Julia set with an orbit that does not accumulate on critical points. The proof of this result is based on Thurston's algorithm and some rigidity properties of quasi-conformal maps. We also prove that the Lebesgue measure of the Julia set of a backward-contracting rational map is zero, when it is not the whole Riemann sphere.

Generic diagnoses are based on few characters that often have overlapping states among genera, complicating the understanding of the relationships within the group. The goals of this study are to illuminate the phylogenetic relationships among the genera of the Bodotriidae using morphological characters and to review the systematics of the family. For this purpose, all species within each genus were studied from the literature to code all the variability of genera for 109 variable morphological characters. Phylogenetic analyses show that there is independent reduction of the pleopods in two clades from a plesiomorphic state of five pairs, while the number of exopods of peraeopods has been reduced gradually in more derived groups of bodotriids. The subfamily Bodotriinae is the most derived and the Vaunthompsoniinae the most basal, and is paraphyletic with the Mancocumatinae embedded within it. No discriminatory characters were found between the subfamilies Mancocumatinae and Vaunthompsoniinae and they are not clearly separated in the phylogeny. Mancocumatinae is synonymized with Vaunthompsoniinae and all the genera of the former Mancocumatinae should be included within Vaunthompsoniinae. Analyses of character evolution justify a few other taxonomic changes. All genera were redescribed based on all the coded characters and a complete list of all valid species for each genus is included. Finally, dichotomous keys for identification to genus level are provided.","I thank the cumacean specialists who have helped improve and complete this revision.

                  In many discussions of globalization and growth, attention focuses on Asia, notably China, South Korea, and India. In contrast, this book looks at business developments in another key emerging market region, Latin America. It examines the success and failure of Latin American firms in their own markets and elsewhere in the world, the reasons behind these outcomes, and these firms' future prospects. Contributors to this book draw on concepts from organization theory, industrial organization, economics, marketing, sociology, and political science. The book includes sections on the broad themes of competitiveness in Latin America, micro-level strategies of firms in specific sectors, and the competitiveness of firms in specific countries and competing in emerging markets. The cases examined range in size and sector, and include some of the largest firms in Latin America, such as as Embraer in Brazil, Quiñenco (Luksic) in Chile, Techint in Argentina, Grupo Carso in Mexico, Cisneros in Venezuela, and Grupo Empresarial Antioqueño in Colombia.",,,,,"Robert Grosse, Luiz F.

Post-apartheid South Africa has succeeded in swiftly opening its economy to international trade and capital flows, and in stabilising the economy while achieving reasonably good growth performance, mainly driven by productivity gains. However, important socio-economic problems persist, especially unemployment, poverty and the exclusion of a large fraction of the population from the formal economy. The country is now in the middle of two more specifically economic transitions: i) responding to globalisation and ii) transforming the structure of the economy away from its former heavy dependence on primary resource production and associated commodity-based industries. In this context, enhancing innovation capabilities is key to a sustained improvement of living standards based on productivity-driven growth. This review assesses the national innovation system of South Africa from this perspective, identifying areas and means for improvement with an emphasis on the role of public research organisations and policies.",,,OECD Reviews of Innovation Policy,,,,2007-09-10,2007,,2007-09-10,,,,Closed,Edited Book,,,,,3,0,,0.99,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1107167201,44 Human Society; 4404 Development Studies; 4407 Policy and Administration,8 Decent Work and Economic Growth

Today’s increasingly global environment encourages reviewing the world-wide goals and practices of CP. The desire to promote collective well-being clearly transcends geographical boundaries. The goal of developing a global perspective and discourse between countries has been delayed by the lack of a single, accessible source for information. This book provides the first in-depth guide to global community psychology research and practice, history and development, theories and innovations, presented in one field-defining volume. Included are contributions from countries with long histories of oppression, social movements, and political turmoil; long-time democracies and former dictatorships. Fully-formed CP establishments compare with fledgling ventures into the field. The contributors document the complex relationships between CP and ideological currents, other strands of psychology and social science, cultural and historical traditions, and economic developments. The goals of this book are several: Promote international collaboration Enhance theory utilization and development Identify biases and barriers in the field Accrue critical mass for a discipline that is often marginalized Minimize the pervasive US-centric view of the field Practitioners and researchers will find in International Community Psychology new perspectives on the communities they serve. As a text for advanced and graduate-level courses, it depicts a robust field with a legitimate mission.

These developments emphasize the need for establishing a sounder foundation for collaborative networks, namely in terms of theoretical principles and formal models, capturing the concepts, entities, behaviors, and operations of the CNs, and developing technology-independent infrastructure architectures, tools and methodologies. As a new scientific discipline, research on different aspects of CNs is gaining momentum. As a result of many research projects and pilot applications, a large number of new challenges are identified everyday, in need of innovative solutions, which require holistic, multi-disciplinary approaches. This book contains a number of selected articles from PRO-VE 2007, the eighth Working Conference on Virtual Enterprises held in Guimarães, Portugal, which was sponsored by the International Federation for Information Processing (IFIP) and the Society of Collaborative Networks (SOCOLNET). PRO-VE is well known as the most focused scientific and technical conference on Collaborative Networks, offering a major opportunity for the presentation and discussion of the latest research developments and industrial practice case studies. In line with the vision of IFIP and SOCOLNET societies, the PRO-VE Conference offers a forum for collaboration and knowledge exchange among experts from different regions of the world. With the steady growth of the PRO-VE community, this platform has offered a base for consolidation of the foundation of Collaborative Networks. The articles included in this book represent a comprehensive overview of recent advances in various domains and lines of research and development on collaborative networks. There is a special emphasis on the CN topics related to trust aspects, performance and valuesystems, VO breeding environments, VO creation, e-contracting, collaborative architectures and frameworks, professional virtual communities, interoperability issues, business benefits, and case studies and applications in industry and services.

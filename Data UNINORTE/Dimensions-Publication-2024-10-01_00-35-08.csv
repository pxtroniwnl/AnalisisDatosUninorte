Information dealing with fatal cases is scarce. We herein describe three patients with Chickungunya infection who presented with multiple organ failure and died within 24h of admission. Two cases had positive anti-dengue IgM, but dengue coinfection was rejected based on the clinical features and results of real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. These cases illustrate the challenges of the diagnosis and management of severe Chikungunya infection.",,,Journal of Clinical Virology,,,"Aged; Antibodies, Viral; Chikungunya Fever; Chikungunya virus; Coinfection; Colombia; Dengue Virus; Fatal Outcome; Female; Hospitalization; Humans; Male; Multiple Organ Failure; Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction",2015-05-29,2015,2015-05-29,2015-08,69,,27-29,Closed,Article,"de la Hoz, Juan M.; Bayona, Brayan; Viloria, Samir; Accini, José L.; San Juan-Vergara, Homero; Viasus, Diego","de la Hoz, Juan M.

7443,pub.1002563454,10.1007/s11356-015-4153-z,25634366,,Assessment of the risk of failure of high voltage substations due to environmental conditions and pollution on insulators,"Pollution on electrical insulators is one of the greatest causes of failure of substations subjected to high levels of salinity and environmental pollution. Considering leakage current as the main indicator of pollution on insulators, this paper focuses on establishing the effect of the environmental conditions on the risk of failure due to pollution on insulators and determining the significant change in the magnitude of the pollution on the insulators during dry and humid periods. Hierarchical segmentation analysis was used to establish the effect of environmental conditions on the risk of failure due to pollution on insulators. The Kruskal-Wallis test was utilized to determine the significant changes in the magnitude of the pollution due to climate periods. An important result was the discovery that leakage current was more common on insulators during dry periods than humid ones. There was also a higher risk of failure due to pollution during dry periods. During the humid period, various temperatures and wind directions produced a small change in the risk of failure. As a technical result, operators of electrical substations can now identify the cause of an increase in risk of failure due to pollution in the area. The research provides a contribution towards the behaviour of the leakage current under conditions similar to those of the Colombian Caribbean coast and how they affect the risk of failure of the substation due to pollution.","Authors would like to thank to the Power System Research Group GISEL of the Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia, for their financial support to conduct this research. The authors also want to thank the company TRANSELCA S.A. E.S.P. to enable them to carry out research in one of its electrical substations. Special recognition is given to Engrs.

There is consensus that using a mobile phone while driving increases the risk of exposure to traffic accidents. The purpose of this research is to evaluate the drivers' behavior when they decide whether or not to use a mobile phone while driving. For that, a hybrid modeling approach that integrates a choice model with the latent variable ""risk perception"" was used. It was found that workers and individuals with the highest education level are more prone to use a mobile phone while driving than others. Also, ""risk perception"" is higher among individuals who have been previously fined and people who have been in an accident or almost been in an accident. It was also found that the tendency to use mobile phones while driving increases when the traffic speed reduces, but it decreases when the fine increases. Even though the urgency of the phone call is the most important explanatory variable in the choice model, the cost of the fine is an important attribute in order to control mobile phone use while driving.",,,Accident Analysis & Prevention,,,"Accidents, Traffic; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Automobile Driving; Cell Phone; Choice Behavior; Colombia; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Models, Psychological; Models, Statistical; Risk Factors; Socioeconomic Factors; Young Adult",2015-03-03,2015,2015-03-03,2015-05,78,,73-80,Closed,Article,"Márquez, Luis; Cantillo, Víctor; Arellana, Julián","Márquez, Luis (Universidad Pedagógica y Tecnológica de Colombia, Colombia); Cantillo, Víctor (Universidad del Norte, Colombia); Arellana, Julián (Universidad del Norte, Colombia)","Márquez, Luis (Pedagogical and Technological University of Colombia)","Márquez, Luis (Pedagogical and Technological University of Colombia); Cantillo, Víctor (Universidad del Norte); Arellana, Julián (Universidad del Norte)",28,3,0.68,6.0,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1013854861,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3509 Transportation, Logistics and Supply Chains",3 Good Health and Well Being

So far, only basic health care is provided. Here we analyzed the cancer mortality in this region as a first step towards epidemiological data for cancer prevention.
METHODS: We calculated the age-adjusted mortality rates according to world standard (AMRWs) for the major cancer sites in both males and females between 2003 and 2012, and estimated the differences between the capital and more central districts of Itapúa vs. remote districts.
RESULTS: There were about 2000 cancer deaths in the decade studied, with AMRWs for all malignancies of 90.9/100,000 in males from central vs. 49.1/100,000 in remote districts and 69.0/100,000 vs. 45.0/100,000 in women. Cancer was mentioned in 12.4% of all death certificates and outweighed mortality from certain infectious and parasitic diseases (3.6%). Cause of death was ill-defined in 19.6% of all death certificates, especially in remote regions and among the elderly. The part of cancer located in the uterus (47.8%) or cell type of neoplasm of the lymphatic or hematopoietic system (73.1%) were often not specified. The uterus (mainly the cervix) (C53-C55) was the leading cancer site in women with AMRWs of 17.2/100,000 in central and 14.0/100,000 in remote districts, followed by the breast. Lung and prostate were the leading cancer sites among men. The lung cancer mortality rate was 19.3/100,000 in the central region but 9.5/100,000 in remote districts. Although children comprised 36% of the population, only 24 death certificates listed cancer as cause of death in this decade.
CONCLUSIONS: Analysis of cancer mortality in this rural region of Paraguay, which lacks resources for diagnostics and care, revealed an already large number of cases, with higher rates in the central region than in remote districts. Lung and uterus (primarily the cervix) are common cancer sites and indicate the potential for prevention. However, the quality of the vital statistics needs to be improved. The true cancer burden is most likely underestimated, especially in remote regions and children.",,,Cancer Epidemiology,,,Aged; Child; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Neoplasms; Paraguay,2015-11-18,2015,2015-11-18,2016-02,40,,1-6,Closed,Article,"Codas, Manuel; Pesch, Beate; Adolphs, Madita; Madrazo, Carolina; Matthias, Cristian; Heinze, Evelyn; Taeger, Dirk; Behrens, Thomas; Chaux, Alcides; Brüning, Thomas","Codas, Manuel (Regional Hospital of Encarnación, National Itapúa University, Jorge Memmel/Independencia Nacional, Encarnación, Paraguay); Pesch, Beate (Institute for Prevention and Occupational Medicine of the German Social Accident Insurance, Institute of Ruhr University Bochum (IPA), Buerkle-de-la-Camp-Platz 1, 44789 Bochum, Germany); Adolphs, Madita (Institute for Prevention and Occupational Medicine of the German Social Accident Insurance, Institute of Ruhr University Bochum (IPA), Buerkle-de-la-Camp-Platz 1, 44789 Bochum, Germany); Madrazo, Carolina (Regional Hospital of Encarnación, National Itapúa University, Jorge Memmel/Independencia Nacional, Encarnación, Paraguay); Matthias, Cristian (Regional Hospital of Encarnación, National Itapúa University, Jorge Memmel/Independencia Nacional, Encarnación, Paraguay); Heinze, Evelyn (Institute for Prevention and Occupational Medicine of the German Social Accident Insurance, Institute of Ruhr University Bochum (IPA), Buerkle-de-la-Camp-Platz 1, 44789 Bochum, Germany); Taeger, Dirk (Institute for Prevention and Occupational Medicine of the German Social Accident Insurance, Institute of Ruhr University Bochum (IPA), Buerkle-de-la-Camp-Platz 1, 44789 Bochum, Germany); Behrens, Thomas (Institute for Prevention and Occupational Medicine of the German Social Accident Insurance, Institute of Ruhr University Bochum (IPA), Buerkle-de-la-Camp-Platz 1, 44789 Bochum, Germany); Chaux, Alcides (Universidad del Norte, Gral.

However, cultural aspects, personal values, and social structure may affect the way caregivers experience their role in different societies. The current study investigated the relationship between HRQOL and psychological factors using a cross-sectional design. The sample consisted of 102 informal caregivers of patients with dementia from Bogotá, Colombia, South America. Measures included the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) for depression, the Satisfaction with Life Scale (SWLS), the Zarit Burden Interview, and the Short Health Questionnaire (SF36) for HRQOL. Canonical correlations revealed that there was a significant relationship between caregivers’ mental health and HRQOL, such that caregivers with better satisfaction with life and less symptoms of depression had more vitality and better general health. There is a strong relationship between mental health and health-related quality of life in Colombian caregivers of dementia patients living in their country of origin. Specific aspects of mental health, including satisfaction with life and depression, need to be addressed in order to improve caregivers’ quality of life. Given that mental health care resources may be scarce in Latin American countries, culturally appropriate interventions should focus on preventing/treating depression and promote life satisfaction, as a way to improve their quality of life.",,,Journal of Cross-Cultural Gerontology,,,Adult; Aged; Caregivers; Colombia; Cross-Sectional Studies; Dementia; Depression; Female; Health Status Indicators; Humans; Male; Mental Health; Middle Aged; Personal Satisfaction; Psychiatric Status Rating Scales; Quality of Life; Socioeconomic Factors; Surveys and Questionnaires,2015-08-20,2015,2015-08-20,2015-12,30,4,393-408,Closed,Article,"Moreno, Jhon Alexander; Nicholls, Elizabeth; Ojeda, Natalia; De los Reyes-Aragón, Carlos José; Rivera, Diego; Arango-Lasprilla, Juan Carlos","Moreno, Jhon Alexander (Center for Interdisciplinary Research in Rehabilitation-Centre de Réadaptation Lucie-Bruneau, Montréal, Québec, Canada; Département de Psychologie, Centre de Recherche en Neuropsychologie et Cognition (CERNEC), Université de Montréal, Montréal, Québec, Canada); Nicholls, Elizabeth (Department of Psychology, Drexel University, Philadelphia, PA, USA); Ojeda, Natalia (Department of Psychology, University of Deusto, Bilbao, Spain); De los Reyes-Aragón, Carlos José (Department of Psychology, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); Rivera, Diego (Department of Psychology, University of Deusto, Bilbao, Spain); Arango-Lasprilla, Juan Carlos (Department of Psychology, University of Deusto, Bilbao, Spain; IKERBASQUE, Basque Foundation for Science Bilbao, Bilbao, Spain)","Moreno, Jhon Alexander (Centres Intégré Universitaires de Santé et de Services Sociaux; University of Montreal)","Moreno, Jhon Alexander (Centres Intégré Universitaires de Santé et de Services Sociaux; University of Montreal); Nicholls, Elizabeth (Drexel University); Ojeda, Natalia (University of Deusto); De los Reyes-Aragón, Carlos José (Universidad del Norte); Rivera, Diego (University of Deusto); Arango-Lasprilla, Juan Carlos (University of Deusto; Ikerbasque)",23,0,1.08,6.3,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1026084618,42 Health Sciences; 4203 Health Services and Systems; 4205 Nursing,3 Good Health and Well Being

METHODS: A descriptive study was conducted in which cases of maternal deaths in the department of La Guajira between 2010 and 2012 were analyzed, based on data from secondary sources. The difference in rates, rate ratio, population attributable risk percent, and Gini and concentration coefficients were calculated.
RESULTS: 54 maternal deaths were recorded, 61.1% of which were indigenous and 16.7% Afro-Colombians; the majority did not have any schooling (33.3%) or only primary schooling (29.6%). Inequalities in the difference of rates, rate ratio, and population attributable risk percent were calculated for La Guajira and other departments in the Caribbean region and in Colombia; however, the differences were not reflected in the Gini and concentration coefficients.
CONCLUSIONS: Maternal mortality was significantly higher in indigenous women than in non-indigenous women.

5084,pub.1079128908,,26245174,,Impact of contraception counseling on choice of combined hormonal methods in Colombia.,"OBJECTIVE: Determine the impact of informed contraceptive counseling on choice of contraceptive method.
METHODS: Multicenter descriptive study using before-and-after evaluation in nine cities in Colombia. Women considering use of self-administered combined hormonal methods at the time of consultation were invited to participate. They were asked about contraceptive method use and preference, following signing of informed consent. Later, they were given standardized medical advice on contraception and then asked again about contraceptive preference and reasons for their choice.
RESULTS: The study enrolled 858 women. At the beginning of the study, 538 (62.7%) women were using the combined pill and 281 (32.8%) were not using any contraceptive method. Before receiving counseling, women showed a preference for the pill (62.7%), followed by the intravaginal ring (28.4%), and transdermal patch (14%). After counseling, preferences were as follows: pill (40.8%), intravaginal ring (31.5%), and transdermal patch (11.3%). After counseling, 32.5%, 26.8%, and 7.5% of those considering the pill, patch, and ring, respectively, changed their intended choice. Region of origin, employment status, desire to conceive a child in the future, and having a stable relationship showed a statistical relationship to choice of method. However, age, number of children, and level of education were not determining factors.
CONCLUSIONS: Medical advice has an impact on choice of self-administered combined hormonal contraceptives, which helps women to use the method of their choice and improves adherence to the method in accordance with its particular conditions.",,,BULL PAN AM HEALTH ORGAN,,,"Administration, Intravaginal; Administration, Oral; Adolescent; Adult; Choice Behavior; Colombia; Consumer Behavior; Contraception Behavior; Contraceptives, Oral, Combined; Contraceptives, Oral, Hormonal; Counseling; Family Planning Services; Female; Humans; Middle Aged; Motivation; Self Administration; Tablets; Transdermal Patch; Young Adult",2015-06,2015,,2015-06,37,6,395-401,Closed,Article,"Gómez Sánchez, Pío; Lozano, Fidel; Velásquez, Andrés; Marrugo, Martha; Torres, Luz","Gómez Sánchez, Pío (Universidad Nacional de Colombia, Bogotá, Colombia, pigomezs@unal.edu.co.); Lozano, Fidel (Laboratorios Merck, MSD, Bogotá, Colombia.); Velásquez, Andrés (Universidad del Rosario, Bogotá, Colombia.); Marrugo, Martha (Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia.); Torres, Luz (Universidad Libre de Cali, Cali, Colombia.)",,"Gómez Sánchez, Pío (National University of Colombia); Lozano, Fidel (Laboratorios Merck, MSD, Bogotá, Colombia.); Velásquez, Andrés (Universidad del Rosario); Marrugo, Martha (Universidad del Norte); Torres, Luz (Universidad Libre de Cali, Cali, Colombia.)",2,0,,0.33,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1079128908,42 Health Sciences; 4206 Public Health,3 Good Health and Well Being

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We explore this association through the skeletal remains of 48 individuals interred at the cemetery of Larache using bioarchaeological, biogeochemical, and artifactual evidence. Data from cranial modification practices, violent injury, and the mortuary assemblage are used to explore culturally constructed elements of status and identity, radiogenic strontium isotope analyses provide us with a perspective on the geographic origins of these individuals, and stable carbon and nitrogen analyses allow discussion of paleodiet and access to resources.
RESULTS: Radiogenic strontium isotope values show the presence of multiple first generation migrants at Larache. Stable carbon and nitrogen isotope data reveal significant differences among individuals. The mortuary context reveals a standard pattern for the oases but also includes a series of unusual burials with abundant gold and few other objects. Interestingly, both local and nonlocal individuals with different head shapes had access to the differentiated burial context; however nonlocal individuals appear to be the only ones with a heavily maize-based diet.
CONCLUSIONS: Our evidence shows that Larache served as a burial place for a diverse, yet culturally integrated and potentially elite segment of the Atacameño population, but not a foreign enclave as had been postulated.","The authors would like to thank Blair Daverman, Laura King, and William Whitehead for their invaluable contributions during data collection.

Archaeological evidence tends to support the idea that the period under the influence of the altiplano (high plane) empire was very affluent. Here we investigate the possibility that this affluence had a positive impact on the health status of the Atacameneans, using the oral health as an indirect indicator of quality of life. Dental decay, dental abscess, dental wear, linear enamel hypoplasia, periodontal disease and dental calculus were analyzed on 371 skeletons from 12 sites from San Pedro de Atacama oases. We believe that if, indeed, there were better biological conditions during the altiplano influence, this could have been caused by the access to a more diversified food intake promoted by the intensification of the trading network established by Tiwanaku in the central-south Andes, of which San Pedro de Atacama became an important node.","AcknowledgmentsThe authors thank Mark Hubbe, Cristina Torres-Rouff and the entire team of Gustavo Le Paige Archaeological Museum for guidance and collaboration in data collection that allowed the execution of this work.

Menopause symptoms and management are greatly influenced by socioeconomic status in addition to genetic background and medical history. Because of their very unique cultural heritage and often holistic view of health and well-being, menopause symptoms and management might differ greatly in aboriginals compared to non-aboriginals. Our aim was to investigate the extent and scope of the current literature in describing the menopause experience of aboriginal women. Our systematic literature review included nine health-related databases using the keywords 'menopause' and 'climacteric symptoms' in combination with various keywords describing aboriginal populations. Data were collected from selected articles and descriptive analysis was applied. Twenty-eight relevant articles were included in our analysis. These articles represent data from 12 countries and aboriginal groups from at least eight distinctive geographical regions. Knowledge of menopause and symptom experience vary greatly among study groups. The average age of menopause onset appears earlier in most aboriginal groups, often attributed to malnutrition and a harsher lifestyle. This literature review highlights a need for further research of the menopause transition period among aboriginal women to fully explore understanding and treatment of menopause symptoms and ultimately advance an important dialogue about women's health care.",The authors declare that there is no conflict of interest regarding the publication of this paper.

3544,pub.1040447004,10.1108/ijph-11-2014-0042,26277922,,Psychotherapy and despair in the prison setting,"PURPOSE: The purpose of this paper is to outline research which aimed to explore psychotherapists' experience of working with despair, in the UK prison setting, through a qualitative phenomenological approach. Within the forensic psychological literature, despair is considered a pathology, associated with suicide and self-harm, resulting from the prisoners histories and the coercive prison setting. In turn, therapeutic writings outline the importance of therapy in the prison setting with despair in providing coping skills, containment and learning opportunities for the prisoners involved.
DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH: Within the study, ten psychotherapists were interviewed as to their experience of working with clients in despair in the prison setting. The data were analysed via the phenomenological research method Empirical Phenomenological Analysis (EPA), and a secondary analysis through reverie.
FINDINGS: Through the analysis by EPA, despair emerged in the prison setting as a destabilising phenomenon to which there was no protocol for working with it. Participants also described the prisoners' despair and the despairing prison setting, touching on their own sense of vulnerability and despair. However, drawing on the secondary analysis by reverie, the researcher also became aware of how the phenomenon of despair emerged not simply through the said, but also through the intersubjective.
ORIGINALITY/VALUE: It was therefore through the secondary analysis by reverie that the importance of the attendance to aspects of intersubjectivity in prison research emerged. This paper contributes to the therapeutic writings on despair in the prison setting, alongside holding implications for qualitative research in the prison setting.",,,International Journal of Prisoner Health,,,"Attitude of Health Personnel; Burnout, Professional; Clinical Competence; Criminal Psychology; Depressive Disorder; Humans; Prisoners; Prisons; Professional-Patient Relations; Psychotherapy; United Kingdom",2015-09-21,2015,,2015-09-21,11,3,141-156,Closed,Article,"Gee, Joanna; Loewenthal, Del; Cayne, Julia","Gee, Joanna (HMP YOI Holloway, London, UK.); Loewenthal, Del (University of Roehampton, London, UK.); Cayne, Julia (University of Roehampton, London, UK.)",,"Gee, Joanna (HMP YOI Holloway, London, UK.); Loewenthal, Del (University of Roehampton); Cayne, Julia (University of Roehampton)",4,0,0.17,1.13,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1040447004,44 Human Society; 4402 Criminology,

METHOD: Data used were from the 2010 Colombian National Demographic and Health Survey; 40,392 women reported whether they have had a Pap test. A multilevel mixed logistic regression model was developed with random intercepts to account for clustering by neighbourhood and municipality. The model evaluated whether having a rural/urban area of residence modified the effect of identified risk factors and if the prevalence of no education at the neighbourhood level acted as a contextual effect.
RESULTS: Most women (87.3%) reported having at least one Pap test. Women from lower socioeconomic quintiles (p=0.002), who were unemployed (p<0.001), and whose final health decisions depended on others (p<0.001) were less likely to have had a Pap test. Women with children were more likely to have had the test (p<0.001), and the effects of education (p=0.03), type of health insurance (p=0.01), age (p<0.001), and region (p<0.001) varied with having a rural/urban area of residence. Women living in rural areas (specifically younger ones, with no health insurance, living in the Atlantic and Amazon-Orinoquía regions, and with no education) were less likely to have had a Pap test when compared to those living in urban areas. Furthermore, women living in a neighbourhood with a higher prevalence of no education were less likely to have ever had a Pap test (p=0.005).
CONCLUSIONS: In Colombia, the probability of having had a Pap test is associated with personal attributes, area of residence, and prevalence of no education in the neighbourhood. Efforts to improve access to cervical cancer screening should focus on disadvantaged women with limited education, low socioeconomic status, and no health insurance or subsidised insurance, especially those in rural/isolated areas.","AcknowledgmentsThe authors thank Profamilia Colombia and the U.S. Agency for International Development that facilitated access to the 2010 NDHS data.

In the facilitated active learning (FAL) approach, tutors engage students and are expected to enable and balance both active learning and progression through laboratory objectives. In contrast, the emphasized independent learning (EIL) approach stresses elements from the ""flipped classroom"" educational model: prelaboratory preparation, independent laboratory learning, and limited tutor involvement. Quantitative (Likert-style questions) and qualitative data (independent thematic analysis of open-ended commentary) from a survey of students who had completed the preclerkship curriculum identified strengths from the EIL (promoting student collaboration and communication) and FAL (successful progression through objectives) approaches. However, EIL led to student frustration related to a lack of direction and impaired completion of objectives, whereas active learning opportunities in FAL were highly variable and dependent on tutor teaching style. A ""hidden curriculum"" was also identified, where students (particularly EIL and clerkship students) commonly compared their compressed anatomy education or their anatomy learning environment with other approaches. Finally, while both groups highly regarded the efficiency of prosection-based learning and expressed value for cadaveric-based learning, student commentary noted that the lack of grade value dedicated to anatomy assessment limited student accountability. This study revealed critical insights into small group learning in compressed anatomy education, including the need to balance student active learning opportunities with appropriate direction and feedback (including assessment).",,,Anatomical Sciences Education,,,"Anatomy; Education, Medical; Group Processes; Humans; Learning",2015-06-03,2015,2015-06-03,2016-01,9,1,40-51,Closed,Article,"Whelan, Alexander; Leddy, John J.; Mindra, Sean; Hughes, J.D.

This study was conducted in the Alacrán gold-mining site, one of the most important ASGM sites in Colombia, to identify native plant species growing in Hg-contaminated soils used for agricultural purposes, and to assess their potential as phytoremediation systems. Twenty-four native plant species were identified and analysed for total Hg (THg) in different tissues (roots, stems, and leaves) and in underlying soils. Accumulation factors (AF) in the shoots, translocation (TF) from roots to shoots, and bioconcentration (BCF) from soil-to-roots were determined. Different tissues from all plant species were classified in the order of decreasing accumulation of Hg as follows: roots > leaves > stems. THg concentrations in soil ranged from 230 to 6320 ng g(-1). TF values varied from 0.33 to 1.73, with high values in the lower Hg-contaminated soils. No correlation was found between soils with low concentrations of Hg and plant leaves, indicating that TF is not a very accurate indicator, since most of the Hg input to leaves at ASGM sites comes from the atmosphere. On the other hand, the BCF ranged from 0.28 to 0.99, with Jatropha curcas showing the highest value. Despite their low biomass production, several herbs and sub-shrubs are suitable for phytoremediation application in the field, due to their fast growth and high AF values in large and easily harvestable plant parts. Among these species, herbs such as Piper marginathum and Stecherus bifidus, and the sub-shrubs J. curcas and Capsicum annuum are promising native plants with the potential to be used in the phytoremediation of soils in tropical areas that are impacted by mining.","AcknowledgementsTo the University of Córdoba, the Laboratory of Toxicology and Environmental Management; COLCIENCIAS, for financing the project: “Removal of mercury in soils by plants that grow in lands contaminated with metal (El Alacrán mine in the Department of Córdoba and Santa Cruz mine in the Department of Bolívar)”, identified with the code 111248925604 and contract number 472-2009.

There are currently two methods for characterizing wheel load repetitions: equivalent single axle load (ESAL) and load spectra, which is a more precise characterization of traffic but relies on the same input data used to calculate ESALs. Although the load spectra are described using a bimodal mixture distribution, samples taken in Colombia indicate that the load spectra exhibit an intermediate region that can be modelled with an additional distribution. This research proposes the use of a mixture of three distributions: two log-normal distributions for the description of the peaks and a normal distribution for the intermediate region, finding a closed statistical solution for the formal evaluation of its properties, and deduces the expression of the nth moment that facilitates obtaining important features of the proposed distribution. In a case of application in two geographic regions of Colombia, with more than 53,000 tandem and tridem observed axles, it was found that the proposed model effectively improves the characterization of the load spectra.","The authors are grateful to the Atlantic Department Government and the Colombian General Royalties System, for having partially financed this work through the Project LOGPORT, BPIN20120001001911050672 (Agreement No. 0103-2013-000016), in relation to the data analysis of the Caribbean Colombian region.

A Colombian Case Study,"During the last several years a dynamic transformation has been taking place at the northern city fringe of Barranquilla, Colombia: shopping malls, gated communities and gated tower buildings have been built — a process very similar to other Latin American cities. The aim of this article is to reveal the underlying planning approaches and explain the role and influence of the private and public actors involved. This work contributes to the discussion on formal and informal practices of urban development in the global South and shows the blurring borders between the ‘formal’ and the ‘informal’. The main finding of the analysis is the coherence between the interests of the landowning company, the official land-use plan and the actually implemented projects. This coherence was achieved through the massive influence of private interests in public planning and a multitude of informal arrangements between the landowner and the public authorities. This form of urban planning is described as ‘arranged urbanism’ and stands in a tradition of similar forms of spatial development in Latin America. Nevertheless, forms of ‘arranged urbanism’ can also be found outside of the Latin American context.",,"The article was realized in projects financed by the DIDI — Dirección de Investigación, Desarrollo e Innovación de la Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla and the DAAD — German Academic Exchange Service.

To characterize the social practices regarding the right to childhood protection as well as the cognitions and social norms that support them, on the part of the boys, girls, teenagers, parental figures and teachers in the Atlantic region. The study used focus groups with boys, girls, teenagers, parental figures, and teachers to identify both the social practices linked to this right and the cognitions and social norms that support these practices. The information was processed by performing a content analysis with Atlas.ti software (version 7, Scientific Software Development GmbH, Berlin, Germany). The results obtained for all populations indicate that there are social conventions that underpin the social practices that jeopardize the right to childhood protection.

Consequently, an engineering education must develop the necessary knowledge, skills, and attitudes to find viable, desirable, and feasible sustainable solutions. One of the main challenges in engineering education, however, is the identification of an appropriate model to educate students in the area of sustainability. The aim of this paper is to develop a methodology based on the case study approach that effectively exposes students to knowledge, skills, and attitudes required for decision making attuned to the multi-dimensional contexts (environmental, social, and economic) of sustainability challenges. There are two key pedagogy-based deliverables: 1) an active learning approach that requires students to work on virtual teams comprised of students throughout the Americas to solve the case study modules and 2) the case study lessons that can be applied longitudinally throughout an engineering curriculum.

The effects of exchange and correlation have been considered by means of the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) with the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof parametrization. In addition, the Tran–Blaha-modified Becke–Johnson potential (TB-mBJ) was applied to give a better description of the band-gap energies and optical spectra. The lattice parameters, bulk modulus, and band-gap energy show nonlinear dependence on concentration x. Results for rock-salt Yx$$_x$$Al1-x$$_{1-x}$$N alloys show that the band gap undergoes an indirect (Γ→X$$\Gamma \rightarrow X$$)-to-direct (Γ→Γ$$\Gamma \rightarrow \Gamma $$) transition at a given yttrium composition, followed by a direct (Γ→Γ$$\Gamma \rightarrow \Gamma $$)-to-indirect (Γ→X$$\Gamma \rightarrow X$$) transition in a higher yttrium concentration. For wurtzite Yx$$_x$$Al1-x$$_{1-x}$$N alloys, the band gap presents a direct (Γ→Γ$$\Gamma \rightarrow \Gamma $$)-to-indirect (M→Γ$$M\rightarrow \Gamma $$) transition at a given yttrium composition, followed by an indirect (M→Γ$$M\rightarrow \Gamma $$)-to-indirect (M→Σ$$M\rightarrow \Sigma $$) transition in a higher yttrium concentration. The real dielectric function, imaginary dielectric function, refractive index, and extinction coefficient were calculated using the TB-mBJ potential. Using a regular solution model, slightly lower mixing enthalpies for wurtzite Yx$$_x$$Al1-x$$_{1-x}$$N alloys were found. The mixing enthalpy for a given concentration differs depending on structures, and on the interaction between atoms of constituents. The effect of temperature on the volume, bulk modulus, Debye temperature, and the heat capacity for Yx$$_x$$Al1-x$$_{1-x}$$N alloys was analyzed using the quasi-harmonic Debye model.

At San Pedro de Atacama, in northern Chile, snuff trays that exhibit iconographic motifs similar to those found on Tiwanaku megalithic monuments have been assigned to the Tiwanaku style. In the present work, we propose a new definition for this style based on the occurrence of three morphological features: an overall trapezoidal shape, incurving sides, and sharp top corners. This group includes trays with iconography from the previously defined Tiwanaku style, as well as other trays without iconography. Principal component analysis shows that Tiwanaku-style trays with and without iconography make up a single group that is significantly different from plain, largely rectangular San Pedro-style trays. The relative proportion of Tiwanaku-style trays with and without iconography does not differ between cultural periods and archaeological sites. The results point to shape as an important trait for assigning trays to styles. Furthermore, the results show that during the Middle period four main types of snuff trays were in use: Tiwanaku trays with and without iconography and local San Pedro trays, also with and without iconography. We explore the possible social implications of this co-occurrence of styles.
Resumen Las tabletas de inhalación son objetos arqueológicos conspicuos de San Pedro de Atacama (norte de Chile); aquellas que exhiben motivos iconográficos inspirados en los monumentos megaliticos de Tiwanaku han sido adscritas al estilo Tiwanaku. En este trabajo se propone una nueva definición de este estilo que incluye la presencia simultdnea en las tabletas de tres caracteres morfológicos: forma trapezoidal, lados aproximadamente hiperbólicos y esquinas superiores agudas. Este nuevo grupo de tabletas incluye todas aquellas definidaspreviamente como de estilo Tiwanaku (con iconografia) y agrega un conjunto de tabletas sin iconografia Tiwanaku. Un anãlisis de componentes principales mostró que las tabletas de estilo Tiwanaku con y sin iconografia constituyen un grupo único, significativamente distinto del grupo de tabletas esencialmente rectangulares de estilo San Pedro. La proporción de tabletas Tiwanaku con y sin iconografía no difirió entre distintos períodos culturales y distintos sitios arqueológicos. Los resultados señalan que la forma es un criterio importante para la asignacion de las tabletas de inhalacion a estilos. Adicionalmente, los resultados indican que durante el Período Medio cuatro tipos de tabletas fueron preferentemente empleados por la población local: tabletas de estilo Tiwanaku con y sin iconografia y tabletas del estilo local San Pedro, también con y sin iconografía.

Electronic structure calculations have been performed for ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic states of NixAl1−xN (x = 0.056 and 0.0625) by GGA and GGA+U schemes. It has been found that the GGA+U method increases the repulsion of the impurity bands in the gap of semiconductors. The magnetic moment of the atom impurity in NixAl1−xN (x = 0.056 and 0.0625) is higher than those of the anions bonded to it for both GGA and GGA+U. Ni (N) contributions to the magnetic moment of NixAl1−xN (x = 0.056 and 0.0625) decrease (increase) in NiN4 tetrahedron when using GGA+U. A magnetic moment per Ni atom of about 2.10 μB is predicted in NixAl1−xN for x = 0.056 with GGA approach for the most stable system. However, it was found that the ground state nature for NixAl1−xN (x = 0.056 and 0.625) changes from ferromagnetic to antiferromagnetic with the GGA+U approach for the Ni-Ni closest configuration. On the contrary, for the Ni-Ni farthest configuration both GGA and GGA+U formalisms predict a ferromagnetic ground state for NixAl1−xN (x = 0.056 and 0.0625). For intermediate Ni-Ni distances, both GGA and GGA+U schemes present almost the same energy differences and the same ferromagnetic ground state. The ferromagnetic ground state originates from the strong hybridization between Ni-d and N-p states. Additionally, it was found that the GGA+U formalism increases the magnetic moment per Ni atom for all NixAl1−xN (x = 0.056) ferromagnetic states.","The research published in this paper was supported by Division de Investigación, Desarrollo e Innovación (DIDI) of Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia.

Results from the Gladar Multinational Cohort,"Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic inflammatory disease characterized by synovial inflammation leading to both cartilage destruction and bone erosions. Early identification of patients with RA, and in particular those with erosive course of the disease would allow a timely therapeutic strategy for cartilage and bone protection. To investigate the degree of agreement between local expert rheumatologists and central trained readers in the detection of erosions (presence/absence) on plain radiographs of hands and feet. Patients with early RA (<1 year symptoms) were included in the multinational Latin American RA (GLADAR) cohort (46 participating centers in 14 Latin American countries). A set of baseline hands and feet radiographs were read by two trained readers (radiologist and rheumatologists) in a radiology center in Mexico City, who centrally scored baseline radiographs according to the Sharp/van der Heijde score, erosion 0-280 scale. The same set of radiographs have been rated as erosive/non erosive locally and the fulfilment of radiographic changes criteria for the classification of RA 1987 at baseline had been registered. Agreements and misclassification were calculated (kappa values). From 1069 patients in the GLADAR cohort, there were 516 RA patients with hands and feet radiographs available for standardized radiographic scoring system. According to local and central reading 137 patients (26.6%) and 276 patients (53.5%) displayed erosions, respectively. Agreement between local and central reading was poor (kappa =0.171). From a total of 525 patients with hands radiographs available for standardized scoring, according to local reading 153 (29.1%) fulfilled the radiographic changes criteria RA 1987, whereas central reading showed that 227 (43.2%) presented hand erosions. Again, agreement was poor (kappa =0.120). In patients with early RA trained readers and local rheumatologists agreed poorly on the recognition of erosions. This is relevant as therapeutic decisions may change in the presence of erosions and indicate the necessity of more/better training for radiologists/rheumatologists in evaluating articular damage in RA in LA.

1747,pub.1061786748,10.1109/tsc.2014.2299547,,,Network and QoS-Based Selection of Complementary Services,"Composite services are widely popular for solving complex problems where the required QoS levels are often demanding. The composite service that provides the best utility while meeting the QoS requirements has to be found. This paper proposes a network model where many complementary candidates could be selected for each service class to improve the benefits, while the conventional model limits the selection to a single service candidate or service level per service class. The selection of services step is NP-hard because it can be reduced to a multi-constraint knapsack problem. Yet, the decision has to be reached rapidly so that it does not increase the overall workflow time. Large-size networks and problems with high restriction levels (strong QoS requirements) are the most problematic. Traditional multiple-constrained-shortest-path (MCSP) heuristics are improved in this paper using the novel concept “potential feasibility”. When our modified MCSP heuristic algorithms are compared to the CPLEX solver, one of them demonstrates a significantly smaller average runtime. Further, it provides solutions within a 2.6 percent optimality gap on average for small networks, and a 10 percent optimality gap on average for large networks, regardless of the restriction level. Our algorithm uses a general utility function, not derived from the QoS parameters.",,,IEEE Transactions on Services Computing,,,,2015-02-03,2015,2015-02-03,,8,1,79-91,Closed,Article,"Llinas, Guisselle A.

Samples were taken monthly for 2 years in Oura Bay, Japan, using a combination of bait and refuge traps. Breeding was seasonal but extended from spring through autumn, with female-phase individuals (FPs) producing broods successively, with their ovaries maturing for a new spawn during incubation of a previous brood. Females incubated numerous (∼500-4000) embryos that suffered insignificant mortality before hatching. Recruitment of juveniles after planktonic larval development began in summer and peaked during the autumn, with negligible recruitment during winter and spring. Cohort analysis confirmed the hypothesis of protandric sex change in this species, with juveniles maturing into the male phase (MP) during their first reproductive season at an age of 6-10 mon, depending on the time of recruitment. Sex change occurred during the following winter when transitional individuals matured into FPs during their second reproductive season at an age of ≥18 mon. Two cohorts were followed from recruitment until the end of the study, indicating a life span of 21-25 mon.

1702,pub.1016813185,10.1002/jqs.2779,,,A climatic trigger for catastrophic Pleistocene–Holocene debris flows in the Eastern Andean Cordillera of Colombia,"The geomorphology and stratigraphy of massive debris flows on the Eastern Andean Cordillera, Colombia, indicate two distinct deposits can be recognized. The lower Chinauta deposit covers 14 km2 and has a thickness of ∼60 m, whereas the upper Fusagasugá deposit covers 20 km2 and has a thickness of ∼20 m. The lower Chinauta section consists of matrix‐supported gravels, with isolated boulders and massive to moderately bedded structure and local inverse grading. The upper section displays sequences of inversely graded, clast‐supported gravels, with boulders >2 m in axial length, capped by massive, matrix‐supported fine gravels. The latter are dissected by coarse, channelized gravels. We interpret these facies as a series of debris and hyper‐concentrated flows dissected by river channels. The Fusagasugá deposit is dominated by massive to inversely graded matrix‐supported gravels with isolated boulders. Single‐grain, optically stimulated luminescence dates of the sandy–silty matrix of debris and hyper‐concentrated flows constrain the timing of deposition of the Chinauta debris flow deposits between 38.9 and 8.7 ka. We postulate that millennial‐scale climate variability is responsible for causing these massive debris flows, through a combination of elevated temperatures and increased rainfall that triggered runoff and sediment transport.","N.H. was supported by grants from Fundación para la Promoción de la Investigación y la Tecnología del Banco de la República (grant 2655), Colciencias (Fondo para la Ciencia, la Tecnología y la Innovación) and Universidad del Norte (internal research grant).

This study contributes to the Transformative Service Research agenda by understanding stigmatized service consumption practices and their effect on the well-being of these consumers; this has not been fully addressed until now. Additionally, it is shown that understanding the relations among consumers, communities, and informal service offerings results in the design of services with unintentional positive effects on well-being at individual, collective, and relational levels. Findings show that informal service offerings are non-discriminatory, hassle-free, jargon-free, and reputation-based. These findings pave the way to further explore such complex contexts to better understand the impact of service design on the well-being of such consumers.

We present detrital zircon U–Pb data encompassing the Palaeozoic era in northern Chile and northwestern Argentina. Cathodoluminescence images reveal dominantly magmatic zircon barely affected by abrasion and displaying only one growth phase. The main age clusters for these zircon grains are Ediacaran to Palaeozoic with an additional peak at 1.3–0.9 Ga and they can be correlated with ‘Grenvillian’ age, and the Brasiliano, Pampean, and Famatinian orogenies. The zircon data reveal main transport from the nearby Ordovician Famatinian arc and related rocks. The Silurian sandstone units are more comparable with Cambrian units, with Brasiliano and Transamazonian ages (2.2–1.9 Ga) being more common, because the Silurian deposits were situated within or east of the (extinct) Famatinian arc. Hence, the arc acted as a transport barrier throughout Palaeozoic time. The complete suite of zircon ages does not record the accretions of exotic terranes or the Palaeozoic glacial periods. We conclude that the transport system along the palaeo-Pacific margin of Gondwana remained stable for c . 0.3 byr and that provenance data do not necessarily reflect the interior of a continent. Hence, inherited geomorphological features must be taken into account when detrital mineral ages are interpreted.

This article questions de Soto’s institutional economist account. It draws on a 14-month ethnographic study performed at two rural field sites in Colombia and in the central government office responsible for promoting land programmes designed to improve the living conditions of rural communities. This study, which focuses on the daily practices of public officials and rural campesinos, suggests the importance of the title document, and in particular the public deed, for land ownership. It describes the process by which landownership is created by the issuance of the land title document and highlights some important elements and untended consequences that are often neglected in this process of making land a legal and economic asset.","The author would like to thank the participants at the faculty workshop ‘The Public and Private, beyond Distinction’, which took place at Cornell Law School in September 2012.

It is usually explained by the impact of student attributes; however, recent developments in student success literature point to the need of exploring institutional practices that may impact a student's decision to abandon their studies. The current weight of academic quality assurance for Colombian higher education institutions (HEI) and what such measures may mean for how HEI fulfill their missions indicates the need to consider a possible relation between such quality measures and undergraduate student attrition. Using official databases from the Colombian Ministry of Education for the year 2009, this study explores through analysis of variance the relationship between attrition and three measures of academic quality: accreditation status, professional test scores required to graduate (Saber Pro Exam) and the number of research groups at HEI. The scope of the study is the Colombian Caribbean region and the sample includes 19 HEI. Study results demonstrate that the percentage of accredited undergraduate programs at HEI was the only measure of quality assurance, out of the three explored, that showed a statistically significant relationship with undergraduate student attrition rates.",,,Higher Education Research & Development,,,,2015-05-05,2015,2015-05-05,2015-11-02,34,6,1192-1206,Closed,Article,"Martínez, Anabella; Borjas, Mónica; Herrera, Mariela; Valencia, Jorge","Martínez, Anabella (Department of Education, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); Borjas, Mónica (Department of Education, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); Herrera, Mariela (Department of Education, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); Valencia, Jorge (Department of Education, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia)","Martínez, Anabella (Universidad del Norte)","Martínez, Anabella (Universidad del Norte); Borjas, Mónica (Universidad del Norte); Herrera, Mariela (Universidad del Norte); Valencia, Jorge (Universidad del Norte)",10,1,,3.75,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1015420033,"39 Education; 3902 Education Policy, Sociology and Philosophy; 3903 Education Systems",4 Quality Education

The role of violence as a predictor of sexual debut was studied, in a context of predictors borrowed from social cognition models. Data were taken from cluster-randomized trials of school-based HIV prevention interventions in three sites in South Africa and Tanzania. Analyses consisted of descriptive statistics and multi-group structural equation modelling. The basic model functioned fairly well for Cape Town, but less well for Mankweng and Dar es Salaam (low R2 values). Attitudes were the strongest predictor of intention. Adding socio-demographic variables to the model did not reduce the associations much and neither did subsequent inclusion of violence. Sexual debut was strongly associated with victimization; adding violence also substantially increased R2 for sexual debut. Besides social cognition factors, intimate partner violence should be addressed in future research on reproductive health interventions for adolescents.","The full title of the project was:“Promoting sexual and reproductive health.

The succession is composed of laminated clay, organic-rich laminae, sand beds and buried soils. These buried soils range in thickness from 2 to 16 cm and are composed of silty clay with varying degrees of root bioturbation and have a gray-green-bluish color. They could classify as Entisols and in this article we refer to them as paleosols. Samples from each of these sediment types (except sand), and samples from two modern-analog environments, also on the proximal part of the Cauca River, i.e. sediment from a seasonally flooded pond and the upper-most layer of a modern soil, were analyzed for organic matter content. Prior to selection of an organic matter extraction method, four protocols were tested on the modern pond sediment sample. A modified protocol involving flotation with ZnCl2 proved to be the best method for these sediment types. We produced an atlas of the main taxa and their relative proportions found in this study and propose this method as an excellent approach to environmental reconstruction of fluvial environments. Very little work has been done on fluvio-palustrine palynofacies in the Neotropics.","We thank the Colloids Research Group at the University of Antioquia and Director Dr. Herley Casanova, for unconditional support and use of laboratory facilities, and suggestions for protocols to extract organic matter.

The aim of the controller is to maintain a near-optimal voltage profile in the transmission network by coordinating discrete reactive power (var) control devices in the system. The controller is targeted for implementation in electric power transmission utility companies where most of the voltage controls are coordinated by switching of discrete var devices such as shunt capacitor and reactor banks and transformer banks load tap changers (LTCs). By effectively dividing the controller responsibilities between local substation controls and a central coordinator at control center level, the design is aimed at voltage control of large-scale power systems. At local level, the substation controllers maintain their respective substation bus voltages by local power-flow-like computations using mostly local PMU measurements. The central coordinator computes and provides the voltage set-points to the substation controllers and also coordinates by enabling or disabling the local controllers as needed. The controller is being designed towards prototype implementation in Southern California Edison (SCE), starting with local controllers at specific substations in the first stage. It is tested on real-time dynamic models and large-scale power-flow simulations of SCE transmission network.",,,IEEE Transactions on Power Systems,,,,2015-12-21,2015,2015-12-21,,31,1,397-411,Closed,Article,"Venkatasubramanian, Vaithianathan; Guerrero, Javier; Su, Jingdong; Chun, Hong; Zhang, Xun; Habibi-Ashrafi, Farrokh; Salazar, Armando; Abu-Jaradeh, Backer","Venkatasubramanian, Vaithianathan (Sch. of Electr.

Two major findings provide new insights into the Neogene history of this Cocinetas Basin: (1) a formal re-description of the Jimol and Castilletes formations, including a revised contact; and (2) the description of a new lithostratigraphic unit, the Ware Formation (Late Pliocene). We conducted extensive fieldwork to develop a basin-scale stratigraphy, made exhaustive paleontological collections, and performed 87Sr/86Sr geochronology to document the transition from the fully marine environment of the Jimol Formation (ca. 17.9–16.7 Ma) to the fluvio-deltaic environment of the Castilletes (ca. 16.7–14.2 Ma) and Ware (ca. 3.5–2.8 Ma) formations. We also describe evidence for short-term periodic changes in depositional environments in the Jimol and Castilletes formations. The marine invertebrate fauna of the Jimol and Castilletes formations are among the richest yet recorded from Colombia during the Neogene. The Castilletes and Ware formations have also yielded diverse and biogeographically significant fossil vertebrate assemblages. The revised lithostratigraphy and chronostratigraphy presented here provides the necessary background information to explore the complete evolutionary and biogeographic significance of the excellent fossil record of the Cocinetas Basin.","The Smithsonian Institution, the National Geographic Society, the Anders Foundation, Gregory D. and Jennifer Walston Johnson, Universidad del Norte, lab of Marcelo R.

The investigation was conducted by 3D finite element analysis (FEA) and strain gauge test.Materials and methodsSix models were generated, with MOD cavities and endodontic treatment: A (MOD amalgam restoration), R (MOD composite restoration), AL (A + cervical lesion (L)), RL, ALR (A + cervical lesion restored with composite (LR)), and RLR. Each model underwent two compressive loading (100N): axial and oblique—45° angle to the long axis on the buccal cusp. The models were analyzed by von Mises criteria. For strain gauge test, 14 standardized maxillary premolars were treated according to the groups described for FEA. Two strain gauges were bonded on each sample submitted to compressive loading in a mechanical testing machine.ResultsA presented higher stress concentration and strain values than R. Oblique loading promoted highest stress concentration and strain rates for all groups. ALR and RLR presented similar stress–strain distribution pattern when compared to A and R.ConclusionThe interaction between MOD cavity restored with amalgam and oblique loading propitiated the highest stress concentration and strain values on cervical region and WS lesion.Clinical relevanceThe MOD cavity restored with composite resin is a better option than amalgam to improve the biomechanical behavior of wedge-shaped lesion, avoiding dental failure. In addition, the occlusal interferences must be removed, allowing homogeneous contact distribution and preventing WS lesion progression.",,,Clinical Oral Investigations,,,"Bicuspid; Biomechanical Phenomena; Bisphenol A-Glycidyl Methacrylate; Composite Resins; Dental Amalgam; Dental Cavity Preparation; Dental Materials; Dental Restoration Failure; Dental Restoration, Permanent; Dental Stress Analysis; Elastic Modulus; Finite Element Analysis; Gutta-Percha; Stress, Mechanical; Tooth, Nonvital",2015-07-11,2015,2015-07-11,2016-04,20,3,433-441,Closed,Article,"Pereira, Fabrícia Araújo; Zeola, Livia Fávaro; de Almeida Milito, Giovana; Reis, Bruno Rodrigues; Pereira, Rodrigo Dantas; Soares, Paulo Vinícius","Pereira, Fabrícia Araújo (Operative Dentistry and Dental Materials Department, Federal University of Uberlandia, Rua Republica do Piratini S/N Bloco 4LA Sala 37 Campus Umuarama, 38405-325, Uberlândia, Minas Gerais, Brazil); Zeola, Livia Fávaro (Operative Dentistry and Dental Materials Department, Federal University of Uberlandia, Rua Republica do Piratini S/N Bloco 4LA Sala 37 Campus Umuarama, 38405-325, Uberlândia, Minas Gerais, Brazil); de Almeida Milito, Giovana (Operative Dentistry and Dental Materials Department, Federal University of Uberlandia, Rua Republica do Piratini S/N Bloco 4LA Sala 37 Campus Umuarama, 38405-325, Uberlândia, Minas Gerais, Brazil); Reis, Bruno Rodrigues (Operative Dentistry and Dental Materials Department, Federal University of Uberlandia, Rua Republica do Piratini S/N Bloco 4LA Sala 37 Campus Umuarama, 38405-325, Uberlândia, Minas Gerais, Brazil); Pereira, Rodrigo Dantas (Department of Dentistry, United Universities of the North of Minas, Avenida Osmane Barbosa, 11111, 39404-549, Montes Claros, Minas Gerais, Brazil); Soares, Paulo Vinícius (Operative Dentistry and Dental Materials Department, School of Dentistry, Federal University of Uberlandia, Rua Republica do Piratini S/N Bloco 4LA Sala 37 Campus Umuarama, 38405-325, Uberlândia, Minas Gerais, Brazil)","Soares, Paulo Vinícius (Federal University of Uberlândia)","Pereira, Fabrícia Araújo (Federal University of Uberlândia); Zeola, Livia Fávaro (Federal University of Uberlândia); de Almeida Milito, Giovana (Federal University of Uberlândia); Reis, Bruno Rodrigues (Federal University of Uberlândia); Pereira, Rodrigo Dantas (Department of Dentistry, United Universities of the North of Minas, Avenida Osmane Barbosa, 11111, 39404-549, Montes Claros, Minas Gerais, Brazil); Soares, Paulo Vinícius (Federal University of Uberlândia)",10,4,0.63,2.84,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1028193222,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3203 Dentistry,

Using drug combinations is one therapeutic approach to overcome the developing resistance to any one drug. Oxidative stress is now a generally regarded hallmark of cancer that can be one approach to selectively target cancer cells while sparing normal cells. With the aim of increasing oxidative stress in cancer cells to a lethal set point, we have generated and combined several series of redox active compounds that act at different points of the cellular oxidative cascade. The premise of such combinations is to deplete of endogenous antioxidant defence proteins (e.g., Glutathione) while concomitantly increasing the generation of ROS via metal redox recycling and Fenton chemistry which eventually leads to the disruption of cellular redox homeostasis and induction of cell death. Through this approach, we have identified highly synergistic combinations of two distinctive classes of compounds (Azines and Copper(II) complexes of 2-pyridyl ketone thiosemicarbazones) which are capable of eliminating cancer cells without concomitant increase in toxicity toward normal cells. In one of our most potent combinations, a combination index (CI) value of 0.056 was observed, representing a 17 fold enhancement in activity beyond additive effects. Such new combination regimen of redox active compounds can be one step closer to potentially safer low dose chemotherapy.","The authors wish to acknowledge the helpful discussions of Professor D Richardson (University of Sydney, Australia) and Professor R Haynes (University of the North West, South Africa) during the development of this concept.

Turtles in the lower segment of the Castilletes Formation (c. 16.33 Ma) are pleurodires or side-necked turtles belonging to Chelus colombiana Wood, Chelus sp., and Podocnemididae incertae sedis, and cryptodires or hidden-necked turtles attributed to Chelonoidis sp., all of them characterized by the large size of their shells, 1 meter or more total length. The middle segment of the formation (c. 14 Ma) contains specimens of Podocnemididae incertae sedis and Chelonoidis sp. The turtle fauna from Castilletes share taxa with faunas from La Venta (middlelate Miocene of Colombia), Urumaco, and Western Amazonia (late Miocene from Venezuela, Brazil, and Peru); all of these records indicate a wider geographical distribution for podocnemidids, chelids, and testudinids of tropical South America during the early to middle Miocene. The large size of the fossils described here also confirms that gigantism was characteristic of South American tropical turtles during the early Miocene, a trend that lasted at least from the Paleocene to the Pliocene in different lineages.","Funding for this work was provided by the Smithsonian Institution, National Geographic Society, Anders Family, Universidad del Norte, University of Zurich, and the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation of Germany.

While for crystals, it is well established that equilibrium isotopic fractionation factors can be calculated using a statistical thermodynamic approach based on the vibrational properties, several theoretical methods are currently used to model ions in aqueous solution. In this work, we present a systematic study to determine the reduced partition function ratio (β-factor) of aqueous Mg2+ using several levels of theory within the simulations. In particular, using an empirical force field, we compare and discuss the performance of the exact results obtained from path integral molecular dynamics (PIMD) simulations, with respect to the more traditional methods based on vibrational properties and the cluster approximation. The results show the importance of including configurational disorder for the estimation of the equilibrium isotope fractionation factor. We also show that using the vibrational frequencies computed from snapshots taken from equilibrated classical molecular dynamics represents a good approximation for the study of aqueous ions.Based on these conclusions, the β-factor of aqueous Mg2+ have been estimated from a Car–Parrinello molecular dynamics (CPMD) simulation with an ab initio force field, and combined with the β-factors of carbonate minerals (magnesite, dolomite, calcite and aragonite). Mg β-factor of Mg-bearing aragonite, calculated here for the first time, displays a lower value than the three other carbonate minerals. This is explained by a strong distortion of the cationic site leading to a decrease of the coordination number during Ca–Mg substitution. Overall, the equilibrium magnesium isotope fractionation factors between aqueous Mg2+ and carbonate minerals that derive from this methodological study support the previous theoretical results obtained from embedded cluster models.","AcknowledgementsThis work was performed using HPC resources from GENCI-IDRIS (Grant 2014-i2014041519).

The study sample consisted of 591 in-service teachers from various Ibero-American countries (Spain, Mexico, Guatemala, Colombia, and Ecuador). The study analyzed attributional structure or teacher beliefs on learning to read based on principal component analysis. Findings revealed that many of the implicit theories on learning to read held by the teachers correspond to the historiography analysis and representational structure identified in previous studies. Based on main component analysis with varimax rotation, a factorial structure was found to be formed by the seven main factors related to the constructivist, nativist, maturationist, social, repetition, corrective, and psycho-linguistic learning theories. Also, significant differences were found in the learning theories of the teachers depending on geographical and cultural context. Spanish teachers were more likely to be associated with the psycho-linguistic and nativist theories. Mexican teachers were more closely associated with the constructivist theory, and both Guatemalan and Colombian teachers tended to be linked to the repetition-based theory. Finally, Ecuadorian teachers tended to rely on the nativist theory.",This research study was funded by the National R&amp;D&amp;i Plan (Feder and the Ministry of Science and Technology) under Ref no.: PSI2009-11662 of the first author.,,Reading and Writing,,,,2015-07-08,2015,2015-07-08,2015-11,28,9,1355-1379,Closed,Article,"Jiménez, Juan E.; Rodríguez, Cristina; Suárez, Natalia; O’Shanahan, Isabel; Villadiego, Yalov; Uribe, Claudia; Villalobos, Jose Angel; Rodas, Patricia","Jiménez, Juan E.

Independently of engine load, both alcohols exhibited higher premixed combustion peaks, faster combustion process, and higher coefficient of variation of indicated mean effective pressure (imep) and reduced maximum in-cylinder temperature, in comparison with ultra low sulfur diesel (ULSD). Neither n-butanol nor hydrous ethanol presented better brake thermal efficiency (bte) and brake specific fuel consumption (bsfc) than ULSD. Engine performance with alcohol fumigation is highly susceptible to operating mode. Therefore, it is necessary to optimize the specific thermal conditions for implementing a fumigation strategy. Both alcohols increased carbon monoxide (CO) and total hydrocarbons (THC) and reduced nitrogen oxides (NOx) and particulate matter (PM), in comparison with ULSD fuel. However, the magnitude of this reduction was markedly affected by engine operating mode. The n-butanol showed the best trade-off (PM vs NOx+THC) among all fuels. In comparison with ULSD, hydrous ethanol fumigation decreased the total number concentration of particles while maintaining or increasing the geometric mean diameter, depending on the engine load. In comparison with ULSD, n-butanol maintained or reduced the total number concentration of particles and exhibited the opposite trend for the geometric mean diameter. The particle number concentration (PNC) and size distribution were not affected by engine load for n-butanol.","AcknowledgementsAuthors wish to thank the Universidad de Antioquia for the financial support through the project CODI PRG13-2-04 and the Sostenibilidad program 2014–2015.

Molluscan fossils are highly diverse and often well preserved, offering a window into the rapidly changing paleoenvironments and biogeography of northern South America during parts of the Early to Middle Miocene and latest Pliocene to Pleistocene. Before the evolutionary and biogeographic implications of these fossils can be understood, however, their associated depositional environments and geologic ages must be determined. Here, we present preliminary results from paleoenvironmental, biostratigraphic, and strontium isotope chronostratigraphic analyses of sediments and fossils from the Uitpa, Jimol, Castilletes, and Ware formations found in Cocinetas Basin. The basal unit in the Neogene succession, the Uitpa Formation, comprises mudstones redeposited sandstones and molluscs typical of bathyal to outer shelf environments at its base. It is a shallowing-up sequence and is conformable with the overlying Jimol Formation, which comprises coarse-grained lithic calcarenite, coquina, and mudstone that represent a regressive–transgressive–regressive sequence. This sequence includes foreshore and transition zone through lower inner shelf environments, but generally poorly preserved invertebrate assemblages. The conformably overlying Castilletes Formation contains a varied suite of depositional environments with better-developed shell beds and thicker successions of intervening siltstone. A significant unconformity exists between the Castilletes Formation and the overlying Ware Formation, which represents a deltaic to coastal shoreface deposition environment, rich in shallow marine molluscs from a variety of ecotopes. Biostratigraphic assessment and strontium isotopic results from the Jimol and Castilletes formations indicate that these units contain fossils of latest Early Miocene through Middle Miocene age, while those of the Ware are approximately Late Pliocene in age. These results help to place the shallow marine assemblages of Cocinetas Basin into a wider geologic context that aids our understanding of how these faunas relate to the broader evolutionary and biogeographic history of the southern Caribbean during the Neogene. Additionally, the isotope dating and paleoecology of this fauna help to place co-occurring terrestrial and aquatic vertebrate assemblages into a local paleoenvironmental and chronostratigraphic framework.","This research was supported by the U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF) grant 0966884 (OISE, EAR, DRL), Florida Museum of Natural History and University of Florida, the National Geographic Society, the Anders Foundation, Gregory D. and Jennifer Walston Johnson, and the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute.

Still, the role of copper in the process is unclear. In this work, small copper clusters on the (101) and (100) surfaces of anatase have been investigated by first-principles simulations based on density functional theory, to shed light on their atomic and electronic structure, and to understand their effect on the photocatalytic process. The main effects of copper on the electronic structure are to provide states above the edge of the valence band of titania and to lead to the formation of midgap states. There are two types of midgap states, respectively, associated with direct Cu–Ti bonds and to Ti3+ polarons. The latter are the result of charge donation from copper and lie in the vicinity of the surface. Moreover, the copper tetramer (Cu4) displays empty states at the bottom of the conduction band that play a key role in accommodating excess electrons. We discuss how these features should enhance the photoresponse of TiO2, contribute to increase the lifetime of the photogenerated electron–hole pairs and contribute to increase the activity of this material for CO2 reduction, a key step in the photoproduction of hydrocarbons.",Computational resources were provided by CINECA under IscrC-Copsol and by The Abdus Salam ICTP.

Life cycle analysis (LCA) and a functional characterization focused in the advantages and limitations of each principle are considered. The aim of this work is to provide indicators for an objective selection of the best modular architecture solution in the design stage.

The technique employs non-parametric estimates of the shear stresses derived from the recorded accelerations; therefore, it does not require the forward modeling of the whole soil deposit. Soil properties are described by a hyperbolic shear stress–strain relation. A multi-surface plasticity approach is used to model the stress–strain relation. Convergence and accuracy of the identification technique are assessed using numerical simulations. Two centrifuge experiments are used to validate and demonstrate the capabilities of the technique to estimate the stiffness and damping ratio profiles of a site subjected to base excitation. Performance of the technique is also evaluated using field data corresponding to the 1987 Superstition Hills earthquake recordings from the Wildlife Liquefaction Array at the Imperial Valley in Southern California. The identification results were found to be in good agreement with direct measurements of shear wave velocities.",AcknowledgmentsThis research was partly supported by the National Science Foundation (NEESR CMS-0830325).

However, some solutions, such as pedestrian bridges and crosswalks at signalized intersections, usually imply longer walking distances compared to the direct crossing alternative which, in its turn, involves a higher risk.In this article, a hybrid framework is proposed to analyse the pedestrians’ choice on how to cross an urban road where three crossing options are available: crossing directly, crossing by using a pedestrian bridge or using a crosswalk at a signalized intersection. The decision process is modelled as a discrete choice model incorporating latent variables to consider perceptions and psychological factors, using stated preference data coming from a survey applied in Bogotá, Colombia.Results show that the latent variables security/safety and attractiveness of each crossing alternative are relevant to understand the pedestrian crossing behaviour. These latent variables are strongly determined by socioeconomic characteristics of the individual (age, gender, level of study) and conditioned by the circumstances of the trip (main mode of transport, walking or not with children). It was found that a longer walking distance to a pedestrian bridge or a signalized crosswalk increases the probability of direct crossing, having a more relevant effect in the case of the pedestrian bridge.","AcknowledgementsWe are grateful to Findeter and the General Royalties System, for having partially financed this work through the project Diamante Caribe y Santanderes (Cod. 2014000100012).

There is extensive scientific literature confirming the relationship between the use of new media and electoral political participation (Willnat et al, 2013; Lee and Shin, 2014; Ceron et al, 2014.). The aim of this study is to determine the mechanism by which using social networks influences the decision to vote. Ecuadorian citizens (n= 3,535) took part in an exploratory survey during the first half of 2013. The authors tested the measures and scales included in the questionnaire for validity and reliability; and they used a moderated mediation model (Hayes, 2013) based on regression. Results show that positive influence of using social networks on the decision to vote is not given directly, but rather through the search for information and need for political deliberation. In this mediation process, the indirect effect is in turn negatively moderated by age (the effect is stronger in young people). It is argued that despite the influence that networks may have on the behavior of voters, traditional factors related to the search for political information in more conventional means (e.g. radio or TV) seem to have a more significant effect. The authors explain both theoretical and practical implications. Finally, they address the study's limitations regarding the representativeness of the sample and suggest testing the model in other political and cultural contexts.",,,International Journal of E-Politics,,,,2015-10-01,2015,,2015-10-01,6,4,15-34,Closed,Article,"Ibáñez, Daniel Barredo; Calderón, Carlos Arcila; Arroyave, Jesús; Silva, Roxana","Ibáñez, Daniel Barredo (Universidad Laica Eloy Alfaro de Manabi, Manta, Ecuador); Calderón, Carlos Arcila (Universidad Rey Juan Carlos, Madrid, Spain); Arroyave, Jesús (Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); Silva, Roxana (FLACSO, Quito, Ecuador)",,"Ibáñez, Daniel Barredo (Universidad Laica Eloy Alfaro de Manabí); Calderón, Carlos Arcila (King Juan Carlos University); Arroyave, Jesús (Universidad del Norte); Silva, Roxana (Facultad Latinoamericana de Ciencias Sociales)",5,0,,1.92,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1071879054,"47 Language, Communication and Culture; 4701 Communication and Media Studies",

There is limited data on drug survival studying all modes of action in the same population. The primary objective was to describe the persistence on biologic (b) DMARDS in the Australian landscape. The secondary objectives were to investigate the influence of MTX and other DMARD concomitant medications, effect of patient age at initiation and bDMARD treatment line on biologic persistence. RA patients aged ≥18 for whom biologics were dispensed for their RA and who were in the Australian Medicare 10% sample database (dating from 01 August 2010 to 31 June 2014) provided by the Department of Health and Aging through an Australian healthcare consulting company (PROSPECTION) were included in the study. The following bDMARDS were included abatacept (ABA), adalimumab, certolizumab pegol, etanercept, golimumab, infliximab (INF) and tocilizumab (TCZ). The duration of treatment was determined for each treatment regimen. Data were analysed using descriptive statistics for continuous variables and frequency counts for categorical variables. Time-to endpoints was summarised using Kaplan-Meier (K-M) methodology. Individual sub-cutaneous (SC) anti-TNFs were equivalent in all analyses and therefore were combined for simplicity. Data from 1230 patients were included in the analysis; 27% were ≥65 years old and 73% were between 18-64 years old. The majority (73%) were females. For all patients, the percentage (based on K-M estimates) who continued on treatment at 6 months (mo) after commencement was 84% for TCZ, 75% for ABA, 69% for SC anti-TNFs and 40% for INF. Median time to stopping treatment was 39 mo (95% CI:29-ND) for TCZ, 32 mo (95% CI:19-ND) for ABA; 21 mo (95% Cl:17-26) for SC anti-TNF, and 3 mo (95% CI:1-12) for INF. Longer median treatment persistence was observed for concomitant SC anti-TNFs and ABA with MTX or other DMARDs than for monotherapy (but not TCZ; Table 1). Age was not associated with treatment persistence. Significant differences were observed for treatment line and persistence (Table 2). As first line therapy, ABA and possibly TCZ (p=0.08) have superior persistence compared to SC anti-TNFs. For second line, TCZ was superior to all other options and, for third line, none were different but this was hampered by small numbers. MTX and other DMARDs improve persistence for ABA and SC anti-TNF but not TCZ. These real world data help inform clinicians about choice of therapy at initiation and the use of concomitant DMARDs.

Flare represents an important aspect of RA disease experience with a crucial impact on patients' well-being. The impact of RA flares on fatigue in patients with RA is not fully understood. We aimed to assess the association of RA flares, functional status, pain and well-being with fatigue perception in patients with RA using self-assessment questionnaires. Patients with RA (age≥18 yrs; 1987 ACR criteria) participating in an ongoing population-based cohort study completed flare-assessment in RA (FLARE) questionnaire and Bristol Rheumatoid Arthritis Fatigue (BRAF) questionnaire, as well as Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ) with visual analogue scale for pain (VAS pain) on 100mm scale during a study visit (2012-2014), and submitted a blood sample for C-reactive protein (CRP) and interleukin-6 (IL6) assessment. Retrospective medical records review was performed to collect physician clinical assessment (PCA) and patient global assessment (PGA) of RA disease activity on 100mm scale for the most recent clinical visit prior to the study visit. Pearson's correlation was used to examine relationships between the variables. The study included 190 RA patients (mean age 63 years; 75% female; mean RA duration 13.6 yrs). The mean (standard deviation; SD) of the overall FLARE score was 2.52 (2.55) on 0-10 scale; 1.86 (2.45) for systemic subscale; 3.32 (3.09) for joint subscale. The mean (SD) of the overall BRAF score was 12.72 (13.55) on 0-70 scale; the subscale scores were as follows: physical fatigue 3.65 (4.43), living with fatigue 3.66 (4.45); cognitive fatigue 3.18 (3.21) and emotional fatigue 2.25 (2.64). Mean (SD) CRP was 4.15 (5.8) mg/L; IL6 3.48 (5.52) pg/ml; HAQ 0.66 (0.66); VAS pain 28.8 (24.8). BRAF score overall and all subscales were statistically significantly correlated with FLARE, HAQ, VAS pain, PGA and PCA (except for cognitive fatigue subscale which was only marginally associated with PCA, p=0.08; see Table). There were no statistically significant associations of BRAF with CRP, IL6 or patient's gender. Younger age was statistically significantly associated with higher BRAF score overall, and in particularly with cognitive fatigue, but not with other BRAF subscales. Shorter RA duration was significantly associated with higher “living with fatigue” BRAF score. Flares of RA disease activity, as well as worsening functional status, pain, and overall well-being, but not inflammatory marker levels, are highly correlated with increased perception of fatigue. Our findings underscore the important role of RA flares in shaping the quality of life in patients with RA, and suggest an intricate relationship between self-perception of fatigue and flare, not reflected by inflammatory marker measures in patients with RA. Further studies are warranted to better understand the concept of RA flare and its impact on patient-reported outcomes.

In particular, the piece narrates how the country's first class of illegal drugs merchants helped shape a key element of modern Colombian nationalism by promoting vallenato music on the local stage and hastening its conquest of the national market and imaginary in the 1970s. Marijuana intermediaries — popularly known as marimberos — sprang into action from the most marginalized rural and urban sectors of the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta and La Guajira region. Soon they constituted a new entrepreneurial class whose profile as successful merchants was articulated as a regional masculine identity found in popular expressions such as vallenato music. That process helped marimberos to open space for themselves in regional society and to turn vallenato into a supreme expression of Colombian popular culture. This essay examines that cultural-political process while seeking to explain why the marimberos' role in vallenato's history has been largely erased from national memory.",,,Hispanic American Historical Review,,,,2015-02-01,2015,,2015-02-01,95,1,71-102,Closed,Article,"Britto, Lina","Britto, Lina ()",,"Britto, Lina ()",6,0,,7.69,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1009665994,"43 History, Heritage and Archaeology; 4303 Historical Studies",

1227,pub.1024863008,10.1016/j.trb.2015.04.013,,,Accounting for stochastic variables in discrete choice models,"The estimation of discrete choice models requires measuring the attributes describing the alternatives within each individual’s choice set. Even though some attributes are intrinsically stochastic (e.g. travel times) or are subject to non-negligible measurement errors (e.g. waiting times), they are usually assumed fixed and deterministic. Indeed, even an accurate measurement can be biased as it might differ from the original (experienced) value perceived by the individual.Experimental evidence suggests that discrepancies between the values measured by the modeller and experienced by the individuals can lead to incorrect parameter estimates. On the other hand, there is an important trade-off between data quality and collection costs. This paper explores the inclusion of stochastic variables in discrete choice models through an econometric analysis that allows identifying the most suitable specifications. Various model specifications were experimentally tested using synthetic data; comparisons included tests for unbiased parameter estimation and computation of marginal rates of substitution. Model specifications were also tested using a real case databank featuring two travel time measurements, associated with different levels of accuracy.Results show that in most cases an error components model can effectively deal with stochastic variables. A random coefficients model can only effectively deal with stochastic variables when their randomness is directly proportional to the value of the attribute. Another interesting result is the presence of confounding effects that are very difficult, if not impossible, to isolate when more flexible models are used to capture stochastic variations. Due the presence of confounding effects when estimating flexible models, the estimated parameters should be carefully analysed to avoid misinterpretations. Also, as in previous misspecification tests reported in the literature, the Multinomial Logit model proves to be quite robust for estimating marginal rates of substitution, especially when models are estimated with large samples.","AcknowledgementsWe are grateful for the very useful comments of four unknown referees.

METHODS: Diarrhea mortality data was gathered from 2002 until 2009 from the Pan American Health Organization Mortality Database for five ""vaccine adopter"" countries (Brazil, El Salvador, Mexico, Nicaragua, and Panama) that introduced RV in 2006 and four ""control"" countries (Argentina, Chile, Costa Rica, and Paraguay) that did not introduce RV by 2009. Time trend analyses were carried out, and effects and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated.
RESULTS: Each of the five vaccine adopter countries, except Panama, showed a significant trend in declining mortality rates during the post-vaccine period from 2006 to 2009, whereas no decline was seen in control countries during these years. Furthermore, trends of reduction of all-cause diarrhea mortality in both children <1 year of age and <5 years of age were greater in the post-vaccination period compared with the pre-vaccine period in all vaccine adopter countries (except for Nicaragua), whereas in control countries, a reverse pattern was seen with greater reduction in the early years from 2002 to 2005 versus 2006-2009. An estimatedtotal of 1777 of annual under-5 deaths were avoided in Brazil, El Salvador, Mexico, and Nicaragua during the post-vaccination period.
CONCLUSION: All vaccine adopter countries, except Panama, showed a significant decrease in all-cause diarrhea-related deaths after RV implementation, even after adjusting for declining trends over time in diarrhea mortality. These data strongly support continuous efforts to increase vaccination coverage of RV vaccines, particularly in countries with high levels of child mortality from diarrhea.",,"A partial funding for this research was made by COLCIENCIAS grant no. 304 of 2010, a government entity in Colombia.

1197,pub.1042231641,10.1016/j.jinorgbio.2015.01.008,25635913,,Insight on the interaction of an agmatinase-like protein with Mn2+ activator ions,"Agmatinase is an enzyme that catalyzes the hydrolysis of agmatine, a compound that is associated with numerous functions in the brain of mammalian organisms such as neurotransmitter, anticonvulsant, antinociceptive, anxiolytic and antidepressant-like actions. To date the only characterized agmatinases with significant enzymatic activity were extracted from bacterial organisms. These agmatinases are closely related to another ureahydrolase, arginase; both have binuclear Mn(2+) centers in their active sites. An agmatinase-like protein (ALP) from rat brain was identified that bears no sequence homology to known agmatinases (E. Uribe, M. Salas, S. Enriquez, M.S. Orellana, N. Carvajal, Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 461(2007) 146-150). Since all known ureahydrolases contain histidines in their binuclear Mn(2+) site each of the five histidine residues in ALP was individually replaced by alanines to identify those that may be involved in metal ion binding. Reactivation assays and thermal stability measurements indicated that His206 is likely to interact with a Mn(2+) bound to a high affinity site. In contrast, His65 and possibly His435 are important for binding of a second Mn(2+) to a lower affinity site. Metal ion binding to that site is not only leading to an increase in reactivity but also enzyme stability. Thus, similar to bacterial agmatinases and some of the antibiotic-degrading, Zn(2+)-dependent metallo-β-lactamases ALP appears to be active in the mono and binuclear form, with binding of the second metal ion increasing both reactivity and stability.",AcknowledgmentsThis research was supported by a Grant from Fondecyt 1120663.

The forecast ensemble members at each step are used to estimate the background error covariance matrix via the Rao-Blackwell Ledoit and Wolf estimator, which has been specifically developed to approximate high-dimensional covariance matrices using a small number of samples. Two implementations are considered: in the EnKF full-space (EnKF-FS) approach, the assimilation process is performed in the model space, while the EnKF reduce-space (EnKF-RS) formulation performs the analysis in the subspace spanned by the ensemble members. In the context of EnKF-RS, additional samples are taken from the normal distribution described by the background ensemble mean and the estimated background covariance matrix, in order to increase the size of the ensemble and reduce the sampling error of the filter. This increase in the size of the ensemble is obtained without running the forward model. After the assimilation step, the additional samples are discarded and only the model-based ensemble members are propagated further. Methodologies to reduce the impact of spurious correlations and under-estimation of sample variances in the context of the EnKF-FS and EnKF-RS implementations are discussed. An adjoint-free four-dimensional extension of EnKF-RS is also discussed. Numerical experiments carried out with the Lorenz-96 model and a quasi-geostrophic model show that the use of shrinkage covariance matrix estimation can mitigate the impact of spurious correlations during the assimilation process.","This work was supported in part by awards NSF CCF–1218454, AFOSR FA9550–12–1–0293–DEF, and by the Computational Science Laboratory at Virginia Tech.",,Ocean Dynamics,,,,2015-10-08,2015,2015-10-08,2015-11,65,11,1423-1439,Closed,Article,"Nino-Ruiz, Elias D.; Sandu, Adrian","Nino-Ruiz, Elias D.

We show that a parabolic toroidal pseudodifferential operator generates an analytic semigroup on the Besov space Bpqs(Tn,E)$$B_{pq}^s({\mathbb T}^n,E)$$ and on the Sobolev space Wpk(Tn,E)$$W_p^k({\mathbb T}^n,E)$$, where E is an arbitrary Banach space, 1≤p,q≤∞$$1\le p,q\le \infty $$, s∈R$$s\in {\mathbb R}$$ and k∈N0$$k\in {\mathbb N}_0$$. For the proof of the Sobolev space result, we establish a uniform estimate on the kernel which is given as an infinite parameter-dependent sum. An application to abstract non-autonomous periodic pseudodifferential Cauchy problems gives the existence and uniqueness of classical solutions for such problems.",The authors would like to thank COLCIENCIAS (Project 121556933488) and DAAD for the financial support.,,Journal of Fourier Analysis and Applications,,,,2015-10-20,2015,2015-10-20,2016-08,22,4,823-853,Closed,Article,"Barraza Martínez, B.; Denk, R.; Hernández Monzón, J.; Nau, T.","Barraza Martínez, B.

This study evaluates interobserver error in ancestry estimation using palate shape and explores palate shape variation in Gullah (descendants of West Africans) and Seminole (Indigenous American) population samples using geometric morphometric analysis. Ten participants were asked to ascribe biological ancestry and shape to 28 dental casts based on a classification scheme employed in previous studies. The mean correct classification was 42.0%, indicating that the likelihood of assigning the correct ancestry is very poor and not significantly different from random assignment (p = 0.12). The accuracy analysis based on categorical classification of the casts was complemented by geometric morphometric analysis of nine 3D landmarks reflecting palate shape of 158 casts. Principal component analysis results show no difference between populations regarding palate shape, and cross-validated discriminant function analysis correctly classified only 62.0% of the specimens. Combined, these results show that previous methods to estimate ancestry are inaccurate and that this inaccuracy is probably due to a lack of palate shape differences between groups, rather than limitation of the analytical method per se. Therefore, we recommend caution should be used when choosing to apply the analysis of palate shape in forensically relevant contexts.","The authors would like to thank Deborah Bolnick, Heather Edgar, and Loren Lease for their information and insight.

The data collected included RI, socio-demographic information, clinical characteristics, type of treatment and QoL using the S-QoL 18 questionnaire. A multivariate analysis using multiple linear regressions was performed to determine variables associated with QoL levels.ResultsTwo hundred and fifty-three patients with schizophrenia were enrolled in our study. Significant positive associations were found between RI and QoL (the S-QoL 18 index: β = 0.13; p = 0.048; autonomy dimension: β = 0.15; p = 0.027). Other socio-cultural and economic factors were also associated with low QoL level: being a woman, older patient, low education level and being Aymara. Severity of the psychotic symptoms was associated to a lower QoL for all the dimension (β from 0.15 to 0.31), except for the resilience.ConclusionOur study found that socio-cultural and economic factors including RI were associated with QoL in patients with schizophrenia in Latin America, suggesting that these factors may influence positively health outcome. However, these relationships were moderate in strength, especially in comparison to symptoms severity which remained the most important features associated with QoL.","This research was funded in part by CONICYT and BECAS-CHILE Postdoctorado en el Extranjero (74140004), the Convenio de Desempeño UTA-MINEDUC.

We analyze the impact of both the level of government expenditure and its composition on growth and welfare, under different production technologies, and derive their respective growth and welfare-maximizing levels. We show that contrary to what happens with welfare, the long-run growth rate is increasing in the intertemporal elasticity of substitution but decreasing in the relative weight of public goods in utility. Furthermore, the welfare-maximizing tax rate is lower than the growth-maximizing tax rate, whereas the welfare maximizing share of productive government expenditure is greater than the growth maximizing share. Finally, we employ numerical simulations to get a better understanding of the model.","AcknowledgmentsWe wish to thank the editors (W.D. Lastrapes and P. Wang), S.

Through these documents, it is possible to discover a slave society set within a frontier or even liminal social topography that reveals the multitude of possible dynamics created within the structures of such a heterogeneous community. We discover that much as the Spaniards and their Creole offspring may have sought to maintain the boundaries of what they envisioned as an ideal caste system, institutions such as the navy, the military and the church were forced to incorporate Africans and their descendants for various reasons. Free people of color (pardos libres) as well as the enslaved were agile in their appropriation of those narrow fissures in the rigid racial system that was the theoretical standard. From early on, Africans, Europeans, indigenous peoples and their descendants created a type of tropical Babylon in Cartagena, developing distinct geographical spaces along the coast and in the city and port that can be mapped out ethnically and culturally.","The author is very grateful to Father Tulio Aristizábal, SJ for his warm welcome to Cartagena and his constant willingness to share his expertise and friendship with me.

This variability seems to have increased during the Late Intermediate Period (AD 950–1400). The oasis of Quillagua, located at the margins of the Loa River in northern Chile, between the Andes and the coast (70 km from the Pacific Ocean), has shown important evidence regarding this cultural diversity. The variety in the archaeological evidence found at Quillagua has been interpreted as the result of two different cultural influences at the oasis: the Pica‐Tarapacá who occupied the coastal and inland regions to the north of Quillagua and the Atacama who occupied the oasis and fertile areas southeast of Quillagua. Here, we present the results of stable carbon, nitrogen and oxygen isotope analyses of 23 individuals recovered from the Cementerio Oriente in Quillagua, in order to test whether the observed cultural variability is also reflected in diet and mobility patterns. Results from carbon and nitrogen isotope measurements indicate the importance of marine protein, as well as a contribution of maize in the diet of some individuals. Four individuals show low δ 18 O values, suggesting a possible highland or non‐local origin, whereas values for the remaining individuals are consistent with lowland populations. Together, the results support the idea that the Quillagua oasis represented an important site of interaction between the Tarapacá and Atacama cultures, with close contacts with the coast but also with the presence of individuals from the highlands.

The system implements the detection algorithm as a Snort preprocessor component. Since they work together, a highly effective system against known attacks has been achieved (based on Snort rules) and a highly effective system against unknown threats (which was the main aim of the designed system). As the majority of such systems, the proposal consists of two phases: a training phase and a detection phase. During the training phase a statistical model of the legitimate network usage is created through Bloom Filters and N-grams techniques. Subsequently, the results obtained by analyzing a dataset of attacks are compared with such model. This will allow a set of rules to be developed which will be able to determine whether the packets payloads contain malware. In the detection phase, the traffic to analyze is compared with the model created in the training phase and the results obtained when applying rules. The performed experiments showed really satisfactory results, with 100% malware detection and just 0.15% false positives.",,,IEEE Latin America Transactions,,,,2015-03-26,2015,2015-03-26,,13,3,850-855,Closed,Article,"Villalba, L.J.G.; Orozco, A.L.S.; Vidal, J.M.","Villalba, L.J.G.

Agmatine, a precursor for polyamine biosynthesis, is also associated with neurotransmitter, anticonvulsant, antineurotoxic and antidepressant actions in the brain. This molecule results from the decarboxylation of l-arginine by arginine decarboxylase, and it is hydrolyzed to urea and putrescine by agmatinase. Recently, we have described a new protein that also hydrolyzes agmatine, agmatinase-like protein (ALP), which was identified through immunohistochemical analysis in the hypothalamus and hippocampus of rats. However, its sequence differs greatly from all known agmatinases and does not contain the typical Mn2+ ligands associated with the urea hydrolase family of proteins. ALP has a LIM-like domain close to its carboxyl terminus, and the removal of which results in a truncated variant with a tenfold increased kcat value and a threefold decreased Km value for agmatine. Analysis of the gene database revealed several transcripts, denominated LIMCH1 isoforms, with extreme 3′ sequences identical to ALP. Limch1 gene products have been described as members of a multi-domain family of proteins with the biggest isoform containing a calponin homology (CH) domain at its N-terminus. Here, we cloned two LIMCH1 transcripts, one of 3177 bp and the other of 2709 bp (ALP contains 1569 bp) and analyzed LIMCH1 expression and distribution in rat brain using RT-PCR, Western blot and immunohistochemical analyses. LIMCH1 was detected mainly in the hypothalamic and hippocampal regions, which is similar to the distribution of ALP and agmatine in brain. In addition, we cloned and expressed both isoforms in E. coli and confirmed that they were catalytically active on agmatine with kinetic parameters similar to ALP. LIM domain-truncated variants of both isoforms moderately increased the kcat and catalytic efficiency. Thus, we propose that LIMCH1 is useful to regulate the intracellular concentrations of the neurotransmitter/neuromodulator, agmatine.",This research was supported by Grant Fondecyt 1120663 and Grant VRID-Enlace 251.037.019-1.0.,,Histochemistry and Cell Biology,,,"Animals; Brain; Cell Line; Cloning, Molecular; Male; Protein Isoforms; Rats; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; Ureohydrolases",2015-12-17,2015,2015-12-17,2016-03,145,3,305-313,Closed,Article,"García, David; Ordenes, Patricio; Benítez, José; González, Arlette; García-Robles, María A.; López, Vasthi; Carvajal, Nelson; Uribe, Elena","García, David (Departamento de Ciencias Biológicas y Químicas, Facultad de Ciencias, Universidad San Sebastián, Lientur 1457, Concepción, Chile); Ordenes, Patricio (Departamento de Biología Celular, Facultad de Ciencias Biológicas, Universidad de Concepción, Casilla 160-C, Concepción, Chile); Benítez, José (Departamento de Bioquímica y Biología Molecular, Facultad de Ciencias Biológicas, Universidad de Concepción, Casilla 160-C, Concepción, Chile); González, Arlette (Departamento de Bioquímica y Biología Molecular, Facultad de Ciencias Biológicas, Universidad de Concepción, Casilla 160-C, Concepción, Chile); García-Robles, María A.

In addition to its endogenous antioxidant role, this enzyme is also involved in hydrolysis of organophosphate (OP) pesticides in plasma. PON1 activity shows great variability in the population as a result of a polymorphism in the coding sequence that is expressed as a Glu(Q)/Arg(R) substitution at position 192 of the amino acid sequence. The aim of this study was to determine the activity levels (phenotype) and genotype of PON1 in a group of 85 agricultural workers occupationally exposed to OP pesticides and compared to 97 control subjects without occupational exposure. Allelic and genotypic frequencies of PON1Q192R polymorphism, as well as their catalytic activities, were established for the first time in a group of agricultural Chilean workers. The Q allele was more frequently represented in our studied population (approximately 60%). The Q allele is less efficient than the R allele at metabolizing chlorpyrifos (CPF), the most widely used OP pesticide in the geographical areas where samples were obtained. Further, a large interindividual variability in PON1 activity was observed, suggesting wide variation of individual susceptibility to CPF, an issue that needs to be considered in human monitoring studies.",,,Journal of Toxicology and Environmental Health Part A,,,"Agriculture; Aryldialkylphosphatase; Chile; Chlorpyrifos; Genotype; Humans; Insecticides; Occupational Exposure; Polymorphism, Genetic",2015-03-03,2015,2015-03-03,2015-03-19,78,6,357-368,Closed,Article,"Zúñiga-Venegas, L.; Aquea, G.; Taborda, M.; Bernal, G.; Pancetti, F.","Zúñiga-Venegas, L.

This plant has been used since pre-Colombian times to treat inflammation and dental neuralgias. In this work the first preparative fractionation of diterpenoids present in this plant by means of high-speed counter-current chromatography (HSCCC) was applied, and cytotoxic effects of the isolated compounds were evaluated for the first time against a panel of MCF7 cells.
RESULTS: The major compounds isolated were identified by means of spectroscopy as azorellanol, 13α, 14α-dihydroxymulin-11-en-20-oic acid, mulinolic acid, mulin-11,13-dien-20-oic acid, 17-acetoxy-mulin-11,13-dien-20 oic acid, and 17-acetoxy-mulinic acid (compounds 7, 9-11 and 13, respectively), and four minor diterpenoids [7-deacetyl-azorellanol (6), 13-epi-azorellanol, 7-acetoxy-mulin-9,12-diene, and 17-acetoxy-mulin-11,13-dien-20-oic acid (compounds 4, 8 and 12)], together with three new minor diterpenoids: 13β,14β-dihydroxymulin-11-en-20-oic acid (1), 13-epiazorellanone (2) and 13-epi-7-deacetyl-azorellanol (3) were identified. Besides, compounds 4, 6, 7, 8 and 11 displayed good cytotoxic activity (less than 50% cell viability at 100 µM). Among them, compound 7, an acetylated azorellane, was the most active.
CONCLUSIONS: HSCCC allowed the isolation of 13 diterpenoids present in A. compacta. Three compounds are reported for the first time. Isolated azorellanes are more potent cytotoxic agents than are mulinanes. © 2015 Society of Chemical Industry.",J.B. and M.S. gratefully acknowledge funds from Fondecyt No. 1140178 and the HPLC‐MS equipment acquired by fondequip EQM No. 140002.,,Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture,,,"Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic; Apiaceae; Breast Neoplasms; Chile; Countercurrent Distribution; Diterpenes; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Female; Humans; MCF-7 Cells; Molecular Structure; Plants, Medicinal",2015-10-01,2015,2015-10-01,2016-06,96,8,2832-2838,Closed,Article,"Bórquez, Jorge; Bartolucci, Nandy López; Echiburú-Chau, Carlos; Winterhalter, Peter; Vallejos, Javier; Jerz, Gerold; Simirgiotis, Mario J","Bórquez, Jorge (Laboratorio de Productos Naturales, Facultad de Ciencias Básicas, Departamento de Química, Universidad de Antofagasta, Av.

In Mesodesma donacium, one of the most important commercial species for local fishermen, no information is available on depuration, or on the anatomical distribution of this toxin and its potential use as a palliative measure to minimize the consequences of ASP outbreaks. Deputation of DA is very fast in M. donacium, and can be adequately described by means of a two-compartment model. The estimated rates for the first and second compartments were 1.27 d(-1) and 0.24 d(-1), respectively, with a transfer rate between compartments of 0.75. Having high depuration rates protects this species from being affected by Pseudo-nitzschia blooms for an extended period of time. Taking this into account, the time in which the bivalves are unsafe for consumers is very short, and therefore the economic losses that could result by the DA outbreaks in local fisheries should be moderate. In relation to anatomical distribution, at least during the uptake phase, the toxin was evenly distributed within the soft tissues, with a total toxin burden corresponding to 27%, 32% and 41% for Digestive Gland (DG), Foot (FT) and Other Body Fractions (OBF), respectively. Since the contribution of each organ to the toxin concentration is a function of both weight contribution and toxin burden, the pattern of toxin distribution showed the following trend: ""all other body fractions"" (OBF) > Foot (FT) > Digestive Gland (DG). Thus, the highest concentration of DA, with a contribution close to 72%, corresponds to the edible tissues (OBF + FT), while the DG (non-edible tissue) only contributes the remaining 28%. Consequently, in view of the anatomical distribution of domoic acid in M. donacium, the elimination of the digestive gland does not substantially reduce the toxicity of the final product and therefore selective evisceration would not improve their quality for human consumption.","This research was funded by the DOI 1056 (FONDEF-CHILE) and FIP 2007-20 projects developed within the framework of a cooperation agreement between the Consellería do Medio Rural e do Mar, Xunta de Galicia, Spain and the Universidad Católica del Norte, Chile.

The site corresponds to an extensive shell midden that was used generally as an occupational site and specifically as a funerary one by specialized marine hunter–gatherers exclusively during the Archaic period.The analysis of the faunal remains enabled a general description of the use of local fauna throughout the site's cultural sequence, which range from 7866 to 5040 cal. BP. According to the results obtained, marine and terrestrial fauna, including marine and terrestrial mammals, sea birds, pelagic and oceanic fish, mollusks, crustaceans and equinoderms, were used as a source of both food and technological implements during the Middle Holocene. This implies that the human groups that inhabited Copaca 1 accessed most of the ecoanthropic spheres of the Southern Cone of the Southwestern Pacific coast from early times onward, an adaptation dated since 12,000 BP in the south-western coast from southern Peru and northern Chile.","AcknowledgementsThis investigation was made possible through FONDECYT Grant 1100951.

Model-generated values could, in turn, serve as ""consumer"" inputs for multisource mixture modeling of paleodiet.
METHODS: Linear regression analysis of previously published controlled diet data facilitated the development of a mathematical model for predicting δ(13) Cprotein (and an experimentally generated error term) from isotopic data routinely generated during the analysis of osseous remains (δ(13) Cco and Δ(13) Cap-co ).
RESULTS: Regression analysis resulted in a two-term linear model (δ(13) Cprotein (%) = (0.78 × δ(13) Cco ) - (0.58× Δ(13) Cap-co ) - 4.7), possessing a high R-value of 0.93 (r(2)  = 0.86, P < 0.01), and experimentally generated error terms of ±1.9% for any predicted individual value of δ(13) Cprotein . This model was tested using isotopic data from Formative Period individuals from northern Chile's Atacama Desert.
CONCLUSIONS: The model presented here appears to hold significant potential for the prediction of the carbon isotope signature of dietary protein using only such data as is routinely generated in the course of stable isotope analysis of human osseous remains. These predicted values are ideal for use in multisource mixture modeling of dietary protein source contribution.",The authors acknowledge the support of Francisco Gallardo and Christina Torres‐Rouff.

(Quinoa) is accompanied by an outstanding environmental adaptability and high nutritional properties of the grains. However, little is known about the biochemical and physiological mechanisms associated with the abiotic stress tolerance of Quinoa. Here, we characterized carbon and nitrogen metabolic changes in Quinoa leaves and grains in response to water deficit stress analyzing their impact on the grain quality of two lowland ecotypes (Faro and BO78). Differences in the stress recovery response were found between genotypes including changes in the activity of nitrogen assimilation-associated enzymes that resulted in differences in grain quality. Both genotypes showed a common strategy to overcome water stress including the stress-induced synthesis of reactive oxygen species scavengers and osmolytes. Particularly, water deficit stress induced the stimulation of the ornithine and raffinose pathways. Our results would suggest that the regulation of C- and N partitioning in Quinoa during grain filling could be used for the improvement of the grain quality without altering grain yields.",This work was supported by Fondecyt Initiation No 11130480 to L.B.-G. and by the Will W.

Litter was dominated by plastics throughout the study area, but the proportion of plastics was higher at sea and on the oceanic islands than in coastal waters and on continental beaches. Litter densities were higher close to the center of the SP subtropical gyre compared to the continental coast. The seabird assemblage was diverse (28 species), and several endemic species were recorded. Seabird abundances were higher in the coastal waters and around Juan Fernández Islands off the continental coast than in the Oceanic and Polynesian sectors. Endangered species breeding on Salas & Gómez Island were observed in the Polynesian sector, which suggests a high potential for negative interactions between seabirds and floating litter, both occurring in high densities in this sector.","We thank the Armada de Chile and crew of the Vessel “Piloto Pardo” for their support.

There are some differences between the behaviors of the analyzed parameters in tropical areas in comparison with those published in the literature for temperate ones. The most significant conclusion is that historical data suggest that the highest ground flash density are located between latitude of 8 and 10 north. This value is much higher than the highest values reported for countries located in temperate regions. It is seen from the KL analysis that this parameter varies depending on the latitude with values up to 200 thunderstorm days (TDs).","The authors would like to thank the Colombian Administrative Department of Science and TechnologyCOLCIENCIAS for their support of this research and to the teachers S.

We investigated if harvested kelp beds may harbor higher densities of herbivore invertebrates, and the underlying mechanisms. Thus, we evaluated if the exudates of L. trabeculata change the seawater levels of soluble phenols, known to have a deterrent effect against the feeding behavior of some herbivore invertebrates. Finally we investigated whether the increase in T. tridentata densities in harvested kelp grounds could be related to a decrease in the seawater levels of soluble phenols. Our results showed that the density of invertebrate herbivores increased up to 32% in harvested kelp grounds. We provide the first estimate of the rate of phenolic exudation by L. trabeculata, and we demonstrate that T. tridentata changes its food dependent movement in the presence of exudates with synthetic phloroglucinol. We suggest that the recovery of harvested kelp ecosystems can be jeopardized by increased herbivory triggered by water-borne changes in the levels of herbivore deterrent compounds.","AcknowledgmentsThis manuscript is part of the M.Sc. thesis of M.P., at the International MSc in Marine Biodiversity and Conservation (EMBC).

Neutron diffraction experiments reveal a phase transition at ∼50 K that has been attributed to an unexpected appearance of magnetic moments on Cu ions, having a paramagnetic arrangement down to 50 K and then ordering to an antiferromagnetic state at lower temperatures. In this study we use DFT-based computational methods to investigate the electronic structure and magnetic properties of CuFeS2 in order to obtain a reliable source of information for the interpretation of the observed magnetic behavior, and in particular to shed some light on the magnetic behavior of copper atoms in this compound. We have calculated the electronic structure of the ground and low-energy magnetically excited states and deduced a set of exchange coupling constants that are used afterward in classical Monte Carlo simulations to obtain magnetic susceptibility data, which compare successfully with our experimental results above ∼170 K. From our results it can be inferred that copper atoms remain in a diamagnetic state in this temperature range, although spin delocalization from neighboring iron atoms results in a non-negligible spin density on the copper atoms at high temperatures.","S.C. gratefully acknowledges the Becas Chile program (CONICYT PAI/INDUSTRIA 72090772) for a doctoral grant at the Universitat de Barcelona.

This study assessed the knowledge and perceptions towards the nutritional and health promoting properties of forest foods among forest dependent communities. The relationship between knowledge, perceptions and socio-demographic attributes on consumption of forest foods was also determined. A total of 279 females in charge of decision making with respect to food preparation were randomly selected from 12 villages in southern and eastern Cameroon and interviewed using researcher administered questionnaires. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to identify the factors affecting consumption of forest foods. Baillonella toxisperma (98%) and Irvingia gabonesis (81%) were the most known nutrient rich forest foods by the respondents. About 31% of the respondents were aware of the nutritional value and health benefits of forest foods. About 10%-61% of the respondents expressed positive attitudes to questions related with health benefits of specific forest foods. Consumption of forest foods was found to be higher among polygamous families and also positively related to length of stay in the forest area and age of respondent with consumption of forest foods. Education had an inverse relationship with use of forest foods. Knowledge and positive attitude towards the nutritional value of forest foods were also found to positively influence consumption of forest foods. Since knowledge was found to influence attitude and consumption, there is need to invest in awareness campaigns to strengthen the current knowledge levels among the study population. This should positively influence the attitudes and perceptions towards increased consumption of forest foods.","AcknowledgementsThe authors wish to thank the Congo Basin Forest Fund (CBFF) (5650155000601) of the African Development Bank and the CGIAR Research Programme on Forests, Trees and Agroforestry for the funding support.

A total of 80 gram-negative strains isolated from various freshwater Chilean salmonid farms were studied. We determined that 10 strains belonging to the genus Pseudomonas inhibited at least one of the assayed fish pathogens. Of these, nine strains were able to produce siderophores and two strains were able to inhibit the growth of all assayed pathogenic species. When the 80 strains were examined for QS-blocking activity, only the strains Pseudomonas sp. FF16 and Raoultella planticola R5B1 were identified as QS blockers. When the QS-blocker strains were analyzed for their ability to produce homoserine lactone (HSL) molecules, thin-layer chromatography analysis showed that both strains were able to produce C6-HSL- and C8-HSL-type molecules. Strain R5B1 did not show growth inhibition properties, but strain FF16 also led to inhibition of growth in A. hydrophila and F. psychrophilum as well as to siderophore production. Pseudomonas sp.

The concept was expected to ease the transferability of best practices in city logistics, by analyzing similarities and differences between zones. This research uses a quantitative methodology to apply the LP concept, and assess its potential, using the city of Lisbon as a case study. The analysis is focused on: (a) the extrapolation of freight trip generation per establishment and delivery characteristics from a sample of commercial establishments to the population within the case study, (b) proposing a methodology to test the LPs, (c) testing the existence of proposed LPs. Freight trips have been extrapolated using a Multiple Classification Analysis (MCA) model. Freight delivery characteristics were attributed to establishments from a sample-based probability distribution. LPs were tested using a two-step cluster analysis. Some LPs have been matched with clusters of case-study zones, subject to case study particularities. Profile overlap was not an issue and occurrences were expected. The testing showed that Logistic Profiles have the potential for being used as a departure point for urban freight planning and policy analysis.","AcknowledgementsThe authors would like to thank: CML for providing the retail establishment database and EMEL for providing data on the geographical distribution of loading/unloading bays.

A number of 133 and 121 florfenicol-resistant strains were isolated from scallop larval cultures prior to their transfer to seawater and from effluent samples from 2 commercial hatcheries and identified by 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis, observing a predominance of the Pseudomonas, Pseudoalteromonas and Halomonas genera and exhibiting an important incidence of co-resistance to streptomycin, oxytetracycline and co-trimoxazole. A high percentage of strains from both hatcheries carried the floR gene (68.4% and 89.3% of strains), whereas a lower carriage of the cmlA gene was detected (27.1% and 54.5% of strains). The high prevalence of floR-carrying bacteria in reared scallop larvae and hatchery effluents contributes to enrich the marine resistome in marine environments, prompting the need of a continuous surveillance of these genes in the mariculture environments.",AcknowledgementsThis study was supported by the Science and Technology National Council (CONICYT) of Chile by the Project Grant No. 1090793.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of Streptomyces strains cultured with maize plants in relation to lindane removal.MethodsFour Streptomyces strains were cultured and added as both single and mixed cultures, along with maize plants, to artificially polluted hydroponic systems and soils. The effectiveness of the resulting soil bioremediation was then evaluated through phytotoxicity testing using lettuce seedlings.ResultsIn the hydroponic and soil experiments, similar levels of lindane removal were recorded in the inoculated and non-inoculated systems where maize plants were introduced. However, the vigor index (VI) of the maize plants was highest when grown in inoculated and artificially polluted soil. In the phytotoxicity assay, the VI of the lettuce seedlings increased with increasing bioremediation time for the soils, thus indicating the effectiveness of the process.ConclusionsSimilar levels of lindane removal were recorded in both inoculated and non-inoculated planted systems, indicating that pesticide removal was not significantly affected by the bacterial inoculant. However, inoculation an actinobacteria consortium led to an increase in the VI of the maize and protected the plants against the existing toxicity.

At latitude ∼19°30′S, a threshold between exoreic and endoreic drainage regimes is clearly associated with the latitudinal gradient imposed by the modern monsoon (carrying humidity from the Atlantic) and disposed obliquely over catchments draining the Andes to the Pacific. We summarize the geomorphic, geological and climatic data in the threshold area. We then use these data to constrain numerical experiments of drainage evolution. Data and experimental results are consistent with the development of a flat low-energy morphology, close to sea level, interrupted at ≤10 Ma by tectonic uplift prevailing to the present suggesting trench-ward relief growth by incorporation of the coastal Atacama region to the Andes mountain belt.","Work supported by an IPGP-Univ.

Data generated by volunteers were compared to the results from a professional survey, using an identical protocol. Litter was found in considerable quantities at the riversides and in the surface waters at all the sites investigated. A generalized linear mixed model analysis showed that the recorded litter densities did not differ between volunteers and professionals, even after controlling for river, site, or distance between sampling locations, demonstrating that the volunteers successfully applied the sampling protocol. Differences occurred with respect to litter composition, which is most likely due to difficulties in the classification of litter items and particles and to the underestimation of litter present in surface water samples. Even though this study was only conducted at a small number of rivers and sites, a comparatively consistent pattern of direct and intentional litter deposition at riversides was recorded, highlighting that river basins require more protection. The results also show that the citizen science approach can be a suitable means for more extensive litter surveys at riversides and in other natural environments.",Constructive suggestions from the anonymous reviewers helped to improve the manuscript.

Such model includes four factors: family cohesion and adaptability, family commitment with the business, the relationship between the owner-manager and the successor, and the planning and training of the successor.   Findings – The results confirm the relevance of the four factors used and enable the authors to identify the structure of their coefficients within each factor.   Originality/value – Family involvement constitutes one of the most influential factors in the complex management of family businesses, as it can even threaten their survival. One of the most critical moments in the life of a family business is the interaction during the succession process. Therefore, the succession process continues to be a topic of growing interest to researchers in the family business literature.

Cluster-randomized controlled trials were carried out to examine effects on sexual practices of school-based interventions among adolescents in three sites in sub-Saharan Africa. In this publication, effects on communication about sexuality with significant adults (including parents) and such communication as a mediator of other outcomes were examined. Belonging to the intervention group was significantly associated with fewer reported sexual debuts in Dar es Salaam only (OR 0.648). Effects on communication with adults about sexuality issues were stronger for Dar es Salaam than for the other sites. In Dar, increase in communication with adults proved to partially mediate associations between intervention and a number of social cognition outcomes. The hypothesized mediational effect of communication on sexual debut was not confirmed. Promoting intergenerational communication on sexuality issues is associated with several positive outcomes and therefore important. Future research should search for mediating factors influencing behavior beyond those examined in the present study.",,,AIDS and Behavior,,,Adolescent; Adult; Communication; Female; HIV Infections; Humans; Male; Parent-Child Relations; Parents; Schools; Sexual Behavior; Sexuality; South Africa; Tanzania,2015-02-28,2015,2015-02-28,2015-12,19,12,2162-2176,Closed,Article,"Namisi, Francis; Aarø, Leif Edvard; Kaaya, Sylvia; Kajula, Lusajo J.; Kilonzo, Gad.

The identification of the device type or the make and model of image source are two important branches of forensic analysis of digital images. In this paper we have addressed both of these, with an approach based on different types of image features and the classification using support vector machines. The study has mainly focused on images created with mobile devices and as a result, the techniques and features have been adapted or created for this purpose. There have been a total of 36 experiments classified into 5 sets, in order to test different configurations of the techniques. In the configuration of the experiments, the future use of the technique by the forensic analyst in real situations to create experiments with high technical requirements was taken into account, amongst other things.","Part of the computations of this work were performed in EOLO, the HPC of Climate Change of the International Campus of Excellence of Moncloa, funded by MECD and MICINN.",,Multimedia Tools and Applications,,,,2015-05-14,2015,2015-05-14,2016-06,75,12,7087-7111,Closed,Article,"Sandoval Orozco, Ana Lucila; Corripio, Jocelin Rosales; García Villalba, Luis Javier; Hernández Castro, Julio César","Sandoval Orozco, Ana Lucila (Group of Analysis, Security and Systems (GASS), Department of Software Engineering and Artificial Intelligence (DISIA), Faculty of Computer Science and Engineering, Office 431, Universidad Complutense de Madrid (UCM), Calle Profesor José García Santesmases, 9, Ciudad Universitaria, 28040, Madrid, Spain); Corripio, Jocelin Rosales (Group of Analysis, Security and Systems (GASS), Department of Software Engineering and Artificial Intelligence (DISIA), Faculty of Computer Science and Engineering, Office 431, Universidad Complutense de Madrid (UCM), Calle Profesor José García Santesmases, 9, Ciudad Universitaria, 28040, Madrid, Spain); García Villalba, Luis Javier (Group of Analysis, Security and Systems (GASS), Department of Software Engineering and Artificial Intelligence (DISIA), Faculty of Computer Science and Engineering, Office 431, Universidad Complutense de Madrid (UCM), Calle Profesor José García Santesmases, 9, Ciudad Universitaria, 28040, Madrid, Spain); Hernández Castro, Julio César (School of Computing, Office S129A, University of Kent, Cornwallis South Building, CT2 7NF, Canterbury, UK)","García Villalba, Luis Javier (Complutense University of Madrid)","Sandoval Orozco, Ana Lucila (Complutense University of Madrid); Corripio, Jocelin Rosales (Complutense University of Madrid); García Villalba, Luis Javier (Complutense University of Madrid); Hernández Castro, Julio César (University of Kent)",9,1,,2.22,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1026269199,46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4603 Computer Vision and Multimedia Computation; 4604 Cybersecurity and Privacy; 4605 Data Management and Data Science,

Thus, several strategies have evolved in each tissue in order to balance nutrient supply with energy demand. Adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is now recognized as a key participant in energy metabolism. It ensures an appropriate energetic supply by promoting energy conserving pathways in detriment of anabolic processes not essential for cell survival. Vascular AMPK plays a critical role in the regulation of blood flow and vascular tone through several mechanisms, including vasodilation by stimulating nitric oxide release in endothelial cells. Since obesity leads to endothelial damage and AMPK dysregulation, AMPK activation might be an important strategy to restore vascular function in cardiometabolic alterations. In the present review we focus on the role of vascular AMPK in both endothelial and smooth muscle cells, paying special attention to its dysregulation in obesity- and high-fat diet-related complications, as well as to the mechanisms and benefits of vascular AMPK activation.","AcknowledgmentsThis work was supported by grants from Ministerio de Economía y Competitividad (BFU2011-25303), Grupos UCM (GR-921641), Fundación Universitaria CEU-San Pablo, Fundación Mutua Madrileña and SESCAMET.

These relationships fuel “bonding social capital” within informal economies as people rely on others to work, consume, and cope with scarce resources. At the same time, policy agendas encourage business growth and social mobility by shifting informal microenterprises into the formal economy. However, success in formalized contexts requires a different form of social capital—that is, “bridging social capital” with people outside one's immediate social network and across institutional structures. Yet policy programs often stop short of addressing how subsistence entrepreneurs manage the inherent tensions across these forms of social capital. As such, this study unpacks the contextual value of social capital using data collected with street vendors in an urban Latin American setting. The analysis identifies four entrepreneurial paths pursued by street vendors and articulates the relative value of bonding and bridging social capital across different economic and social positions. The findings advance insights for a community-centric public policy approach and offer guidance for segmentation and value proposition development within subsistence entrepreneurship programs.",,,Journal of Public Policy & Marketing,,,,2015-09-01,2015,2015-09-01,2015-09,34,2,272-286,Closed,Article,"Barrios, Andrés; Blocker, Christopher P.","Barrios, Andrés (Department of Marketing, Universidad de los Andes.); Blocker, Christopher P.

During the 19th century, craniometric studies suggested that the Botocudo resembled more the Paleoamerican population of Lagoa Santa than typical Native Americans groups. These results suggest that the Botocudo Indians might represent a population that retained the biological characteristics of early groups of the continent, remaining largely isolated from groups that gave origin to the modern Native South American variation. Moreover, recently, some of the Botocudo remains have been shown to have mitochondrial and autosomal DNA lineages currently found in Polynesian populations. Here, we explore the morphological affinities of Botocudo skulls within a worldwide context. Distinct multivariate analyses based on 32 craniometric variables show that 1) the two individuals with Polynesian DNA sequences have morphological characteristics that fall within the Polynesian and Botocudo variation, making their assignation as Native American specimens problematic, and 2) there are high morphological affinities between Botocudo, Early Americans, and the Polynesian series of Easter Island, which support the early observations that the Botocudo can be seen as retaining the Paleoamerican morphology, particularly when the neurocranium is considered. Although these results do not elucidate the origin of the Polynesian DNA lineages among the Botocudo, they support the hypothesis that the Botocudo represent a case of late survival of ancient Paleoamerican populations, retaining the morphological characteristics of ancestral Late Pleistocene populations from Asia.",The authors are greatly indebted to the curators and colleagues of the institutions that house these collections.,,American Journal of Biological Anthropology,,,"Anthropology, Physical; Brazil; Cephalometry; Female; Human Migration; Humans; Indians, South American; Male; Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander; Polynesia; Skull",2015-02-07,2015,2015-02-07,2015-06,157,2,202-216,Closed,Article,"Strauss, André; Hubbe, Mark; Neves, Walter A; Bernardo, Danilo V; Atuí, João Paulo V","Strauss, André (Department of Human Evolution, Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology, Leipzig, Germany.); Hubbe, Mark (Department of Anthropology, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH.; Instituto de Investigaciones Arqueológicas y Museo, Universidad Católica del Norte, San Pedro de Atacama, Chile.); Neves, Walter A (Laboratório de Estudos Evolutivos Humanos, Departamento de Genética e Biologia Evolutiva, Instituto de Biociências, Universidade de São Paulo, São Paulo, Brazil.); Bernardo, Danilo V (Instituto de Ciências Humanas e da Informação, Universidade Federal do Rio Grande, Rio Grande, Brazil.); Atuí, João Paulo V (Laboratório de Estudos Evolutivos Humanos, Departamento de Genética e Biologia Evolutiva, Instituto de Biociências, Universidade de São Paulo, São Paulo, Brazil.)","Strauss, André (Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology)","Strauss, André (Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology); Hubbe, Mark (The Ohio State University; Catholic University of the North); Neves, Walter A (Universidade de São Paulo); Bernardo, Danilo V (Federal University of Rio Grande); Atuí, João Paulo V (Universidade de São Paulo)",26,2,0.43,8.12,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1050735403,"31 Biological Sciences; 3105 Genetics; 43 History, Heritage and Archaeology; 4301 Archaeology; 4303 Historical Studies; 44 Human Society; 4401 Anthropology",

While intensely debated, the primary hypotheses focus on either a single dispersal or multiple dispersals out of the continent. Here, we use the human fossil record from Africa and the Levant, as well as an exceptionally large dataset of Holocene human crania sampled from Asia, to model ancestor-descendant relationships along hypothetical dispersal routes. We test the spatial and temporal predictions of competing out-of-Africa models by assessing the correlation of geographical distances between populations and measures of population differentiation derived from quantitative cranial phenotype data. Our results support a model in which extant Australo-Melanesians are descendants of an initial dispersal out of Africa by early anatomically modern humans, while all other populations are descendants of a later migration wave. Our results have implications for understanding the complexity of modern human origins and diversity.","This work was supported by the Senckenberg Gesellschaft für Naturforschung and the Eberhard Karls Universität Tübingen.

In the eastern side it is fed by springs that discharge groundwater of the nearby volcanic aquifers. The area is arid: rainfall does not exceed 200mm/year in the rainiest parts. The stable isotopic content of spring water shows that the recharge is originated mainly from winter rain, snow melt, and to a lesser extent from some short and intense sporadic rainfall events. Most of the spring water outflowing in the northern side of Laguna Tuyajto is recharged in the Tuyajto volcano. Most of the spring water in the eastern side and groundwater are recharged at higher elevations, in the rims of the nearby endorheic basins of Pampa Colorada and Pampa Las Tecas to the East. The presence of tritium in some deep wells in Pampa Colorada and Pampa Las Tecas indicates recent recharge. Gas emission in recent volcanoes increase the sulfate content of atmospheric deposition and this is reflected in local groundwater. The chemical composition and concentration of spring waters are the result of meteoric water evapo-concentration, water-rock interaction, and mainly the dissolution of old and buried evaporitic deposits. Groundwater flow is mostly shallow due to a low permeability ignimbrite layer of regional extent, which also hinders brine spreading below and around the lake. High deep temperatures near the recent Tuyajto volcano explain the high dissolved silica contents and the δ(18)O shift to heavier values found in some of the spring waters. Laguna Tuyajto is a terminal lake where salts cumulate, mostly halite, but some brine transfer to the Salar de Aguas Calientes-3 cannot be excluded. The hydrogeological behavior of Laguna Tuyajto constitutes a model to understand the functioning of many other similar basins in other areas in the Andean Altiplano.","This research was supported by the Anillo Project ACT1203 of the CONICYT of Chile, with the collaboration of the REDESAC Project CGL2009-12910-C03-01, MINECO, Spain.

About 4000 m of high‐resolution stratigraphic columns of the Tonel, Purilactis and Barros Arana Formations reveal braided fluvial and alluvial facies, typical of arid to semi‐arid environments, interrupted by scarce intervals with evaporitic, aeolian and lacustrine sedimentation, displaying an overall coarsening‐upward trend. Clast‐count and point‐count data evidence the progressive erosion from Mesozoic volcanic rocks to Palaeozoic basement granitoids and deposits located around the Cordillera de Domeyko area, which is indicative of an unroofing process. The palaeocurrent data show that the source area was located to the west. The U/Pb detrital zircon geochronological data give maximum depositional ages of 149 Ma for the base of the Tonel Formation (Agua Salada Member), and 107 Ma for its middle member (La Escalera Member); 79 Ma for the lower Purilactis Formation (Limón Verde Member), and 73 Ma for the Barros Arana Formation. The sources of these zircons were located mainly to the west, and comprised from the Coastal Cordillera to the Precordillera. The ages and pulses record the tectonic activity during the Peruvian Phase, which can be split into two large events; an early phase, around 107 Ma, showing uplift of the Coastal Cordillera area, and a late phase around 79 Ma indicating an eastward jump of the deformation front to the Cordillera de Domeyko area. The lack of internal deformation and the thicknesses measured suggest that deposition of the units occurred in the foredeep zone of an eastward‐verging basin. This sedimentation would have ended with the K‐T phase, recognized in most of northern Chile.","Acknowledgements The authors thank and acknowledge the contributions and funding by the SERNAGEOMIN 1:100.000 National Mapping Project.

En contraste, el talento humano capacitado es escaso y los programas de educación superior posgraduada tienen menos de 15 años. No se conoce tampoco el número de egresados ni su distribución.Materiales y métodoSe realizó una investigación documental en busca de trabajos que estudiaran el talento humano en UCI y su asociación con desenlaces primarios y secundarios. Igualmente se revisó las normas colombianas sobre el tema.ResultadosSe encontraron 120 artículos nacionales e internacionales. Se revisó la norma colombiana desde 1990 hasta la fecha. Se incluyeron los estudios descriptivos, analíticos o experimentales en inglés y español.Discusión y conclusionesHay un número importante de camas de UCI en Colombia, tanto pediátricas como neonatales y de adultos. Aun así, el número de profesionales con posgrado en cuidado crítico no es suficiente, lo que hace que escaseen en donde se necesitan. La evidencia demuestra, ampliamente, mejores desenlaces cuando los pacientes críticos son manejados por el talento humano mejor capacitado. Esta falta de planificación y control en el sector genera una distribución inequitativa que no necesariamente se compadece con las necesidades reales. Un problema mayor es la falta de estandarización de esta necesidad (carga de trabajo) y la competencia del talento humano en las actualizaciones de la norma y por las asociaciones científicas. Se requiere un mayor esfuerzo entre universidad, asociación y ministerio para impulsar la ocupación de estas plazas por personal idóneo y suficiente, y establecer las estrategias de referencia oportuna para los sitios más dispersos, con el fin de que los pacientes lleguen debidamente a donde se les pueda brindar un mejor cuidado.AbstractIntroductionThe number of intensive care units (ICU) in Colombia has increased in the last 25 years and its magnitude is not well known. In contrast, trained human resources are scarce, and postgraduate higher education programs have been available for less than 15 years. The distribution and number of graduated practitioners needs to be known.Materials and methodA literature search was performed looking for studies on human resources in ICU and their association with primary and secondary outcomes. The Colombian regulations were also reviewed.ResultsOne hundred and twenty national and international articles were found. Colombian regulations from 1990 to date were reviewed. Descriptive, analytical or experimental studies in English or Spanish were included.Discussion and conclusionsThere are a significant number of adult, pediatric and neonatal ICU beds in Colombia. Nevertheless, there is an insufficient number of critical care trained practitioners, which make them scarce where they are needed. The evidence broadly shows better outcomes when critical care patients are treated by the best-trained human resources. This lack of planning and control in the sector generates an unfair distribution, not necessarily based on the actual needs. A bigger problem is the lack of standardization of this need (load of work) and the quality of human talent in the upgrades of the rulings and by the scientific associations. A greater effort is required between universities, associations and health ministry to promote coverage of these vacancies with suitable and ideal staff, and to establish timely referral strategies for remote sites so that patients may receive a better care.",AgradecimientosA la AMCI por la divulgación de estos hallazgos.,,Acta Colombiana de Cuidado Intensivo,,,,2015-04,2015,,2015-04,15,2,80-102,Closed,Article,"Gutiérrez, Norton Pérez; Darabos, Emma Isabel Rodríguez","Gutiérrez, Norton Pérez (Medicina Crítica y Cuidado Intensivo, UCI Hospital Departamental de Villavicencio, Corporación Clínica Universidad Cooperativa de Colombia, Universidad Cooperativa de Colombia, Villavicencio, Colombia; Grupo de Investigación de Villavicencio (GRIVI), Villavicencio, Colombia); Darabos, Emma Isabel Rodríguez (Gerencia y Gestión de Servicios de Salud, Maestría en Sistemas Integrados de Gestión, A&R Gestión, Villavicencio, Colombia; Grupo de Investigación de Villavicencio (GRIVI), Villavicencio, Colombia)","Gutiérrez, Norton Pérez (Cooperative University of Colombia; Grupo de Investigación de Villavicencio (GRIVI), Villavicencio, Colombia)","Gutiérrez, Norton Pérez (Cooperative University of Colombia; Grupo de Investigación de Villavicencio (GRIVI), Villavicencio, Colombia); Darabos, Emma Isabel Rodríguez (Gerencia y Gestión de Servicios de Salud, Maestría en Sistemas Integrados de Gestión, A&R Gestión, Villavicencio, Colombia; Grupo de Investigación de Villavicencio (GRIVI), Villavicencio, Colombia)",11,4,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1007989845,,

In the Andes, we hypothesized that political and environmental changes around AD 1100 resulted in behavioral changes, visible as shifts in paleodiet and paleomobility, among individuals in the San Pedro de Atacama oases and Loa River Valley. To investigate this hypothesis, we generated carbon and oxygen isotope data from cemeteries dating to the early Middle Horizon (Larache, Quitor-5, Solor-3), late Middle Horizon (Casa Parroquial, Coyo Oriental, Coyo-3, Solcor-Plaza, Solcor-3, Tchecar), and Late Intermediate Period (Caspana, Quitor-6 Tardío, Toconce, Yaye-1, Yaye-2, Yaye-3, Yaye-4). Carbon isotope data demonstrate a greater range of carbon sources during the late Middle Horizon compared with the Late Intermediate Period; while most individuals consumed largely C3 sources, some late Middle Horizon individuals consumed more C4 sources. Oxygen isotope data demonstrate greater diversity in drinking water sources during the late Middle Horizon compared with the Late Intermediate Period. Water samples were analyzed to provide baseline data on oxygen isotope variability within the Atacama Desert, and demonstrated that oxygen isotope values are indistinguishable in the San Pedro and Loa Rivers. However, oxygen isotope values in water sources in the high-altitude altiplano and coast are distinct from those in the San Pedro and Loa Rivers. In conclusion, instead of utilizing a wider variety of resources after environmental and political changes, individuals exhibited a wider range of paleodietary and paleomobility strategies during the Middle Horizon, a period of environmental and political stability.","The authors thank Mark Hubbe, Blair Daverman, Laura King, William Pestle, M.

A lack of comprehensive age information leads to poor understanding of life history schedules, difficulty in estimation of parameters necessary for modeling population dynamics, and uncertainty in the determination of appropriate harvest levels. This study applied a novel direct age determination method based on band counts to three Chilean crustacean species: red squat lobster (Pleuroncodes monodon), yellow squat lobster (Curvimunida johni), and nylon shrimp (Heterocarpus reedi) for the first time. The growth bands were observed and counted in the endocuticle layer in thin longitudinal sections of the meso-cardiac ossicles of the gastric mills in the two squat lobster species and in the eyestalks of the nylon shrimp. Comparison of growth band counts with independent estimates of age strongly suggests that the bands form annually, thus providing a direct and accurate method of age determination in all of the species examined. Sex-specific growth curves were produced and demonstrated that the females grow at a slower rate than the males in the three species. Size and age-at-sexual maturity were also estimated. Application of this technique to known-age individuals will be necessary to validate band counts as indicators of chronological age.",,,Fisheries Research,,,,2015-10,2015,,2015-10,170,,134-143,Closed,Article,"Kilada, Raouf; Acuña, Enzo","Kilada, Raouf (Biology Department, University of New Brunswick (Saint John), 100 Tucker Park Road, PO Box 5050, Saint John, NB, Canada E2L 4L5; Department of Marine Science, Suez Canal University, Ismailia, Egypt); Acuña, Enzo (Departamento de Biología Marina, Universidad Católica del Norte, Casilla 117, Coquimbo, Chile; Millennium Nucleus for Ecology and Sustainable Management of Oceanic Islands (ESMOI), Coquimbo, Chile)","Kilada, Raouf (University of New Brunswick; Suez Canal University)","Kilada, Raouf (University of New Brunswick; Suez Canal University); Acuña, Enzo (Catholic University of the North; Millennium Nucleus for Ecology and Sustainable Management of Oceanic Islands (ESMOI), Coquimbo, Chile)",29,4,,4.3,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1026355415,"30 Agricultural, Veterinary and Food Sciences; 3005 Fisheries Sciences",
423,pub.1026331000,10.1007/s11024-015-9272-7,,,Reaching for the Stars? Astronomy and Growth in Chile,"While scholars and policy practitioners often advocate for science and technology transfer as a motor for economic growth, many in Latin America have long warned of the pitfalls of such top-down, North-South transfers. To many in Latin America, scientific aid or cooperation from the North has often reproduced hierarchies that perpetuate dependency. Large astronomy observatories located in Chile – with a high price tag, cutting-edge technology, and seen to answer seemingly arcane research questions – seem ripe for reproducing precisely these kinds of hierarchical relationships. Using data from documents, interviews, and a site visit to Gemini South, one of several large telescopes in Chile, this paper takes a historical perspective to examine how resilient these hierarchical relationships are. Over forty years, astronomy in Chile grew thanks to new policies that fostered cooperation among universities and gave locals privileged access to the telescopes. But the community also grew in ways that reproduced dependency: foreign science benefits significantly, the Chilean state operates in top-down ways, and its support for science leaves it blind to the benefits high-tech telescopes deliver to Chile, which are not linked to export-led growth. The state appears as both an obstacle and an enabler to the growth of a national scientific community.",,This work was supported by the Social Science Research Council’s pre-dissertation research program and by Gemini South.,Minerva,,,,2015-04-17,2015,2015-04-17,2015-06,53,2,141-164,Closed,Article,"Barandiaran, Javiera","Barandiaran, Javiera (Global and International Studies Program, University of California, Santa Barbara, SSMS 2129, 93106, Santa Barbara, CA, USA)","Barandiaran, Javiera (University of California, Santa Barbara)","Barandiaran, Javiera (University of California, Santa Barbara)",13,3,,6.52,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1026331000,39 Education; 3903 Education Systems; 50 Philosophy and Religious Studies; 5002 History and Philosophy Of Specific Fields,

From 2001 through 2007 the emission lines from the new nebula showed an exponential decline in flux, consistent with a shock that occurred around 1998 and started cooling soon afterwards. Since 2008 the line fluxes have been continuously rising again. Our preliminary interpretation is that this emission comes from a region close to the central star, and is excited by a second shock, which may have been induced by an increase in the stellar mass loss and wind velocity associated with a rise in the stellar temperature.",,,EAS Publications Series,,"E.

In order to confirm this hypothesis and to understand the impact of the carbon metabolism in the metallurgical performance, the expression levels of carbon fixation pathways were investigated in a chalcopyrite bioleaching column test by transcriptomic analysis. The community structure, the physicochemical conditions and the metallurgical parameters were also analyzed.

The findings of the paper are juxtaposed against particular group interests in the educational use of a language as well as differences in the affordances and impact of different modes of language use.

The Antarctic fur seal, Arctocephalus gazella, has a wide distribution range and breeds primarily in subantarctic and Antarctic locations of the Southern Ocean. We report the first record of this species in northern Chile in August, 2014. Although no external trauma was observed, the seal was presumed to be sick because it appeared to be underweight. This sighting is the northernmost record of this species on islands and the continental coastal areas of the southeastern South Pacific.","The Millennium Nucleus ESMOI NC120030 of the Millennium Scientific Initiative of the Chilean government funded this research.

The microbial community structure was assessed by DNA extraction/PCR/DGGE and secuencing for the 16S rRNA gene and the geochemistry was analyzed using several approaches. Prediction of metagenome functional content was performed from the 16S rRNA gene survey using the bioinformatics software package Phylogenetic Investigation of Communities by Reconstruction of Unobserved States (PICRUSt). The geochemical results revealed a much lower iron concentration in the salt flat than in AMD systems (39 and 21804 mg L-1, respectively) and a significant difference in chloride levels. Sequences inferred to be from potential sulfur metabolizing organisms constituted up to 70% of the microbial community in the acidic salt flat meanwhile predominat iron-metabolizing acidophile populations were reported in AMD systems. Interestingly, the microbial assemblage in the acidic salt flat was dominated by mixotrophic and organotrophic sulfur oxidizers as well as by photoautotrophic acidophiles. Our results suggests that the salt concentration in Salar de Gorbea (average Cl-= 40 gL-1) is in the limit for the occurrence of chemolithotrophic oxidation of sulfur compounds. In addition, the investigation allows concluding that salinity rather than extremes of pH is the major environmental determinant of microbial community composition.",,,Advanced Materials Research,,,,2015-11,2015,2015-11,2015-12-30,1130,,63-66,Closed,Article,"Escudero, Lorena; Bijman, Jonathan; Mariela, Guajardo M.; Mur, Juan José Pueyo; Chong, Guillermo; Demergasso, Cecilia","Escudero, Lorena (Universidad Católica del Norte, Centro de Biotecnología, Avda Angamos, Chile, Antofagasta, 0610); Bijman, Jonathan (Universidad Católica del Norte, Centro de Biotecnología, Antofagasta, Chile, Avenida Angamos 0610); Mariela, Guajardo M.

Ferrous iron oxiding microorganisms are key players in the process, as ferric iron is absolutely required to solubilize metal sulfide ores. Members of the Sulfobacillus genus (able to oxidize ferrous iron) were predominant (22 - 95%) in a chalcopyrite bioleaching columns test. In order to obtain new insight about the mechanism of iron oxidation in Sulfobacillus we investigated the presence and expression of genes potentially related to iron oxidation by Sulfobacillus, especially the group of the so-called blue-copper proteins rusticyanin (rus) and sulfocyanin (soxE) in the course of the experiment. The physicochemical parameters and the population dynamics were monitored periodically in the columns and the metatranscriptome was analyzed by using pyro-sequencing. The average temperature inside the column ranged from 22 to 57 °C and the Fe(II) oxidation rate at 45 °C varied between 8 and 42 mg L-1h-1 along 300 days of operation. The metatranscriptomic analysis reveals an over-expression of 9-13 folds of the putative rus and soxE genes in four strains of Sulfobacillus spp. when the Sulfobacillus proportion in the column was >80% and the Fe(II) oxidation rate measured at 45 °C reached 10 mg L-1h-1. Some cytochromes from the electron transport chain were also over-expressed, on a range of 7 - 10 folds under those operational conditions. These results support the hypothetical participation of blue-copper proteins in the iron oxidation pathway of Sulfobacilli. Culture assays and more specific expression analysis are necessary in order to confirm this hypothesis. In addition, we attempt to establish the relationship between rusticyanin and sulfocyanin genes and perform a protein sequence analysis that allows us to infer the actual function of these proteins in Sulfobacillus species.",,,Advanced Materials Research,,,,2015-11,2015,2015-11,2015-12-30,1130,,333-337,Closed,Article,"Acosta, Mauricio; Galleguillos, Pedro A.; Marín, Sabrina; Chibwana, Clement; Strauss, Hannes; Demergasso, Cecilia","Acosta, Mauricio (Universidad Católica del Norte, Centro de Biotecnología, Antofagasta, Chile, Avda.

In addition, the effect of pH and gypsum precipitation from calcium ions (Ca2+) and sulfate ions (SO42−) ions in saline water on the recovery of the molybdenite was analyzed. It was found that the floatability of molybdenite fines significantly increased with the ionic strength of the saline solutions and is independent of pH above 0.5 mol/L ionic strength. The high floatability of molybdenite in saline solutions is explained as being due to the low electrostatic repulsion between bubbles and the edges of molybdenite particles, which is exceeded by interactions due to van der Waals and hydrophobic forces. The precipitation of Ca2+ and SO42− ions as gypsum had a detrimental effect on the natural floatability of molybdenite because of gypsum crystal attachment on the faces of the molybdenite particles. This precipitation phenomenon may be initiated in copper-molybdenite flotation circuits that use recycled saline water, like seawater containing Ca2+ and SO42− ions.",,,"Mining, Metallurgy & Exploration",,,,2015-11-01,2015,2015-11-01,2015-11,32,4,203-208,Closed,Article,"Lucay, F.; Cisternas, L.

These two schools are best known for their role in the 1976 Soweto uprising, but I move away from this aspect of their history and, instead, analyse them as institutions of learning and as crucial generators of Soweto's professional elite over several decades. This article focuses on the schools as they operated under the Bantu Education system from the late 1950s until the mid 1970s. During the 1960s the Nationalist government was hostile to the very notion of African secondary schooling in the cities. Yet in spite of an authoritarian and repressive state bureaucracy, a lack of resources, and overcrowding, the schools established themselves as credible institutions of learning. Under the firm leadership of T.W. Kambule and Lekgau Mathabathe, they attracted talented, dedicated staff and highly motivated students. Working within the state system inevitably aroused suspicions and tensions; nevertheless, the schools offered the most likely avenue for ordinary Sowetan families to achieve some form of professional upward mobility.",,,Journal of Southern African Studies,,,,2015-01-02,2015,2015-01-19,2015-01-02,41,1,159-171,Closed,Article,"Glaser, Clive","Glaser, Clive (University of the Witwatersrand)",,"Glaser, Clive (University of the Witwatersrand)",10,1,,3.72,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1009729112,"39 Education; 3901 Curriculum and Pedagogy; 3902 Education Policy, Sociology and Philosophy",4 Quality Education

The discussion which follows looks at a selection of schools’ and universities’ Latin mottoes and offers some background to these phrases and why these (mostly exhortations) have been adopted.

The monoclinic phase was prepared via a conventional solid-state reaction, whereas the orthorhombic phase was obtained via a facile, low-temperature combustion synthesis method. X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), and photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy were used to characterize the resulting phosphors. The XRD results indicate the orthorhombic phase crystallized isostructurally with the Aurivillius Bi2WO6 phase, whereas the other polymorph crystallized isostructurally with Yb2WO6 in the monoclinic system. The SEM studies revealed both phases had a strong tendency to form agglomerates averaging nanometers in size. The photoluminescence emission spectra confirmed all of the samples were efficiently excited by near UV light and were dominated by the electric dipole transition 5D0→7F2. The orthorhombic Y2−xEuxWO6 excitation spectrum possessed a broad band across the entire UV region (220–400nm); therefore, Y1.86Eu0.14WO6 could be considered an efficient spectral converter material for use in dye-sensitized solar cells.","AcknowledgmentsThis work was financially supported by a Grant from FONDECYT (Chile), No. 1130248; D.E. acknowledges CONICYT for providing a doctoral fellowship.",,Journal of Alloys and Compounds,,,,2015-04,2015,,2015-04,628,,352-356,Closed,Article,"Llanos, Jaime; Olivares, Douglas; Manríquez, Víctor; Espinoza, Darío; Brito, Ivan","Llanos, Jaime (Departamento de Química, Universidad Católica del Norte, Avda.

The interest of this study lies in the economic, political and social impacts on a large number of countries with economies based on non-renewable mineral resources. Our approach uses the theoretical foundation of nonlinear dynamic systems for the characterization and analysis of the time series with chaotic component, by using nonlinear tools and methods. Recurrence visual analysis, the Fourier spectrum, the autocorrelation function, mutual information and the Lyapunov exponents are the methods used in the analysis phase of the series, and then a predictive model was generated using nonlinear system techniques. The results identify two cycles of copper prices and price forecasts in the short term. These cycles are connected by a transient and provide further evidence of the effect of investment cycles and infrastructure industries to the value of commodities.",,,IEEE Latin America Transactions,,,,2015-07-22,2015,2015-07-22,,13,6,1961-1965,Closed,Article,"Carrasco, Raul; Vargas, Manuel; Soto, Ismael; Fuertes, Guillermo; Alfaro, Miguel","Carrasco, Raul (Univ. de Santiago de Chile, Santiago, Chile); Vargas, Manuel (Univ.

Here we present the observational evidence that Gl 504 A is an evolved turn-off star of about solar age and by inference its faint companion a low-mass brown dwarf. As with our previous work on Gl 504 A several years ago, we suggest the accretion of a substellar object to account for the otherwise unexplained high rotation of Gl 504 A.

322,pub.1035244419,10.1002/asna.201512100,,,Variable stars in the Bochum Galactic Disk Survey,"Abstract  We present a first overview of variable stars in the Bochum Galactic Disk Survey (GDS) with emphasis on eclipsing binaries (EBs). This ongoing survey is performed by a robotic twin refractor at the Universitätssternwarte Bochum located near Cerro Armazones in Chile. It comprises a mosaic of 268 fields in a stripe of Δ b = ±3° along the Galactic plane observed once per month simultaneously in the Sloan r and i filters with a detection limit of r s ∼ 16 mag and i s ∼ 15 mag. The data from the first three years until the end of February 2014 yields a total of 41718 variable stars with variability amplitudes between 0.1–6 mag. A cross‐match with SIMBAD identified 11 465 of these variables unambiguously, while 2184 had multiple matches; most of the remaining stars could be matched with 2MASS objects. Among the SIMBAD‐listed objects with single matches, only 1982 turned out as known variables while a further 256 are suspected of variability. That leaves a total of 39480 potentially new variables. The group of known variables comprises 419 stars (21 %) that are classified as EBs while 443 (22%) are of other types; for the remaining 1120 catalogued variables (57 %) the type is unknown. Investigating variability as a function of spectral type, we find that SIMBAD provides spectral types for 2811 (25 %) of the identified stars. Spectral classes B (26 %), A (20 %), and M (25%) contain the most numerous variables, while all other classes contribute less than 10% each. More than half of the B (55 %) and A (56%) stars are designated as EBs, suggesting that hundreds of new B‐ and A‐type EBs may be contained in the GDS archive. In contrast, among the numerous M stars no EBs are known. (© 2015 WILEY‐VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

The primary outcome measures were the histological findings of the internal inguinal ring. Patients were divided into three groups according to age: group 1 included patients between 15 and 40 years of age, group 2 patients between 41 and 70 years of age, and group 3 patients older than 71 years of age.ResultsAll samples from the internal inguinal ring comprised fibrous fascial tissue with elastic fibres which were thicker in groups 1 and 2, and thinner in group 3 (p<0.0001). Adipose tissue between elastic fibres was absent in group 1 (p=0.003), and was present in group 3 (p=0.001). Vascular sclerosis was minimum in group 1, moderate in group 2, and important in group 3 (p<0.0001). Acute or chronic inflammatory cells were absent in all patients. These changes were more significant with age, according to the analysis with multiple linear regression.ConclusionsThe basic histological characteristics of the internal inguinal ring in patients with indirect inguinal hernia consisted of reduced density and thickness of elastic fibres, and increased adipose tissue between elastic fibres, changes which became more significant with increasing age. Vascular sclerosis was also more severe in older patients compared to younger patients. These histological changes all appeared to be related to ageing.",,,Hellenic Journal of Surgery,,,,2015-03,2015,2015-04-30,2015-03,87,2,121-127,Closed,Article,"Beltrán, Marcelo A.; Barría, Carlos; Rodríguez, Francisco; Arcos, Javier; Cruces, Karina S.","Beltrán, Marcelo A.

Nanoparticles and hybrid films were characterized by X-ray powder diffraction, Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and alternating gradient magnetometry (AGM).Experimental results indicated that the BT:Co nanoparticles were encapsulated in the QO/Pl hybrid films and that the magnetic properties of the QO/Pl/BT:Co nanocomposites are similar to the naked BT:Co nanoparticles. Results indicate that Co doping produces an enhancement in the ferromagnetic behavior of the BT nanoparticle. The coating restricts this enhancement only to low-fields, leaving the diamagnetic behavior of BT at high-fields.Magnetically stable sizes (PSD) were obtained at 3% Co doping for both naked nanoparticles and hybrid films. These show an increased magnetic memory capacity and a softer magnetic hardness with respect to non-doped BT nanoparticles.","AcknowledgmentsThis work has been financed by FONDECYT Grant under Contract no. 1110555.

Nevertheless, in recent years, several alien plant species has been found in Antarctica with negative effects on the native flora. In this study, we show a recolonization record of the most widespread plant invader in Antarctica (Poa annua) and the risk of a potential spreading in a highly visited site on the Antarctic Peninsula. Overall, two new P. annua individuals were recorded, where four specimens were previously reported and removed in 2010, suggesting that either a propagule load is continuous, or that a seed bank prevailed in the site. On the other hand, the spreading modeling suggests that the probability to colonize and spreading of P. annua increases notoriously with the possibility of dispersion of propagules, with consequent risk of displacement for the native flora. Biological invasions are a major threat to the integrity of native biodiversity in all biomes, and they have the potential to change irreversibly Antarctica’s fragile ecosystems.","This work was financed by the INACH (RT_11-13) project of the Chilean Antarctic Institute (INACH).

The main phases in copper anodes are metallic copper, including CuO, which are present in free form or associated with the presence of copper selenide or tellurides (Cu2(Se,Te)) and several Cu-Pb-Sb-As-Bi oxides. During electrorefining, the impurities in the anode release and are not deposited in the cathode, part of them dissolving and concentrated in the electrolyte, and others form a raw anode slime that contains Au, Ag, Cu, As, Se, Te and PGM, depending on the composition of the anode. There are several recovery processes, most of which involve acid leaching in the first step to dissolve copper, whose product is decopperized anode slime. SEM analysis revealed that the mineralogical species present in the raw anode slime under study were mainly eucarite (CuAgSe), naumannite (Ag2Se), antimony arsenate (SbAsO4), and lead sulfate (PbSO4).

The uncertainties are represented by normal, uniform and triangular probability distribution functions (PDFs). The case studies include the uncertainty in the recovery of each stage separately and simultaneously across all of the stages with different standard deviation levels. A total of 2880 cases were studied, which corresponded with twelve circuits, three distribution functions and 84 different combinations with standard deviations in the stage recoveries. For each case, 2000 simulations were performed, with an overall simulation total of 5.76 million. Among the conclusions obtained in this work are the following: 1) The shape of the distribution function in the output variables is dependent on the input distribution function, the concentration circuit and the uncertainty level; 2) when the recovery of a single stage is represented by a PDF, the other stage recoveries are assigned a deterministic value then the type of the PDF obtained for the global recovery is similar to the input distribution; 3) when considering uncertainty in several stages simultaneously, the resulting PDF type usually is not the same PDF type observed for the input variables; and 4) the circuit structure affects more than the stage recoveries in the analysis of the global recovery and concentrate grade.",AcknowledgmentsThe authors wish to thank CICITEM (R10C1004) and CONICYT (Fondecyt 1120794) for financial support.,,International Journal of Mineral Processing,,,,2015-10,2015,,2015-10,143,,12-17,Closed,Article,"Montenegro, Marcelo R.; Gálvez, Edelmira D.; Cisternas, Luis A.","Montenegro, Marcelo R.

The transition from high school to embark on university studies is one of the critical stages in a student life. This is the time when students have to learn new academic and social survival skills amongst others, without the guidance of their guardians. Most of these students, during the first months of university, struggle to balance between academic and new social demands brought by the new university environment. The study was conducted among 105 first year Public Administration students through a close-ended questionnaire. The paper therefore, compares experiences and strategies that are used for survival in the first year of university. The challenges identified during the data analysis are presented together with recommendations that can assist with survival strategies and therefore curb high dropout rates among first year students.",,,International Journal of Educational Sciences,,,,2015-04,2015,2017-09-25,2015-04,9,1,47-54,Closed,Article,"Mathebula, Ntwanano","Mathebula, Ntwanano (Department of Public Administration, Office 2042, Old K Block, University of Limpopo, South Africa)",,"Mathebula, Ntwanano (University of Limpopo)",0,0,,0.0,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1092879017,39 Education; 3901 Curriculum and Pedagogy; 3903 Education Systems,

This study investigates the phonetic/phonology features of L2 production such as pitch accent patterns, F0 ratio, and durational ratio of focused words. It was hypothesized that the Korean speakers who had been immersed early in the English-speaking environment would show prosodic features of English focus more similar to those of native English speakers than the Korean speakers who had been immersed late. Thirty subjects in three groups-Korean adults with the early immersion, Korean adults with the late immersion, and native English speakers as a control group-took part in the experiment. The result showed that the early immersion group produced more native-like focus features such as a more proportion of pitch-peak patterns and a longer duration. In realizing semantic focus, however, they failed to raise the F0s in the focused words in which native English speakers clearly showed the outstanding higher F0s. These results suggest that the early immersion on L2 focus acquisition is proved to be in the mid of language transfer.",,,Studies in Linguistics,,,,2015-04,2015,,2015-04,null,35,1-19,Closed,Article,강석한,강석한 (),,강석한 (),0,0,,0.0,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1040390251,"47 Language, Communication and Culture; 4703 Language Studies; 4704 Linguistics; 52 Psychology; 5202 Biological Psychology; 5204 Cognitive and Computational Psychology",

The new model is an expansion and modification of an existing model in the literature (Sepúlveda et al., 2014). The modifications extend the number of process groups from 35 to 143, which makes it possible to extend the number of concentration circuits that can be represented from 1492 to over 274 million circuits and to increase the maximum number of stages from 6 to 9. The errors observed between the fitting and the prediction results of concentration circuits that were not included in the fitting verifies that the new model could be extremely useful in the design of mineral concentration circuits.","Financial support from CONICYT (Fondecyt 1120794), CICITEM (R10C1004) and the Antofagasta Regional Government is gratefully acknowledged.",,Computers & Chemical Engineering,,,,2015-03,2015,,2015-03,74,,28-33,Closed,Article,"Lucay, Freddy; Cisternas, Luis A.; Gálvez, Edelmira D.","Lucay, Freddy (Process Technology, CICITEM, Antofagasta, Chile); Cisternas, Luis A.

The effect of Ag content on the properties of ZnO nanoparticles have been studied by various characterization techniques. The results from X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and Raman spectroscopy (RS) suggest that elemental silver is present as a second phase. The UV–visible absorption and photoluminescence (PL) properties of the samples were also studied. PL data at room temperature reveals a strong blue emission. In addition, Raman spectroscopy results indicate a very strong A1(LO) mode resulting from oxygen vacancies and zinc interstitials. A new local vibrational mode (LVM) at 480cm−1 induced by silver can also be observed in the Raman spectra, suggesting silver incorporation into the ZnO lattice compensating the Zn vacancies, which is consistent with the XRD results.","AcknowledgementsThis work has been partially supported by the Chilean Government Research Agencies FONDECYT (Grant no. 1150475), CONICYT-PIA (Grant no.

A total of 466 completed responses were obtained, of which 81 respondents indicated that they were invested directly in a South African equity unit trust to allow for statistical testing. The data obtained were analysed for evidence of overconfidence and anchoring by comparing respondents’ estimates of fund returns against historical returns and then checking whether they adjusted their estimate after being presented with an anchor. The study found that investors were under-confident rather than overconfident. Furthermore, it was found that older respondents were better able to estimate their past returns than younger respondents.

A detailed structural study of the incorporation of Fe into SrTiO3 nanoparticles is reported. Slightly iron-doped strontium titanate nanoparticles with 0, 1, 3 and 5 mol% concentration of iron were grown using a sol–gel hydrothermal process and characterised using Raman scattering, X-ray photoelectron and X-ray diffraction spectroscopy. The amorphisation of the nanostructures was observed as the iron content increased, which was confirmed by the TEM images. The XPS results indicated that the oxidation states of the Sr atoms were maintained in 2+. However, a mixture of Fe3+ and Fe4+ atoms was observed as the Fe content increased, resulting in a significant number of oxygen vacancies in the perovskite structure. The analysis of Raman spectra indicated that the intensity, linewidth and frequency shift of the TO4 phonon can be used as an indicator of the Fe content as well as a local temperature probe for future thermal analysis.Graphical abstractTemperature evolution of the Raman spectra of STO:Fe 1 mol%.

The article focuses mainly on the decline of moral values amongst Kgafela's subjects, which is caused by a lack of proper leadership and guidance. An incremental lowering of moral values in South African communities has been observed over the last decade, as evidenced by current reports in the media on greed, corruption, violence, drugs, sexual abuse and other criminal activities which negatively affect daily activities at various levels of society, such as schools, universities, churches, homes, the police force and government. The analysis of this poem will be used to illustrate that traditional poetry is not only meant to praise chiefs for their bravery, as some like to believe, but also to address the challenges of society. The general decline in values such as respect for authority, politeness and good manners, motivated the researcher to undertake this analysis to reveal the moral decline and to examine how the poem, although traditional, can play a positive role, even today, in addressing the challenges faced by modern society.",,,South African Journal of African Languages,,,,2015-07-03,2015,2015-12-18,2015-07-03,35,2,225-230,Closed,Article,Masote,"Masote (Department of African Languages, University of South Africa, Pretoria, South Africa)",Masote (University of South Africa),Masote (University of South Africa),1,1,,0.62,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1052408844,"47 Language, Communication and Culture; 4703 Language Studies; 4704 Linguistics","16 Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions"

Health services are not always accessible or available to citizens, especially those of previously disadvantaged or rural communities. The South African National Plan for Development 2030 aims to address these inequality and health issues. One focus area of this plan is the inclusion of recreation, leisure and sport as an important service sector to improve the health and well-being of all individuals. Therapeutic recreation could play an important role in this regard. In South Africa, therapeutic recreation is in its developmental stages. This paper aims to provide the reader with an overview of therapeutic recreation in South Africa as a developing profession. An overview of the current status of the profession is discussed in terms of standard of practice and as it relates to health professions and recreation service providers, programmes with therapeutic value and training needs. The study concludes that there is still groundwork to be done, calling for interested parties to embark on an aggressive advocacy and strategic planning process to develop therapeutic recreation as a profession in South Africa.",,,World Leisure Journal,,,,2015-01-02,2015,2015-01-22,2015-01-02,57,1,34-45,Closed,Article,"Young, Marié E.M.","Young, Marié E.M.

Here tsunami characteristics are analyzed through a combination of field data and numerical modeling. Despite the earthquake magnitude, the tsunami was moderate, with a relatively uniform distribution of runup, which peaked at 4.6 m. This is explained by a concentrated maximal slip at intermediate depth on the megathrust, resulting in a rapid decay of tsunami energy. The tsunami temporal evolution varied, with locations showing sustained tsunami energy, while others showed increased tsunami energy at different times after the earthquake. These are the result of the interaction of long period standing oscillations and trapped edge wave activity controlled by inner shelf slopes. Understanding these processes is relevant for the region, which still posses a significant tsunamigenic potential. 
Key Points    The Pisagua earthquake generated a moderate tsunami despite its magnitude   Tsunami energy was sustained due to standing and propagating edge waves   Edge waves are confined to the inner shelf","The authors would like to thank CONICYT (Chile) through its grants FONDAP 15 11‐0017, FONDEF D11I1119, FONDECYT 11140424, and CCTVAL‐FB0821.

The structural characteristics of the compounds were investigated using X-ray diffraction and Raman spectroscopy. Surface chemical information and oxidation states were studied using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The magnetic properties of the samples were studied using magnetization curves. In addition, quantum chemical calculations were performed to elucidate the electronic structure of the samples and to understand the possible substitution mechanisms during Co-doping. The results indicated that Co effectively endowed the BaTiO3 structure with intrinsic magnetic properties, which decreased as the Co percentage increased. In addition, the increase in the Co mol% produced a gradual loss of the non-perovskite structure, leading to a decrease in the ferroelectric behaviour.","AcknowledgementsThis work has been partially financed by FONDECYT grant under contract No 1110555, the basal Financing program CONICYT FB0807 (CEDENNA).

This situation has led to this research aimed to determine the effect of different process variables on the extraction of copper based on the ore type of these small-scale mining activities. The extraction of copper from finely ground (<150μm) low-grade mixed ore (0.36% Cu) was studied in different acidic media (H2SO4 and HCl). The effects of water quality (tap water, seawater and synthetic process water) and lixiviants on copper leaching were investigated at three temperatures (25°C, 35°C and 45°C). Synthetic process water was prepared by adding Na+, Cl−, Cu2+ and SO42− to seawater. Copper extractions between 70% and 80% were achieved in 48h using seawater, similar to the extractions obtained using tap water. Rapid copper dissolution occurred when synthetic process water was used, from 90% to 97%. This marked increase was related to the addition of Cu2+, which promoted the formation of CuCl+. Seawater was comparable to freshwater in terms of leaching kinetics and yield potential by raising the chloride concentration and increasing the formation of copper chloride ions. The findings of this study also expanded our understanding of the consequences of substituting seawater for freshwater at industrial leaching operations.","AcknowledgmentsAssistance in ore preparation by the Mining Engineering and Chemical Engineering Departments of UA is acknowledged with gratitude.

A glass rod served as a mechanical control. The responses of juvenile [2+ year (y), ~36-mm shell height (SH)] and adult (6+ y, ~100-mm SH) scallops from the Magdalen Islands, Québec, Canada, were assessed in early summer 2005. The predatory seastars evoked the strongest response, in terms of both response latency and minimum interval between phasic contractions and numbers of phasic contractions, particularly early in the escape response. 
Both the minor seastar predators and crabs stimulated stronger responses than the mechanical control. Juvenile scallops were livelier than adult scallops. As P. magellanicus consistently responded to predators with an initial flurry of phasic contractions that tapered off to spaced phasic contractions separated by increasingly long tonic contractions, only the intensity of the escape response seems to have been modified by selection.",This research was supported by grants from the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada to HG and JHH as well as funding from Ressources Aquatiques du Québec to HG.

The observations were carried out for two years with the 1-m telescopes of the Special and Crimean Astrophysical Observatories. As a result of these observations, we detected regular V -band luminosity variations with a period of P ≈ 8 hours. The amplitude of the variability is stable on timescales greater than two years and amounts to 11 ± 1 mmag. The difference in the variability amplitude from observations with different telescopes is 1–3 mmag. The result is interpreted within the concept of a rotation-modulated variability of magnetic properties of the star’s atmosphere. We also discuss a possible variability due to the presence of planetary companions around stars of this type. The results of monitoring were used to explore the capabilities of the telescopes for exoplanet investigation. We studied the dependences between the characteristic times of exposures, magnitudes of the objects, and a threshold level of the expected variability amplitudes for all the telescopes involved in our program. A program of exoplanet monitoring with the mentioned telescopes was drawn up for the next few years based on the results of the study.",,,Astrophysical Bulletin,,,,2015-07,2015,2015-08-15,2015-07,70,3,318-327,Closed,Article,"Valeev, A.

We analyze co-seismic induced ionospheric TEC perturbations following the northern Chile Mw 8.1 Pisagua earthquake occurred on April 1, 2014. The continuous Global Positioning System (GPS) data at 15 sites from the Integrated Plate Boundary Observatory Chile (IPOC) and International GPS Service (IGS) GPS networks have been used in the present study. The nearest GPS site iqqe, ~98km away from the epicenter, recorded the ionospheric disturbance 12min after the event. The maximum co-seismic induced peak-to-peak TEC amplitude is ~1.25 TECU (1TECU=1016electrons/m2), and the perturbations are confined to less than 1000km radius around the epicenter. The observed horizontal velocity of TEC perturbations has been determined as ~1180m/s. We could also discern the signatures of acoustic gravity waves (AGW) with velocity~650m/s and frequency~2mHz. The ionospheric signal components due to Rayleigh and/or Tsunami waves could not be observed. This contribution presents characteristics of near-field co-seismic ionospheric response due to the 2014 Pisagua earthquake.","AcknowledgmentsThe authors C.D. Reddy and A.S.

We analyzed 127,812 articles published between 1988 and 2013 in 173 journals on the ISI W eb of S cience in the “management” category. Collaboration occurred in approximately 60% of all articles. A power–law relationship was found between citation‐based performance and journal size and collaboration patterns. The number of citations expected by collaborative articles increases 2 1.89 or 3.7 times when the number of collaborative articles published in a journal doubles. The number of citations expected by noncollaborative articles only increases 2 1.35 or 2.55 times if a journal publishes double the number of noncollaborative articles. The M atthew effect is stronger for collaborative than for noncollaborative articles.

Using both paleontological and distributional data, we compare the origination, extinction and immigration levels between low and high latitudes since the earliest proliferation of the group during the mid‐Triassic. Altogether, first and last occurrence localities in the fossil record do not support a positive preference towards either latitudinal bin. Nonetheless, considering past and present scleractinian fauna, the process of extinction has been apparently more pronounced at higher latitudes based on face values and correlation coefficients. Far above these differences, immigration of extant taxa has been substantially higher towards the tropics than to temperate regions. While the net dispersal toward low latitudes persists in all temporal intervals, the gradient of diversity was largely built up during the Cenozoic Era and only becomes significantly steep from the Neogene Period onwards. This dynamic supports the ‘into the tropical museum’ model, which suggests that tropics have historically acted as a center of accumulation for marine biodiversity.",We deeply appreciate the comments of Morana Mihaljević which helped improve this manuscript.

Furthermore, the modeling of the recovery of each concentration stage is complex, requires experimentation, and depends on many variables, including the selected circuit and mineral feed (which is heterogeneous and changes over time). These difficulties indicate that there are uncertainties in the actual values of the recovery of each stage and the information required to create the circuit design. This paper demonstrates that, for a specific mineral, few structures exist that are optimal for a wide range of values of concentration stage recoveries. This knowledge can be useful in circuit design, e.g., after selecting the circuit (or the most promising circuits), the equipment design parameters and operating conditions can be defined based on simulation and laboratory tests.","AcknowledgmentsFinancial support from CONICYT – Chile (Fondecyt 1120794), CICITEM (R10C1004) and the Antofagasta Regional Government is gratefully acknowledged.",,Minerals Engineering,,,,2015-11,2015,,2015-11,83,,175-184,Closed,Article,"Cisternas, Luis A.; Jamett, Nathalie; Gálvez, Edelmira D.","Cisternas, Luis A.

The calculated elastic constants indicate that C2/m-carbon is mechanically stable according to the elastic stability criteria under pressure. Furthermore, the elastic anisotropy has been visualized in detail by plotting the directional dependence of Poisson’s ratio, Young’s modulus, and shear modulus, whereas the calculated values of Poisson’s ratio and B/G present their brittle manner.

They are defined in terms of mutual information of bipartite local measurements done over an optimal local basis complementary to the local basis which defines the respective classical correlations. For two qubits, it is always possible to choose the basis of classical correlations as the set of eigenvectors of σz$$\sigma _z$$ (the third Pauli matrix) and complementary bases become the sets of eigenvectors of the observables orthogonal to σz$$\sigma _z$$. It is shown that all states with zero local available quantum correlations are separable but not necessarily strictly classical; this fact puts this kind of correlations in the middle between discord and entanglement. Since in many cases it may suffice to know whether a given state has quantum correlations, the structure of the states with zero local available quantum correlations is presented. It is also shown that there is a close connection between local available quantum correlations and the protocol of entanglement activation developed by Piani et al. (Phys Rev Lett 106:220403, 2011).

The presented method is based on the analysis of dynamical spectra, which make it possible to obtain high signal-to-noise residual spectra after host star spectrum deduction. These residual spectra contain information on the light reflected from an exoplanet and on its albedo. The first results of such research for the exoplanet HD 189733b are presented in the paper. We obtained a series of a few dozens moderate-resolution spectra of the host star HD 189733. Individual spectra have a high signal-to-noise ratio (≈700) and cover a considerable part of the complete orbital cycle of the exoplanet. The use of the developed method allowed us to achieve a characteristic contrast of the reflected light detection at a level of 5 × 10−4 from the continuum. Investigation of the dynamic spectra with this characteristic value as a detection threshold has not revealed obvious evidence of the host star light reflected from the planet. Nevertheless, the obtained threshold is high, which demonstrates the necessity of the development of the method for the exoplanet monitoring studies.",,,Astrophysical Bulletin,,,,2015-10,2015,2015-11-22,2015-10,70,4,466-473,Closed,Article,"Valyavin, G.

253,pub.1052428484,10.1007/s10109-015-0214-6,,,Combining point and regular lattice data in geostatistical interpolation,"Abstract
This work studies how to include both point and areal measurements when estimating gaussian fields by kriging. To achieve this objective, three geostatistical approaches are considered for the areal distributed data: (a) regionalized measurements that are geographically referenced by their centroid as if they were point measurements, (b) regionalized measurements that are explicitly accounted by formally computing all the needed covariances (i.e. area-to-area, area-to-point and point-to-point covariances, respectively) and (c) regionalized measurements that are used as an external drift variable. Results indicate that the measurement error corresponding to the areal data plays a key role to decide when the spatial support of the areal measurements is relevant. For small measurement errors, it is necessary to explicitly consider the spatial support of the areal measurements to avoid large estimation variances. For large measurement errors, the difference between defining areal measurements by using their actual spatial support and defining areal measurements by referencing them by their centroids (i.e. gravity centre) is small. In this situation, it is possible to use the areal measurements as an external drift instead of merging both types of information (i.e. point and areal data) as measurements for kriging. In this case, the cross-validation analysis shows a larger coefficient of determination, similar average kriging variance and smaller mean square error than the obtained in the case of merging point and areal measurements for kriging.","This research was undertaken as part of the European Union (FP6) funded Integrated Project called WATCH through Contract Number 036946 and also by the project “Hydrological behaviour analysis of groundwater dependent wetlands”, funded by the Geological Survey of Spain (IGME) with Reference Number CANOA-73.3.00.44.00.

                    Gordon using canonical discriminant analysis. There is strong sexual dimorphism in this species, in that robustus morphotypes are greater in size and with larger appendages (extended third maxillipeds and major [first] chelipeds) than females. As typus males grow bigger in size, their third maxillipeds and major chelipeds become proportionately larger than those of females, and the numbers of corneous spines on the terminal segment of the maxillipeds are reduced. Although there is no sexual dimorphism in body size between typus and intermedius males and females, the robustus males are often substantially larger than females. During mating and spermatophore transfer, all male morphotypes performed similar behaviours (touching, overlapping and holding), but only intermedius and robustus morphotypes appeared to fertilize the broods of the females successfully. Robustus males were faster in approaching as well as mating with receptive females than subordinate males. When mating with robustus males, females spawned more quickly than after mating with typus and intermedius males. Additionally, the time taken for spermatophore transfer by typus males was longer. Rejection by females during the initial approach by typus males often resulted in unsuccessful spermatophore attachment. Results of this study suggest a dominance hierarchy in

It was detected in Norway in 1984 and in June 2007 appeared in Chile, producing a drop of more than 30% in the country's production level. It is expected that with certain regularity, outbreaks will continue to appear in Chile without the need of reintroducing the virus from foreign countries. We present a numerical study of the influence of winds and tides in the dispersion of lagrangian particles to simulate the transport of ISAv in the Aysen region, in southern Chile. This study combines the use of numerical models of the ocean and atmosphere, lagrangian tracking and biological aspects of ISAv infections. As in previous results, a wider dispersion of ISAv was observed during spring tides. Temporal changes in wind significantly modified the transport of viral particles from an infected center. Under similar forcing conditions, the areas of risk associated to culture sites separated by a few kilometers could be very different. Our main results remark the importance of the use of a detailed knowledge of hydrographic and atmospheric circulation in the definition of boundaries for sanitary management areas. We suggest that a methodology similar to the one presented in this study should be considered to define sanitary strategies to minimize the occurrence of native outbreaks of ISAv.","AcknowledgmentsFunding for this study and ancillary measurements in the area were provided by Salmones FrioSur.

However, these input variables may have uncertainties that can lead the designed process to unwanted conditions. This paper presents a methodology for determining critical variables to avoid unwanted responses in the designed process. The methodology proposed here consists of three stages: (1) deterministic process design, (2) elimination of non-influential input variables via the global sensitivity analysis method of Sobol’, and (3) determination and regionalization of critical variables with Monte Carlo Filtering. The proposed methodology was applied to the design of a mineral concentration circuit and to the design of a desalination plant. The results show that the methodology could be helpful in analyzing whether a deterministic design works adequately under uncertainties, identifying critical variables in large models, and regionalizing operating conditions and design variables.","AcknowledgmentsThe authors wish to acknowledge support from the CONICYT and the Regional Government of Antofagasta by their funding through PAI program, Project Anillo ACT 1201.

Animals living in extreme environments with predictable seasonality may have important life history events correlated to favourable periods. These animals pass critical life stages in protected habitats, especially during early life, often receiving parental care. It is thus hypothesized that juveniles rely on protective microhabitats provided by their parents, becoming independent only during favourable seasons. Semi-terrestrial crayfish Parastacus pugnax inhabit burrows in highly seasonal and predictable environments, thus being well suited to test this hypothesis. Following marked burrows and individual crayfish we examined the life history patterns of P. pugnax in their natural environment to test the predictions that (i) burrowing activity is higher during the wet season, (ii) reproductive events occur during favourable seasons and (iii) juveniles only disperse after reaching larger sizes. There was little or no burrowing activity during the dry season, when soil was more compact, but burrows became wider and had more openings during the wet season. After hatching, juveniles cohabited with adults for at least 4 months during the dry season. During this period juveniles grew considerably, starting independent lives during the wet season. These results suggest that the prolonged parent-offspring cohabitation evolved in response to the predictable seasonal variations in the crayfish habitat.","We thank Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior (CAPES) for the scholarship to AVP.

A number of countries have analyzed the feasibility of small-scale culture of Kappaphycus as a method of alleviating poverty in low-income coastal communities. In this study, a bioeconomic model for individual and artisanal culture of Kappaphycus alvarezii is constructed. The results of the study show that using the base model, the net present value is positive at the 6-month mark, once the business has started, and that the internal return rate is 210 %. These results are explained by the small investment required for a raft culture system. Sensitivity analysis shows that the business tolerates important unfavorable variations in the critical economical, technological, and biological variables.

This programming style usually uses callback methods, non-blocking operations, allowing high responsive user interactions even if an application works without multi-threading. However, this style requires the uncoupling of a module into two sub-modules at least, which are not intuitively connected by a callback method. The separation of modules spurs the birth of other issues: callback spaghetti and callback hell. This paper proposes a virtual block approach to address the previous two issues. This approach enables a programmer to virtually block a program execution and restart it at arbitrary points in the program. As a result, programmers do not need to uncouple a module even if non-blocking operations are adopted; therefore, callback dependencies disappear. Using aspect-oriented programming, this approach uses aspects to control the execution of a program in an oblivious manner. As a consequence, programmers do not need to be concerned whether pieces of code use blocking or non-blocking operations. We implement a proof-of-concept for this approach, called SyncAS, for ActionScript3. In addition, we apply our proposal to a toy application and conduct experiments to show its modular application, flexibility, and performance.",,,International Journal of Software Engineering and Knowledge Engineering,,,,2015-06,2015,2015-09-28,2015-06,25,05,887-907,Closed,Article,"Fukuda, Hiroaki; Leger, Paul","Fukuda, Hiroaki (Information Science and Engineering, Shibaura Institute of Technology, 3-7-5 Koto, Toyosu, Tokyo 135-8548, Japan); Leger, Paul (Escuela de Ciencias Empresariales, Universidad Católica del Norte, Chile)",,"Fukuda, Hiroaki (Shibaura Institute of Technology); Leger, Paul (Catholic University of the North)",0,0,,0.0,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1062959804,46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4612 Software Engineering,

To achieve this objective, a continuous-time model including biological, technological, and economic aspects was developed. To implement this model, the biomass growth until marketable size is reached was estimated for three periods of the year. A periodic system of cultivation and harvesting is described, and the main investments, operation costs, remunerations, and operational costs of cultivation and harvesting are defined. The results of the baseline model show that cultivation is not profitable in the long term considering the selling price and the harvest yield. Additionally, at baseline, the revenue is unable to cover the investment costs or the operation costs. However, in a scenario in which productivity is 211 % higher than the base harvest and prices are 25 % higher, cultivation becomes profitable, with positive net present values (NPV) after 14 years. Despite the aforementioned considerations, the opportunity for generating greater value from this type of cultivation is discussed, taking into account its characteristics as units that provide ecosystem services, which is a feature that is starting to be discussed in relation to marine environments.",,,Journal of Applied Phycology,,,,2015-05-15,2015,2015-05-15,2016-02,28,1,405-416,Closed,Article,"Zuniga-Jara, Sergio; Marín-Riffo, María Cristina; Bulboa-Contador, Cristian","Zuniga-Jara, Sergio (Escuela de Ciencias Empresariales, Universidad Católica del Norte, Larrondo 1281, Coquimbo, Chile); Marín-Riffo, María Cristina (Escuela de Ciencias Empresariales, Universidad Católica del Norte, Larrondo 1281, Coquimbo, Chile); Bulboa-Contador, Cristian (Departamento de Ecología y Biodiversidad, Facultad de Ecología y Recursos Naturales, Universidad Andrés Bello, República 440, Santiago, Chile)","Zuniga-Jara, Sergio (Catholic University of the North)","Zuniga-Jara, Sergio (Catholic University of the North); Marín-Riffo, María Cristina (Catholic University of the North); Bulboa-Contador, Cristian (Andrés Bello National University)",17,2,,1.36,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1046875783,31 Biological Sciences; 3106 Industrial Biotechnology,

The local Rapanui people have noticed an extreme decline in marine resources, which is due to the exploitation of these resources. Top-down regulations (e.g. fisherman and boat registrations and restrictions on catch-length and fishing season and location) implemented by the central fishery authorities located ∼4000 km from the island do not represent the cultural heritage and interests of the Rapanui people. According to the local people, one of the traditional ways to protect marine resources was the taboo (or tapu in Rapa Nui) that regulated the fish harvest. Key informants were interviewed to assess what they knew about the tapu in fisheries and so that the feasibility of its implementation could be assessed based on current local conditions. The tapu that had the greatest potential impact on regulating open water resources, especially tuna, was the traditional belief that consumption of open-water fish during winter months would cause asthma. According to the interviewees, the real reason for this tapu was to protect the fish during its reproductive period, and the asthma threat was only a way to enforce the restriction. At present, tapu is not respected because of the high economic activity related to the tourism that demands fish like tuna all year. Even though many Rapanui people agree that tapu re-implementation would be the best alternative to recover marine resources, people also think it is difficult to implement under modern conditions. We propose to promote a participatory process for development of a local governance structure that will use local traditions and beliefs, including tapu, to support the local decision-making process for reverting the decline of marine resources.","AcknowledgmentsThis work was supported by the Chilean Millennium Initiative (NC120030) grant.JA and CG are grateful to the Rapanui people and to “Tapu” indigenous association for supporting the activities developed in this research.

Three tsunami survey teams covered approximately 700 km of the Pacific coast. The teams surveyed the area, recording 83 tsunami flow depth and runup measurements. The maximum runup was found to be 10.8 m at only one small bay, in front of the inferred tsunami source area. However, it was observed that runup in other locations rarely exceed 6 m. Tsunami runup was larger than those of the 2014 Pisagua event, despite the similar earthquake magnitude. Moreover, tsunami arrival times were found to be shorter than those of previous tsunamis along the Chilean subduction zone.

The objective of this study was to determine whether these differing distributions result primarily from differences in spawning locations, larval development times, and transport by the Ross Sea circulation. To address this objective, Lagrangian particle tracking experiments were used to simulate the transport of larvae of Antarctic krill and crystal krill. The particle simulations showed that regions providing inputs of Antarctic krill to the Ross Sea were along the outer shelf/slope. Crystal krill transport and retention were along the shallow banks on the outer Ross Sea shelf. Particles initialized in the inner shelf off Victoria Land showed high retention in the region south and along the Terra Nova Bay polynya, with timescales consistent with development times of crystal krill. These results suggest that the cyclonic circulation over the shelf contributes significantly to the dispersion and retention of crystal krill in parts of the inner Ross Sea continental shelf that overlaps with regions with high concentrations of krill-dependent top predators. The westward circulation along the shelf break contributes to the transport and aggregation of Antarctic krill in regions where Circumpolar Deep Water is observed on the outer continental shelf and along the shelf break. The transport pathways and connectivity obtained from this study provide a baseline for assessing the effects of projected changes in the Ross Sea circulation on the distribution of two important krill species.",This study was supported by the National Science Foundation Grant OCE-0622642 and by the National Science Foundation Office of Polar Programs Grants ANT-0838911 and ANT-0944174.

A New Approach to the Testament of Moses,"In recent years a consensus has emerged that the Testament of Moses is to be dated in the early first century c.e., at least in its final form, and the primary basis for that consensus is the apparently perfect match between the reference to a ruler ruling for 34 years and the years of the reign of Herod the Great. While acknowledging that much can be explained on that presupposition, I have sought to show that a fit equally as strong as with Herod may be found when chapter 6 is read as alluding to the reign of Alexander Janneus and Alexandra Salome. The figure 34 matches with as much accuracy as one could expect. But much else also matches, including the fact that his sons did reign for shorter periods than their father, unlike Herod’s sons, and that many of the details, including depictions of depravity and assumptions of religious conflict, better match what we know of the reign of Alexander, Alexandra, and their sons.",,,Journal for the Study of Judaism,,,,2015-02-10,2015,2015-02-10,,46,1,28-43,Closed,Article,"Loader, William","Loader, William (Murdoch University, Perth, Australia, University of the North West, South Africa, w.loader@murdoch.edu.au)",,"Loader, William (Murdoch University)",2,1,,2.56,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1039664241,"43 History, Heritage and Archaeology; 4303 Historical Studies; 50 Philosophy and Religious Studies",

They formed the South African Students Organisation (SASO) and began formulating an ideology called Black Consciousness. At its heart, the Black Consciousness Movement (BCM) called for the unity of South Africa’s oppressed, which they defined as African, Coloured and Indian. Those who were not students found a home in the Black People’s Convention. Many students of Indian origin joined SASO and played leading roles in the development of the BCM. This article traces these developments, paying particular attention to Indian women, seeking to understand their motivations in joining the movement, and record their experiences inside the BCM. Their story has to date been largely ignored, primarily because the Indian male members of BCM who stood trial and went to Robben Island during this period have tended to overwhelm the narrative, and in more recent times, the post-apartheid liberation story has been dominated by the journey of the African National Congress.",,,Diaspora Studies,,,,2015-10-22,2015,2015-10-22,,8,1,37-50,Closed,Article,"Desai, Ashwin","Desai, Ashwin (Sociology Department, University of Johannesburg, Durban, South Africa)","Desai, Ashwin (University of Johannesburg)","Desai, Ashwin (University of Johannesburg)",3,1,,5.81,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1042948377,"47 Language, Communication and Culture; 4705 Literary Studies",

The model enables analysts to perform a cost-benefit analysis on security expenditure as expressed by a Return on Investment. Security is an important part of modern societies. Crime rates, especially in South Africa, have forced organisations, businesses, individuals and even the state to employ security guards and to install, security hardware and technology. Burger (2014:1) raised the point that 74% of business executives in South Africa indicated that rising security costs is a great concern. The frequency was 45% in 2005. Security expenditure is a great concern for executives and often decision-makers struggle with the problem whether money spent on security has any benefits. Part of the problem of justifying expenditure is that the industry lacks a reliable model to calculate cost-benefits. This article's aim is to provide industry-standard terminology and to develop a cost efficiency model culminating in a model to calculate a Return on Investment on security expenditure. The cost-efficiency model is based on an integration of a number of disciplines and fields of study, notably, criminology, probability and finance. The outcome is a model for which the author developed a number of formulae that can be used to calculate a return on investment for security expenditure.",,,Studies in Economics and Econometrics,,,,2015-08-01,2015,2020-11-09,2015-08-01,39,2,63-86,Closed,Article,"Roelofse, C.","Roelofse, C.

The capabilities approach can take us forward in addressing these challenges in two ways. Nussbaum's version of the capabilities approach, in particular, provides us with an analytical framework to explore valued opportunities and freedoms from a social justice perspective. Secondly, in line with Sen's argument, the approach can serve as the informational base for disability policies. In this study, the capabilities approach is operationalized within education by applying Walker's list of eight valued freedoms and opportunities to students with disabilities. Data are drawn from a qualitative study examining the processes through which students with disabilities at two South African universities make their educational choices and negotiate different structures on their way to, and in higher education. These students identified key valued freedoms and opportunities that are needed to access and succeed in higher education. Four of the eight valued freedoms and opportunities on Walker's list emerged strongly in this study. Seven other valued freedoms and opportunities which fall outside of Walker's list were also identified. These 11 key valued freedoms and opportunities, we argue, are needed for the formulation of socially just disability-inclusive policies.","We acknowledge the valuable comments and suggestions from Sophie Mitra, anonymous peer reviewers and the funding support to the CRHED by the UFS and the National Research Fund for this study.",,Journal of Human Development and Capabilities,,,,2015-10-02,2015,2015-10-26,2015-10-02,16,4,501-517,Closed,Article,"Mutanga, Oliver; Walker, Melanie","Mutanga, Oliver (Centre for Research on Higher Education and Development, University of the Free State, Bloemfontein, South Africa); Walker, Melanie (Centre for Research on Higher Education and Development, University of the Free State, Bloemfontein, South Africa)","Walker, Melanie (University of the Free State)","Mutanga, Oliver (University of the Free State); Walker, Melanie (University of the Free State)",29,5,,13.63,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1044054641,44 Human Society; 4404 Development Studies,4 Quality Education

                    – The purpose of this paper is to conduct a quantitative analysis of the university accreditation processes in Chilean universities. The aim is to determine the effects of the different variables, especially the type of institutions (state- and privately owned, with and without state financial support) on the results obtained.
                  
                  
                    Design/methodology/approach
                    – Univariate and multivariate statistical analysis of official data.
                  
                  
                    Findings
                    – Results indicate consistency in the accreditation processes in Chilean universities, as those variables directly associated with the processes accounted for approximately 70 per cent of the variation in the length of accreditation periods (between 0 and seven years), these variables being the ones that defined the type of universities. High dispersion was found in six state-owned universities that behaved as if they were private universities and in two private universities that behaved as if they were state universities. However, a high percentage of the universities included in the analysis maintained their affiliation to their corresponding legal group, when their performance in accreditation processes was analyzed.
                  
                  
                    Originality/value
                    – The results of the university accreditation processes in Chile have been the focus of a intense debate due to the legal and economic conflicts between the different types of universities. This study constitutes the first scientific analysis of the results of these processes, especially in terms of the performance of the different types of universities, thus enabling a better interpretation of the results. This information is useful not only in the terms of the legal reforms that are being carried out in Chile, but they also help the understanding of the processes of accreditation of higher education in other Latin American countries.","The authors are grateful to the Center of Advanced Studies, the Higher Education Research Group and the Doctorate Program in Educational Management and Policies of the University of Playa Ancha, Valparaíso Chile.

These artifacts provide the earliest evidence of metal use in southern Chile. They are also the southernmost prehispanic metal artifacts ever found in South America. These contextualized results complement those obtained from the analysis of an earring from Kilómetro 0—Enlace Temuco (El Vergel Complex, Late Ceramic period), an archaeological residential site dated to almost 500 years after the Labranza cemetery. Particle Induced X-ray Emission, X-ray radiography, and stereomicroscopy analyses allow us to offer an elemental characterization of the pieces, an assessment of their manufacturing process, and a comparison between the metals and alloys discovered. We follow with a discussion of proposals regarding cultural relations in the Araucania region during different time periods.

Various scientists and practitioners have contributed to its theoretical and practical development, and research on the subject has increased over the past few years. However culture in constellation work has received little research attention and has not been empirically studied in African contexts. The aim of this article is to reflect on culture and its influence on constellation work in multicultural, post‐apartheid South Africa. An empirical qualitative research approach within the phenomenological paradigm was adopted. Six constellation facilitators were interviewed with in‐depth and field notes taken during participative observations of constellation workshops.

Life history theory predicts that old males with low residual reproductive value (RRV) would accept greater risk for current reproduction than their younger counterparts. Accordingly, we tested the prediction that, under predation risk, old males of the rock shrimp Rhynchocinetes typus pair with females faster and for a longer time than young males do. We exposed young and old dominant males (in the final ontogenetic stage, called “robustus”) to a female in the absence and presence of a predator. As predicted, older robustus males modified their mating behavior when exposed to a predator. However, in contrast to the prediction, they delayed female seizure under predation risk, possibly to carefully assess the actual threat before initiating female guarding. Once they had established the mate-guarding position, old robustus males did not interrupt it until the end of female spawning and, in the presence of predators, even guarded the female significantly longer than in predator-free treatments. In contrast, younger robustus males did not delay female seizure but abandoned the female repeatedly when a predator was present, suggesting that they perceived and responded to the predation risk. Our results suggest that older robustus males have the experience to assess threats before engaging in risky behaviors that bolster their reproductive success. Although consistent with the theory that low RRV individuals should accept greater reproductive risk, we suggest that old individuals do not recklessly engage in risky behaviors but rather cautiously evaluate the threats before investing in a potentially terminal reproductive event.",,,Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology,,,,2015-09-22,2015,2015-09-22,2015-12,69,12,1975-1984,Closed,Article,"Ory, Nicolas Christian; van Son, Thijs Christiaan; Thiel, Martin","Ory, Nicolas Christian (Facultad Ciencias del Mar, Universidad Católica del Norte, Larrondo 1281, Coquimbo, Chile; Millennium Nucleus Ecology and Sustainable Management of Oceanic Island (ESMOI), Coquimbo, Chile); van Son, Thijs Christiaan (Facultad Ciencias del Mar, Universidad Católica del Norte, Larrondo 1281, Coquimbo, Chile; Marine Geology, Geological Survey of Norway, Postboks 6315 Sluppen, 7491, Trondheim, Norway); Thiel, Martin (Facultad Ciencias del Mar, Universidad Católica del Norte, Larrondo 1281, Coquimbo, Chile; Millennium Nucleus Ecology and Sustainable Management of Oceanic Island (ESMOI), Coquimbo, Chile; Centro de Estudios Avanzados en Zonas Áridas (CEAZA), Coquimbo, Chile)","Ory, Nicolas Christian (Catholic University of the North; Millennium Nucleus Ecology and Sustainable Management of Oceanic Island (ESMOI), Coquimbo, Chile)","Ory, Nicolas Christian (Catholic University of the North; Millennium Nucleus Ecology and Sustainable Management of Oceanic Island (ESMOI), Coquimbo, Chile); van Son, Thijs Christiaan (Catholic University of the North; Norwegian Geological Survey); Thiel, Martin (Catholic University of the North; Millennium Nucleus Ecology and Sustainable Management of Oceanic Island (ESMOI), Coquimbo, Chile; Centro de Estudios Avanzados en Zonas Áridas (CEAZA), Coquimbo, Chile)",14,1,,1.7,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1049041701,31 Biological Sciences; 3103 Ecology; 3109 Zoology,
236,pub.1042728989,10.1002/cpe.3550,,,Spectral turning bands for efficient Gaussian random fields generation on GPUs and accelerators,"Summary A random field (RF) is a set of correlated random variables associated with different spatial locations. RF generation algorithms are of crucial importance for many scientific areas, such as astrophysics, geostatistics, computer graphics, and many others. Current approaches commonly make use of 3D fast Fourier transform (FFT), which does not scale well for RF bigger than the available memory; they are also limited to regular rectilinear meshes. We introduce random field generation with the turning band method (RAFT), an RF generation algorithm based on the turning band method that is optimized for massively parallel hardware such as GPUs and accelerators. Our algorithm replaces the 3D FFT with a lower‐order, one‐dimensional FFT followed by a projection step and is further optimized with loop unrolling and blocking. RAFT can easily generate RF on non‐regular (non‐uniform) meshes and efficiently produce fields with mesh sizes bigger than the available device memory by using a streaming, out‐of‐core approach. Our algorithm generates RF with the correct statistical behavior and is tested on a variety of modern hardware, such as NVIDIA Tesla, AMD FirePro and Intel Phi. RAFT is faster than the traditional methods on regular meshes and has been successfully applied to two real case scenarios: planetary nebulae and cosmological simulations.

The purpose of this literature review is to identify and exemplify facilitator roles in e-learning, to argue that there is a need for facilitators to undergo e-learning-related training, and to consider certain other challenges that result from using an online platform for teaching and learning. The results of the literature survey confirm that the roles of the educator change in a digital environment, while communication also enables him/her to maintain a degree of control over computer-mediated learning.

Concerns over the long-term supply of macroalgae have led farmers to investigate the suitability of various formulated feeds, however there has been limited commercial adoption. Combination diets of macroalgal and formulated feed fed together provide a mechanism to explore and adapt to formulated feed use without entirely abandoning macroalgal feed. The current study evaluated the use of formulated, macroalgal and two combination diets (low and high macroalgal supplementation) on production indicators and canning yields of juvenile abalone H. rufescens in a culture system modified for formulated feed. The macroalgal diet and the high macroalgal-formulated pellet combination diet (76.1% macroalgae: 23.9% pelleted diet as dry weight) produced significantly higher growth indicators (SGR and LGR) than the low macroalgal-formulated pellet combination diet (31.6% macroalgae: 68.4% pelleted diet as dry weight) and the formulated pellet diet. The protein efficiency ratio of the experimental treatments was positively related to the proportional contribution of fresh macroalgae in the diet. Furthermore, calculation of the protein efficiency ratio of the formulated component in combination diets (PERf) revealed a significant positive relationship between macroalgae contribution and PERf. This suggests that the increase in total PER is driven by the increased utilisation of protein in the formulated component of combination diets associated with increasing levels of fresh macroalgal supplementation. We suggest possible reasons why the presence of seaweed increased the availability of the formulated feed protein to the abalone. A simulated canning trial highlighted a significant positive linear relationship between meat canning yield and the proportional contribution of formulated feed. This study highlights the value of combination diets as a tool for abalone producers to harness the potential production advantages of macroalgae while still accessing the processing benefits associated with nutrient dense formulated feed.Statement of relevanceWe believe that this manuscript describes novel insights into the efficiency of protein utilisation in juvenile red abalone fed combination diets as well as the effect of diet, particularly formulated feed inclusion level, on canned meat yields. This provides empirical information to inform commercial abalone farmers of H. rufescens when exploring dietary options for optimal culture.","AcknowledgementThe authors would like to thank Franklin Pincheira, Rattcliff Ambler and Mauricio Lopez for their technical assistance with this research.

To address such concerns, we carried out a modern calibration study to assess the representation of vegetation by pollen records from rodent middens. We compared vegetation censuses with soil-surface and midden (matrix and feces) pollen samples from sites between 21° and 28°S. The results show that (1) the pollen signal from the midden matrix provides a more realistic reflection of local vegetation than soil-surface samples due to the pollen-deposition processes that occur in middens; and (2) in contrast to feces pollen assemblages, which feature some biases, rodent dietary habits do not seem to influence midden matrix pollen assemblages, probably because midden agents are dietary generalists. Our finding that modern pollen data from rodent middens reflect vegetation patterns confirms the reliability of midden pollen records as paleoecological archives in northern Chile.","AcknowledgmentsThis research was supported by FONDECYT grants no. 3130511 (to MEdP), no. 1130279 (to AM), no. 1100916 (to CL and AM), and CONICYT´s Programa de Investigación Asociativa (PIA), Anillo Código SOC 1405 (to MEdP, AM and CL).

Since the Late Formative Period (ca. 100–400 AD), the region around San Pedro de Atacama (SPA) in the Atacama desert of northern Chile has been part of a complex and extensive network of interacting polities through which raw materials, agricultural products, goods, people and ideas circulated in the South-Central Andes. The archaeological record in SPA abounds with textiles from various cultures that participated in such network. A study of these textiles would allow intercultural as well as diachronical comparisons. Numerous studies on textiles found in SPA have focused on their technological and iconographic features. This work addresses the identification of the organic dyes employed in the manufacture of 38 textiles found in funerary contexts in SPA from the Middle (ca. 400–1000 A.D.) and the Late Intermediate periods (ca. 1000–1450 A.D.), using high performance liquid chromatography with a diode array detector (HPLC-DAD). Purpurin and not alizarin was found in all red dyed fibers and indigotin (IND) and indirubin (INR) in all blue dyed fibers. Natural sources of these dyes are exogenous to SPA; their importation into SPA lasted for nearly a millennium. A positive correlation was found between [IND]/[INR] concentration ratio and the altitude of the place where the fiber was presumably dyed. Overall, the results indicate that finished garments and also raw dyes and ready-to-use dyed fibers were imported into SPA from neighboring regions and that foreign weavers were possibly active at SPA.","This work was partially funded by the program Proyectos de Investigación Asociativa de CONICYT, Anillo en Ciencia y Tecnología grant ACT N° 096 (http://www.cienciaymemoria.cl) and by LANBIO (Latin American Network for Research in Bioactive Natural Compounds).

This article analyses the 10 criteria that inform the evaluation of teaching and eventual promotion decisions at a South African university: rationale for teaching, teaching methods, postgraduate supervision, assessment, student evaluations, peer evaluations, ongoing study of higher education, developing courses, sharing teaching experiences and special recognition of teaching. The study investigated which criteria, if any, were significant in the overall evaluation of teaching and in academic promotion outcomes for different rank levels. The unexpected key finding was that each of the criteria demonstrated statistically significant correlations and differences with both teaching evaluations and promotion outcomes. While all 10 teaching criteria mattered in the evaluation of teaching and academic promotion outcomes, postgraduate supervision and sharing teaching experiences were especially important for those who were successful at the rank of full professor. A multidimensional approach that rigorously assesses multiple criteria in evaluating teaching at all rank levels, including the professoriate, contributes to its credence and currency in academic promotions. Analyses of actual assessments of teaching criteria and their relation to promotion outcomes can contribute to consensus on evaluating teaching.","To the UKZN PhD Higher Education cohort-2014 and in particular, Prof Michael Samuel, for the critical feedback in shaping the paper.

Residents of places where deep underground oil and gas deposits are found want to know about the broader economic, social, and environmental impacts of these activities that generate windfall income for some residents. We first review the literature on windfall spending patterns. Then, using the Marcellus region, the earliest area to be tapped using the new techniques, we estimate county-level employment and income effects. For robustness, we employ two methods. Using a propensity score matching approach we find no effect of fracking on income or employment. A panel-fixed effect regression approach suggests statistically significant employment effects in six out of seven alternative specifications, but significant income effects in only one out of seven specifications. In short, the income spillover effects in the Marcellus region appear to be minimal, meaning there's little incentive at the county level to incur current or potential future costs that may be associated with this activity.

We report petrographical and geochemical data, new geochronological ages and for the first time a detailed geological map representing the eruptive products generated by the Irruputuncu volcano. The detailed study on the volcanic products allows us to establish a temporal evolution of the edifice. We propose that the Irruputuncu volcanic history can be divided in two stages, both dominated by effusive activity: Irruputuncu I and II. The oldest identified products that mark the beginning of Irruputuncu I are small-volume pyroclastic flow deposits generated during an explosive phase that may have been triggered by magma injection as suggested by mingling features in the clasts. This event was followed by generation of large lava flows and the edifice grew until destabilization of its SW flank through the generation of a debris avalanche, which ended Irruputuncu I. New effusive activity generated lavas flows to the NW at the beginning of Irruputuncu II. In the meantime, lava domes that grew in the summit were destabilized, as shown by two well-preserved block-and-ash flow deposits. The first phase of dome collapse, in particular, generated highly mobile pyroclastic flows that propagated up to ∼8 km from their source on gentle slopes as low as 11° in distal areas. The actual activity is characterized by deposition of sulfur and permanent gas emissions, producing a gas plume that reaches 200 m above the crater. The maximum volume of this volcanic system is of ∼4 km3, being one of the smallest active volcano of Central Andes.","AcknowledgmentsThis research was financed by FONDECYT Project N°11100372, ECOS-CONICYT Project C11U01, Institut de Recherche pour le Développement (IRD), and the French Government Laboratory of Excellence initiative n°ANR-10-LABX-0006, the Région Auvergne and the European Regional Development Fund.

Given that floating algae may represent a limiting habitat in many regions, rafting organisms may be unselective and colonize any available seaweed patch at the sea surface. This process may homogenize rafting assemblages on different seaweed species, which our study examined by comparing the assemblages on benthic and floating individuals of the fucoid seaweeds Fucus vesiculosus and Sargassum muticum in the northern Wadden Sea (North Sea). Species richness was about twice as high on S. muticum as on F. vesiculosus, both on benthic and floating individuals. In both seaweed species benthic samples were more diverse than floating samples. However, the species composition differed significantly only between benthic thalli, but not between floating thalli of the two seaweed species. Separate analyses of sessile and mobile epibionts showed that the homogenization of rafting assemblages was mainly caused by mobile species. Among these, grazing isopods from the genus Idotea reached extraordinarily high densities on the floating samples from the northern Wadden Sea, suggesting that the availability of seaweed rafts was indeed limiting. Enhanced break-up of algal rafts associated with intense feeding by abundant herbivores might force rafters to recolonize benthic habitats. These colonization processes may enhance successful dispersal of rafting organisms and thereby contribute to population connectivity between sink populations in the Wadden Sea and source populations from up-current regions.","AcknowledgmentsFinancial support was obtained through BMBF-CONICYT grant 01DN12106 to L.G. and M.T.

Animals in the New Mobilities Studies,"Conceptual work on the history of mobilities has been devoid of animation other than humans and their machines. The deafening automobility of the present has drowned out memories of an “animal past” teleologically, and the raucous rapidity of the mobile machine drives over the “animal present.” This article is an attempt to explore what a history of mobility that takes animals seriously might look like. It is based on the argument that living nonhuman creatures have their own mobilities and that these animobilities have shaped and been shaped by human societies. It is intended to open up historical narratives of a complex, shifting, nonlinear relationship between animals and changing human technologies of transport—as part of this journal's mission to rethink mobility and include more subaltern approaches. A key finding is that mobility's negative sociopolitical and environmental effects on different groups, in fact species, are inversely correlated to their proximity to power. This article touches on several research trajectories, but the focus is on control of mobility by the state, with case studies drawn from southern Africa's history.",,,Transfers,,,,2015-06-01,2015,,,5,2,81-101,Closed,Article,"Swart, Sandra","Swart, Sandra ()",,"Swart, Sandra ()",5,1,,1.05,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1003003444,44 Human Society; 4406 Human Geography,

Since these species have different distributions (16°S–30°S for L. berteroana and 29°S–42°S for L. spicata ), they experience differences in environmental conditions, such as solar irradiance, seawater temperature and air exposure during low tide. This study tested to what extent the genetic distinctness of each of the two species [identified by a mitochondrial marker ( atp8/trnS )] is reflected by ecophysiological traits (total lipids, fatty acid composition, phlorotannins, pigments and variable chlorophyll a fluorescence of PSII) in response to the respective environmental conditions, prevailing along the latitudinal gradient. We studied algal individuals from eight populations (27°S–32°S, including the species overlapping zone). Phlorotannins, pigments and Chl a fluorescence of PSII were most crucial for species-specific adaptations at the respective growth sites, whereas changes in total lipids and fatty acid compositions were negligible. Hence, species differentiation within the L. nigrescens complex is also manifested at the ecophysiological level. These findings may help to predict kelp responses towards future environmental changes.",,,Botanica Marina,,,,2015-04-01,2015,2015-04-01,2015-04-01,58,2,81-92,Closed,Article,"Koch, Kristina; Thiel, Martin; Tellier, Florence; Hagen, Wilhelm; Graeve, Martin; Tala, Fadia; Laeseke, Philipp; Bischof, Kai","Koch, Kristina (Department of Marine Botany and Bremen Marine Ecology Center for Research and Education (BreMarE), University of Bremen, Leobener Str.

This paper analyses water-rights transactions to determine how this water market has behaved in the northern Atacama Desert. It questions the neoliberal assumption that Chile’s unregulated water market has acted as an active tool to reallocate water towards uses that provide the highest economic value. Instead, it argues that the state is the central actor in water allocation. This problematizes the notion that the Chilean water model is one of the most unregulated in the world.","The author thanks Freddy Viñales for his research assistance as well as Carl Bauer, Paul Robbins, Sally Marston, Stephen Lansing and Sarah Kelly for comments made on early drafts of this article.","This work was supported by the Interamerican Foundation (through a Grassroots Development fellowship), the Interdisciplinary Center for Indigenous and Intercultural Studies [CONICYT FONDAP No. 15110006], and the Concurso Nacional de Inserción en la Academia, Convocatoria 2014 [CONICYT PAI No. 79140014].",Water International,,,,2015-11-04,2015,2015-11-04,2016-02-23,41,2,191-212,Closed,Article,"Prieto, Manuel","Prieto, Manuel (Instituto de Investigaciones Arqueológicas y Museo R.P.G.

It is widely distributed across the Antarctic and South Atlantic Oceans and has been the most frequently collected and intensively studied Antarctic echinoid. Despite the abundant literature devoted to Sterechinus, few studies have questioned the systematics of the genus. Sterechinus bernasconiae is the only species of Sterechinus reported from the Pacific Ocean and is only known from the few specimens of the original material. Based on new material collected during the oceanographic cruise INSPIRE on board the R/V Melville, the taxonomy and phylogenetic position of the species are revised. Molecular and morphological analyses show that S. bernasconiae is a subjective junior synonym of Gracilechinus multidentatus (Clark). Results also show the existence of two genetically distinct subclades within the so-called Sterechinus clade: a Sterechinus neumayeri subclade and a subclade composed of other Sterechinus species. The three nominal species Sterechinus antarcticus, Sterechinus diadema, and Sterechinus agassizi cluster together and cannot be distinguished. The species Sterechinus dentifer is weakly differentiated from these three nominal species. The elucidation of phylogenetic relationships between G. multidentatus and species of Sterechinus also allows for clarification of respective biogeographic distributions and emphasizes the putative role played by biotic exclusion in the spatial distribution of species.","Samples were collected during oceanographic campaigns through IPEV (formerly IFRTP) programmes No. 195 BENTHOS-MAC, No. 345 BENTHADEL, and No. 1044 PROTEKER; Chilean programmes INACH 13-05, INACH 02-02, INACH B01-07, ECOS C06B02, and INIDEP 1608; and oceanographic cruises INSPIRE, Antarktis XXIII/8, CEAMARC, CHESSO, BIOPEARL I, and Bentart’06.

He supervised no fewer than 11 MA and doctoral theses in this field between 1930 and 1936, texts which are remarkable for the coherence of the backgrounds of their authors — male, rural, Christian, right-wing — and for the uniformity of their ethnological method — extensive reliance on German linguistics and imperial ethnography as core secondary sources, limited and detached fieldwork practice oriented towards the verbatim recording of texts from elderly men and collection of ethnographic objects on Berlin Mission Society mission stations, and an almost obsessive preoccupation with African sexuality, particularly the alleged promiscuity of women in African cultures. Through a close reading of their theses and published writing, I argue that these pious Afrikaner nationalist men of the post-“English War” generation consolidated volkekunde on the lines established by their mentor in his writings and teachings of the 1920s: that is, as a rigid ideology of difference, powerfully underpinned by concepts of race and racism, deeply informed by a masculine Afrikaner nationalism and the associated politics of segregation. An important subtheme in the theses and correspondence of Eiselen and his protégés is the threatening figure of the liberal woman anthropologist. Contrary to the conventional wisdom that there was a moment of convergence of interests and approaches during the early and mid-1930s between the English-speaking liberal school of social anthropology and “the Stellenbosch school of volkekunde,” I conclude that the latter tradition remained, as it had been when fathered by Eiselen in the 1920s, radically different from social anthropology in its racial politics, its anthropological method and its ethnographic focus.",,,Anthropology Southern Africa,,,,2015-09-29,2015,2015-09-29,2015-10-02,38,3-4,180-197,Closed,Article,"Bank, Andrew","Bank, Andrew (History Department, University of the Western Cape, Bellville, South Africa)","Bank, Andrew (University of the Western Cape)","Bank, Andrew (University of the Western Cape)",5,0,,1.65,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1030174892,44 Human Society; 4401 Anthropology; 4404 Development Studies; 4406 Human Geography,

The estimates of mtDNA haplotype and nucleotide diversity were very similar in New Zealand (h =0.735±0.032, π =0.001±0.001) and Australia (h =0.729±0.027, π =0.001±0.001), but in Chile they were higher (h =0.800±0.089, π =0.002±0.001). The haplotype genealogy showed evidence of two distinct clades, New Zealand and Australia combined (clade 1), and Chile (clade 2). A power analysis suggested that sample sizes were large enough to detect any significant differences within clade 1. Neutrality test, mismatch distribution, and demographic reconstructions based on a coalescence approach, suggested that the Oceania population (clade 1) went through a period of population expansion, whereas the population size of the Chile population (clade 2) has been relatively stable over the last 20,000 years. Data from microsatellite loci also supported the separation of the Oceania and Chile populations. Principal component analysis suggested that there might also be a separation of groups within clade 1, which was not statistically significant (P =0.434). The genetic data reported in this study supported the model of a single G. galeus stock in New Zealand and Australia. Our findings were consistent with previous tagging data that showed individual G. galeus migrate across the Tasman Sea between Australia and New Zealand, and at least some of these migration events result in successful reproduction.","We would like to thank the observers and fisheries biologists from the Ministry for Primary Industries and the National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research (NIWA) in New Zealand, and the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization (CSIRO), Department of Primary Industry, and Marine and Freshwater Fisheries Research Institute in Australia for their help collecting tissues samples of G. galeus.

Here we assessed adaptive phenotypic plasticity in three photoprotective traits (non-photochemical quenching, total soluble sugars, and de-epoxidation state of xanthophylls cycle), and fitness-related traits (maximum quantum yield, photosynthetic rate and total biomass) in the invasive species Poa annua and Deschampsia antarctica under current conditions of water availability and those projected by climate change models. In addition, two manipulative experiments in controlled and field conditions were conducted to evaluate the competitive ability and survival of both species under current and climate change conditions. Moreover, we performed an experiment with different water availabilities to assess cell damage as a potential mechanism involved in the competitive ability deployed in both species. Finally, was assessed the plasticity and biomass of both species subject to factorial abiotic scenarios (water × temperature, and water × nutrients) ranging from current to climate change condition. Overall, results showed that P. annua had greater phenotypic plasticity in photoprotective strategies, higher performance, and greater competitive ability and survival than D. antarctica under current and climate change conditions. Also, cell damage, assessed by lipid peroxidation, was significantly greater in D. antarctica when grown in presence of P. annua compared when grown alone. Finally, P. annua showed a greater plasticity and biomass than D. antarctica under the factorial abiotic scenarios, being more evident under a climate change scenario (i.e., higher soil moisture). Our study suggests that the high adaptive plasticity and competitive ability deployed by P. annua under current and climate change conditions allows it to cope with harsh abiotic conditions and could help explain its successful invasion in the Antarctica.",We are grateful to Fernando Carrasco-Urra for their assistance in the field and logistic support from Antarctic station “Arctowski”.

The effects of drug-related violence on migration decisions in Mexico,"This paper attempts to identify the existence of displacement in Mexico caused by drug-related violence. We identify two types of migrants: (i) migrants moving from nonviolent to violent states, driven by better economic opportunities and less expensive cost of living at destination and (ii) migrants moving from violent to nonviolent states: they still migrate even if the cost of living at destination is more expensive and economic opportunities are lower. Our hypothesis is that for the second type, migrants are fleeing from violence, and are willing to sacrifice economic opportunities in order to gain safety. For instance, when migrants move from nonviolent to violent states, they demand a salary 25% greater in order to increase the odds of migration in 10%. On the contrary, when migrants move from violent to nonviolent states, they only demand an increase in their salary of 15%.",,This work was supported by the seminar of the Drug Policy Program of CIDE.,Journal of Ethnic and Migration Studies,,,,2015-09,2015,2015-09,2016-02-19,42,3,480-502,Closed,Article,"Atuesta, Laura H.; Paredes, Dusan","Atuesta, Laura H.

The methodology used in the research comprises a combination of co-word analysis with Social Networks Analysis organized in a six-step procedure. First, the data retrieval was carried out; second, a list of key words related to the management discipline was created; third, a key word co-occurrence matrix and its normalization using Salton’s Cosine was done; fourth, each key word was assigned to the research line it represents, taking into consideration the 25 divisions that make up the Academy of Management Society; fifth, the internal cohesion was calculated for each research line using the density of the words network that makes it up and each line’s centrality degree; and, sixth, a strategic diagram was created representing the stage of development of each research line. The results show how the research lines Strategic Management Process and Innovation & Technology Management have formed the backbone of the development of management as an academic discipline in LAC. We also present how research lines that are necessary for the economic and social development of the region such as Entrepreneurship, Cooperative Strategy and Public Sector Management appear as peripheral underdeveloped lines.

211,pub.1012584072,10.1016/j.tecto.2015.09.022,,,Stress fields recorded on large-scale strike-slip fault systems: Effects on the tectonic evolution of crustal slivers during oblique subduction,"In continental margins, large-scale, strike-slip fault-systems resulted from oblique subduction commonly exhibit a complex pattern of faulting where major faults define the inland boundary of tectonic slivers that can be detached from the margin. In turn, subsidiary faults bound and define internal tectonic blocks within the sliver which are expected to rotate, translate and/or internally disrupt in order to accommodate the internal deformation. The geometrical and spatial arrangement of faults and tectonic blocks thus determines the evolution of the sliver given a particular stress field regime. The Paposo segment of the Atacama Fault System in northern Chile displays a series of brittle faults whose orientations are hierarchically arranged: low-order faults splay off higher-order faults forming Riedel-type and strike-slip duplexes geometries at several scales. The master (1st- and highest-order) Paposo Fault defines the inland boundary of a tectonic sliver whereas subsidiary faults bound and disrupt internal tectonic blocks. By using newly collected brittle fault-slip data we estimated the orientations and regimes of the stress fields that acted upon the entire sliver, the different fault-orders and the tectonic blocks. Results indicate that an overall transtensional – with NW-compressional and NE-tensional principal axes – strike-slip regime affected the sliver and triggered the development of left-lateral strike-slip structures. An incomplete split of the stress field imposed by the subduction process resulted in the generation of a nested pattern of R-type faults as well as in a combined strike-slip/normal faulting disruption of the tectonic blocks within the sliver.","AcknowledgmentsWe would like to thank the Chilean National Science Foundation (FONDECYT) for supporting this research through Research Grant FONDECYT 11080233.

This includes the anomalous Herschel 36 profile, exhibiting a prominent, broad red tail, and the typically observed narrow profiles, exhibiting much narrower, but noticeable red tails. This study was motivated by the inability of previous rotational contour modeling work to account for the narrow and broad red tails. We show that the full profiles, for all the observations, can consistently be modeled as a superposition of two overlapping DIBs, with peaks at 6613.6 and 6614.2 Å. Each DIB is plausibly fit using a prolate, parallel band, symmetric top spectral contour model. For λ6613.6, there are small differences in the rotational constants, less than 1%, between the upper and lower transition states; whereas, for λ6614.2, the differences are much larger, ∼ −5%. These results are consistent with λ6614.2 being the source of the narrow and broad red tails. The fit residuals are shown to be consistent with contributions from overlapping spectra, attributed to closely spaced vibrational sequences, originating from low frequency vibrations. We suggest that such sequences may be the source of the anomalous broadening needed to obtain good spectral fits to narrow DIB profiles. We discuss how λ6614.2 and the other Herschel 36 extended red tail DIBs help bridge the association gap between the narrow, absorption DIBs and the even broader and more redshifted emission features observed for the Red Rectangle. Finally, the broader implications of this study, in the context of identifying DIB molecular carriers, are discussed.","The authors thank the anonymous reviewer for a thorough and careful reading and many useful and critical comments that resulted in significant improvements to the paper.

The Vaal Uprising of September 1984, triggered by dissatisfaction over rent increases and an illegitimate and defunct local government, heralded the beginning of the insurrectionary period. However, while the uprisings of the mid 1980s have attracted sustained scholarly interest, the processes that underwrote the rebellious momentum and the discourses and practices shaping civic politics warrant greater attention. Based on a large body of archival material and life history interviews, this article examines the roots of the emerging Charterist civic movement in the Vaal Triangle. It seeks to show that civic politics emerged along multiple fault lines, which reflected complex processes of inclusion and exclusion. Antagonism towards community councillors increased in the years before the uprising, and led to the defining of collective identities and the forging of a political ‘community’ that excluded them. These processes of inclusion and exclusion reflected not only contestations over the political order but multiple cleavages rooted in a failure on the part of councillors to honour the social contract. With the formation of underground units of the African National Congress in 1982 and the establishment of the Vaal Civic Association in 1983, localised processes of conflict and discourses of contestation began to intersect with anti-apartheid politics. The article argues that these layers of contestation finally led to a politics of difference that provided the matrix for rebellion.",,,Journal of Southern African Studies,,,,2015-11-02,2015,2015-12-09,2015-11-02,41,6,1181-1198,Closed,Article,"Rueedi, Franziska","Rueedi, Franziska (University of the Witwatersrand)",,"Rueedi, Franziska (University of the Witwatersrand)",1,0,,0.4,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1030313938,44 Human Society; 4408 Political Science,

First, data on 1988–1998 enrolments showing a ‘skewed revolution’ in student africanisation are summarised. Then, using 2000–2012 data for the 23 new post‐2000 universities and universities of technology, it is argued that the ‘official’ categorisation of these institutions masks new socio‐economic inequalities; and a better understanding of the ‘skewed’ and ‘stalled’ africanisation revolution is possible using classification into three proposed new categories based on postgraduate enrolments and staff publications as indices of research‐intensivity at each institution: (1) five ‘upper band’ universities; (2) seven ‘middle band’ universities; and (3) eleven ‘lower band’ universities. The paper concludes by distinguishing between ‘reformist’ and ‘radical’ national transformation policies in order to identify their impact on these new race‐ and class‐based student inequalities.","Acknowledgments Ashraf Conrad, Principle Planning Officer of the Institutional Planning Department of the University of Cape Town, is thanked for his work in constructing the data (from HEDA, 2014) that enabled the analyses of Table &amp; .

Herein salmon aquaculture release of ammonium ( NH 4 + ) to the water column and its effects on natural archaea and bacteria ammonia-oxidizers (AOA and AOB) and nitrite-oxidizing bacteria (NOB) community structure were studied in the Comau fjord using molecular approaches, such as: cloning (AOA and AOB richness), qPCR for C. Nitrosopumilus maritimus (AOA) and Nitrospina sp. (NOB) abundance (DNA) and RT-qPCR only for Nitrospina sp activity (RNA). Sampling was carried out in brackish (0.7–25 salinity, <5 m depth) and marine (>30 salinity, 25 m depth) waters during contrasting salmon production periods: rest (winter 2012), growth and harvest (summer and winter 2013). During the rest period, the highest NH 4 + concentration was observed at Vodudahue River, whereas during productive periods NH 4 + accumulated in the brackish layer inside salmon cages and in the vicinty (up to 700 m distance from the cages). The nitrifier community from the fjord reference station (Stn-C) was characterized by C. N. maritimus (AOA) and Nitrosomonas sp. (AOB) sequences affiliated with cosmopolitan ecotypes (e.g., marine, freshwater, hydrothermal), maxima abundances of C. N. maritimus (AOA) and Nitrospina sp. and extreme ranges of Nitrospina sp. activity occurred in the brackish layer. During productive periods, abundances of C. N. maritimus were co-varied with NH 4 + concentrations inside salmon cages (summer) and the adjacent areas (winter). Productive periods were characterized by lower abundances but more homogeneity between brackish and marine areas than for the Stn-C nitrifiers. The physiological state of Nitrospina sp. estimated from cDNA:DNA ratios indicated higher growth during winter 2013 associated with NH 4 + enrichment derived from production and river input. Our results suggest that in Comau Fjord, NH 4 + enrichment events occur during salmon production and also naturally by river inputs, supporting an abundant and active nitrifying community potentially processing only part of the extra NH 4 + that occurs, predominantly outside the salmon cages. Our work highlights the abundance and activities of nitrifying communities and identifies these communities as being sensitive to increased loads of NH 4 + .","This research was supported by funds from the Comisión Nacional de Investigación Científica y Tecnológica (CONICYT, Chile), FONDECYT grants No. 1110190 and 1110824, Andrés Bello University Introduction to Research grant No. DI-409-13/I and the WAFOW project at NTNU, financed by the Norwegian Research Council (project no: 193661).

Quinoa's tolerance to salinity and other types of abiotic stresses provides it with high potential in a world where scarcity of water and increased soil salinization are important causes of crop failures. Due to its traditionally broad cultivation area (from Colombia to southern Chile), there is a wide range of quinoa cultivars adapted to specific conditions displaying a broad genetic variability in stress tolerance. In addition, being practically unique as a halophytic seed-producing crop with amazing nutritional properties, it is ideal as a model species for investigating morphological, cellular, physiological, and bio-molecular mechanisms of salinity tolerance. This review summarizes current knowledge of genotype-dependent variability in salinity responses and adaptive salt-tolerance mechanisms in quinoa. These include anatomical features and physiological aspects, such as osmotic adjustment through accumulation of ions, osmoprotectants, and sodium loading, transport, and storage, including the activity and gene expression of plasma and vacuolar membrane transporters. Finally, current knowledge regarding the effect of salinity on the nutritional properties of quinoa is discussed.","The authors are grateful to Verena Adolf, Andres Zurita-Silva, Giovanni Dinelli, Sara Maldonado, Hernan Burrieza, and Didier Bazile for useful discussions.","Financial contributions from the TWAS-ICGEB exchange programme (“Tolerance strategies of quinoa plants under salt stress” CRP.PB/CHI06-01), the EU-IRSES program (PIRSES-GA-2008–230862), the EU-FP7 project SWUP-MED (“Sustainable water use securing food production in dry areas of the Mediterranean region”), and Fondecyt (Ministry of Education, Chile) project No. 3130624 (to K.B.R) are gratefully acknowledged.",Plant Biosystems - An International Journal Dealing with all Aspects of Plant Biology,,,,2015-04-08,2015,2015-04-08,2016-03-03,150,2,357-371,Closed,Article,"Ruiz, K.

Active normal faulting occurs conspicuously in the Coastal Forearc at the southern end of this gap, between 22.7°S and 24°S. There, upper crustal extension is present right above a suggested subduction segment boundary of the Nazca-South America interplate contact. In this work, by using Coulomb Failure Stress Change (CFS) models, we explore the effects of coseismic and interseismic stages of the subduction earthquake cycle on the reactivation of pre-existing upper plate normal faults in this area. We attempt to unravel the first-order interplate conditions required to explain this extensional pattern, putting specific focus on the influence of the megathrust segmentation defined by the Mejillones Peninsula. It is suggested that the restricted occurrence of active normal faulting in the study area is tightly related to the structure of the interplate seismogenic zone. Positive CFS values are induced in the study area by the coseismic and interseismic stages of the subduction earthquake cycle, in a region characterized by lower coupling beneath the Mejillones Peninsula. We propose that fault reactivation in this zone is particularly favored during the coseismic stage by earthquakes occurring offshore of the Mejillones Peninsula and surrounding areas. In the adjacent subduction segments, coseismic and interseismic CFS values tend to counterbalance each other, resulting in no tensional conditions capable to cause normal fault reactivation. We suggest that the coupling variation in the seismogenic zone is long term controlled by the geological structure of the upper plate.","We thank the Chilean National Science Foundation (CONICYT) for the financial support of our research through the grant FONDAP 15110017.

176,pub.1047912358,10.1108/jpbm-08-2014-0696,,,The influence of “Facebook friends” on the intention to join brand pages,"Purpose
                    – This paper aims to examine the role of Facebook friends on the intention to join brand pages in this social network site (SNS). SNSs have grown in both popularity and use. They allow individuals to articulate their social networks by developing a list of other members on the site with whom they share a connection. These platforms also allow companies to create profiles to promote their brands. However, many firms have jumped into SNSs by creating a “brand page” without fully understanding how to spread it successfully.
                  
                  
                    Design/methodology/approach
                    – Two experiments were developed. In the first one, the authors manipulated how the individual comes to know about brand pages. Participants discovered a brand page through a friend with whom they have either a strong tie or a weak tie. In the second experiment (2 × 2), the authors manipulated tie strength (strong vs weak) and the type of recommendation (active vs passive).
                  
                  
                    Findings
                    – Results of the first study show that as the individual has more experience in Facebook (measured in this paper through satisfaction, past behavior of following brands and Facebook intensity), the effect of tie strength on the intention to join a brand page dilutes. The second study confirms Study 1 and shows that strong ties exert more influence than weak ties when the brand page is actively recommended by Facebook friends.
                  
                  
                    Practical implications
                    – This paper shows that the influence of strong ties is particularly important for individuals with low levels of experience in Facebook. As experience in SNSs is expected to continue growing, managers should not forget the role of weak ties as a source of information for their networked friends. Strong ties only remain more influential than weak ties when the information about the brand page is received through an invitation.
                  
                  
                    Originality/value
                    – This paper explores the interpersonal influences in Facebook, asserting that the influence of tie strength depends on the level of experience in the SNS, and on the way, information about the brand page is received.","This research was supported by the grant ECO2012-35766 from the Spanish Ministry of Economics and Competitiveness and by the Fundación Séneca-Agencia de Ciencia y Tecnología de la Región de Murcia (Spain), under the II PCTRM 2007-2010.

A vertex is recovered when it becomes connected to the depot by an already constructed path. Due dates for recovery times are associated with vertices. The problem is to obtain a construction schedule that minimizes the maximum lateness of vertices, or the number of tardy vertices. We introduce these new problems, discuss their computational complexity, and present mixed-integer linear programming formulations, heuristics, a branch-and-bound algorithm, and results of computational experiments.",The work of Igor Averbakh was supported by a grant from the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC).

In some places, however, network users are subject to attacks, resulting in assaults to drivers and cargo theft. In an attempt to solve this problem, a binary integer programming model is developed, whose objective is to maximize the expected vehicle coverage across the network. The model dynamically locates patrol units through a fixed time horizon, subject to movement and location constraints, considering a probability of not being able to attend to an attack, due to a distance factor. A chronological decomposition heuristic is developed, and achieves an optimality gap of less than 1 %, in less than 5 min. The problem is also solved by developing a geographical decomposition heuristic. To introduce a measure of equity, two sets of constraints are proposed. Three measures are considered: total vehicle coverage, inequity and network coverage. A trade-off between these three measures is observed and discussed. Finally, scalability of the model is explored, using decomposition in terms of patrolling units, until we obtain subproblems of equal size as the original instance. All of these features are applied to a case study in Northern Israel. In the last section, some adaptations and additions to the model that can be made in further research are discussed.","The authors would like to thank the Associate Editor and anonymous referees for their comments on earlier versions of this paper.

160,pub.1058945975,10.1088/0004-637x/809/1/107,,,MULTIPLICITY AMONG F-TYPE STARS. II.,"In continuation of our previous study we present an updated census of new companions and model atmosphere analyses for some 50 southern dwarfs, mostly in the mass range . For the common-proper-motion companions μ Vir B, HR 2225 B, HD 67199 B, and HD 114853 B, we confirm their physical association from their radial velocities. We report the discovery of the F-type visual binary α For as a field blue straggler and confirm (ζ Ret, HR 5864) or identify (HD 67199, HR 4013, HR 8843) another five mass transfer systems or candidates. For the F stars Eri and 111 Tau, we present and cases for astrometric binaries by virtue of the very accurate van Leeuwen Hipparcos parallaxes. Following the work of Shaya & Olling, we suggest the F-type star ι Vir to be a wide (0.37 pc) hierarchical quadruple system. We confirm the visual binary NLTT 23781/2 as a common-proper-motion object to the very wide (0.54 pc) F star 40 Leo, but discard the G star HD 128987 as an ultra-wide (1.01 pc) physical companion to the α Lib quadruple system on account of a diverse metallicity. The improved statistics of our sample establishes the previously discovered positive correlation of stellar multiplicities with primary mass. For the F star multiplicity census in the mass range , we find that at least a quarter consists of triple or higher level systems and at least two out of three F stars are non-single.","This work has made extensive use of the Catalogue of Nearby Stars (CNS4) of the Astronomisches Rechen-Institut at Heidelberg, Germany, the ESA Hipparcos catalog, NASA’s ADS bibliographic service, and the CDS SIMBAD database, operated at Strasbourg, France.

Nevertheless, variable differences in 10Be concentrations according to grain size have been reported. We analyzed these differences in eleven catchments on the western side of the Andes, covering contrasting climates and slopes. The data include eight sand (0.5–1 mm) and gravel (1–3 cm) pairs and twelve sand (0.5–1 mm) and pebble (5–10 cm) pairs. The difference observed in three pairs can be explained by a difference in the provenance of the sand and coarser sediment. The other sand–pebble pairs show a lower 10Be concentration in the pebbles, except for one pair that shows similar concentrations. Two sand–gravel pairs show a lower 10Be concentration in the gravel and the other five pairs show a higher 10Be concentration in the gravel. Differences in climate do not reveal a particular influence on the 10Be concentration between pairs. The analysis supports a model where pebbles and gravel are mainly derived from catchment areas that are eroding at a faster rate. The five gravel samples with high 10Be concentrations probably contain gravel that were derived from the abrasion of cobbles exhumed at high elevations. In order to validate this model, further work should test if pebbles are preferentially exhumed from high erosion rate areas, and if the difference between pebbles with high 10Be concentrations and sand decreases when the erosion rate tends to be homogeneous within a catchment.","This study was funded by the Agence Nationale pour la Recherche, project ANDES (ANR-06-JCJC0100), the Institut de Recherche pour le Développement (IRD) and the ECOS-Conycit program (project C11U02).

Sedimentologic and sequence stratigraphic studies reveal facies associations of a continental shelf setting. Textural variations indicate that coarsening and fining up of the succession are due to relative sea level rise and fall, respectively. Magnetostratigraphy was integrated with bio- and tephro- stratigraphic data to construct a record of high-resolution chronology. The age model constrains the Tiburon Basin lower section between 4.2 Ma and 2.8 Ma. The record is likely to be controlled in part by sea level change with orbital periodicities of obliquity (∼40 ka of frequency) and, between 3.2 Ma and 2.9 Ma a high-amplitude sea level fall is correlated to global climatic deterioration and the onset of major Northern Hemisphere glaciations.","AcknowledgementsThis research was funded by the Foundation for Research Science and Technology of New Zealand (grant reference numbers: UOOX0207 &amp; UOOX0712), U.S. National Science Foundation (grant reference numbers: 0119298 &amp; 0203555) and CONICYT – Chile (PhD scholarship to the first author, Project Id.: 05-DOCBIRF-41).

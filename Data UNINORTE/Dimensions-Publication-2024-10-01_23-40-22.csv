Clarias gariepinus is a highly valued and cheap staple to local communities and an ideal aquaculture species. Consequently, interest in the parasitic communities of C. gariepinus has increased as parasites may accidentally be ingested by humans when eating uncooked fish or can be introduced into culture systems through fish stocks supplied from local rivers which affect yield, growth, and marketability. This review provides an overview of the ∼107 metazoan parasite species known to parasitise C. gariepinus in Africa and their general life cycles, morphology, paratenic and post-cyclic infections, and the biogeography and validity of records are discussed. A brief overview is included on the application of some of these parasites in environmental studies and their link to human health.","This work is based on the research and researchers supported by the National Research Foundation (NRF) – South African Research Chairs Initiative of the Department of Science and Innovation (DSI) (Inland Fisheries and Freshwater Ecology, Grant no. 110507) and National Research Foundation (NRF) of South Africa (Project CPRR160429163437; P.I.: N.J.

The traditional form of learning is expanding through the use of new approaches and teaching methods, learning systems, and information technology. Individual learning trajectory allows the learner to regulate the order of studying course modules and the pace of mastering the subject material. Decision-making in choosing the learning trajectory can be supported by specialized methods and tools.

2004,pub.1157922299,10.1201/9781003429258-76,,,Environmental efficiency assessment of RCA inclusion as partial replacement of virgin aggregates in HMA and WMA,"Road infrastructure is one of the economic sectors with the most significant environmental impact on the planet. Nonetheless, the construction and preservation of pavements are essential for the sustained economic development of the communities. Therefore, it is necessary to find and implement methods, techniques, or designs that reduce the environmental burden caused by this industry. Hence, in this research effort, two sustainability alternatives are explored to optimize the design of traditional hot mix asphalt (HMA) from an eco-efficiency perspective, namely, recycle concrete aggregate (RCA) and warm mix asphalt (WMA). Specifically, the life cycle assessment (LCA) procedure was used to determine the optimal conditions for WMA production through chemical additive technology and the partial substitution of natural aggregates (NAs) by RCA. Accordingly, several asphalt mix designs were proposed to identify the influence of the design variables on the total environmental damage generated during the manufacturing processes. Coarse RCA contents of 0, 10, 20, 30 and 40% were evaluated for HMA and WMA. Regarding the WMAs, dosage combinations of RCA and chemical additive (0.1, 0.2, 0.3, and 0.4% by weight of asphalt binder) were assessed. The main findings of this case study were: (i) amounts of coarse RCA equal to or higher than 20% induce a more harmful environmental effect than that of NAs, this due to the increase in the asphalt binder demand that this waste material provokes; (ii) the additional environmental impacts associated with the chemical additives production are insignificant compared to the savings obtained by reducing mixing and compaction temperatures.","The authors express their sincere gratitude to the Administrative Department of Science, Technology, and Innovation (COLCIENCIAS) and the Universidad del Norte for funding this study through the “Research Project 745/2016, Contract 037-2017, No. 1215-745-59105”.",,,Roads and Airports Pavement Surface Characteristics,,,2023-05-10,2023,2023-05-10,,,,778-787,Closed,Chapter,"Polo-Mendoza, Rodrigo; Turbay, Emilio; Martinez-Arguelles, Gilberto; Peñabaena-Niebles, Rita","Polo-Mendoza, Rodrigo (Faculty of Science, Charles University, Prague, Czech Republic, Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); Turbay, Emilio (Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); Martinez-Arguelles, Gilberto (Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); Peñabaena-Niebles, Rita (Department of Industrial Engineering, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia)",,"Polo-Mendoza, Rodrigo (Charles University); Turbay, Emilio (Universidad del Norte); Martinez-Arguelles, Gilberto (Universidad del Norte); Peñabaena-Niebles, Rita (Universidad del Norte)",6,6,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1157922299,33 Built Environment and Design; 3302 Building; 40 Engineering; 4005 Civil Engineering; 41 Environmental Sciences; 4104 Environmental Management,"12 Responsible Consumption and Production; 9 Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure"

SFL sees language as a social semiotic that shapes and is shaped by its use in social contexts. The chapter offers a brief overview of the development of SFL and its major contributors and exemplifies analysis of grammatical metaphor in classroom discourse to illustrate how the theory connects context and language. The chapter then highlights the approaches and tools from SFL that have been used by discourse analysts from various fields to explore semiotic manifestations in the areas of education, social justice, health, memory, and politics, at different social, temporal, and spatial scales. It shows how, grounded in SFL’s theory of language, critical discourse analysts have developed work that offers both deconstructive approaches to social problems as well as celebratory and reconstructive approaches that indicate how such problems may be redressed. Recognizing the active role of language in social life, SFL offers a means of understanding social contexts as discursive situated practices. New directions in SFL discourse analysis are briefly outlined.",,,,The Routledge Handbook of Discourse Analysis,,,2023-03-30,2023,2023-03-30,2023-03-30,,,156-169,Closed,Chapter,"Schleppegrell, Mary J.; Oteíza, Teresa","Schleppegrell, Mary J.

The idea of sustainable futures lies at the heart of contemporary education and development agendas, including UNESCO’s Futures of Education initiative, which aims to reimagine how knowledge and learning can shape the future of humanity and the planet by equipping learners with diverse ways of being and knowing. Yet, much of the knowledge, values and skills in formal education continues to be Eurocentric, and many education systems maintain colonial legacies of exclusion and violence. Protests, including those led by the Black Lives Matter, Rhodes Must Fall, Indigenous and other anti-colonial, anti-racist social movements, have called for education to be decolonized and for diverse knowledge systems, languages and values to be the basis for realizing equitable and sustainable futures. These demands have become accentuated by multiple crises, including the Covid-19 pandemic. The book looks at the journey towards decolonization and sustainable futures from theoretical and practitioner perspectives: introducing concepts that underpin debates about decolonized futures; bringing to the fore the epistemic injustice in the exclusion and marginalization of non-Western knowledge systems, languages and value systems; and exploring different approaches to praxis in schools, universities and society. It also develops a call for reparative futures, highlighting the need for acknowledgement and repair of past injustice and violence in order to build dignified and inclusive futures for all. Bringing together the perspectives of researchers, policy makers, activists, educators and practitioners, this book critically interrogates the Western-centric assumptions underpinning education and development agendas and the colonial legacies of violence they often uphold. The book considers the crucial connection between the idea of sustainable futures and the demand to decolonise education. Containing an innovative mixture of text, stories and poetry, it explores how decolonised futures can be conceived and enacted, offering theoretical and practical examples, including from practice in educational and cultural organisations. In doing so, the book highlights education’s potential role in facilitating processes of reparative justice that can contribute to decolonised futures. Bringing together the perspectives of researchers, policy makers, activists, educators and practitioners, this book critically interrogates the Western-centric assumptions underpinning education and development agendas and the colonial legacies of violence they often uphold. This chapter explores the idea of reparation through pedagogy. It draws on experiences across the Education, Justice and Memory network (EdJAM), which supports creative approaches to teaching and learning about past violence and injustice, supporting 25 projects in 13 countries led by educators, artists, activists and heritage-sector professionals. Using examples from EdJAM’s practice, the chapter describes features of reparative pedagogy as: dignifying, truth-telling, multiplicitous, responsible and creative. It illustrates these as petals of a flower; beautiful in their own right but working together to create something more. Conceptualizing pedagogy as reparative adds to theorizing around material, symbolic, epistemic and affective reparation and also recognizes the existing creative work that educators and students are doing towards reparation despite considerable odds.",,,,Decolonizing Education for Sustainable Futures,"Yvette Hutchinson, Artemio Arturo Cortez Ochoa, Julia Paulson, Leon Tikly",,2023-06-21,2023,2023-06-21,,,,220-240,Closed,Chapter,"Paulson, Julia","Paulson, Julia ()",,"Paulson, Julia ()",5,4,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1160229665,39 Education; 3904 Specialist Studies In Education,4 Quality Education

The most important roots and tubers are potatoes, sweet potatoes, cassava, yams, carrots, and beetroots. They are used for the obtention of several products, such as chips, snacks, soaps, purees, starches, sugars, and colorants, among others. The in natura roots and tubers are high-moisture and high perishable products. Consequently, drying is an important unit operation to increase their stability. However, traditional drying can also jeopardize the quality of those products. This chapter describes the main properties of the most important roots and crops, as well as different strategies for drying them. Both traditional and emerging processing approaches are detailed to achieve products with the desired functionality. Future challenges and perspectives are also discussed.","Acknowledgments The authors are grateful to: • the São Paulo Research Foundation (FAPESP, Brazil) for funding the project n° 2019/05043-6 and the GR Carvalho postdoctoral fellowships (2018/17844-0; 2021/10199-5); • the “Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior—Brazil (CAPES)” for funding the PhD scholarships of KC Santos (88887.613529/2021-00); JS Guedes (88887.513566/2020-00) and BS Bitencourt (88887.636998/2021-00); • the “Programa Nacional de Investigación Científica y Estudios Avanzados” (ProCiencia, Peru) from the “Consejo Nacional de Ciencia, Tecnología e Innovación Tecnológica” (CONCYTEC, Peru) for funding the project n° 409-2019-FONDECYT; • the Universidad Privada del Norte (UPN, Peru) for funding the project n° 20201005; • This study was carried out in the Center Européen de Biotechnologie et deBioéconomie (CEBB), supported by the Région Grand Est, Département de la Marne, Greater Reims (France) and the European Union.

We set the context by describing the problem of plastic globally and how the Global South is a focal point for environmental and human health impacts, before analyzing political and structural conditions of waste management in a few selected countries in Southeast Asia and Africa. Then, we review social and behavioral factors that contribute to plastic pollution, from social norms to religious and cultural aspects not typically considered. We summarize what is known about plastic pollution and human health with particular reference to waste pickers. We close by reviewing opportunities and challenges, giving positive examples of change, and highlighting research gaps.","Acknowledgments Parts of this chapter extend earlier discussions of plastic pollution in Nigeria, which appeared in: Dumbili E, Henderson L: The Challenge of Plastic Pollution in Nigeria.

Despite being positioned as a high tourist attraction, it has been possible to identify that there is a lack of public-private articulation, as well as the participation of the academy in the development of projects with a greater regional impact, weaknesses in the working capital of the sector, little entrepreneurship, and innovation around the generation of new tourism products.

The interaction between individuals and their environment enables the detection of abnormal patterns that may arise from a decline in their cognitive abilities. In this study, we evaluate the CASAS Kyoto dataset from WSU University, which provides information on the daily living activities of individuals within an indoor environment. We developed a model to predict activities such as Cleaning, Cooking, Eating, Washing hands, and Phone Call. A novel approach is proposed, which involves preprocessing and segmenting the dataset using sliding windows. Furthermore, we conducted experiments with various classifiers to determine the optimal choice for the model. The final model utilizes the regression classification technique and is trained on a reduced dataset containing only 5 features.

Studies have been done in various countries about gender equality in the field, showing that in academic philosophy, as opposed to what happens in other humanities and social sciences, there has been no significant progress toward equality in terms of the participation of women in teaching and research positions. In the Colombian case, there is no information about women’s participation in philosophical academia. This study offers a descriptive analysis of women’s participation in philosophy programs in Colombia, showing that we are still a long way from gender equality in the field (24.8 %).

Therefore, a sensor wake-up mechanism is introduced to study multi-interference sources based on block-compressed sensing positioning method. First, wake up the sensor nodes periodically, while improving the utilization effectiveness of the sensor nodes and the accuracy of positioning information collection; secondly, considering that the distance between the distance and the received signal strength cannot be determined when the transmission power of the interference source is unknown and changes. Then, based on the compressive sensing theory, the positioning problem is modeled as a block sparse vector reconstruction problem; finally, a variation-based algorithm is designed by exploring the law of power variation. The Wake-VBEM reconstruction algorithm based on Bayesian mean expectation accurately reconstructs the target position vector. The simulation proves that the proposed method can simultaneously realize the position estimation of multiple interference sources and effectively improve the service life of the network when the interference source power is unknown and changes.",,,Lecture Notes in Networks and Systems,Intelligent Computing and Networking,"Valentina Emilia Balas, Vijay Bhaskar Semwal, Anand Khandare",,2023-08-05,2023,2023-08-05,2023,699,,453-463,Closed,Chapter,"Yadav, Amar Pal; Davuluri, Sandeep Kumar; Charan, Piyush; Keshta, Ismail; Gavilán, Juan Carlos Orosco; Dhiman, Gaurav","Yadav, Amar Pal (CSE-AI College: Noida Institute of Engineering and Technology Greater Noida, Greater Noida, India); Davuluri, Sandeep Kumar (Department of Information Technology, University of the Cumberlands, 40769, Williamsburg, KY, USA); Charan, Piyush (Electronics and Communication Engineering, Manav Rachna University, Faridabad, India); Keshta, Ismail (Computer Science and Information Systems Department, College of Applied Sciences, AlMaarefa University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia); Gavilán, Juan Carlos Orosco (Universidad Privada del Norte, campus virtual, Lima, Peru); Dhiman, Gaurav (Institute of Engineering and Technology, Chitkara University, Punjab, India)","Davuluri, Sandeep Kumar (University of the Cumberlands)","Yadav, Amar Pal (CSE-AI College: Noida Institute of Engineering and Technology Greater Noida, Greater Noida, India); Davuluri, Sandeep Kumar (University of the Cumberlands); Charan, Piyush (Electronics and Communication Engineering, Manav Rachna University, Faridabad, India); Keshta, Ismail (AlMaarefa University); Gavilán, Juan Carlos Orosco (Private University of the North); Dhiman, Gaurav (Chitkara University)",2,2,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1163033257,40 Engineering; 4006 Communications Engineering; 46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4603 Computer Vision and Multimedia Computation; 4605 Data Management and Data Science; 4606 Distributed Computing and Systems Software,

This systematic literature review explores the role of DR and information visualization (IV) techniques in interactive models (IM). We search relevant bibliographic databases, including IEEE Xplore, Springer Link, and Web of Science, for publications from the last five years. We identify 1448 scientific articles, which we then narrow down to 52 after screening and selection. This study addresses three research questions, revealing that the number of articles focused on interactive DR-oriented models has been in the minority in the last five years. However, related topics such as IV techniques or RD methods have increased. Trends are identified in the development of interactive models, as well as in IV techniques and RD methods. For example, researchers are increasingly proposing new DR methods or modifying existing ones rather than relying solely on established techniques. Furthermore, scatter plots have emerged as the predominant option for IV in interactive models, with limited options for customizing the display of raw data and details in application windows. Overall, this review provides insights into the current state of interactive IV models for DR and highlights areas for further research.","Authors acknowledge the valuable support by SDAS Research Group (https://sdas-group.com/, accessed on 26 Mars 2023).",,Lecture Notes in Computer Science,Computational Science and Its Applications – ICCSA 2023,"Osvaldo Gervasi, Beniamino Murgante, David Taniar, Bernady O.

One of the most effective ways to reduce CO2 emissions is the partial substitution of cement with mineral admixtures in concrete and mortars without jeopardizing their mechanical and durability properties. The positive impact on the environment is especially relevant when those mineral admixtures come from industrial byproducts. However, international standards do not offer sufficient guidelines to characterize mortar mixtures that incorporate byproducts as mineral admixtures. Nonetheless, some of those waste mineral admixtures allow for improving properties, such as capillary absorption and mechanical performance in mixtures. The method proposed in this research allows establishing the absorption capacity of the mortar through an experimental setup based on the porosity of the specimens. This research found a relationship between absorption and compressive strength, validating the inverse relationship between both properties and preparing the path for new standardizations for the mineral admixtures used.",,,RILEM Bookseries,Testing and Experimentation in Civil Engineering,"Carlos Chastre, José Neves, Diogo Ribeiro, Fernando F.

However, they have limitations, such as not being scalable and not allowing integrations with other software, e.g., ALOHA (Areal Locations of Hazardous Atmospheres). This work seeks to develop an intelligent system to predict atmospheric dispersion in common chemicals in industries. The variables involved in the process are studied and characterized, and the tool is designed and implemented using machine learning techniques and validated through different case studies. After characterizing the parameters, the following step is creating the database to develop the automatic learning tool. Furthermore, the results obtained by applying the techniques such as Random Forest (RF), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) were compared to evaluate them as suitable alternatives for atmospheric dispersion prediction, the objective is to obtain a predictive tool as accurately as possible without using ALOHA software.

The objective was to incorporate decolonial thinking into analysing IDN artifacts through cross-cultural dialogue and collaboration. To achieve this, students were randomly divided into 20 groups comprising individuals from both countries and were assigned to work together across different time zones and geography. Students were prepared with an introduction to decolonial thinking and interactive digital narratives (IDNs). For the cross-cultural analysis, students used a methodology that merges the SPP model, the transformation aspect of IDN user experience, and the decoding position to reflect on how the artifacts perpetuate coloniality. Our results indicate that cross-cultural dialogue enabled students to counter colonial norms of universalism and Eurocentrism in IDNs through collaboration and interaction across the globe.",,,Lecture Notes in Computer Science,Interactive Storytelling,"Lissa Holloway-Attaway, John T.

An accurate an on time diagnosis could delay severe damage in the eye or vision loss. Currently, the diagnosis is supported by a retinography and visual evaluation by a trained clinician. However, retinography evaluation is a difficult task due to differences in contrast, brightness and the presence of artifacts. In this work we propose a convolutional neural network (CNN) model to detect and grading DR to support the diagnosis from a fundus image. Moreover, we used the transfer learning technique to reuse the first layers from deep neural networks previously trained. We carried out experiments using different convolutional architectures and their performance for DR grading was evaluated on the APTOS database. The VGG-16 was the architecture with higher results, overcoming the other networks and other related works. The best experimentation we obtained reached an accuracy value of 83.52% for DR grading tasks. Experimental results show that the CNN based transfer learning achieve high performance taking the knowledge learning from pretrained network and saving computational time in the training process, which turns out suitable for small dataset as DR medical images.",,"This work has received funding from the Spain Ministry of Universities, NextGenerationEU - European Union, and Recovery, Transformation and Resilience Plan, as well as from research projects PI21/00064 and PI18/00169 (ISCIII and Fondos FEDER) funds and the URV grant 2019-PFR-B2-6, which partially support this research.",Lecture Notes in Computer Science,Computer Information Systems and Industrial Management,"Khalid Saeed, Jiří Dvorský, Nobuyuki Nishiuchi, Makoto Fukumoto",,2023-09-15,2023,2023-09-15,2023,14164,,240-252,Closed,Chapter,"Escorcia-Gutierrez, José; Cuello, Jose; Gamarra, Margarita; Romero-Aroca, Pere; Caicedo, Eduardo; Valls, Aida; Puig, Domenec","Escorcia-Gutierrez, José (Department of Computational Science and Electronic, Corporación Universitaria de la Costa, CUC, 080001, Barranquilla, Colombia); Cuello, Jose (Electronic and Telecommunications Engineering Program, Universidad Autónoma del Caribe, 080001, Barranquilla, Colombia); Gamarra, Margarita (Department of System Engineering, Universidad del Norte, 080001, Barranquilla, Colombia); Romero-Aroca, Pere (Ophthalmology Service, Universitari Hospital Sant Joan, Institut de Investigacio Sanitaria Pere Virgili [IISPV], 43204, Reus, Spain); Caicedo, Eduardo (School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Universidad del Valle, 760032, Cali, Colombia); Valls, Aida (Departament d’Enginyeria Informàtica i Matemàtiques, Escola Tècnica Superior d’Enginyeria, Universitat Rovira i Virgili, 43007, Tarragona, Spain); Puig, Domenec (Departament d’Enginyeria Informàtica i Matemàtiques, Escola Tècnica Superior d’Enginyeria, Universitat Rovira i Virgili, 43007, Tarragona, Spain)","Escorcia-Gutierrez, José (University of the Coast)","Escorcia-Gutierrez, José (University of the Coast); Cuello, Jose (Universidad Autónoma del Caribe); Gamarra, Margarita (Universidad del Norte); Romero-Aroca, Pere (Ophthalmology Service, Universitari Hospital Sant Joan, Institut de Investigacio Sanitaria Pere Virgili [IISPV], 43204, Reus, Spain); Caicedo, Eduardo (University of Valle); Valls, Aida (Rovira i Virgili University); Puig, Domenec (Rovira i Virgili University)",1,1,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1164089825,46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4605 Data Management and Data Science; 4611 Machine Learning,

The research question is: should the academic curricula related to audiovisual and media competence of Andean universities change or be updated to meet a new profile of young people who know the audiovisual language? The methodology is qualitative and descriptive through content analysis of the academic curricula of the leading universities in the international rankings that classify Latin American universities, as well as semi-structured interviews with experts in higher education in communication in the region. In the case of communication studies and related areas, it happens that young people, before entering university, learn autonomously many of the techniques, processes and audiovisual languages that feed the contents of the current offer, but it is an instruction acquired without the corresponding social contexts, deontological senses and responsibilities. The denominations of the titles of the careers are classic, the formation of media competence is not alluded to or implicitly assumed, the same happens with the names of the courses taught, they respond to common or generic programs of professional formation with emphasis on journalistic production and audiovisual contents.","This paper presents some results of the project “Humanistic horizon in audiovisual communication skills and new narratives of Ecuadorian adolescents” that the Research Group “Communication and Audiovisual Culture” is carrying out to determine thecapabilities and demands of Ecuadorian adolescents, between 12 and 18 years of age, in relation to their personal and professional life projects.",,"Smart Innovation, Systems and Technologies",Perspectives and Trends in Education and Technology,"Anabela Mesquita, António Abreu, João Vidal Carvalho, Cristina Helena Pinto de Mello",,2023-01-03,2023,2023-01-03,2023,320,,555-565,Closed,Chapter,"Suing, Abel; Arrobo-Agila, Juan Pablo; González-Rentería, Verónica","Suing, Abel (Departamento de Ciencias de la Comunicación, Grupo de Investigación Comunicación y Cultura Audiovisual, Universidad Técnica Particular de Loja, 11-01-608, Loja, Ecuador); Arrobo-Agila, Juan Pablo (Departamento de Ciencias de la Comunicación, Grupo de Investigación Comunicación y Cultura Audiovisual, Universidad Técnica Particular de Loja, 11-01-608, Loja, Ecuador); González-Rentería, Verónica (Departamento de Ciencias de la Comunicación, Grupo de Investigación Comunicación y Cultura Audiovisual, Universidad Técnica Particular de Loja, 11-01-608, Loja, Ecuador)","Suing, Abel (Universidad Técnica Particular de Loja)","Suing, Abel (Universidad Técnica Particular de Loja); Arrobo-Agila, Juan Pablo (Universidad Técnica Particular de Loja); González-Rentería, Verónica (Universidad Técnica Particular de Loja)",1,1,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1154173836,"36 Creative Arts and Writing; 3605 Screen and Digital Media; 47 Language, Communication and Culture; 4701 Communication and Media Studies",

A sancocho is a traditional Colombian soup, that’s made from meat broth with ingredients that include corn, cassava, some form of meat, and spices. Rice and avocado are also part of the serving. By approaching design from a sancocho-style perspective, we aim to uncover entanglements that can provide avenues for making epistemological and ontological borders permeable to our kin and integrate ourselves in coexistence with the natural, abstract, spiritual, artificial worlds, and other forms of thinking, feeling, being, and doing, from a relational perspective. We propose a dual process for designing beyond human concerns. The first process is a three-prong coexistence process of emancipation from representations that operate as accepted intelligibility mechanisms. The second process refers to designing as a transformational participation process that moves the focus away from the human and centres on coexistence. We’re not after a new methodology or a new agenda, we believe that the sancocho-style approach can be integrated into other methodologies, forms of thinking, feeling, being, and doing, while aiming for a mycorrhizal coexistence.",,,,Design For More-Than-Human Futures,,,2023-07-27,2023,2023-07-27,2023-07-27,,,130-140,Closed,Chapter,"Parra-Agudelo, Leonardo; Quijano, Edgard David Rincón","Parra-Agudelo, Leonardo (); Quijano, Edgard David Rincón ()",,"Parra-Agudelo, Leonardo (); Quijano, Edgard David Rincón ()",1,1,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1162823790,33 Built Environment and Design; 3303 Design; 44 Human Society,

Spatiality and temporality and the carnival's touristification,"Considering the spatial turn in the humanities and ethnomusicology, I suggest that Barranquilla’s Gay Carnival has produced spaces that have been free from heteronormativity. Nonetheless, while I observe that some instances of this carnival are indeed liberatory, I posit that they produce space-times that are not entirely free but that respond to economic neo-liberal principles, mostly by the effects of touristification and globalization. In an attempt to represent Barranquilla as global, cosmopolitan, and modern, the local government has marketed the Gay Carnival as evidence of diversity and inclusion. To illustrate this, I make two arguments. First, I show how the predominance of heteronormativity and the novel neoliberal homonormativity could be noticed through the representation of soundscapes in the Carnival marketing campaigns. Second, I argue that capitalism via spectacularization and touristification made the gay carnival acceptable to Barranquilla’s society because of its aesthetic contributions to Barranquilla. In this way, the relation of gay men in Barranquilla to the carnival is one of creative contributions; they are ruled by principles of production. Instead of living a queer freedom, they are conditioned by a homonormativity that regulates the way they participate in the carnival.",,,,"Ambiance, Tourism and the City",,,2023-02-21,2023,2023-02-21,,,,194-205,Closed,Chapter,"Wanumen Jiménez, Sebastián","Wanumen Jiménez, Sebastián ()",,"Wanumen Jiménez, Sebastián ()",1,1,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1155623197,44 Human Society; 4405 Gender Studies,

This prejudice operates at three levels: (a) structural level, (b) interpersonal level, and (c) individual level. The extreme expression of prejudice is hate crime against transgender people, events widely reported in the literature. Additionally, the exposure to prejudice against transgender people has been proved to be associated with an important decline of their physical and mental health, greater than the one reported by general population or sexual minorities like lesbian, gay men, and bisexual (LGB), including depression, anxiety, suicide, substance abuse, and HIV, among other conditions. According to Minority Stress Model (MSM), stress resulting from prejudice is related to worse mental health indicators. MSM also indicates that the way transgender people try to cope or face this stress moderates the link between stress and deteriorated mental health, specifically while an efficient response to stress would weaken this relationship, an inefficient response would keep or increase it. Transgender people are not merely passive receivers of prejudice; on the contrary, they use specific coping strategies (CS) to resist this prejudice and fight its consequences, as reported in the literature. CS is understood as the particular ways in which transgender persons respond to stress resulting from prejudice. Hence, given the relevant moderating role of the CS and their results for health, this chapter mainly describes some aspects that have not been sufficiently addressed by CS research on trans people, along with putting forward some ideas for future studies. Also, the need for a reexamination of the coping notion, particularly concerning trans people, is discussed.","This chapter was funded by the Agencia Nacional de Investigación y Desarrollo (ANID) of Chile, through project FONDECYT 1210139 entitled “¿Cómo afrontan las personas transgénero el prejuicio sexual?

In order to solve the conversational systems learning problems, this investigation proposes a new architectural model for the conversational system “BRasa,” consisting of two subsystems. The first, “BRasa_Assistant,” is oriented to direct communication with users, and the second “BRasa_LDS” is oriented to conversational system learning inspired by Linguistic Data Summarization techniques. BRasa_LDS generates summaries in natural language, which incorporate new knowledge into the conversational system database. In addition, is proposed a system of indicators for the self-assessment of the human–computer interaction of the conversational system. In the analysis results section, three sets of tests were designed to measure the quality of conversational system responses. The proposal is validated based on the criteria applicability and adequacy of the conversational system responses. It is shown that the application of linguistic data summarization techniques for learning conversational systems improves the behavior of these systems significantly.",,,Studies in Big Data,"Data Analytics and Computational Intelligence: Novel Models, Algorithms and Applications","Gilberto Rivera, Laura Cruz-Reyes, Bernabé Dorronsoro, Alejandro Rosete",,2023-09-13,2023,2023-09-13,2023,132,,241-267,Closed,Chapter,"Vasconcelo Mir, Yuniesky Orlando; Pérez Pupo, Iliana; Piñero Pérez, Pedro Y.; Alvarado Acuña, Luis; Graffo Pozo, Aimee","Vasconcelo Mir, Yuniesky Orlando (Grupo de Inteligencia Artificial para el Desarrollo Sostenible, BusinessRedmine, IADES SRL, Company, 10400, Havana, Cuba); Pérez Pupo, Iliana (Grupo de Inteligencia Artificial para el Desarrollo Sostenible, BusinessRedmine, IADES SRL, Company, 10400, Havana, Cuba); Piñero Pérez, Pedro Y.

Extremophilic and extremotolerant prokaryotes are the most abundant in most environments with harsh conditions for diverse life forms. Eukaryotic organisms are less abundant in these extreme environments; however, some microscopic eukaryotes have successfully thrived in various inhospitable environments. Although the role and participation of such eukaryotes in ecosystem ecology has yet to be studied, a few eukaryotic species have been described and their potential application in different industries has been prioritized. In addition to this potential, the application of native yeasts in bioremediation processes is a little studied topic, despite the potential that these extremophilic and extremotolerant yeasts have demonstrated. A great diversity of yeasts with characteristics to thrive in adverse conditions has been studied and classified (psychrotrophic, psychrophilic, piezophilic, halophilic, xerophilic, among others). This variety must be identified through molecular and physiological mechanisms that allow them to overcome difficult environments for the growth of all life. Based on this knowledge, potential applications in the bioremediation of contaminated environments through the removal, biodegradation, and transformation of harmful pollutants can be proposed. Therefore, this chapter focuses on the main extremophilic and extremotolerant yeasts that colonize extreme terrestrial ecosystems and their potential application in bioremediation processes.",,,,Advances in Yeast Biotechnology for Biofuels and Sustainability,,,2023,2023,,2023,,,521-542,Closed,Chapter,"Hualpa-Cutipa, Edwin; Acosta, Richard Andi Solórzano; Luis-Alaya, Bernabe; León, Jannelle Mendoza","Hualpa-Cutipa, Edwin (Universidad César Vallejo, Lima-Este, Peru; Faculty of Pharmacy and Biochemistry, Biotechnology and Omics in Life Sciences Research Group, Universidad Nacional Mayor de San Marcos, Lima, Peru); Acosta, Richard Andi Solórzano (Carrera de Ingeniería Ambiental, Universidad Científica del Sur, Lima, Peru); Luis-Alaya, Bernabe (Faculty of Biological Sciences, Department of Microbiology and Parasitology, Universidad Nacional Mayor de San Marcos, Lima-Este, Peru; Faculty of Engineering, Universidad Privada del Norte, Lima-Este, Peru); León, Jannelle Mendoza (Instituto Nacional de Salud, Lima-Este, Peru)",,"Hualpa-Cutipa, Edwin (Universidad César Vallejo; National University of San Marcos); Acosta, Richard Andi Solórzano (Scientific University of the South); Luis-Alaya, Bernabe (National University of San Marcos; Private University of the North); León, Jannelle Mendoza (Instituto Nacional de Salud)",1,1,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1158458533,31 Biological Sciences; 3103 Ecology; 3107 Microbiology; 41 Environmental Sciences,

This descriptive cross-sectional study was carried out between April and July 2020 at the Elena Fernández Castro Polyclinic in Los Palacios, Pinar del Río, Cuba, to determine the risk factors that influenced professional burnout in MGI specialists working in the offices in the center of the city. A total of 28 specialists completed the Burnout Assessment Inventory (MBI), the 10 Wishes technique, and an in-depth interview. The results showed that 76% of them were affected by professional burnout. Significant associations also appeared with factors such as work overload, lack of perceived control, and community breakdown at work.

We focus on media coverage expressing frustration regarding migration, infrastructure, government, and geopolitics. Our approach combines quantitative analysis of code frequencies from qualitative content analysis of 1,360 regional newspaper articles on migration-related issues. Our findings indicate that an increase in the Venezuelan population in Colombia leads to more negative media coverage of infrastructure impacts, such as hospitals and schools. This negative coverage, referred to as “frustration,” indirectly contributes to increased coverage of infrastructure frustration. This suggests an opportunity for intervention by balancing media coverage to reduce the excessive use of negative language and stereotypes, potentially mitigating anti-migrant sentiment fueled by frustration towards infrastructure. Furthermore, we observe that as migration increases, coverage of frustration towards geopolitics decreases, while frustration towards the Colombian government rises. This shift may reflect a transition from contemplating the causes of migration to focusing on the humanitarian response (or lack thereof) by the host government in accommodating the new arrivals.","This research is funded by grant number N000141912624 by the Office of Naval Research through the Minerva Research Initiative.

It is essential to emphasize the need for security in processes within industries to avoid loss of human lives, environmental pollution, and economic losses. Existing emergency management systems do not consider how conglomerates of companies improve emergency handling. Thus, following a qualitative approach, this paper extensively reviews the existing academic and commercial solutions as input for a features-based design of a new system. The system covers all the management needs of technological accidents found in the review. The system infrastructure uses cloud services and peripheral devices to obtain real-time information on meteorological variables. As a result, it provides a comprehensive review of the current tools and proposals and a novel solution for an adapted emergency management system.",,,Communications in Computer and Information Science,"Smart Technologies, Systems and Applications","Fabián R.

The nature of inter-municipal transport makes it very difficult for companies and vehicle owners to have real control of the income of each bus because, unlike urban transport, the value of the ticket depends on the place of getting on and off each bus. One of the main motivations of this research is to help solve the problems associated with the management of drivers who usually hire assistants who manually and visually control each passenger’s entry and exit points and, according to this criterion, calculate the amount to be paid.

Gamification, a popular methodology that incorporates game elements into the classroom to motivate students and improve learning, is the focus of this research. The paper describes the development of a web application based on gamification to assist in teaching Software Engineering. It follows an agile software development methodology and uses UML diagrams to describe the operation and user interaction. A prototype of the SE-Coins App was developed to support the gamification strategy, allowing the teacher to keep track of student progress and reward them accordingly. The functional and quality requirements of the software were implemented with a focus on user requirements to facilitate the implementation of gamification in the classroom. The software is intended for use by both teachers and students, supporting a gamification strategy based on roles, points, recognition, and prizes. The prototype complements the requirements and serves as a starting point for this strategy.",,,Lecture Notes in Computer Science,Computer Information Systems and Industrial Management,"Khalid Saeed, Jiří Dvorský, Nobuyuki Nishiuchi, Makoto Fukumoto",,2023-09-15,2023,2023-09-15,2023,14164,,151-165,Closed,Chapter,"Gamarra, Margarita; Charris, Jan; Cantillo, Asly; Daza, Jaime; Llamas, Brandon; Vásquez-Carbonell, Mauricio; Dominguez, Anderson; Escorcia-Gutierrez, José","Gamarra, Margarita (Department of System Engineering, Universidad del Norte, 081007, Barranquilla, Colombia); Charris, Jan (Department of Computational Science and Electronic, Universidad de la Costa, CUC, 080002, Barranquilla, Colombia); Cantillo, Asly (Department of Computational Science and Electronic, Universidad de la Costa, CUC, 080002, Barranquilla, Colombia); Daza, Jaime (Department of Computational Science and Electronic, Universidad de la Costa, CUC, 080002, Barranquilla, Colombia); Llamas, Brandon (Department of Computational Science and Electronic, Universidad de la Costa, CUC, 080002, Barranquilla, Colombia); Vásquez-Carbonell, Mauricio (System Engineering Program, Universidad Simón Bolívar, 081002, Barranquilla, Colombia); Dominguez, Anderson (Corporación Universitaria Minuto de Dios, UNIMINUTO, 081002, Barranquilla, Colombia); Escorcia-Gutierrez, José (Department of Computational Science and Electronic, Universidad de la Costa, CUC, 080002, Barranquilla, Colombia)","Escorcia-Gutierrez, José (University of the Coast)","Gamarra, Margarita (Universidad del Norte); Charris, Jan (University of the Coast); Cantillo, Asly (University of the Coast); Daza, Jaime (University of the Coast); Llamas, Brandon (University of the Coast); Vásquez-Carbonell, Mauricio (Universidad Simón Bolívar); Dominguez, Anderson (Corporación Universitaria Minuto de Dios); Escorcia-Gutierrez, José (University of the Coast)",0,0,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1164087566,46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4612 Software Engineering,4 Quality Education

It is hence necessary to implement tools to aid decisions at strategic, tactical and operational levels. The current paper reviews existent literature with an emphasized on crop production systems and agricultural chain management, including planning, production, inventory management, and conditions of transport and distribution. The focus was planning, production techniques, operations and resources management. In contrast to narrative reviews, this paper follows a systematic protocol to avoid bias and allows replicability. Findings show that a high percentage of works emphases on hypothetical Operational Research (OR) models and optimization techniques that simplify the real problem with strong assumptions on isolated applied cases. These do not consider the integration of production, quality, food security, sustainability and risk conditions of a supply chain and many works only have been oriented to one echelon of the chain. Finally, the studies on agricultural production systems are based on some mathematical programming approaches, heuristics and artificial intelligence, but several are not applied or implemented in agricultural production. This paper also identifies key challenges and proposes opportunities for future research.",,,Lecture Notes in Operations Research,Operations Research and Analytics in Latin America,"Jairo R.

The Caribbean region is particularly susceptible to wildfires due to factors such as human activities, climate change, and natural causes. In this article, we propose a comprehensive methodology that combines data from multi-source satellite data and applies a range of predictive models. The results demonstrate the potential of deep learning techniques for identifying high-risk areas and developing effective fire management strategies. They also highlight the importance of continued research and investment in this area to improve the accuracy of predictive models and ultimately ensure the safety of communities and the environment. The findings have important implications for policymakers and stakeholders in the Caribbean region, who can use this information to develop more effective fire management strategies to minimize the impact of wildfires on the environment and local communities. By identifying high-risk areas, preventative measures such as controlled burns and improved fire management strategies can be implemented.","The authors would like to thank the Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation for the support under the projects PID2020-117954RB and TED2021-131311B, and the European Regional Development Fund and Junta de Andalucía for projects PY20-00870 and UPO-138516.

Modeling and forecasting techniques serve as valuable tools in this domain, with Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), especially Deep Neural Networks (DNN), emerging as promising options, as indicated by the scientific literature. Furthermore, combining ANN with other methodologies has been a subject of frequent discussion. This study builds on previous research that used historical data to predict expenditure on medicines in Portuguese NHS Hospitals. The focus of this study is to evaluate advantages of Deep Learning methodologies. In addition to traditional approaches as Exponential Smoothing (ES), hybrid models are explored, specifically the combination of DNN with the Box and Jenkins methodology (BJ-DNN). A comparative analysis is conducted to assess the predictive quality and computational cost associated with the forecast models. The findings reveal that ES models provide overall suitability and low computational cost. However, considering the Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE), the BJ-DNN model demonstrates robust forecasting accuracy. In conclusion, this study highlights the potential of Deep Learning methodologies for improving expenditure forecasting in healthcare, while maintaining the favorable attributes of traditional Exponential Smoothing models. These findings contribute to the broader understanding of forecasting techniques in the healthcare sector.",,,Springer Proceedings in Mathematics & Statistics,Operational Research,"João Paulo Almeida, Filipe Pereira e Alvelos, Jorge Orestes Cerdeira, Samuel Moniz, Cristina Requejo",,2023,2023,2024-01-07,2023,437,,179-192,Closed,Chapter,"Sequeiros, José; Ramos, Filipe R.; Pereira, Maria Teresa; Oliveira, Marisa; Rubio, Lihki","Sequeiros, José (School of Engineering of Porto (ISEP), Polytechnic of Porto, Portugal); Ramos, Filipe R.

In this article, we present a practical methodology we implemented to estimate the current life expectancy of the hull structure of an aging combatant ship. Such estimation was proposed to be derived from the accumulated fatigue damage in the ship structure due to wave-induced loads throughout its service life and strength-based criteria. Our assessment featured a rationally based identification and evaluation of critical ship structures against fatigue by performing Spectral Fatigue Analyses on three-dimensional global and local finite element models of the ship hull structure. Additionally, Extreme Load Analyses were carried out on the ship structure to account for its time-decreasing buckling and strength capabilities due to material degradation. As a result of such analyses, several structural components with presumed severe fatigue damage and reduced buckling and strength capabilities were identified.",,,,Advances in the Analysis and Design of Marine Structures,,,2023-04-14,2023,2023-04-14,,,,453-460,Closed,Chapter,"Hernández, K.P.; Verma, B.; Carvajal, D.A.; Barrios, H.A.","Hernández, K.P.

This drama production is one example of an increasingly widespread pattern in which countries and TV industries with little previous tradition of external partnership on high-end drama productions become involved in co-producing this type of content with a foreign-owned network, increasingly a SVoD service. The chapter’s analysis foregrounds the implications of this form of production for the construction and representation of cultural specificity, the vehicle for which, in El Robo del Siglo, is high-end drama in limited serial form. The focus of this chapter’s investigation is El Robo’s representations of Costeños and Cachacos, two territorial groups whose differences have remained an important source of conflict in Colombia, constructing a false dichotomy between them, which has political, social, and cultural dimensions and ramifications. Because of this background, it is important for the chapter to analyse the extent to which this false dichotomy continues to be perpetuated by El Robo del Siglo.

Rapid visual screening of homes was carried out using the forms presented in the Ecuadorian Construction Standard (NEC), FEMA P-154 and the procedure developed by the Venezuelan Foundation for Seismological Research FUNVISIS in which indexes of vulnerability, risk and seismic prioritization are assigned. In addition, to explicitly determine the structural exposure, the methodology developed by the Global Earthquake Model Foundation (GEM foundation), within the framework of the South America Risk Assessment (SARA) project, was used. In total, 998 buildings were surveyed and compared with a cadastral data base that includes information on structures for residential use.

(turmeric) belongs to the same family as ginger (Zingiberaceae) and is native to Southeast Asia (India and China); it is a fragrant perennial flowering erect herb, with rhizomes/tubers. The rhizomes are used as a spice (condiment)/food, dye-stuff, and for textile/beverage/cosmetic industries, in particular, curcumin its main constituent. The plant has been applied in the traditional medicine systems of Asia as treatments for respiratory/digestive/neurodegenerative disorders, as well as antiseptic/disinfectant, antidiabetic, antiinflammatory/antioxidant, antiplatelet/anticoagulant, antitumor/anticancer, antiviral, blood purifier, cardioprotective, hepatoprotective, wound-healing, etc. The main active principles of turmeric are curcuminoids and sesquiterpenoids (from essential oils), which would be responsible for the wide spectrum of bioproperties that the plant presents. Considering neurogenerative diseases, the most common are Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, Huntington’s, and Lou Gehrig’s (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis) diseases, on some of which turmeric and/or curcumin have proven the protective capabilities in certain in vitro/in vivo studies related to anti-inflammatory/antioxidant effects, oxidative stress reduction, etc. However, the most important limiting factor for the clinical application of curcumin is its poor pharmaco-kinetic/-dynamic properties. Therefore, the following question arises, could the curcuminoids and sesquiterpenoids of Curcuma longa rhizomes be the cure for neurodegenerative disorders? The answer is that these substances do not cure neurodegenerative disorders (there is no cure for them yet), but they would improve the quality of life of people who suffer from any of these diseases.","The authors thank: Universidad Santo Tomás de Aquino (sede Bucaramanga) by using of the Bibliometric Unit; MinCiencias-SGR [Formación de Capital Humano (O.J.C.C., Convocatoria No. 1 Becas de Excelencia Bicentenario, 2019—Departamento de Sucre; C.P.G.G., Convocatoria No. 810, 2018—Departamento de La Guajira)].",,,Curcumin and Neurodegenerative Diseases,"Mahendra Rai, Chistiane M.

Educational video games can be a powerful medium that can benefit children, not only in entertainment but also in learning new eating habits. The objective of this study is to measure the food preferences of schoolchildren. For this purpose, a video game prototype was developed and evaluated in two groups: the experimental group that will use the prototype developed in this research and the control group that will receive the same contents of the video game through audiovisual tools and recreational activities. For the development of the prototype, we started with the analysis of the characteristics of the works related to the proposed topic, then the GAMED methodology was used for the development of the video game; the phases used were: problem formulation, idea generation, game design, requirements development, architecture, and finally, the software design. The effectiveness of the prototype was evaluated with two questionnaires. The first showed that the control group preferred unhealthy food by 48% and the experimental group by 62%. The second questionnaire showed that 36% of the participants in the control group continued to select unhealthy food, compared to 26% of the experimental group, recommending the creation of incentives and mechanisms to promote the use of the proposed tool as an option to improve learning and nutritional education.",,,EAI/Springer Innovations in Communication and Computing,"Sustainable, Innovative and Intelligent Societies and Cities",Carlos Filipe da Silva Portela,,2023-06-10,2023,2023-06-10,2023,,,185-202,Closed,Chapter,"Cabascango, Sara; Andrango, Ismael; Guerrero, Graciela","Cabascango, Sara (Universidad de las Fuerzas Armadas ESPE, Sangolquí, Ecuador); Andrango, Ismael (Universidad de las Fuerzas Armadas ESPE, Sangolquí, Ecuador); Guerrero, Graciela (Universidad de las Fuerzas Armadas ESPE, Sangolquí, Ecuador)","Guerrero, Graciela (Escuela Politécnica del Ejército)","Cabascango, Sara (Escuela Politécnica del Ejército); Andrango, Ismael (Escuela Politécnica del Ejército); Guerrero, Graciela (Escuela Politécnica del Ejército)",0,0,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1159411352,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3210 Nutrition and Dietetics; 46 Information and Computing Sciences,2 Zero Hunger

Worldmaking Winds and Seasonal Disruptions in the Northern Chilean Andes,"In this chapter, we report how bilingual Aymara-Spanish speaking people talk about weather phenomena and the increasing unreliability of expected seasonal weather events in Isluga, a community in the highlands of northern Chile. We use strong winds as a case study in weather-worlding. During the cold and dry windy season, exceptionally strong westerlies prevent rain-bearing clouds from entering Isluga territory. Softer easterlies bring in moisture-bearing clouds from Bolivia, ushering in the warmer rainy season, during which precipitation can fall as rain or snow. Sometimes the boisterous westerlies intrude into the moist season, preventing rain from falling. Isluga residents personify the winds as cannibal brothers and they describe wind directions in relation to the social organization of Isluga territory. These factors formed the basis for a rain-calling ceremony introduced as a ritual practice in Isluga from the 1920s onwards, in response to episodes of drought during the rainy season. This ceremony is now no longer observed because many Isluga residents have converted to an evangelical form of protestantism, which forbids such practices. People nonetheless still use a cycle of saints’ days to keep track of constancies and inconstancies in seasonally occurring weather events. The chapter ends with a consideration of how people in the Americas used a calendrical awareness to check seasonal variations and to track changes. Our investigation of people’s spatial construal of temporal weather experiences explores how they use past events to compare with present occurrences or future possibilities. This chapter shows how bilingual Aymara-Spanish speaking people talk about weather phenomena and the increasing unreliability of expected seasonal weather events in Isluga, a community in the highlands of northern Chile. Isluga residents personify the winds as cannibal brothers and they describe wind directions in relation to the social organization of Isluga territory. Local people’s understanding of weather conditions coincide in important respects with meteorologically collected data. Rain-bearing clouds arrive in Isluga during Jallu pacha by convection from the Atlantic Ocean and Amazon River basin. The reorganization of Isluga and the institution of the rain-calling ceremony, as remembered by people late in the twentieth century, dates from a period of demographic increase. Meteorologically trained specialists and lay observers of weather cycles alike make use of comparisons between past events and future possibilities.

1022,pub.1160056410,10.4324/9781003334552-6,,,Divorce in Early Modern Bilbao,"Although the word “divorce” can be found in documents dating back to the 17th and 18th centuries, the first Spanish divorce law did not come into force until 1932. Divorce had a different meaning in early modern Spain, resembling what we now call separation. Thus, while the separation of property and the release from marital cohabitation was possible, remarriage before the death of the divorced spouse was not. Archival documents show that it was mainly women who filed for divorce in this period. The grounds for divorce were usually related to the husbands’ behavior: adultery, physical abuse, and/or a waste of their wives’ dowries. The few husbands who filed for divorce usually did so on grounds of their wives' dishonorable behavior. The Bishop of Calahora-La Calzada decided upon the divorce, while a secular court dealt with matters pertaining to property. During the proceedings, the woman who initiated the divorce process lived with her parents or in a convent. From the surviving documents we can deduce that female petitioners usually obtained the divorces they sought, while male ones did not. The chapter focuses on divorce in early modern Catholic Bilbao and examines which people were involved in the divorce proceedings while including their first names and family names, age differences, social and economic background, and family connections. It also explores the role children, both from previous marriages and legitimate children from the marriage, had in divorce proceedings, and who gained custody of said children. Finally, the chapter explores the grounds upon which the Bishop of Calahorra-La Calzada granted a permanent divorce or simply the right for wives to temporarily live apart from their husbands and whether such decisions were tied to the couple’s social background. The sources for the investigation are the archives of Bilbao and the diocesan archives of the city of Calahorra.

The poultry industry, which has a large share of global food, is no exception. A particular challenge is more critical than others due to the product’s short perishability and the reduced times of the merchandise in the warehouse. Thus, the importance of having an optimal distribution process increase. This study will conduct a qualitative analysis to determine the leading causes that prevent us from achieving optimal distribution performance. Based on the critical success factors, improvement actions can be proposed. Finally, the improvement actions will be evaluated through an AHP process, and the evaluation criteria will be based on the most relevant performance indicators in the industry. Thus, the best viable option can be determined quantitatively according to the weighting in the most important criteria. The investigation will determine that implementing an integrated data warehouse will be the most optimal solution for a distribution process in the poultry industry.",,,Lecture Notes in Logistics,Supply Chain Management Strategies and Methodologies,"Jorge Luis García Alcaraz, Diego Fernando Manotas Duque, Rosa Guadalupe González-Ramírez, Mario Gustavo Chong Chong, Irineu de Brito Junior",,2023-06-03,2023,2023-06-03,2023,,,257-281,Closed,Chapter,"Córdova-Lavado, Hafid Joseph; Ramos-Rodríguez, Breinner Alexander; Calderón-Romero, Daniel José; Aliaga-Maguiña, Rodrigo Leonardo","Córdova-Lavado, Hafid Joseph (Department of Engineering, Universidad del Pacífico, Lima, Peru); Ramos-Rodríguez, Breinner Alexander (Department of Engineering, Universidad del Pacífico, Lima, Peru); Calderón-Romero, Daniel José (Department of Engineering, Universidad del Pacífico, Lima, Peru); Aliaga-Maguiña, Rodrigo Leonardo (Department of Engineering, Universidad del Pacífico, Lima, Peru)","Córdova-Lavado, Hafid Joseph (University of the Pacific)","Córdova-Lavado, Hafid Joseph (University of the Pacific); Ramos-Rodríguez, Breinner Alexander (University of the Pacific); Calderón-Romero, Daniel José (University of the Pacific); Aliaga-Maguiña, Rodrigo Leonardo (University of the Pacific)",0,0,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1158574893,46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4605 Data Management and Data Science; 4609 Information Systems,

Using a qualitative, descriptive and documentary methodology, we reconstruct the discourses and narratives of women and their organisations, as well as their collective actions. We begin with a historical overview of the organisational processes between the 1970s and the beginning of the twenty-first century. We then analyse some manifestations of feminist activism, then we reflect first on the conservative reaction, and after that we examine the way in which the different expressions of the movement were challenged by local and community experiences and by the activism of Afro-Colombian and transwomen. In conclusion, we highlight the multiplicity of feminist activism according to the scenarios in which it develops. We also underscore the relevance of NGO support around central political processes such as the armed conflict and the promulgation of a new Constitution.",,,Latin American Societies,Women’s Rights in Movement,"Inés M.

Thereby, some wild/domesticated plants found in agropastoral farms have been used as medicine/food for humans, as well as fodder/forage (growth promoters) and medicine for animals (ethnoveterinary); they are GRAS and would act as nutraceuticals. The importance of these plants in developing countries arises because the low-income population (or in rural areas) uses them as a cheap, affordable and sustainable alternative to maintain/care for the livestock, which could be lost (~35%) due to lack of good sanitary/hygienic (diseases) and food/nutritional practices, as well, environmental conditions (food shortage and deficiency of water resources). Some examples of this type of plants which will be discussed in this chapter are Artocarpus altilis (breadfruit - fruits/leaves/seeds), Azadirachta indica (neem - whole plant), Manihot esculenta (cassava - leaves/roots), Prosopis juliflora (mesquite - fruits/leaves); these species contain carbohydrates/proteins/fibers/fat, along with terpenoid/phenolic/flavonoid and/or glycoside compounds; these phytoconstituents could confer antinutritional factors to those plants that would help or not to maintain the animal health/nutrition.","The authors thank: Universidad Santo Tomás de Aquino (sede Bucaramanga) by using of the Bibliometric Unit; Colciencias-SGR [Formación de Capital Humano (N.M.P. and C.P.G., Convocatoria No. 810, 2018 - Departamento de La Guajira)].",,,Ethnobotany,,,2023-02-06,2023,2023-02-06,,,,1-43,Closed,Chapter,"Muñoz-Acevedo, Amner; Guzmán, Cindy P.; Peralta, Nubellys M.; González, María C.; Cervanles-Díaz, Martha","Muñoz-Acevedo, Amner (Departamento de Química y Biología, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia.; Corresponding author:, amnerm@uninorte.edu.co); Guzmán, Cindy P.

The chapter examines four crucial figures in this conversation: Vladimir Jankélévitch, Jacques Derrida, Paul Ricœur, and Jean-Luc Marion. Jankélévitch defines forgiveness as a limit-case, a gift of pure love, in his main text on the topic, yet denies the possibility of forgiveness in a more polemic piece that argues against lifting the statute of limitations for Nazi war crimes. Derrida treats forgiveness—like the notions of the gift and hospitality—as an instance of the impossible, with a structural tension between the unconditional demand of purity and gratuity versus the conditional performance in concrete contexts like the legacy of apartheid in South Africa. Ricœur speaks of forgiveness as difficult but not impossible, a release of the agent to new action. Marion also responds to Derrida by highlighting forgiveness as a phenomenon that makes visible the (initially spurned) gift. After explicating and analyzing the various treatments, the conclusion raises some questions about the close link these thinkers establish between the phenomena of the gift and forgiveness.",,,,The Routledge Handbook of the Philosophy and Psychology of Forgiveness,,,2023-03-24,2023,2023-03-24,2023-03-24,,,194-209,Closed,Chapter,"Gschwandtner, Christina M.","Gschwandtner, Christina M.

It describes how cosmic complexity is substantiated as astronomical data and how astronomical datasets circulate beyond astronomy as a source of “free” Big Data, supposedly without exploitable ends or ethical implication. Pointing to the land-intensive, labour-intensive, resource-intensive, and territorially and cosmopolitically fraught production of complex, large, and mobile astronomical datasets at the ALMA observatory, the article argues that not only are astronomical datasets not “free” but that in an optimisation economy, extraction is optimised, not displaced. In early July 2012, I attended a small conference, Research Networks and Cloud Computing for Astronomy and Mining, organised by the Universidad de Chile’s Centre for Mathematical Modelling (CMM). The conference focused on two seemingly distinct industrial and scientific domains in northern Chile’s Atacama Desert: megascale copper mining and radio astronomical observation. Visits to two sites bookended the conference, both located high in the western slopes of the south-central Andes, in El Loa province in Chile’s second northernmost region of Antofagasta. The first site was Chuquicamata, one of the largest open-pit copper mines on the planet. The second, located about two hours east of the mine, on the Llano de Chajnantor (Chajnantor Plateau), near the international border of Chile and Bolivia, was the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA), one of the most ambitious ground-based astronomical projects in the world. This chapter describes how large-scale mining and astronomical observation in Chile’s El Loa province come to interact on the terrain of optimisation and automation—of extraction, on the one hand, and observation, on the other. It describes how cosmic complexity is substantiated as astronomical data and how astronomical datasets circulate beyond astronomy as a source of “free” Big Data, supposedly without exploitable ends or ethical implication. Codelco’s Building the Mining of the Future seminar showcased the use of distributed sensor technologies, machine learning, ubiquitous computing, Big Data, geological modelling facilitated by hypercomputation, and the integration of new, “smart” mining technologies at every level of the global mining industry, from extraction, to production, to the logistics of transport and circulation. As astronomical Big Data circulate as a “free” and politically “clean” resource for reimagining one particular future of the Chilean economy, they are explicitly placed within the Atacama Desert’s history of mineral extraction.",,,,The Routledge Handbook of Social Studies of Outer Space,,,2023-06-19,2023,2023-06-19,2023-06-19,,,263-280,Closed,Chapter,"Detwiler, Katheryn M.","Detwiler, Katheryn M.

These mountain guardians have distinct names in different regions (apu, uywiri, Coquena…). These beings are thought to own and care for the animals and other elements of the natural world within their domains, and their power is widely acknowledged among Andean herders and agriculturalists. This essay explores the biocultural manifestations of these religious and cosmopolitical ideas, the role of these guardian mountain beings in ritual life, and the ideas and practices that regulate human and nonhuman relations in this complex, drawing on fieldwork among the Aymara-speaking ayllu communities of Qaqachaka in the southcentral Andes. These relations tend to be expressed in terms of reciprocity, but other asymmetrical kinds of dependency, less studied to date, include threats of punishment if established rules of behavior are not followed. This complex of ideas seems to have dominated Andean understandings of the hunt in the recent past and underlies notions about sustainability in herding and agricultural life in this mountainous region today. Similar ideas have been explored in an Amazonian context, and this essay examines an Andean counterpart.","I acknowledge the tremendous support in fieldwork by Juan de Dios Yapita, which included long conversations with Doña María Ayca Llanque and Don Domingo Jiménez, whose lives and ideas I record here.",,"Conflict, Environment, and Social Complexity",The History and Environmental Impacts of Hunting Deities,Richard J.

This study aims of predicting the water level height and bathymetry of lake Yahuarcocha, Imbabura, Ecuador with the use of the NASA Ice, Cloud, and land Elevation Satellite-2 (ICESat-2) ATL13/ATL13QL since they provide observations that are suitable for water level estimation, also combining the study with System Dynamics Modelling (SD), and machine learning technique based on the extraction of points from the laser altimetry footprint at the limits of the lake vector, according to the absolute deviation method used to eliminate the outliers of the lake elevation along the orbit, and thus obtain the average values of the water level of the lake. Yahuarcocha has been seriously affected in recent years, and the anthropic activities inherent to the wetlands have been the main cause of the effects, including land use, and other watershed activities influencing surface runoff and groundwaters. Therefore, predictions of lake level are crucial for their sustainable management. In this study, the SD model simulation with the PySD library is used to have the estimation of the level of precipitation, evapotranspiration, and volume of water the lake Yahuarcocha until 2030. The results indicate that the water level estimated from ATL13 is the same as the water level trend measured in situ, with an average estimation error of 30 cm, indicating that the ICESat-2 ATL13 laser altimetry data has high precision, thus the approach of the proposed reaches more than 95.57%.",,,Communications in Computer and Information Science,Advanced Computing,"Deepak Garg, V.

So, one of the solutions for decreasing this is using electric vehicles (EVs). Therefore, the supply of fuels for EVs is a significant issue that societies will face in the future. Generating electricity by solar radiation with a photovoltaic panel is a good solution for supplying the demands. One of the issues that should consider is electricity because people intend to use EVs with inexpensive fuels. This issue put governments that encourage people to produce electricity on their rooftops by photoelectric panels. By this strategy, governments supply the demand for electricity at less price and less cost. This study surveys the best criteria for selecting the proper rooftop PV panels by maximum efficiency. The eight criteria are proposed by researchers as efficiency, temperature coefficient, material warranty, cost per watt of the panel, solar inverter and solar inverter cost per watt-peak, automatic protector, and smart panel. The numerical example for selection of best panels is proposed by these criteria and four alternatives. So, the researchers used the multiple criteria decision-making (MCDM) method for evaluating these options. It should be noted that one of the major issues considered in this study is the time vision. The alternatives evaluating are performed in two-time vision current and future. For this, two methods are combined: distance from the average solution (EDAS) and prospective multi-attribute decision-making (PMADM). The results show that alternatives one and four are the best in the future and current vision, respectively.",,,Lecture Notes in Electrical Engineering,Computational Intelligence for Engineering and Management Applications,"Prasenjit Chatterjee, Dragan Pamucar, Morteza Yazdani, Dilbagh Panchal",,2023-04-30,2023,2023-04-30,2023,984,,875-884,Closed,Chapter,"Zolfani, Sarfaraz Hashemkhani; Bazrafshan, Ramin","Zolfani, Sarfaraz Hashemkhani (School of Engineering, Catholic University of the North, Larrondo 1281, Coquimbo, Chile); Bazrafshan, Ramin (Department of Industrial Engineering and Management Systems, Amirkabir University of Technology (Tehran Polytechnic), Tehran, Iran)","Zolfani, Sarfaraz Hashemkhani (Catholic University of the North)","Zolfani, Sarfaraz Hashemkhani (Catholic University of the North); Bazrafshan, Ramin (Amirkabir University of Technology)",0,0,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1157646125,40 Engineering; 4008 Electrical Engineering,7 Affordable and Clean Energy

These advances are largely due to the rapid evolution in the manufacture of increasingly sophisticated electronic devices. However, the consumption and disposal of electronic devices generate environmental pollution problems (e‐waste) in different matrices of the ecosystem, linked to an accelerated demographic growth. A variety of techniques have been used to reduce the outcome of e‐waste. Bioremediation is an environmental and eco‐friendly strategy based on the use of the metabolic capabilities of organisms and microorganisms. For a better application of these environmental strategies, the application of molecular strategies is proposed under a multiomic approach, which involves the global and integrated study of the molecular components resulting from the interaction of organisms and microorganisms with waste products. Therefore, the aim of this chapter is to provide details on the microbes that degrade electronic waste (e‐waste) and their study under a multiomic perspective (genomics, transcriptomics, metabolomics, and proteomics).",,,,Electronic Waste Management,"Sunil Kumar, Vineet Kumar",,2023-12-23,2023,2024-02-06,2023-12-23,,,25-32,Closed,Chapter,"Hualpa‐Cutipa, Edwin; Andi, Richard; Acosta, Solórzano; Landa‐Acuña, Daniela; León, Janelle Mendoza","Hualpa‐Cutipa, Edwin (School of Environmental Engineering, Universidad Continental, Lima‐Perú; Faculty of Pharmacy and Biochemistry, Biotechnology and Omics in Life Sciences Research Group, Universidad Nacional Mayor de San Marcos, Lima‐Perú); Andi, Richard (Dirección de Supervisión y Monitoreo en las Estaciones Experimentales Agrarias, Instituto Nacional de Innovación Agraria (INIA), Lima, Peru); Acosta, Solórzano (Dirección de Supervisión y Monitoreo en las Estaciones Experimentales Agrarias, Instituto Nacional de Innovación Agraria (INIA), Lima, Peru); Landa‐Acuña, Daniela (Professional career in Environmental Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, Private University of the North, Lima–Los Olivos Campus; Facultad de Farmacia y Bioquímica, Departamento Académico de Farmacología, Bromatología y Toxicología, Centro Latinoamericano de Enseñanza e Investigación en Bacteriología Alimentaria (CLEIBA), Research Group Biotechnology and Omics in Life Sciences, Universidad Nacional Mayor de San Marcos, Lima, Perú); León, Janelle Mendoza (Instituto Nacional de Salud–Centro Nacional de Control de Calidad, Lima, Perú; Facultad de Farmacia y Bioquímica, Universidad Nacional Mayor de San Marcos, Lima, Perú)","Hualpa‐Cutipa, Edwin (Universidad Continental; National University of San Marcos)","Hualpa‐Cutipa, Edwin (Universidad Continental; National University of San Marcos); Andi, Richard (Instituto Nacional de Innovación Agraria); Acosta, Solórzano (Instituto Nacional de Innovación Agraria); Landa‐Acuña, Daniela (Private University of the North; National University of San Marcos); León, Janelle Mendoza (Instituto Nacional de Salud; National University of San Marcos)",0,0,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1168601107,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3205 Medical Biochemistry and Metabolomics,12 Responsible Consumption and Production

Monkeypox is a re-emerging zoonotic disease caused by monkeypox virus. The first case was detected in monkeys in 1958. Nevertheless, in humans it was not until 1970 that it had its first manifestation in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. On the other hand, social media platforms had proved to be an important source of valuable information. People use this kind of tools, specifically Twitter, to express their ideas, feelings, opinions, interests, in addition to information related to their both physical and mental health. Therefore, Twitter is real-time source of public information extremely useful on public health issues. This work presents a methodology to monitoring epidemiological events.

In 1893 it was renamed the British Central African Protectorate. This became Nyasaland in 1907. By the mid-1940s a nationalist movement had emerged, spearheaded by the Nyasaland African Congress. In 1953 Nyasaland was joined with Southern Rhodesia (Zimbabwe) and Northern Rhodesia (Zambia) to form the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland, under British control. This union was dissolved in 1963. Nyasaland was self-governing until on 6 July 1964 it became independent, adopting the name Malaŵi. In 1966 Malaŵi was declared a republic and Dr Hastings Banda became the first president, establishing a one-party dictatorship which lasted for 30 years. In 1994 Malaŵi returned to multi-party democracy. One of the world’s least developed countries, Malaŵi has suffered periodic drought, flooding and famine, most recently prompting the government in April 2016 to declare a state of emergency.",,,The Statesman's Yearbook,The Statesman’s Yearbook 2024,,,2023,2023,2024-01-04,2023,,,737-740,Closed,Chapter,,,,,0,0,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1167637827,"43 History, Heritage and Archaeology; 4303 Historical Studies; 44 Human Society",

ERP allows either small or large companies to improve their internal processes, leading to innovation and making it possible, for the most part, to improve their enterprise resource planning. The present research aims to determine the influence of the implementation of an ERP system in the improvement of the logistics process of a boutique. The methodology used for the development of the ERP was Spring. To measure the proposed indicators, 20 procurement operations were used; obtaining as a result that, in the pre-test, the purchasing time indicator obtained a mean value of 163.4 and in the satisfaction indicator of those in charge of procurement, a mean value of 1.80 was obtained. After this and with the implementation of the system, we proceeded to perform the post-test, obtaining as a result for the purchasing time a mean value of 90.55, which represents a reduction of 45.6%, and for the satisfaction of those in charge of procurement a mean value of 4.55 was obtained, which represents an increase of 150%.

Currently, there is an increasing demand for energy storage materials (Li, Ni, Co, Mn, Vn, graphite, etc.) that suffer from supply risk. Consequently, innovative technologies have emerged to enable the mining industry to satisfy the forecast demand, ideally leading toward processes that are equitable and environmentally sound. Nevertheless, quantitative methods are needed to determine whether promising technologies in the lab could translate into solutions at a specific mine site, taking into account the geological uncertainty of how much of the material is in the orebody, and under what form, and how the technologies and processes would be operated differently in confronting this uncertainty. Any new process that is enabled by a technology must be characterized in terms of system-wide operational modes; this establishes how the technology is coordinated with the adjacent processes. Particularly for open-pit mines, there are well-established strategic planning algorithms that determine the economic viability of different processing options, under varying degrees of geological uncertainty, over the mine life. However, these algorithms have tuning parameters that obscure the representation of new technologies. Our work has addressed this issue. Sample calculations are being developed based on an open-pit manganese mine. Adaptation of the approach to underground mines is also discussed.",,,,"Proceedings of the 61st Conference of Metallurgists, COM 2022",,,2023-01-06,2023,2023-01-06,2023,,,637-644,Closed,Chapter,"Quelopana, Aldo; Ordenes, Javier; Navarra, Alessandro","Quelopana, Aldo (Universidad Católica de Norte, Antofagasta, Chile; McGill University, Montreal, QC, Canada); Ordenes, Javier (McGill University, Montreal, QC, Canada); Navarra, Alessandro (McGill University, Montreal, QC, Canada)","Navarra, Alessandro (McGill University)","Quelopana, Aldo (Catholic University of the North; McGill University); Ordenes, Javier (McGill University); Navarra, Alessandro (McGill University)",0,0,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1154257213,34 Chemical Sciences; 3406 Physical Chemistry; 40 Engineering,

The main difficulty in its implementation is the scarce or non-existent presence of solar charging stations for electric vehicles in all regions. This paper illustrates the design optimization and simulation of an electric vehicle charging station that integrates solar energy. An optimal design of the charging station with MPPT, PID controllers, as well as current control strategies, is shown. The design took into account the dynamic needs such as the geographical area of maximum irradiance using PV GIS, an optimal system with PVsyst, the design, and simulation of the charging station showing the dynamic values of power versus time, as well as current versus time, validated by MATLAB/Simulink.

The current paper documents and investigates the change management while implementing an ERP in a plant for industrializing food in Brazil. This approach was phenomenological and focused on the users’ perspective, applying a questionnaire after the training and implementation of an ERP. The findings suggest users declared that they were ready to put energy into this change. However, at the same time, they also stated that they see no need to change. This raises doubts about how this change was implemented. The energy and desire might be there for the change, but it needs to be directed to the necessary targets through adequate guidance.

This property is represented by two parameters: internal friction angle and cohesion, obtained from shear testing in the field and laboratory. The direct shear test is the most popular and intensively used for determining shear strength parameters. The aim of this paper is to present a rational procedure to interpret the results of the laboratory direct shear test for defining the strength parameters of soils. Two series of direct shear tests under consolidated and drained conditions (ASTM D3080) were carried out with samples of a wet well-graded sand (SW) compacted to a dense state, from Cutimbo’s bank of aggregates, and saturated soft clay (CL and CH), from lacustrine deposits of Puno city. The procedure was applied to the results, for two soils, and the strength parameters were determined considering typical response curves and validity ranges of normal stresses for application purposes. Calculated strength parameters values were consistent with reported values in several publications and reduces the uncertainty of the reported values from direct shear tests.",,,"Smart Innovation, Systems and Technologies",Proceedings of the 8th Brazilian Technology Symposium (BTSym’22),"Yuzo Iano, Osamu Saotome, Guillermo Leopoldo Kemper Vásquez, Maria Thereza de Moraes Gomes Rosa, Rangel Arthur, Gabriel Gomes de Oliveira",,2023-05-01,2023,2023-05-01,2023,353,,340-350,Closed,Chapter,"Huanca, Samuel Laura; Huanca, Julio Cesar Laura; Vilca, Russel Allidren Lozada","Huanca, Samuel Laura (Universidad Privada del Norte, Cajamarca, Peru); Huanca, Julio Cesar Laura (Universidad Nacional de Juliaca, Juliaca, Peru); Vilca, Russel Allidren Lozada (Universidad Nacional de Juliaca, Juliaca, Peru)","Huanca, Samuel Laura (Private University of the North)","Huanca, Samuel Laura (Private University of the North); Huanca, Julio Cesar Laura (Universidad Nacional de Juliaca); Vilca, Russel Allidren Lozada (Universidad Nacional de Juliaca)",0,0,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1157656783,40 Engineering; 4005 Civil Engineering; 4019 Resources Engineering and Extractive Metallurgy,
316,pub.1160274558,10.1007/978-981-99-1459-3_40,,,Application of Regression Techniques for Preparing a Homogeneous Earthquake Catalog—An Overview,"Standard least squares regression (SLR) and general orthogonal regression (GOR) address different questions and make different assumptions about measurement errors in one or both of the variables. SLR minimizes the sum of squares of the vertical deviations and provides estimation of the dependent variable (Y). It assumes that the independent variable (X) is an observed value which is known without error, and only the dependent variable (Y) suffers from measurement error. GOR, on the other hand, yields a linear relationship (Yt=β0+β1Xt$$Y_\text{t} = \beta_{0} + \beta_{1} X_\text{t}$$) between the dependent (Yt) and the independent (Xt) variables based on observed data (X, Y) having measurement errors in both the variables involved. Therefore, it is mathematically incorrect to use observed value X in place of Xt$$X_\text{t}$$ in the equation Yt=β0+β1Xt,$$Y_\text{t} = \beta_{0} + \beta_{1} X_{t,}$$ and thus, if done so (as in the conventional GOR method), this procedure will produce biased estimates. The present study is an overview of different methodologies used for preparing a homogeneous earthquake catalog for different seismic environments. The error variance ratio (η) used in GOR has not been addressed in seismological literature, and this overview will address this critical issue as well. This study will also suggest a guideline for the use of regression methods for preparing a homogeneous earthquake database which is an important input to obtain improved seismic hazard assessment.",The article has benefitted from FONDECYT Grant 11200618.,,Lecture Notes in Civil Engineering,Proceedings of 17th Symposium on Earthquake Engineering (Vol. 4),"Manish Shrikhande, Pankaj Agarwal, P.

In this context, this chapter implements a monitoring system for the environment of a poultry house based on IoT, with the capacity to process, analyze, and store information obtained through sensors and other devices. The V-based methodology was used. The system is composed of three layers: a monitoring web system layer, a data layer, and the third layer, a layer for detecting information from the house. This layer oversees the data loading process through the set of wireless sensors installed in the shed. In addition, the database is hosted in the cloud, thus eliminating the installation of local servers. The web system layer is composed of the system administration module and the monitoring module, accessed through roles. To test the system, it was put to the test for twelve days, the results obtained indicated that the time to determine the temperature, humidity, and air quality decreased to 28 s after the implementation of the system, making this proposal serve as a support tool for the automatic monitoring of the variables of the galpón environment.",,,Lecture Notes in Networks and Systems,Proceedings of Eighth International Congress on Information and Communication Technology,"Xin-She Yang, R.

An extensive exploration of different sources has been carried out. This information has been studied and correlated to answer the objective. The methodology of this research follows a correlational type, quantitative approach, and non-experimental design. To obtain the data, instruments such as the questionnaire were used, presented to Cronbach's Alpha Statistic. To measure the reliability value for Administrative Management, a value of 0.901 was obtained and for labor disputes a value of 0.771. Among the results obtained, it was found that administrative management and labor disputes have a significance level of 0.135. This indicates that it is greater than 0.05, which means that there is no direct correlation between these two variables. This is a low-degree relationship with a coefficient of 0.241.

In recent years, community resilience perspectives in architecture and urbanism have highlighted the idea of transformative adaptation where communities are able to restore their built environment, and to transform it based on their needs and desires. However, little has been explored and compared about whether and how informal housing influence local community resilience strategies and adaptations to disturbances and challenges. To compare how informal and precarious housing in different topographic contexts influenced community resilience, this research examines three case studies from the Americas (Peru, Uruguay, and Southern US). Methods included semi-structured interviews, architectural documentation, and analyses of secondary data. This study reveals informal housing characteristics and its underlying processes in different geographical and cultural contexts were critical for communities to address local challenges. Findings aim to provide lessons to architects, planners, and policy makers, about how community-based initiatives can enable communities to adapt to stresses while contemplating the complexities that informal housing often entail.",We would like to thank everyone who participated in this project and the International Institute at Mississippi State University which generously supported this project with the Global Development Seed Grant (2022).,,Sustainable Development Goals Series,Design for Resilient Communities,"Anna Rubbo, Juan Du, Mette Ramsgaard Thomsen, Martin Tamke",,2023-09-20,2023,2023-09-20,2023,,,639-647,Closed,Chapter,"Lopez Barrera, Silvina; Thompson, Diego; Dreifuss Serrano, Cristina; Schreier Barreto, Christopher","Lopez Barrera, Silvina (School of Architecture, Mississippi State University, Starkville, USA); Thompson, Diego (Department of Sociology, Mississippi State University, Starkville, USA); Dreifuss Serrano, Cristina (Universidad Privada del Norte, Lima, Peru); Schreier Barreto, Christopher (Universidad Ricardo Palma, Lima, Peru)","Lopez Barrera, Silvina (Mississippi State University)","Lopez Barrera, Silvina (Mississippi State University); Thompson, Diego (Mississippi State University); Dreifuss Serrano, Cristina (Private University of the North); Schreier Barreto, Christopher (Universidad Ricardo Palma)",0,0,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1164210251,33 Built Environment and Design; 44 Human Society; 4406 Human Geography,11 Sustainable Cities and Communities; 13 Climate Action

An exploratory study into how the perception of food colour affects the mood of Latino-American and Spanish people is presented to this end. A survey is carried out that shows photographs of dishes and inquiries as to the moods triggered in the participant. The analysis of the results of this survey confirms that colour modifies the perception of food. As a consequence, choosing food colours that induce positive moods in people can be helpful in attracting gastronomic tourists to a specific destination.","This work has been partially funded by the Spanish Ministry of Science, Innovation and Universities through the project Prueba de Concepto para la Plataforma de Análisis Social Dinámico en el Contexto del Turismo Sostenible (PDC2021-121097-I00) and by the Ministry of Economy and Commerce with project contract TIN2016-88835-RET.

Several environmental impacts of this industry on marine ecosystems have been identified. However, descriptions of the underwater soundscape near the sea-based salmon installations are scarce. A continuous recording of ~45 h was conducted using a calibrated hydrophone (0.02–60 kHz) anchored at 20 m depth (2 m from bottom) and 250 m from a salmon net pen. Thirteen noises were identified (particle motion metrics were not included). The dominant noise had a peak frequency of ~80 Hz, probably due to electric generators (SPLRMS ~ 120 dBre1μPa). The second dominant was ~2500 Hz, probably from automatic feeding systems or well boats in use (SPLRMS ~ 142 dBre1μPa). Outboard motor noises were also present (SPLRMS ~ 130 dBre1μPa). During only 1 h, anthropogenic noises were absent (SPLRMS ~ 100 dBre1μPa), where snapping shrimps and fish sounds were found. Therefore, the soundscape was strongly dominated by anthrophony from the salmon net pen with 97% of the total time and ~ 40 dBre1μPa higher than natural sounds. Moreover, the highest noise might be roughly 175 dBre1μPa at 1 m from the net pen (regarding the simple geometric spreading loss model). Consequently, it is raising the necessity to evaluate the effects of these noises on the marine fauna.","This manuscript was a poster presentation in the conference “The effect of noise on aquatic life” conducted in Berlin, Germany, from 10 to 15 July.

For this reason, in the present work, an exhaustive systematic literature review study of manuscripts related to the prediction of student dropout was carried out. The articles were obtained from six databases, which were searched using the PRISMA methodology. A total of 88 manuscripts were selected from which 4 questions were posed. Finally, we obtained as an answer to the questions that the most used model is the random forest, with an accuracy of between 73 and 99% for predicting student dropout. For this, aspects such as academic, demographic, economic, and health aspects must be considered. Meanwhile, the technological tool for the models was the Python language according to this systematic review.",,,Lecture Notes in Networks and Systems,Proceedings of Eighth International Congress on Information and Communication Technology,"Xin-She Yang, R.

This is because the soundtrack as a subject has not always been an object of analysis that is investigated as rigorously as it is now. Therefore, this paper seeks to determine the trend of studies on movie soundtracks over the last five years in the Scopus database. This is a systematic review using the PRISMA method. Fifteen articles published between 2017 and 2022 were selected, and, once all the information was reviewed, it was divided into four categories. The main limitations were the lack of information and the number of papers written in English. Finally, it was concluded that the soundtrack fulfills several functions within the narrative of a movie and that the topic needs more academic attention in Ibero-America. Therefore, researchers are invited to continue to problematize this issue in future systematic reviews.",,,Lecture Notes in Networks and Systems,Fourth International Conference on Image Processing and Capsule Networks,"Subarna Shakya, João Manuel R.

The methodology applied is non-experimental at the explanatory level of the cross-section. Data were collected from 210 students aged 17 to 25 years old. The data was treated by modelling structured equations based on the variance, which is a multivariate model. This study focused on critical factors: cell phone addiction, anxiety, distraction, and their relationship to learning achievement. Each of these variables was subjected to meticulous analysis, the reliability of which was confirmed throughout the process. This detailed examination revealed its importance and influence on the academic performance of higher education students. The most salient finding suggests that cell phone addiction and anxiety are positively correlated with learning achievement. In contrast, distraction was harmful. An increase in anxiety and cell phone addiction was associated with better academic performance, while an increase in distractibility was associated with decreased academic performance. These findings highlight the complexity of the relationship between these variables and their impact on academic performance.",,,Lecture Notes in Educational Technology,Proceedings of the 18th Latin American Conference on Learning Technologies (LACLO 2023),Santiago Berrezueta,,2023-10-17,2023,2023-10-17,2023,,,14-25,Closed,Chapter,"Gutierrez-Aguilar, O.; Duche Pérez, A.; Leon-Lucano, J.; Cordova-Buiza, F.; Chicaña-Huanca, S.","Gutierrez-Aguilar, O.

As an example of this, there is greater interest in providing attention to groups of students with special needs and attention, particularly in the context of the health crisis. The main objective of the study was to determine the relationship between inclusive policies and good teaching practices in private educational institutions of the primary level. Under a quantitative approach, we worked with a non-experimental, cross-sectional design and applied the validated questionnaire “Inclusion Index”, a Likert-type scale, to 50 primary school teachers in the city of Trujillo. The results show a high and significant correlation (.835**) between the two variables under study, suggesting the importance of establishing adequate policies to improve inclusion practices. Likewise, from the teachers’ perspective, the need to improve inclusive policies with the commitment to encourage and promote inclusive practice within their educational institutions is also noted. Finally, it is concluded that educational inclusion is a process and a strategy that helps to overcome barriers to learning. However, the critical global situation hinders the goal of implementing this system effectively.","To God for granting us the best of our weapons: To our parents, for forging us into the people we are today.

That is why many academics have seen the potential of this data source for the prediction of electoral elections. Therefore, it is necessary to review what kind of machine learning models perform better in predicting election results. Therefore, a literature review is carried out, following the guidelines of the PRISMA methodology, for which databases such as Scopus, IEEE-Xplore, Science Direct, Google Academic, Springer, Ebscohost, Iop, Wiley, and Sage were used. After the literature review analysis, a total of 1638 manuscripts related to the research topic were obtained, and the inclusion and exclusion criteria were applied. Thus, 69 manuscripts were systematized. The results showed that one of the models most used by the scientific community is sentiment analysis. It was also noted that the best performing model was random forest (RF), with an accuracy rate of 97%. In the second place, we have the recurrent neural networks (RNNs) model with an accuracy rate of 91.6%. However, unlike RF, RNN requires a high computational knowledge and effort. Finally, it is concluded that the RF model is the most suitable for the prediction of electoral results since it can perform better in this type of case.",,,Lecture Notes in Networks and Systems,Proceedings of Eighth International Congress on Information and Communication Technology,"Xin-She Yang, R.

The keywords “streaming”, “platform”, “media”, “COVID-19”, “Netflix”, “video” and “pandemic” were used. Sources were located in three languages. The data analysis allowed dividing the information into five categories: background on the positioning of streaming platforms, audience behaviour, consumption drivers, cases related to Netflix and platforms in times of confinement. It is concluded that during the pandemic, people mutated their mode of digital consumption, becoming more dependent, which has been capitalised on by streaming platforms that, taking advantage of habits, adaptability, and consumption trends, and responding with innovation, have increased users, in a distribution of the sector in which Netflix, thanks to its own strategies, is the leader.

In this work, we analyze the problem of optimizing the value of information presented in an electronic device to users who seek information on the web and whose attention is a priori limited and considered as a scarce and valuable resource. The optimization problem is posed as a dynamic and stochastic prioritization problem and is modeled as a dual-speed multi-armed restless bandit problem (RMABP) in a finite state-space and discrete-time setting. In addition, Adaptive-Greedy algorithm (AG) is used to approximate their solution, this algorithm assigns the value of Whittle’s index to each piece of information, which determines whether or not it is favorable to be presented to the user at a given time. Computational experiments based on Monte Carlo modeling are presented, which show that this methodology substantially improves Greedy index policy and asymptotically approximates the optimization solution to Whittle benchmark.",,,Lecture Notes in Networks and Systems,"CSEI: International Conference on Computer Science, Electronics and Industrial Engineering (CSEI)","Marcelo V.

For this reason, the objective of this research is to build a predictive multiclass classification model for the AP of students in an elementary school. It was conducted with a dataset of 218 third-year high school students. The Cross Industry Standard Process for Data Mining (CRISP-DM) methodology was used to create the model, which consists of 6 phases and is effective in data mining (DM) projects. The random forest (RF) algorithm was also used. The results indicated that the RF model obtained the highest prediction rates compared to other studies, with an accuracy of 95% of the model, respectively. Finally, it is observed that the attributes that mostly influence prediction are the scores of Ability 02 end of I bimester, Positive Impression, Ability 01 end of I bimester, Ability 03 end of I bimester, and Adaptability.

Alongside the often-low-keyed memorialisation processes, there have been shifts, changes and continuity in the commemorative culture of this massacre. Prior to the democratic dispensation in South Africa, commemorations had taken the form of expression of grief, loss and the will to continue the liberation project. In 1994, the nascent democratic government declared 21 March Human Rights Day, and since then, commemorations of the Sharpeville Massacre have been marked by state-led commemorations and narratives, contestations and articulations of diverse political identities. Against the backdrop of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, this chapter focuses on the 60th-anniversary commemorations of the Sharpeville Massacre. Through document analyses, field research and semi-structured interviews with custodians of heritage sites and cultural activists, the chapter addresses how COVID-19 restrictions re-configured commemorations of the massacre and transformed it from traditional memory practices to a mediatised culture using digital technologies. It argues that the 60th anniversary of the massacre was marked by the launch of numerous low-key grassroots commemorative activities, ranging from exhibitions and interviews with survivors to memorial site tours and documentary screenings.",,,Palgrave Macmillan Memory Studies,The COVID-19 Pandemic and Memory,"Orli Fridman, Sarah Gensburger",,2023-12-15,2023,2023-12-15,2024,,,199-218,Closed,Chapter,"Ngoaketsi, Joseph Mairomola","Ngoaketsi, Joseph Mairomola (University of South Africa (UNISA), Pretoria, South Africa)","Ngoaketsi, Joseph Mairomola (University of South Africa)","Ngoaketsi, Joseph Mairomola (University of South Africa)",0,0,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1167021163,36 Creative Arts and Writing; 48 Law and Legal Studies; 4807 Public Law,

The libraries fulfil the essential roles of providing information and related services and making them accessible to aca­demic communities. The current rapid technological developments of the Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR) pose challenges for academic libraries. They must rein­vent themselves and come up with new ways of rendering services. The COVID-19 pandemic forced many universities to completely shut down or consider using 4IR tools and present their activities online. This chapter investigates the strategies that can be deployed to upgrade and reshape academic libraries’ structure and opera­tional procedures in South Africa and potentially elsewhere. It considers the degree to which the functioning of academic libraries has altered because of the combined effects of the 4IR and the COVID-19 crisis. The response of academic libraries to the radically changed circumstances is examined. A qualitative case study and content analysis were used to collect data from the library websites of the Uni­versity of KwaZulu-Natal and the University of Limpopo. The findings indicated that the situation had forced both libraries to operate in entirely new ways. The libraries have positively responded to the challenge by adapting their operations. Academic libraries must embrace the use of new technological tools to complement existing traditional approaches. A syncretic combination of traditional and online collections and operations will meet the challenges of providing access to academic library collections and services during COVID-19 and beyond.",,,,Information Services for a Sustainable Society,"Madeleine C.

In Brazil, a law project prohibits the sale of fossil-fuel vehicles in 2030. However, Brazil faces challenges to meet the future demand for electricity, generated by the massive use of EVs. One of the state-of-the-art technological solutions is the ethanol-cell EVs. It is ideal because the country has a significant production of ethanol (hydro and anhydrous). Therefore, this chapter aimed to investigate the physical feasibility (in terms of productivity, climate conditions, and available areas) of sugarcane plantations (the most productive raw material for ethanol production) to meet estimated future electricity demands of ethanol-cell EVs. Based on big data between 2016 and 2020, it was applied the Slack-Based Measure (SBM) Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) model to measure the relative efficiency of 73 productive micro-regions. Then, future demand scenarios were projected. And the possibility of replacing pasture areas with sugarcane plantations was investigated. The results showed which macro-regions, states, and micro-regions are more efficient. Therefore, they should be the focus of investments for electricity generation and benchmarks (at regional and national levels). Furthermore, the possibility of a conflict between the need to generate electricity to supply EVs and the need to produce food and protect environmentally sensitive areas (e.g., the Amazon Forest) was highlighted. Policymakers must consider the complexity of this context before fostering green power sources. Finally, once this chapter is a kick-off of the discussion about the theme, future research paths are suggested.",,,,Handbook of Smart Energy Systems,"Michel Fathi, Enrico Zio, Panos M.

Parallelly to the urgent necessity of providing electricity for a huge number of people, there is the equally urgent necessity of reducing global warming and climate change. These two necessities are translated into a huge necessity of expanding the offer of green and clean electricity. Among the possibilities, hydropower can provide multiple services (e.g., freshwater management, climate mitigation, etc.). However, the maintenance of hydroelectric generation still presents challenges to be overcome, especially the small hydroelectric power plant (SHPP), which has more constrained resources. Given this context, the current chapter proposes an innovative and practical method for optimizing maintenance planning and continuous maintenance improvement, based on a decision-making grid (DMG) and analytic hierarchy process (AHP), a novel method for this kind of application. It was applied to an SHPP in Brazil. The results empirically validated common perceptions of the maintenance responsibilities but also enabled widening the view and discussing maintenance strategies beyond common sense. For example, showing that it is better to adopt a corrective strategy for communication systems. Through the results, the proposed method proved to be useful and practical for the company’s management once it is simple, fast, and easy. The proposed method can be easily replicated to the other SHPP worldwide for achieving better maintenance strategic decisions. Based on the investigation limitations (lack of maintenance data standardizations), further directions are discussed.",,,,Handbook of Smart Energy Systems,"Michel Fathi, Enrico Zio, Panos M.

225,pub.1157353589,10.7765/9781526159083.00009,,,3 Black academics matter,"This collection considers developments in South African historiography after apartheid, as viewed from the perspective of scholars involved at the cutting edge of research within the field. In the respective chapters, the contributors offer critical reflection on the theoretical and methodological aspects that guide their work. This involves them looking simultaneously backwards at the intellectual traditions on which their scholarship builds, and forwards to potential future areas of inquiry and unresolved questions. In so doing, the book offers a corrective to charges that South African historiography has seen little in terms of innovation in the years since apartheid. The book highlights many new approaches that have reshaped the field, and it situates them in the context of the extant literature. In addition to offering fresh perspectives on the traditional themes of race, class and nation, the topics addressed by contributors include histories of the environment, of women, of creative literature and the fine arts, and of South Africa’s global connections and transnational entanglements. The resulting collection offers an essential resource for emerging and established scholars involved in the practice of South African historiography. The ongoing debates that emerged after the 2015–17 student protests raised several questions with historiographical implications. However, they have also raised questions about the challenges of teaching at this historical moment for young black women historians. This chapter argues first that student ‘wokeness’ in the aftermath of these protests has combined with the rise of consumer-based education to reproduce black women’s illegitimacy in the classroom. Second, it argues that student wokeness converges with the antiblackness of South African universities and South African history writing. Manifesting itself through the gatekeeping of senior white scholars, the antiblackness has not only resulted in the paucity of black female historians but also had implications for historiography. To make these arguments the chapter draws on the experiences of black academics to sketch the everyday encounters with antiblackness in the classroom and their manifestation through ‘woke’ vocabulary. Among these sources are two volumes that capture the experiences of black academics across a variety of institutions in the USA and South Africa, and Paul Gilroy’s reflections on how wokeness shows up in ways that undermine the very political project that students seek to cultivate. The second set of sources grapples with antiblackness in South African historiography. There the chapter focuses primarily on the work of Premesh Lalu and Windsor Leroke to highlight how the production of South African historiography often continues to be shaped by its colonial origins and has therefore reproduced forms of black subjection, engendering forms of racial domination in the field.",,,,History beyond apartheid,Thula Simpson,,2023-12-31,2023,2024-02-02,2023-12-31,,,55-75,Closed,Chapter,"Thumbran, Janeke","Thumbran, Janeke ()",,"Thumbran, Janeke ()",0,0,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1157353589,"47 Language, Communication and Culture; 4702 Cultural Studies",4 Quality Education

This method involves simulating individual agents and their interactions with each other and the environment. Several platforms, such as GAMA and MASON, are available for developing agent-based simulations. In this chapter, we present a case study that showcases the versatility of agent-based simulation across different domains. Through various scenarios, we demonstrate that this approach can be successfully employed in diverse areas, such as traffic modeling, understanding the behavior of drifting objects, and teaching the operation of a sugar mill boiler. These simulations can be built from the scratch or using development platforms, providing a unique approach to modeling complex systems. By using agent-based simulations, researchers can test different scenarios and understand how agents interact within a system, leading to valuable insights for decision-making and problem-solving.",,,Studies in Big Data,"Data Analytics and Computational Intelligence: Novel Models, Algorithms and Applications","Gilberto Rivera, Laura Cruz-Reyes, Bernabé Dorronsoro, Alejandro Rosete",,2023-09-13,2023,2023-09-13,2023,132,,341-369,Closed,Chapter,"Moreno-Espino, Mailyn; Moreno-Román, Ariadna Claudia; López-González, Ariel; Benitez-Bosque, Robert Ruben; Porras, Cynthia; Hadfeg-Fernández, Yahima","Moreno-Espino, Mailyn (Centro de Investigación en Computación (CIC), Instituto Politécnico Nacional, Mexico city, Mexico); Moreno-Román, Ariadna Claudia (Escuela Superior de Ingeniería Mecánica y Eléctrica Unidad Culhuacan, Instituto Politécnico Nacional, Mexico city, Mexico); López-González, Ariel (Escuela Superior de Ingeniería Mecánica y Eléctrica Unidad Culhuacan, Instituto Politécnico Nacional, Mexico city, Mexico); Benitez-Bosque, Robert Ruben (Facultad de Informática, Universidad Tecnológica de La Habana “José Antonio Echeverría”, La Habana, Cuba); Porras, Cynthia (Facultad de Informática, Universidad Tecnológica de La Habana “José Antonio Echeverría”, La Habana, Cuba); Hadfeg-Fernández, Yahima (Facultad de Economía y Administración, Universidad Católica del Norte, Antofagasta, Chile)","Moreno-Espino, Mailyn (Instituto Politécnico Nacional)","Moreno-Espino, Mailyn (Instituto Politécnico Nacional); Moreno-Román, Ariadna Claudia (Instituto Politécnico Nacional); López-González, Ariel (Instituto Politécnico Nacional); Benitez-Bosque, Robert Ruben (Facultad de Informática, Universidad Tecnológica de La Habana “José Antonio Echeverría”, La Habana, Cuba); Porras, Cynthia (Facultad de Informática, Universidad Tecnológica de La Habana “José Antonio Echeverría”, La Habana, Cuba); Hadfeg-Fernández, Yahima (Catholic University of the North)",0,0,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1164038005,46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4602 Artificial Intelligence,

In Envisioning African Intersex Amanda Lock Swarr debunks this claim by interrogating contemporary intersex medicine and demonstrating its indivisibility from colonial ideologies and scientific racism. Tracing the history of racialized research that underpins medical and scientific premises of gendered bodies, Swarr analyzes decolonial actions by intersex South Africans from the 1990s to the present, centering the work of organizers such as Sally Gross, the first openly intersex activist in Africa and a global pioneer of intersex legislation. Swarr also explores African social media activism that advocates for intersex justice and challenges the mistreatment of South African Olympian Caster Semenya. Throughout, Swarr shows how activists displace doctors’ impositions to fashion self-representation. By unseating colonial visions of gender, intersex South Africans are actively disrupting medical violence, decolonizing gender binaries, and inciting policy changes.

It has been studied as an alternative processing for the preservation of fruit and vegetable juices. Inactivation of endogenous enzymes in juices is an important concern for food processing, aiming to guarantee juice stability and sensory acceptance during product shelf life. However, HPH can physically change the enzyme configuration, leading to activation, inactivation, and/or stabilization, depending on the processing parameters, enzyme, and food matrix. These different results expand the possibilities for food processing. This chapter describes the principles of HPH technology, the mechanisms involved in enzyme activation, inactivation, and stabilization, and the main effects on juice quality parameters, rheology, and phytochemical profile. To conclude, final remarks and future challenges of HPH application to modify enzyme activity were described.","This study was carried out in part in the Centre Européen de Biotechnologie et de Bioéconomie (CEBB), supported by the Région Grand Est, Département de la Marne, Greater Reims (France), and the European Union.

Influenced by several recent international initiatives, such as United Nations’ International Strategy for Disaster Reduction (ISDR), The Hyogo Framework for Action 2005–2015, and The Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015–2030 (SFDRR), there has been a growing awareness and consensus on the need in risk reduction, prevention, and climate adaptation. Such initiatives highlight the importance of efforts of reducing disaster risks and building a “culture of prevention,” as part of sustainable development. This reflects a paradigm shift in the mindset from disaster response to disaster reduction and preparedness. This shift also necessitates a fundamental change from centralized disaster management to decentralized disaster governance that is supposed to involve partnerships of all stakeholders including local communities, governments, private sector, civil society organizations, etc.In order to fasten and facilitate the process of disaster reduction and preparedness, the literature usually focuses on the skills of “capacity building” of local governments. But is it really mainly a matter of capacity building? This paper finds this view simplistic and instead argues that disaster governance may hardly take place in some countries like Turkey even if they hold high skills of capacity building.Putting financial barriers aside, countries that already have a decentralized form of administration, theoretically, may easily adapt to this shift. However many countries, including Turkey, hold a long history of centralized administration that makes it quite difficult for them to adapt to this new paradigm of disaster governance no matter how often and how severely they face disasters. Given that, it becomes important to examine how such countries deal with the principal of disaster governance in terms of disaster reduction and preparedness. To explore this question, this chapter discusses the results of a qualitative study looking at the relationships of Balikesir municipalities with other local stakeholders.The data comes from in-depth interviews with ten mayors and high-rank officials. The main findings are the following: the perceptions and behaviors of municipalities towards natural disasters generally remain focused on post-disaster response. Disaster risk and vulnerability analyses are not performed. Target audiences of awareness trainings are limited to students. The concept of preparedness is not widely internalized because local knowledge actors are not allowed to be actively involved in planning processes. It is concluded that a history of centralized administration along with strong national security concerns are the main reasons behind relatively poor performance of disaster governance. However, municipality authorities have a high belief in the response capacity of the state institutions and social solidarity in the events of disasters.","The authors thank TÜBİTAK for supporting the project numbered 116 K208, which is the data source of this chapter.",,Advances in Natural and Technological Hazards Research,Geohazards and Disaster Risk Reduction,"Sebastiano D'Amico, Francesco De Pascale",,2023-05-04,2023,2023-05-04,2023,51,,89-114,Closed,Chapter,"Çakı, Fahri; Uzun, Alper","Çakı, Fahri (Faculty of Science and Arts, Department of Sociology, Balıkesir University, Balıkesir, Turkey); Uzun, Alper (Faculty of Science and Arts, Department of Sociology, Balıkesir University, Balıkesir, Turkey; Department of Geography, Balikesir University, Balikesir, Turkey)","Çakı, Fahri (Balıkesir University)","Çakı, Fahri (Balıkesir University); Uzun, Alper (Balıkesir University; Balıkesir University)",0,0,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1157734224,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3507 Strategy, Management and Organisational Behaviour; 44 Human Society; 4407 Policy and Administration",11 Sustainable Cities and Communities

Public institutions of higher education for Blacks had to await a later period, spirit, and historical context. Private Black colleges and universities, despite the heavy odds against them and persistent, painful financial burdens and woes, generally survived and succeeded. In the historical context of the systematic, rigid, and race-conscious exclusion of Blacks from the professorate of White colleges and universities in America, one cannot avoid thinking of the current controversy over affirmative action, diversity, and equality of opportunity in American higher education.

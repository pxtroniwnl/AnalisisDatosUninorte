Legionellosis is becoming increasingly important as a public health problem throughout the world; although it is an underreported disease, studies have consistently documented a high incidence. In addition, health costs associated with the disease are high. Diagnosis of Legionnaires’ disease is based mainly on the detection of Legionella pneumophila serogroup 1 antigen in urine. However, there have been advances in detection tests for patients with legionellosis. New methodologies show greater sensitivity and specificity, detect more species and serogroups of Legionella spp., and have the potential for use in epidemiological studies. Testing for Legionella spp. is recommended at hospital admission for severe community-acquired pneumonia, and antibiotics directed against Legionella spp. should be included early as empirical therapy. Inadequate or delayed antibiotic treatment in Legionella pneumonia has been associated with a worse prognosis. Either a fluoroquinolone (levofloxacin or moxifloxacin) or a macrolide (azithromycin preferred) is the recommended first-line therapy for Legionnaires’ disease; however, little information is available regarding adverse events or complications, or about the duration of antibiotic therapy and its association with clinical outcomes. Most published studies evaluating antibiotic treatment for Legionnaires’ disease are observational and consequently susceptible to bias and confounding. Well-designed studies are needed to assess the usefulness of diagnostic tests regarding clinical outcomes, as well as randomized trials comparing fluoroquinolones and macrolides or combination therapy that evaluate outcomes and adverse events.","Acknowledgements

METHODS: Cross-sectional study in a voluntary sample of 469 university students (22.4 ± 0.19 years; 66% women). According to students' self-reports of physical activity and sedentary time, four behavioral profiles were created to investigate their association with subjective well-being and mental health using one-factor ANOVA that was adjusted to a multifactorial model.
RESULTS: The physically inactive and sedentary behavior profile presents the lowest levels of subjective well-being (p < 0.001), positive affective experiences (p < 0.001) and general mental health (p = 0.001). When adjusting for confounding variables, it was observed that the physically active and non-sedentary profile was associated with better general mental health (p < 0.01) in contrast to those who are physically active and sedentary.
CONCLUSIONS: Chilean university students with a physically inactive and sedentary profile during the pandemic presented worse well-being and mental health, with a sedentary lifestyle being one of the variables that most affects the mental health of these students. Therefore, measures should be implemented to encourage this population to maintain adequate levels of physical activity and reduce sedentary times.",,This research received no external funding.,International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health,,Jennifer L.

Different points are monitored during the polypropylene synthesis to perform TGA, DSC, FT-IR, RDX, and MFI analyses later. The content of AsH3 in polypropylene varies between 0.05 and 4.73 ppm, and of arsenic in virgin PP residues between 0.001 and 4.32 ppm for PP0 and PP10, increasing in fluidity index from 3.0 to 24.51. The origin of thermo-oxidative degradation is explained by the reaction mechanisms of the Molecule AsH3 with the active titanium center of the ZN catalyst and the subsequent oxidation to form radical complexes. OO-AsH-TiCl4-MgCl2 and (OO-as-OO)2 -TiCl4-MgCl2, which, by radical reactions, give rise to the formation of functional groups aldehyde, ketone, alcohol, carboxylic acid, CO, CO2, PP-Polyol, PP-Polyether, and PP-Isopropylethers.

When ultrasound is applied to a product with solid or fluid characteristics, the passage of acoustic waves and acoustic cavitation generates different mechanisms responsible for modifications in the original matrix of the sample. These effects of ultrasound can also be used to take advantage of by-products, for example by extracting compounds of interest, including natural pigments. Natural pigments or colorants are being highly demanded by different industries not only for color purposes but also due to their healthy properties, the greater demands in regulations and new consumer preferences. This review presents an updated critical analysis of the application of ultrasound-assisted extraction (UAE) to obtain natural pigments from food processing by-products. Initially, the ultrasound effects and mechanisms that improve the extraction of natural pigments in a fluid medium, as well as the factors that influence the extraction and the energy consumption of UAE are analyzed and described. Subsequently, the UAE application to obtain pigments belonging to the groups of carotenoids, chlorophyll, anthocyanins and betalains is evaluated. These sections detail the processing conditions, positive and negative effects, as well as possible applications of the extracted pigments. This review presents relevant information that may be useful to expand and explore new applications of ultrasound technology as well as promote the revaluation of by-products to obtain pigments that can be used in food, pharmaceutical or cosmetic industries.",,MR was grateful to the project no. 20201005 funded by the Universidad Privada del Norte.,Frontiers in Nutrition,,,,2022-05-24,2022,2022-05-24,,9,,891462,All OA; Gold,Article,"Linares, Guillermo; Rojas, Meliza Lindsay","Linares, Guillermo (Departamento de Ciencias Agroindustriales, Universidad Nacional de Trujillo, Trujillo, Peru); Rojas, Meliza Lindsay (Dirección de Investigación, Innovación y Responsabilidad Social, Universidad Privada del Norte (UPN), Trujillo, Peru)","Rojas, Meliza Lindsay (Private University of the North)","Linares, Guillermo (National University of Trujillo); Rojas, Meliza Lindsay (Private University of the North)",42,40,5.94,19.39,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnut.2022.891462/pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1148113057,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3210 Nutrition and Dietetics,

Objective: The objective of this study was to relate nursing workloads to professional job satisfaction. Methods: This is an observational, analytical, descriptive, concurrent and quantitative study, which used the Overall Job Satisfaction scale and subscales therein, to identify global satisfaction-intrinsic or related to motivational factors and extrinsic or associated with hygienic factors-in nursing professionals (n = 104) from eight Inpatient Units of Internal Medicine and Surgery, in four hospital centers, to describe job satisfaction in the professionals studied and to find statistically significant associations between job satisfaction and workload (measured with the scale MIDENF®) in the inpatient units where they work. Results: There were higher levels of satisfaction in the variables ""relationship with immediate boss"" and ""relationship with fellow workers"", and lower levels in ""relationship with senior management"" and ""organizational system of the unit"". In the inferential analysis, the scores were 75.63 for overall satisfaction, 35.28 for intrinsic satisfaction, and 40.36 for extrinsic satisfaction. Conclusions: There is a close relationship between workload and job satisfaction, showing more dissatisfaction regarding organizational aspects and professional recognition.","We would like to thank all the people and institutions that have collaborated with this project: the Carlos III Health Institute and Biomedical Research Institute of Murcia (IMIB) for their financial support and management of the project, the Statistical Support Section (SAE), the Area of Science and Research (ACTI), University of Murcia (www.um.es/web/acti (accessed on 15 September 2022) for their statistical analysis, and the IMIB bioinformatics platform for the data collection software.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of vaccines against COVID-19 in real-world conditions in adults aged 60 years and older in Colombia.
Methods: In this retrospective, population-based, matched cohort study, we evaluated the effectiveness of vaccines against COVID-19-related hospitalisation and death in people aged 60 years and older. The full cohort consisted of every person who was eligible to receive a COVID-19 vaccine in Colombia (the ESPERANZA cohort). The exposed cohort consisted of older adults who were fully vaccinated with Ad26.COV2-S, BNT162b2, ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, or CoronaVac, and who did not have a history of confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. The unexposed cohort were people aged 60 years and older who had not received any dose of a COVID-19 vaccine during the study period. Participant follow-up was done between March 11, 2021, and Oct 26, 2021. Vaccine effectiveness was estimated as 1- hazard ratio from cause-specific proportional hazards models in the presence of competing risks. We estimated the overall effectiveness of being fully vaccinated, as well as effectiveness for each vaccine, adjusting by main potential confounders. The effectiveness of each vaccine was also assessed by age groups (ages 60-69 years, 70-79 years, and ≥80 years).
Findings: 2 828 294 participants were assessed between March 11 and Oct 26, 2021. For all ages, the overall effectiveness across all assessed COVID-19 vaccines at preventing hospitalisation without subsequent death was 61·6% (95% CI 58·0-65·0, p<0·0001), 79·8% (78·5-81·1, p<0·0001) for preventing death after hospitalisation with COVID-19, and 72·8% (70·1-75·3, p<0·0001) for preventing death without previous COVID-19 hospitalisation. The effectiveness of all vaccines analysed at preventing death after hospitalisation for COVID-19 was 22·6% lower in adults who were aged 80 and older (68·4% [65·7-70·9], p<0·0001) compared with adults aged between 60 and 69 years (91·0% [89·0-92·6], p<0·0001).
Interpretation: All vaccines analysed in this study were effective at preventing hospitalisation and death from COVID-19 in fully vaccinated older adults, which is a promising result for the national vaccination programme against COVID-19 in Colombia and in countries where these biologics have been applied. Efforts should be improved to increase coverage among older adults. In addition, given that we observed that the effectiveness of vaccines declined with increasing age, a booster dose is also justified, which should be prioritised for older adults.

Their negative impacts on human health and shellfish exploitation are determined by toxic potential of the local strains and toxin biotransformations by exploited bivalve species. Chile has become, in a decade, the world's major exporter of mussels (Mytilus chilensis) and scallops (Argopecten purpuratus) and has implemented toxin testing according to importing countries' demands. Species of the Dinophysis acuminata complex and Protoceratium reticulatum are the most widespread and abundant LT producers in Chile. Dominant D. acuminata strains, notwithstanding, unlike most strains in Europe rich in okadaic acid (OA), produce only pectenotoxins, with no impact on human health. Dinophysis acuta, suspected to be the main cause of diarrhetic shellfish poisoning outbreaks, is found in the two southernmost regions of Chile, and has apparently shifted poleward. Mouse bioassay (MBA) is the official method to control shellfish safety for the national market. Positive results from mouse tests to mixtures of toxins and other compounds only toxic by intraperitoneal injection, including already deregulated toxins (PTXs), force unnecessary harvesting bans, and hinder progress in the identification of emerging toxins.

However, the literature on pesticide-related health effects in the Latin American and the Caribbean (LAC) region, an area of intensive agricultural and residential pesticide use, is sparse. We conducted a scoping review to describe the current state of research on the health effects of pesticide exposure in LAC populations with the goal of identifying knowledge gaps and research capacity building needs.
METHODS: We searched PubMed and SciELO for epidemiological studies on pesticide exposure and human health in LAC populations published between January 2007 and December 2021. We identified 233 publications from 16 countries that met our inclusion criteria and grouped them by health outcome (genotoxicity, neurobehavioral outcomes, placental outcomes and teratogenicity, cancer, thyroid function, reproductive outcomes, birth outcomes and child growth, and others).
RESULTS: Most published studies were conducted in Brazil (37%, n=88) and Mexico (20%, n=46), were cross-sectional in design (72%, n=167), and focused on farmworkers (45%, n=105) or children (21%, n=48). The most frequently studied health effects included genotoxicity (24%, n=62) and neurobehavioral outcomes (21%, n=54), and organophosphate (OP) pesticides were the most frequently examined (26%, n=81). Forty-seven percent (n=112) of the studies relied only on indirect pesticide exposure assessment methods. Exposure to OP pesticides, carbamates, or to multiple pesticide classes was consistently associated with markers of genotoxicity and adverse neurobehavioral outcomes, particularly among children and farmworkers.
DISCUSSION: Our scoping review provides some evidence that exposure to pesticides may adversely impact the health of LAC populations, but methodological limitations and inconsistencies undermine the strength of the conclusions. It is critical to increase capacity building, integrate research initiatives, and conduct more rigorous epidemiological studies in the region to address these limitations, better inform public health surveillance systems, and maximize the impact of research on public policies. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP9934.","We acknowledge the leadership of the Latin American and the Caribbean (LAC) Chapter of the International Society of Environmental Epidemiology (ISEE) for their support of this article.

Contracaecum larvae infecting farmed fish and fishery products are economically important causing market rejection in massive infection and may have zoonotic potential. In Israel, Contracaecum larvae have been described morphologically in several fish species; however, none of these descriptions were supported by molecular tools. In 2019-2020, hybrid tilapia (Oreochromis aureus x Oreochromis niloticus) and red drum (Sciaenops ocellatus), farmed in polyculture were found to be heavily infected with nematodes referable to Contracaecum larvae. Prevalence of infection in hybrid tilapia and red drum was 53.8% and 40.9%, respectively. A combined (morphological and molecular) approach revealed that both infected fish species were parasitized by the same species of Contracaecum, although larvae in hybrid tilapia were localized in the pericardial cavity whereas in red drum, they were observed in the abdominal cavity. Genetic analysis of internal transcribed spacer rDNA and cox2 mtDNA showed high similarity to unidentified Contracaecum larvae detected in several fish species in Ethiopia, Egypt and Kenya. In this study, molecular and morphological analyses place the possible new species in the C. multipapillatum complex and was provisionally named C. multipapillatum E. Further analyses combining morphological and molecular approaches are required on adult specimens collected from piscivorous birds living in the same area to support the identification of a potentially new species.","We thank Prof. Menachem Goren from the School of Zoology and The Steinhardt Museum of Natural History, Tel Aviv University for his kind advises regarding fish common and scientific names.

Nonetheless, CR decreases the workability of mixes by increasing the viscosity of the binder, leading to an increase in the production temperatures of asphalt mixes. However, warm mix technologies can reduce the temperature demand associated with these processes. The preceding explains the growing interest in producing rubberised asphalt binders incorporating warm mix asphalt (WMA) additives. In this research, the mechanical and rheological properties of a 60/70 penetration grade asphalt binder modified with CR (at a dosage of 15, 18 and 21% by the wet process) and WMA chemical additives (Evotherm M1 and Iterlow T) were investigated. Laboratory tests included penetration, softening point, rotational viscosity, frequency sweep through dynamic shear rheometer (DSR), and multiple stress creep recovery (MSCR) tests. The results indicate that CR increases the stiffness of the asphalt binder, which is reflected in a lower penetration grade and improved softening point. It also improves its rutting resistance but decreases fatigue performance. Furthermore, it has been shown that under the conditions studied, the higher the CR content, the more elevated the degree of stiffness and performance of the asphalt binder. On the other hand, WMA technology decreases asphalt stiffness and performance at high temperatures.",,"The authors express their sincere gratitude to the Universidad del Norte and the Department of Science, Technology, and Innovation (COLCIENCIAS) for financing this investigation effort via “Research Project 745/2016, Contract 037-2017, No. 1215-745-59105 “, and the company Humberto Quintero O.

A total of 569 college students (61.9% female), with a mean age of 21.73 years (standard deviation = 4.95), responded to the following questionnaires: Academic Self-Efficacy Scale, Single Item Self-Esteem Scale, Brief Scale of Satisfaction with Studies, Scale of Use of Virtual Media, Patient Health Questionnarie-2, and Single Item of Academic Emotional Exhaustion. Correlation statistics, regression models, and structural equation modeling (SEM) were used for data analysis. The results demonstrated a direct and significant correlation between virtual media use, academic self-efficacy, self-esteem, depression, and emotional exhaustion (p < .01). In addition, satisfaction with studies (β = -0.13), academic self-efficacy (β = -0.19), self-esteem (β = -0.14), and emotional exhaustion (β = 0.19) predicted depression significantly, whereas virtual media use (β = 0.17), study satisfaction (β = 0.09), and depression (β = 0.20) predicted emotional exhaustion associated with academics. The SEM model indicated that self-esteem, satisfaction with studies, and academic self-efficacy negatively predict depression, whereas academic self-efficacy positively predicts virtual media use. Finally, both virtual media use and depression positively predict emotional exhaustion. This model presents optimal goodness-of-fit indices (X2 = 8.926, df = 6, p = .178; comparative fit = .991, Tucker-Lewis = .979, root mean square error of approximation = .029 [confidence interval 90% = .000-.067], standardized root mean square residual = .022).

Among the FAs, docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) has been widely recognized as a key molecule for neuronal function and cell signaling. Despite its relevance, the molecular pathways underlying the beneficial effects of DHA on the cells of the CNS are still unclear. Here, we summarize and discuss the molecular mechanisms underlying the actions of DHA in neural cells with a special focus on processes of survival, morphological development, and synaptic maturation. In addition, we examine the evidence supporting a potential therapeutic role of DHA against CNS tumor diseases and tumorigenesis. The current results suggest that DHA exerts its actions on neural cells mainly through the modulation of signaling cascades involving the activation of diverse types of receptors. In addition, we found evidence connecting brain DHA and ω-3 PUFA levels with CNS diseases, such as depression, autism spectrum disorders, obesity, and neurodegenerative diseases. In the context of cancer, the existing data have shown that DHA exerts positive actions as a coadjuvant in antitumoral therapy. Although many questions in the field remain only partially resolved, we hope that future research may soon define specific pathways and receptor systems involved in the beneficial effects of DHA in cells of the CNS, opening new avenues for innovative therapeutic strategies for CNS diseases.","We thank Felipe Serrano (www.illustrative-science.com, accessed on 7 February 2022) for figure design, and Katterine Salazar (Universidad de Concepcion, Chile) for helpful criticisms.","This research was funded by ANID-FONDECYT 1211082 (G.E.Y.), Núcleo para el estudio del cancer a nivel básico, aplicado y clínico, VRIDT UCN 20210401007 (C.C.), and by the Millennium Nucleus for the Study of Pain (MiNuSPain).

The presence of this pathology in children leads to the appearance of different alterations (physical, psychological, social, etc.). Due to their high influence, the aim of this study is to understand these psychological and sociocultural determinants and their impact on the quality of life of asthmatic children. In order to determine the influence of these determinants on quality of life, a narrative review of 48 articles collected in different databases was carried out. Emotions are the most powerful precursor to producing an asthmatic attack. Anxiety and depression are the pathologies that appear frequently associated with childhood asthma, together with Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder. In addition, the personality of these children seems to be characterized by shyness and impulsivity, although exceptionally it has been associated with psychopathic behaviors, aggressiveness, and cases of psychosis. School performance is impaired and bullying occurs more frequently. Likewise, dysfunctional family relationships and lower socioeconomic status have a negative impact on the severity and management of asthma. In short, the quality of life of asthmatic children is lower due to the presence of the aforementioned psychological and sociocultural determinants.",,This research received no external funding.,International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health,,Paul B.

In the present research, we aimed to determine the internal consistency and validity of the Stress Factors and Manifestations Scale for in-hospital and out-of-hospital emergency workers. Methods: A quantitative, prospective, cross-sectional, and observational study including 269 emergency service professionals. Results: The scale was composed of 21 items, with a Cronbach’s α value of 0.908. The hospital workers (38.4 ± 10.8 vs. 35.1 ± 9.9, p = 0.014) and women (39.3 ± 11.4 vs. 34.2 ± 8.6, p < 0.001) had higher levels of stress. The sensitivity, specificity, and predictive values of the scale were adequate. Conclusion: In the present study, including in-hospital and out-of-hospital emergency workers, the Stress Factors and Manifestations Scale presented appropriate usefulness, internal consistency, and validity, with optimal predictive ability. Higher levels of anxiety, female gender, being less optimistic, and working in hospital emergency departments were related to increased stress levels.

This study aimed to evaluate the psychometric property of the GDS-15 and a simplified version among a large representative longevous population in China.MethodsA total of 1624 individuals (786 oldest-old persons aged from 80 to 99 years; 838 centenarians aged 100+ years) participated in this study. Home interviews with structured questionnaires were conducted to collect sociodemographic data. Depressive symptoms were measured using the Chinese GDS-15 version. We implemented mixed methods for the psychometric evaluation of the GDS-15. Cronbach’s α coefficient and item-total correlation coefficients were used to evaluate the internal consistency. A standard expert consultation was conducted to test the content validity of each item. Multiple factor analyses were used to explore the optimal factor structure and measurement invariance.ResultsThe α coefficient of the GDS-15 was 0.745, while two items impaired the overall consistency reliability. Nineteen experts rated the applicability for each item and provided removal suggestion. Five items with less validity were removed, and a simplified 10-item GDS model with three-factor structure was proposed as an optimal solution. The GDS-10 model showed factorial equivalence across age, sex, residence, and education in multi-group confirmatory factor analyses.ConclusionsThe original GDS-15 has acceptable internal reliability, known-group validity, and concurrent validity among Chinese community-dwelling oldest-old and centenarians; however we provided preliminary evidence indicating that individual items related to somatic function or social activities may not be applicable for this population. The modified GDS-10 can be proposed as a potentially more practical and comprehensible instrument for depression screening.","We thank all the staff of the China Hainan Centenarian Cohort Study for their joint efforts and cooperation.

If untreated, the complications of PKU lead to significant neucognitive and neuropsychiatric impairments, placing a burden on both the individual’s quality of life and on the healthcare system. We conducted a systematic literature review to characterize the impact of PKU on affected individuals and on healthcare resources in Latin American (LATAM) countries.MethodsSearches of the global medical literature as well as regional and local medical literature up to September 2021. Observational studies on patients with PKU from any LATAM country. Pairs of reviewers independently screened eligible articles, extracted data from included studies, and assessed their risk of bias.Results79 unique studies (47 cross-sectional studies, 18 case series, 12 case reports, and two cohort studies) with a total of 4090 patients were eligible. Of these studies, 20 had data available evaluating early-diagnosed PKU patients for meta-analysis of burden outcomes. Intellectual disability in the pooled studies was 18% [95% Confidence Interval (CI) 0.04–0.38; I2 = 83.7%, p = 0.0133; two studies; n = 114].

In a previous study, we demonstrated the antimicrobial activity of synthetic hepcidin (hep20) from rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss), and its protective effect in European sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax) challenged with Vibrio anguillarum. Additionally, we described the uptake and distribution of hep20 in different tissues and leukocyte cells. Interestingly, various AMPs characterized in high vertebrates, called host defense peptides (HDPs), also possess immunomodulation activity. For that reason, the present study explores the immunomodulatory abilities of hep20 through in vitro and in vivo studies. First, a monocyte/macrophage RTS-11 cell line from rainbow trout was used to evaluate hep20 effects on pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines in fish leukocyte cells. Next, the European sea bass juveniles were used to determine if hep20 can regulate the expression of cytokines in fish immune tissues. The results show that hep20 was uptake inner to RTS-11 cells and was able to induce the expression of IL-10, IL-1β, and TNFα at transcriptional and protein levels. Then, the European sea bass juveniles were given intraperitoneal injections of the peptide. At 1, 3, 7, 14, and 21 days post-injection (dpi), IL-10, IL -1β, and TNFα mRNA were quantified in the anterior gut, spleen, and head kidney. The hep20 was able to up-regulate cytokine gene expression in these tissues, mainly in the head kidney. Furthermore, the evaluated cytokines showed a cyclical tendency of higher to lesser expression. Finally, a bioinformatics analysis showed that the structure adopted by hep20 is similar to the γ-core domain described for cysteine-stabilized AMP, defined as immunomodulatory and antimicrobial, which could explain the ability of hep20 to regulate the cytokine expression. This study provides new insights into immunomodulatory function complementary to the previously established antimicrobial activity of hep20, suggesting a role as an HDP in teleost fish. These facts are likely to be associated with molecular functions underpinning the protective effect of fish hepcidin against pathogens.",,"This research was funded by ANID-Chile Grants FONDEF VIU15E0024 and FONDECYT 11180042 to C.A.Á.; FONDECYT 1210056 to F.G.; REDES Chile-Perú REDBIO0009 to P.A.S.; and FONDECYT 1191763 and Program for Sanitary Management in Aquaculture of the Ministry of Economy, Development, and Tourism of Chile (FIE-2015-V014 201708070149) to L.M.",Animals,,"Francisco A.

This research provides important information regarding the influence of the type of solvent used in extracting organic reducing agents from E. globulus on the FeO NPs green synthesis protocol. A broad approach to characterization is presented, where UV-vis spectrophotometry suggests the presence of this type of nanoparticulate material. Likewise, the reduction mechanism was evaluated by FT-IR and the magnetic properties were evaluated by PPSM. In addition, characterizations were linked via elemental analysis (EDX), crystallographic characterization (XRD), electron microscopy (SEM/STEM), and Z potential to evaluate colloidal stability. The results show the influence of the type of solvent used for the extraction of organic reducing agents from E. globulus, and the effect on the synthesis of FeO NPs. In addition, the nanostructure material obtained showed excellent efficiency in the remediation of agricultural soil, eliminating metals such as Cr-VI, Cd, and, to a lesser extent, Pb.","The authors would like to thank LABNANO/CBPF for the technical support during the electron microscopy work.

The research was carried out using an explanatory cross-sectional design, with the participation of 1011 pre-professional interns of 13 health networks from the department of Puno (Peru). Data were collected using the Satisfaction with Life Scale, Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale-2, Patient Health Questionnaire 2, and the Psychological Wellbeing Scale. The main data analysis was carried out using the R statistical software, and implementing the confirmatory factor analysis technique, which evidenced that the explanatory model provides an acceptable value. Based on the above, a negative relationship between depression and life satisfaction, (β = -.60, p < .001) and a positive relationship between anxiety and life satisfaction (β = .28, p < .001) was shown, in addition to a mediating effect of the psychological wellbeing related to depression and life satisfaction (p < .001). In conclusion, life satisfaction is explained concerning the degree of depression and anxiety, as well as the moderating effect of psychological well-being.

The present study aimed to determine the epidemiological pattern of trauma patients in a regional trauma center in the Midwest of Iran from 2014 to 2020.MethodsThis study was a retrospective study that was performed on 29,804 trauma patients admitted to Be′sat Hospital in Hamadan from January 2014 to December 2020. Data was collected using Health Information Management (HIM) Center of the Be′sat Hospital. For investigating the relationship of the characteristics of trauma patients and the mechanisms of trauma, Multiple Multinomial Logistic Regression (MMNLR) model was used. All statistical analyses were performed using the IBM SPSS Statistics version 24.ResultsThe mean age of all patients was 35.4 (SD = 21.9) years. Most of them were men (71.7%). The most common mechanism of trauma was road traffic accidents (RTAs) (39.6%) followed by falls (30.2%), other (19.7%), violence (6.2%), and burn (4.4%). 1.5% of the trauma patients expired. The results of multiple multinomial logistic regression indicated that significant affected factor on odds referring because of RTAs compared to other mechanism were: season and hospital length of stay (LOS); in falls and violence: age, sex, season, and LOS; and in burn: age, sex, season, evening time, and LOS (p < 0.05).ConclusionBased on the investigation of 29,804 trauma patients, in Iran as a developing country, RTAs and falls were two common mechanisms of trauma. It seems that as a short-term plan, it is possible to focus on road safety, to improve the quality of vehicles, to hold training courses for drivers. Also, as a long-term goal, considering that the elderly population in Iran is increasing, it is necessary to pay attention to fall reduction programs.",We appreciate the Health Information Management (HIM) Center of the Be′sat Hospital for providing this database.,The current study has financially supported by the Modeling of Non-Communicable Diseases Research Center of Hamadan University of Medical Sciences (No. 9904242617).,BMC Emergency Medicine,,,"Aged; Male; Humans; Adult; Female; Trauma Centers; Iran; Retrospective Studies; Accidents, Traffic; Burns; Wounds and Injuries",2022-12-26,2022,2022-12-26,,22,1,210,All OA; Gold,Article,"Roshanaei, Ghodratollah; Khoshravesh, Sahar; Abdolmaleki, Sajjad; Bathaei, Tayebeh; Farzian, Mahnaz; Saatian, Mohammadreza","Roshanaei, Ghodratollah (Department of Biostatistics, School of Public Health, Modeling of Noncommunicable Diseases Research Center, Hamadan University of Medical Sciences, Hamadan, Iran); Khoshravesh, Sahar (Social Determinants of Health Research Center, Hamadan University of Medical Sciences, Hamadan, Iran); Abdolmaleki, Sajjad (Department of Neurosurgery, Hamadan University of Medical Sciences, Hamadan, Iran); Bathaei, Tayebeh (Department of Operating Room, School of Para Medicine, Hamadan University of Medical Sciences, Hamadan, Iran); Farzian, Mahnaz (Clinical Supervisor, Be’sat hospital, Hamadan, Iran); Saatian, Mohammadreza (Department of Neurosurgery, Hamadan University of Medical Sciences, Hamadan, Iran; School of Medicine, Hamadan University of Medical Sciences, Shaheed Fahmideh Ave, Hamadan, Islamic Republic of Iran)","Saatian, Mohammadreza (Hamedan University of Medical Sciences; Hamedan University of Medical Sciences)","Roshanaei, Ghodratollah (Hamedan University of Medical Sciences); Khoshravesh, Sahar (Hamedan University of Medical Sciences); Abdolmaleki, Sajjad (Hamedan University of Medical Sciences); Bathaei, Tayebeh (Hamedan University of Medical Sciences); Farzian, Mahnaz (Clinical Supervisor, Be’sat hospital, Hamadan, Iran); Saatian, Mohammadreza (Hamedan University of Medical Sciences; Hamedan University of Medical Sciences)",6,6,2.76,3.05,https://bmcemergmed.biomedcentral.com/counter/pdf/10.1186/s12873-022-00756-9,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1153990847,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 42 Health Sciences; 4206 Public Health,3 Good Health and Well Being

Thus, the BR signaling regulators have the potential to be targeted for gene editing to optimize the architecture of plants and make them more resilient to environmental stress. Our understanding of the BR signaling mechanism in monocot crop species is limited compared to our knowledge of this process accumulated in the model dicot species - Arabidopsis thaliana. A deeper understanding of the BR signaling and response during plant growth and adaptation to continually changing environmental conditions will provide insight into mechanisms that govern the coordinated expression of the BR signaling genes in rice (Oryza sativa) which is a model for cereal crops. Therefore, in this study a comprehensive and detailed in silico analysis of promoter sequences of rice BR signaling genes was performed. Moreover, expression profiles of these genes during various developmental stages and reactions to several stress conditions were analyzed. Additionally, a model of interactions between the encoded proteins was also established. The obtained results revealed that promoters of the 39 BR signaling genes are involved in various regulatory mechanisms and interdependent processes that influence growth, development, and stress response in rice. Different transcription factor-binding sites and cis-regulatory elements in the gene promoters were identified which are involved in regulation of the genes' expression during plant development and reactions to stress conditions. The in-silico analysis of BR signaling genes in O. sativa provides information about mechanisms which regulate the coordinated expression of these genes during rice development and in response to other phytohormones and environmental factors. Since rice is both an important crop and the model species for other cereals, this information may be important for understanding the regulatory mechanisms that modulate the BR signaling in monocot species. It can also provide new ways for the plant genetic engineering technology by providing novel potential targets, either cis-elements or transcriptional factors, to create elite genotypes with desirable traits.","The authors gratefully acknowledge financial support of publication of this article by the National Science Centre, Poland (Grant No. 2019/35/B/NZ2/00382).",,Frontiers in Genetics,,,,2022-07-06,2022,2022-07-06,,13,,953458,All OA; Gold,Article,"Ahmar, Sunny; Gruszka, Damian","Ahmar, Sunny (Institute of Biology, Biotechnology and Environmental Protection, Faculty of Natural Sciences, University of Silesia, Katowice, Poland); Gruszka, Damian (Institute of Biology, Biotechnology and Environmental Protection, Faculty of Natural Sciences, University of Silesia, Katowice, Poland)","Gruszka, Damian (University of Silesia)","Ahmar, Sunny (University of Silesia); Gruszka, Damian (University of Silesia)",20,17,2.74,7.72,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fgene.2022.953458/pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1149247785,31 Biological Sciences; 3108 Plant Biology,

The Effect of Delivery Mode on Team-Based Learning of Clinical Reasoning in a Family Medicine Clerkship,"In health professions education, team-based learning (TBL) has been used to help learners develop clinical reasoning and decision-making skills. The COVID-19 pandemic has challenged institutions to move curriculum delivery from largely in-person to online. With the anticipated return to in-person instruction and arguments made in favor of online instruction in certain circumstances, evidence is needed to support decision making in curriculum planning. The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of delivery mode (in-person vs. online) on student learning of clinical reasoning and clinical decision-making (CR/CDM) in the family medicine clerkship. Data from three cohorts of third-year medical students were included in the study: 2018/2019 cohort, in-person; 2019/2020 cohort, half of the cohort in-person, half of the cohort online; 2020/2021 cohort, online. Students' performance data-individual readiness assurance test (IRAT) and group readiness assurance test (GRAT) scores-were used. The Generalized Estimating Equations (GEE) analysis was performed. As expected, students scored higher in GRAT than IRAT across the three cohorts. No significant IRAT-GRAT differences were observed between in-person and online delivery of TBL sessions. Student learning of CR/CDM in TBL is comparable between the two modes of delivery in the family medicine clerkship. Future research in other clerkships, years of medical education, and professional programs is needed to inform decision making regarding the TBL delivery mode.",,This research was funded by the Northern Alberta Academic Family Physician Fund.,Medical Sciences,,Antoni Torres,"COVID-19; Clinical Reasoning; Educational Measurement; Family Practice; Humans; Pandemics; Problem-Based Learning; Students, Medical",2022-08-08,2022,2022-08-08,,10,3,41,All OA; Gold,Article,"Babenko, Oksana; Ding, Mao; Lee, Ann S","Babenko, Oksana (Department of Family Medicine, Faculty of Medicine & Dentistry, University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB T6G 2R3, Canada.); Ding, Mao (Department of Family Medicine, Faculty of Medicine & Dentistry, University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB T6G 2R3, Canada.); Lee, Ann S (Department of Family Medicine, Faculty of Medicine & Dentistry, University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB T6G 2R3, Canada.)","Babenko, Oksana (University of Alberta)","Babenko, Oksana (University of Alberta); Ding, Mao (University of Alberta); Lee, Ann S (University of Alberta)",6,6,2.69,4.2,https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3271/10/3/41/pdf?version=1660028161,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1150086380,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 42 Health Sciences; 4203 Health Services and Systems,4 Quality Education

The main objective of this study is to provide new empirical evidence about the validity and reliability of the CERQ via a sample of 271 Spanish adolescents (136 female, 135 male) aged from 15 to 18 years (M = 15.7, SD = 0.76). The analytical process was carried out in two phases. A confirmatory factor analysis was performed on the polychoric correlation matrix between items. Four possible alternative models were contrasted: two models with nine factors and two models with two second-order factors and nine first-order factors, with 36 and 27 items, respectively. The model with nine correlated factors and 27 items obtained the best indices of overall fit. Subsequently, the reliability of the measurements was estimated on this model. The results reaffirm the validity of the 27-item version of the CERQ over the original 36-item structure. The findings also confirm that the CERQ is a reliable instrument for the evaluation of emotion regulation strategies in adolescents.","This research has been supported by the Spanish Government (Ministry of Education and Vocational Training) and by a doctoral grant (Formación de Profesorado Universitario, FPU 17/01994) awarded to the first author (E.B.).",This research has received no external funding.,International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health,,,Adolescent; Cognition; Emotional Regulation; Female; Humans; Male; Psychometrics; Reproducibility of Results; Surveys and Questionnaires,2022-03-18,2022,2022-03-18,,19,6,3602,All OA; Gold,Article,"Betegón, Elena; Rodríguez-Medina, Jairo; del-Valle, Macarena; Irurtia, María Jesús","Betegón, Elena (Department of Psychology, Faculty of Education and Social Work, University of Valladolid (UVa), Recognized Research Group (GIR) Psychology and Health, 47011 Valladolid, Spain;, mjirurtia@uva.es); Rodríguez-Medina, Jairo (Department of Pedagogy, Faculty of Education and Social Work, University of Valladolid (UVa), Recognized Research Group (GIR) Psychology and Health, 47011 Valladolid, Spain;, jairo.rodriguez.medina@uva.es); del-Valle, Macarena (Institute of Basic and Applied Psychology and Technology (IPSIBAT), National Scientific and Technical Research Council (CONICET), National University of Mar del Plata (UNMDP), Recognized Research Group (GIR) Psychology and Health, Mar del Plata 7600, Argentina;, mdelvalle1989@gmail.com); Irurtia, María Jesús (Department of Psychology, Faculty of Education and Social Work, University of Valladolid (UVa), Recognized Research Group (GIR) Psychology and Health, 47011 Valladolid, Spain;, mjirurtia@uva.es)","Betegón, Elena (University of Valladolid)","Betegón, Elena (University of Valladolid); Rodríguez-Medina, Jairo (University of Valladolid); del-Valle, Macarena (National University of Mar del Plata); Irurtia, María Jesús (University of Valladolid)",11,10,2.46,6.97,https://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/19/6/3602/pdf?version=1647588000,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1146439261,52 Psychology; 5203 Clinical and Health Psychology,

Eight hundred two university students aged 17-54 years (Mean 21.83; SD = 5.31); 658 females (82%) and 144 males (18%); who completed the Patient Health Questionnaire-2, Coronavirus Anxiety Scale, Subjective Well-being Scale (SWB), and Self-reporting of Academic Performance participated. A partial unregularized network was estimated using the ggmModSelect function. Expected influence (EI) values were calculated to identify the central nodes and a two-tailed permutation test for the difference between the two groups (COVID-19 infected and uninfected). The results reveal that a depression and well-being node (PHQ1-SWB3) presents the highest relationship. The most central nodes belonged to COVID-19 anxiety, and there are no global differences between the comparison networks; but at the local level, there are connections in the network of COVID-19-infected students that are not in the group that did not present this diagnosis. It is concluded that anxious-depressive symptomatology and its relationship with well-being and evaluation of academic performance should be considered in order to understand the impact that COVID-19 had on health sciences students.",,This work was supported by Universidad Privada del Norte.,Frontiers in Psychology,,,,2022-02-10,2022,2022-02-10,,13,,837606,All OA; Gold,Article,"Ventura-León, José; Caycho-Rodríguez, Tomás; Talledo-Sánchez, Karim; Casiano-Valdivieso, Kenia","Ventura-León, José (Department of Health Sciences, Universidad Privada del Norte (UPN), Lima, Peru); Caycho-Rodríguez, Tomás (Department of Health Sciences, Universidad Privada del Norte (UPN), Lima, Peru); Talledo-Sánchez, Karim (Department of Health Sciences, Universidad Privada del Norte (UPN), Lima, Peru); Casiano-Valdivieso, Kenia (Department of Health Sciences, Universidad Privada del Norte (UPN), Lima, Peru)","Ventura-León, José (Private University of the North)","Ventura-León, José (Private University of the North); Caycho-Rodríguez, Tomás (Private University of the North); Talledo-Sánchez, Karim (Private University of the North); Casiano-Valdivieso, Kenia (Private University of the North)",16,13,2.46,10.13,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.837606/pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1145448955,52 Psychology; 5203 Clinical and Health Psychology,3 Good Health and Well Being

Using Vis-NIR-SWIR Hyperspectroscopy","High-throughput and large-scale data are part of a new era of plant remote sensing science. Quantification of the yield, energetic content, and chlorophyll a fluorescence (ChlF) remains laborious and is of great interest to physiologists and photobiologists. We propose a new method that is efficient and applicable for estimating photosynthetic performance and photosystem status using remote sensing hyperspectroscopy with visible, near-infrared and shortwave spectroscopy (Vis-NIR-SWIR) based on rapid multivariate partial least squares regression (PLSR) as a tool to estimate biomass production, calorimetric energy content and chlorophyll a fluorescence parameters. The results showed the presence of typical inflections associated with chemical and structural components present in plants, enabling us to obtain PLSR models with R2P and RPDP values greater than >0.82 and 3.33, respectively. The most important wavelengths were well distributed into 400 (violet), 440 (blue), 550 (green), 670 (red), 700−750 (red edge), 1330 (NIR), 1450 (SWIR), 1940 (SWIR) and 2200 (SWIR) nm operating ranges of the spectrum. Thus, we report a methodology to simultaneously determine fifteen attributes (i.e., yield (biomass), ΔH°area, ΔH°mass, Fv/Fm, Fv’/Fm’, ETR, NPQ, qP, qN, ΦPSII, P, D, SFI, PI(abs), D.F.) with high accuracy and precision and with excellent predictive capacity for most of them. These results are promising for plant physiology studies and will provide a better understanding of photosystem dynamics in tobacco plants when a large number of samples must be evaluated within a short period and with remote acquisition data.","Thanks are also due to Eliemar Campostrini and Guilherme Rodrigues de Souza at State University of the North Fluminense Darcy Ribeiro (UENF) for supporting JIP-test and Dra.

DESIGN: A cross-sectional study reported in line with the STROBE guidelines.
METHODS: Nursing students were invited to complete an online questionnaire at the end of the 2019-2020 academic year using convenience sampling. The questionnaire collected data on sociodemographic factors, work, and life experiences in relation to COVID-19, habits and lifestyle using the World Health Organization Five Well-Being Index (WHO-5) and the Generalized Anxiety disorder-7 scale. Variables related to anxiety were analysed using multiple lineal regression analysis, RESULTS: The prevalence of low psychological well-being in the 203 students was 44.3% and of anxiety 55.7%. In the multivariate analysis the variables associated with anxiety were having worked in the pandemic, having had symptoms of COVID-19 and having been afraid of getting infected.
CONCLUSIONS: The levels of anxiety due to the COVID-19 pandemic in nursing students have been high, and levels of psychological well-being have been low. The fact of having worked during the pandemic, having had symptoms compatible with COVID-19 or being afraid of getting infected are associated with the highest scores for anxiety.
RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: This study gives more evidence on the psychological impact on nursing students during the first wave of the pandemic in Spain. This can be used to design anxiety management programmes for inclusion into teaching syllabuses. It also gives arguments for the setting up of psychological and emotional support services for these students and other healthcare professionals working during the pandemic.","ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS The authors would like to thank the staff and students of the Sant Joan de Déu Teaching Campus University Nursing School who participated voluntarily in this study and the Information Technology Department for their help in administrating it.

This review aimed to synthesize evidence of the association between AIP values and CAD. A literature search was carried out on four databases, namely, PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Ovid-Medline. A handsearch was performed on preprint repositories (MedRxiv and Research Square). The effect measurements were expressed as odds ratios (OR) with their corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI). For the quantitative synthesis, we employed a random-effects model. We analyzed 14 articles (with 40,902 participants) from seven different countries. The quantitative analysis revealed that an increase in one unit of AIP was associated with higher odds of developing CAD (OR 2.11; 95% CI 1.65-2.69; P < 0.001; I 2 = 98%). We conducted subgroup analyses of Chinese (OR 1.89; 95% CI 1.40-2.56; P < 0.001) and non-Chinese studies (OR 2.51; 95% CI 1.42-4.42; P < 0.001). The sensitivity analysis by risk of bias continued to demonstrate an association, and the heterogeneity remained unchanged (OR 1.75; 95% CI 1.33-2.31; P < 0.001; I 2 = 98%).

Additionally, these patients suffer hormonal alterations that are associated with psychological symptoms (e.g., changes in mood, emotional instability, and memory loss). This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of a psycho-oncological intervention based on counseling to reduce anxiety and depression related to the treatment in patients with DTC.
Methods: A non-randomized controlled study, with two groups [experimental group (EG), n = 37, and control group (CG), n = 38] and baseline and posttreatment measures, was designed. Patients in the EG received a psycho-oncological intervention based on counseling in addition to the standard treatment. The independent variable was the assigned group and the dependent one was the evolution of anxiety and depression, which were analyzed separately, and both were evaluated using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. Other relevant covariables related to the quality of life (QoL) were also analyzed using Short Form-36 Health Survey and Psychological General Wellbeing Index scales.
Results: The difference of the posttreatment-baseline variation showed a statistically significant reduction in anxiety and depression in the EG in relation to the CG (p < 0.001). The mean of the Psychological General Wellbeing Index scales score increased significantly in the EG (p < 0.001) and decreased significantly in the CG (p < 0.001). All the baseline and the posttreatment scores of the variables evaluated showed a statistically significant improvement in the EG vs. the CG.

LEB-18: Physicochemical Characterization and Assessment of In Vitro Gastrointestinal Behavior,"Encapsulation can be used as a strategy to protect and control the release of bioactive extracts. In this work, an extract from Spirulina sp. LEB-18, rich in phenolic compounds, was encapsulated in biopolymeric particles (i.e., composed of alginate) and characterized concerning their thermal behavior using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), size, morphology, swelling index (S), and encapsulation efficiency (EE%); the release profile of the phenolic compounds at different pHs and the particle behavior under in vitro gastrointestinal digestion were also evaluated. It was shown that it is possible to encapsulate the phenolic extract from Spirulina sp. LEB-18 in alginate particles with high encapsulation efficiency (88.97%). It was also observed that the particles are amorphous and that the encapsulated phenolic compounds were released at a pH 7.2 but not at pH 1.5, which means that the alginate particles are able to protect the phenolic compounds from the harsh stomach conditions but lose their integrity under intestinal pH conditions. Regarding bioaccessibility, it was observed that the encapsulated phenolic compounds showed higher bioaccessibility compared to phenolic compounds in free form. This work increases the knowledge about the behavior of alginate particles encapsulating phenolic compounds during in vitro gastrointestinal digestion. It also provides essential information for designing biopolymeric particle formulations encapsulating phenolic compounds for application in pharmaceutical and food products.","The authors thank FURG, UMINHO, and FAPERGS, RS, Brazil.","The study was financially supported by the following programs and institutions: Science Without Borders—CNPq (Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico), CSF (Ciência sem fronteiras), CAPES (Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior), Brazil, the University of Minho, Braga, Portugal, and Foundation for Science and Technology (FCT, POPH-QREN and FSE Portugal).

However, few population-based seroprevalence surveys have been conducted to quantify attack rates and characterize drivers of transmission.
METHODS: We conducted a population-based cross-sectional study to assess the seroprevalence of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in ten cities in Colombia between September and December 2020. The study involved multi-stage cluster sampling at each city. Participants provided a serum sample and answered a demographic and risk factor questionnaire. Prior infection by SARS-CoV-2 was ascertained using the ""SARS-CoV-2 Total (COV2T) Advia Centaur - Siemens"" chemiluminescence assay.
FINDINGS: A total of 17863 participants from 7320 households participated in the study. Seroprevalence varied substantially between cities, ranging from 26% (95%CI 23-29 %) in Medellín to 68% (95%CI 62-74 %) in Guapi. There were no differences in seroprevalence by sex, but seropositivity was higher in certain ethnic groups. There was substantial heterogeneity in seroprevalence within cities, driven to a large extent by a strong association between socioeconomic stratum and seropositivity.
INTERPRETATION: Colombia has been one of the Latin American countries most affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. This study documented very high attack rates in several Colombian cities by the end of 2020 and identified key drivers of heterogeneities including ethnicity and socioeconomic stratum. Few studies of seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 have been conducted in Latin America, and therefore this study contributes to the fundamental understanding of the pandemic in the region.

Trypanosomatids are traditionally divided into heteroxenous, characterized by the alternation of the life cycle between an insect vector and a plant or a vertebrate host, including humans being responsible for severe diseases; and monoxenous, which are presumably unique parasites of invertebrate hosts. Interestingly, studies reporting the occurrence of these monoxenous trypanosomatids in humans have been gradually increasing, either associated with Leishmania co-infection, or supposedly alone either in immunocompromised or even more sporadically in immunocompetent hosts. This review summarizes the first reports that raised the hypothesis that monoxenous trypanosomatids could be found in vertebrate hosts till the most current reports on the occurrence of Crithidia spp. alone in immunocompetent human patients.",We would like to thank all the members of our laboratories for helpful and stimulating discussions.

As future health professionals, medical students will be a relevant generating opinion group and will have an important role in the organ requesting process. The goals of this meta-analysis were to obtain polled rates of medical students who are in favor, against, or indecisive toward cadaveric organ donation in the studies conducted around the world, and to explore sociocultural variables influencing the willingness to donate. Electronic search and revision of references from previous literature allowed us to locate 57 studies fulfilling the inclusion criteria. Data extraction and risk of bias assessment were performed by two independent investigators. Pooled estimations were computed assuming a random-effects model. Despite the fact that willingness to donate was elevated in medical students, estimated rates in studies from different geographical areas and sociocultural backgrounds exhibited significant differences. The age and the grade of the students also influenced the rate of students in favor. Donation campaigns should take into account cultural factors, especially in countries where certain beliefs and values could hamper organ donation. Also, knowledge and skills related to organ donation and transplant should be acquired early in the medical curriculum when a negative attitude is less resistant to change.",,,Transplant International,,,"Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Humans; Organ Transplantation; Students, Medical; Surveys and Questionnaires; Tissue Donors; Tissue and Organ Procurement",2022-06-28,2022,2022-06-28,,35,,10446,All OA; Gold,Article,"Iniesta-Sepúlveda, Marina; López-Navas, Ana I.; Gutiérrez, Pedro R.; Ramírez, Pablo; Ríos, Antonio","Iniesta-Sepúlveda, Marina (Department of Psychology, Catholic University of Murcia, UCAM, Murcia, Spain); López-Navas, Ana I.

This systematic review updates information on the causative agents of VAP and resistance to antibiotics in COVID-19 patients. We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), PubMed/MEDLINE, and LILACS databases from December 2019 to December 2021. Studies that described the frequency of causative pathogens associated with VAP and their antibiotic resistance patterns in critically ill COVID-19 adult patients were included. The Newcastle-Ottawa Quality Assessment Scale was used for critical appraisal. The data are presented according to the number or proportions reported in the studies. A total of 25 articles were included, involving 2766 VAP cases in COVID-19 patients (range 5-550 VAP cases). Most of the studies included were carried out in France (32%), Italy (20%), Spain (12%) and the United States (8%). Gram-negative bacteria were the most frequent causative pathogens of VAP (range of incidences in studies: P. aeruginosa 7.5-72.5%, K. pneumoniae 6.9-43.7%, E. cloacae 1.6-20% and A. baumannii 1.2-20%). S. aureus was the most frequent Gram-positive pathogen, with a range of incidence of 3.3-57.9%. The median incidence of Aspergillus spp. was 6.4%. Few studies have recorded susceptibility patterns among Gram-negative causative pathogens and have mainly reported extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL), AmpC, and carbapenem resistance. The median frequency of methicillin resistance among S. aureus isolates was 44.4%. Our study provides the first comprehensive description of the causative agents and antibiotic resistance in COVID-19 patients with VAP. Gram-negative bacteria were the most common pathogens causing VAP. Data on antibiotic resistance patterns in the published medical literature are limited, as well as information about VAP from low- and middle-income countries.",,"CIBERINFEC (CB21/13/00009), Instituto de Salud Carlos III, Madrid, Spain.

During its infective cycle, S. Typhimurium is phagocytized by macrophages and proliferates inside a Salmonella-containing vacuole where Salmonella is exposed and survives oxidative stress induced by H2O2 through modulation of gene expression. After exposure of Salmonella to H2O2, the expression of the porin-encoding gene ompX increases, as previously shown by microarray analysis. Expression of ompX mRNA is regulated at a post-transcriptional level by MicA and CyaR sRNAs in aerobiosis. In addition, sequence analysis predicts a site for OxyS sRNA in ompX mRNA.ResultsIn this work we sought to evaluate the transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation of ompX under H2O2 stress. We demonstrate that ompX expression is induced at the transcriptional level in S. Typhimurium under such conditions. Unexpectedly, an increase in ompX gene transcript and promoter activity after challenges with H2O2 does not translate into increased protein levels in the wild-type strain, suggesting that ompX mRNA is also regulated at a post-transcriptional level, at least under oxidative stress. In silico gene sequence analysis predicted that sRNAs CyaR, MicA, and OxyS could regulate ompX mRNA levels. Using rifampicin to inhibit mRNA expression, we show that the sRNAs (MicA, CyaR and OxyS) and the sRNA:mRNA chaperone Hfq positively modulate ompX mRNA levels under H2O2-induced stress in Salmonella during the exponential growth phase in Lennox broth.ConclusionsOur results demonstrate that ompX mRNA is regulated in response to H2O2 by the sRNAs CyaR, MicA and OxyS is Salmonella Typhimurium.",We would like to thank Miguel Valvano and Linda Kenney for special contributions during manuscript revision.

Five new series of chalcone-sulfonamide hybrids (16-20)a-f were prepared via Claisen-Schmidt condensation of the newly obtained sulfonamides with aromatic aldehydes 15a-f in basic medium. Chalcones substituted with chlorine at position 4 of each series were used as precursors for the generation of their five-membered heterocyclic pyrazoline (22-23)a-d, (24-25)a-b and carbothioamide 27a-f derivatives. The synthesized compounds were evaluated for their anticancer and antituberculosis activities. To determine their anticancer activity, compounds were screened against sixty human cancer cell lines at a single dose (10 μM). Compounds 17a-c were highly active against LOX IMVI (melanoma), with IC50 values of 0.34, 0.73 and 0.54 μM, respectively. Chalcone 18e showed remarkable results against the entire panel of leukemia cell lines with IC50 values between 0.99-2.52 μM. Moreover, compounds 20e and 20f displayed growth inhibition of Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv at concentrations below 10 μM.

It affects 5% of the adult population in the world and is the leading cause of disability, with an annual cost of USD one trillion. In Spain, its prevalence is 13.4%, costing EUR 6000 million a year. Physical inactivity has been linked to an increase in depressive symptoms, with physical activity associated with an improvement in health-related quality of life. Objective: To calculate the odds ratio (OR) and relative risk (RR) of suffering from depression and taking antidepressants in the inactive Spanish population compared to groups with a higher level of physical activity. Method: 17,141 individuals aged 18−69 years residing in Spain and interviewed in the 2017 Spanish National Health Survey were included in this cross-sectional investigation. Results: Dependence relationships were found between the level of physical activity and the prevalence of depression and taking antidepressants (p < 0.001). We found elevated ORs and RRs for depression and antidepressant use in inactive people compared to those with a high/very high level of physical activity (Depression: OR: 4.32. CI95%: 3.35−5.57. RR: 1.59. 95% CI: 1.51−1.68; Antidepressants: OR: 4.95. CI95%: 3.59−6.82. RR: 1.61. CI95%: 1.52−1.71).

Quinolones are bactericidal antimicrobials extensively used in both human and animal medicine. Some of the quinolone-resistance mechanisms are encoded by different bacterial genes, whereas others are the result of mutations in the enzymes on which those antibiotics act. The worldwide occurrence of quinolone resistance genes in aquatic environments has been widely reported, particularly in areas impacted by urban discharges. The most commonly reported quinolone resistance gene, qnr, encodes for the Qnr proteins that protect DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV from quinolone activity. It is important to note that low-level resistance usually constitutes the first step in the development of high-level resistance, because bacteria carrying these genes have an adaptive advantage compared to the highly susceptible bacterial population in environments with low concentrations of this antimicrobial group. In addition, these genes can act additively with chromosomal mutations in the sequences of the target proteins of quinolones leading to high-level quinolone resistance. The occurrence of qnr genes in aquatic environments is most probably caused by the release of bacteria carrying these genes through anthropogenic pollution and maintained by the selective activity of antimicrobial residues discharged into these environments. This increase in the levels of quinolone resistance has consequences both in clinical settings and the wider aquatic environment, where there is an increased exposure risk to the general population, representing a significant threat to the efficacy of quinolone-based human and animal therapies. In this review the potential role of aquatic environments as reservoirs of the qnr genes, their activity in reducing the susceptibility to various quinolones, and the possible ways these genes contribute to the acquisition and spread of high-level resistance to quinolones will be discussed.",,"This research was funded by the Chilean National Research and Development Agency, (ANID), grant number 1211950.",Antibiotics,,Øivind Bergh,,2022-10-27,2022,2022-10-27,,11,11,1487,All OA; Gold,Article,"Miranda, Claudio D; Concha, Christopher; Godoy, Félix A; Lee, Matthew R","Miranda, Claudio D (Laboratorio de Patobiología Acuática, Departamento de Acuicultura, Universidad Católica del Norte, Coquimbo 1780000, Chile.); Concha, Christopher (Laboratorio de Patobiología Acuática, Departamento de Acuicultura, Universidad Católica del Norte, Coquimbo 1780000, Chile.); Godoy, Félix A (Centro i~mar, Universidad de Los Lagos, Puerto Montt 5480000, Chile.); Lee, Matthew R (Centro i~mar, Universidad de Los Lagos, Puerto Montt 5480000, Chile.)","Miranda, Claudio D (Catholic University of the North); Concha, Christopher (Catholic University of the North)","Miranda, Claudio D (Catholic University of the North); Concha, Christopher (Catholic University of the North); Godoy, Félix A (University of Los Lagos); Lee, Matthew R (University of Los Lagos)",9,9,1.99,4.1,https://www.mdpi.com/2079-6382/11/11/1487/pdf?version=1667398863,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1152272370,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3207 Medical Microbiology; 3211 Oncology and Carcinogenesis,

Therefore, we aimed to evaluate the best techniques for the removal of pharmaceuticals from municipal and hospital wastewater. For this, a non-experimental, descriptive, qualitative-quantitative design was used, corresponding to a systematic review without meta-analysis. Based on established inclusion and exclusion criteria, 31 open-access articles were selected from the Scopus, ProQuest, EBSCOhost, and ScienceDirect databases. The results showed that high concentrations of analgesics such as naproxen (1.37 mg/L) and antibiotics such as norfloxacin (0.561 mg/L) are frequently found in wastewater and that techniques such as reverse osmosis, ozonation, and activated sludge have the best removal efficiency, achieving values of 99%. It was concluded that reverse osmosis is one of the most efficient techniques for eliminating ofloxacin, sulfamethoxazole, carbamazepine, and diclofenac from municipal wastewater, with removal rates ranging from 96 to 99.9%, while for hospital wastewater the activated sludge technique proved to be efficient, eliminating analgesics and antibiotics in the range of 41-99%.",Not applicable.,This research received no external funding.,International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health,,"Hu Cheng, Hongjie Sheng, Jianming Xue","Wastewater; Sewage; Diclofenac; Naproxen; Norfloxacin; Water Pollutants, Chemical; Carbamazepine; Hospitals; Ozone; Sulfamethoxazole; Anti-Bacterial Agents; Ofloxacin; Pharmaceutical Preparations; Waste Disposal, Fluid",2022-10-12,2022,2022-10-12,,19,20,13105,All OA; Gold,Article,"Rodríguez-Serin, Henry; Gamez-Jara, Auria; De La Cruz-Noriega, Magaly; Rojas-Flores, Segundo; Rodriguez-Yupanqui, Magda; Cardenas, Moises Gallozzo; Cruz-Monzon, José","Rodríguez-Serin, Henry (Escuela de Ingeniería Ambiental, Facultad de Ingeniería, Universidad Cesar Vallejo, Trujillo 13007, Peru); Gamez-Jara, Auria (Escuela de Ingeniería Ambiental, Facultad de Ingeniería, Universidad Cesar Vallejo, Trujillo 13007, Peru); De La Cruz-Noriega, Magaly (Vicerrectorado de Investigación, Universidad Autónoma del Perú, Lima 15842, Peru); Rojas-Flores, Segundo (Departamento de Ciencias, Universidad Privada del Norte, Trujillo 13007, Peru); Rodriguez-Yupanqui, Magda (Escuela de Ingeniería Ambiental, Facultad de Ingeniería, Universidad Cesar Vallejo, Trujillo 13007, Peru); Cardenas, Moises Gallozzo (Universidad Tecnológica del Perú, Trujillo 13011, Peru); Cruz-Monzon, José (Facultad de Ingeniería Química, Universidad Nacional de Trujillo, Av.

The first section starts examining Émile Durkheim's classical conception on CE, and then, the integrative one proposed by the sociologist Randall Collins, leading to a multi-faceted experience of synchronization. Then, we analyze the construct as a process emerging in collective encounters when individuals contact with social ideal and values, referring to the classical work of Serge Moscovici as well as those more recent empirical approaches. Third, we consider CE as a set of intense positive emotions linked to processes of group identification, as proposed by authors of the Social Identity Theory tradition. Finally, we describe CE from the perspective of self-transcendence (e.g., emotions, experiences), and propose a unified description of this construct. The second section shows the results of a meta-analytical integration (k = 50, N = 182,738) aimed at analyzing CE's proximal effects or construct validity (i.e., Individual Emotions and Communal Sharing) as well as its association with more distal variables, such as Collective Emotions, Social Integration, Social Values and Beliefs and Empowerment. Results indicate that CE strongly associates with Individual Emotions -in particular, Self-Transcendent Emotions- and Communal Sharing constructs (e.g., Group Identity, Fusion of Identity), providing construct validity. Among the distal effects of CE, it is associated with Collective Positive Emotions, long-term Social Integration (e.g., Ingroup Commitment), Social Values and Beliefs and Empowerment-related variables (e.g., Wellbeing, Collective Efficacy, Collective Self-Esteem). Among the moderation analyses carried out (e.g., study design, CE scale, type of collective gathering), the effects of CE in demonstrations are noticeable, where this variable is a factor that favors other variables that make collective action possible, such as Group Identity (r pooled = 0.52), Collective Efficacy (r pooled = 0.37), Negative and Self-Transcendent Emotions (r pooled = 0.14 and 0.58), and Morality-related beliefs (r pooled = 0.43).","We would like to express our sincere thanks to all the people who have made this work possible, to members of the Culture, Cognition and Emotion group (University of the Basque Country UPV/EHU), and the valuable criticisms and comments received from the Kama Muta Lab and participants of the ISPP 2021 conference on an early version of this article.","This research was supported by grants given to the research team Culture, Cognition and Emotion (Psicología Social CCE), the Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness ([Ref.: PSI2017-84145-P and Ref.: PID2020-115738GB-I00), the Basque Government (Ref.: GIC12/91 IT-666-13, IT1187-19, and IT1598-22]), and a post-doc grant from the UPV/EHU to JP (DOCBERRI 20/23).",Frontiers in Psychology,,,,2022-08-31,2022,2022-08-31,,13,,974683,All OA; Gold,Article,"Pizarro, José J.; Zumeta, Larraitz N.; Bouchat, Pierre; Włodarczyk, Anna; Rimé, Bernard; Basabe, Nekane; Amutio, Alberto; Páez, Darío","Pizarro, José J.

A Prospective Exploratory Study in 13 Countries,"Conspiracy theories about COVID-19 began to emerge immediately after the first news about the disease and threaten to prolong the negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic by limiting people's willingness of receiving a life-saving vaccine. In this context, this study aimed to explore the variation of conspiracy beliefs regarding COVID-19 and the vaccine against it in 5779 people living in 13 Latin American countries (Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, Colombia, Cuba, Ecuador, El Salvador, Guatemala, Mexico, Paraguay, Peru, Uruguay and Venezuela) according to sociodemographic variables such as gender, age, educational level and source of information about COVID-19. The study was conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic between September 15 and October 25, 2021. The Spanish-language COVID-19 Vaccine Conspiracy Beliefs Scale (ECCV-COVID) and a sociodemographic survey were used. The results indicate that, in most countries, women, people with a lower educational level and those who receive information about the vaccine and COVID-19 from family/friends are more supportive of conspiracy ideas regarding the COVID-19 vaccine. In the case of age, the results vary by country. The analysis of the responses to each of the questions of the ECCV-COVID reveals that, in general, the countries evaluated are mostly in some degree of disagreement or indecision regarding conspiratorial beliefs about COVID-19 vaccines. The findings could help open further study which could support prevention and treatment efforts during the COVID-19 pandemic.","The authors would like to thank the respondents, who kindly participated in this research.",This research was funded by COVID-19 crisis seed grant from Universidad Privada del Norte to TC-R.,Frontiers in Psychology,,,,2022-05-06,2022,2022-05-06,,13,,855713,All OA; Gold,Article,"Caycho-Rodríguez, Tomás; Ventura-León, José; Valencia, Pablo D.; Vilca, Lindsey W.; Carbajal-León, Carlos; Reyes-Bossio, Mario; White, Michael; Rojas-Jara, Claudio; Polanco-Carrasco, Roberto; Gallegos, Miguel; Cervigni, Mauricio; Martino, Pablo; Palacios, Diego Alejandro; Moreta-Herrera, Rodrigo; Samaniego-Pinho, Antonio; Rivera, Marlon Elías Lobos; Figares, Andrés Buschiazzo; Puerta-Cortés, Diana Ximena; Corrales-Reyes, Ibraín Enrique; Calderón, Raymundo; Tapia, Bismarck Pinto; Gallegos, Walter L.

The new skills focus for university teaching grants a central role to critical thinking in new study plans; however, using these skills well requires a certain degree of conscientiousness and its regulation. Metacognition therefore plays a crucial role in developing critical thinking and consists of a person being aware of their own thinking processes in order to improve them for better knowledge acquisition. Critical thinking depends on these metacognitive mechanisms functioning well, being conscious of the processes, actions, and emotions in play, and thereby having the chance to understand what has not been done well and correcting it. Even when there is evidence of the relation between metacognitive processes and critical thinking, there are still few initiatives which seek to clarify which process determines which other one, or whether there is interdependence between both. What we present in this study is therefore an intervention proposal to develop critical thinking and meta knowledge skills. In this context, Problem-Based Learning is a useful tool to develop these skills in higher education. The ARDESOS-DIAPROVE program seeks to foment critical thinking via metacognition and Problem-Based Learning methodology. It is known that learning quality improves when students apply metacognition; it is also known that effective problem-solving depends not only on critical thinking, but also on the skill of realization, and of cognitive and non-cognitive regulation. The study presented hereinafter therefore has the fundamental objective of showing whether instruction in critical thinking (ARDESOS-DIAPROVE) influences students' metacognitive processes. One consequence of this is that critical thinking improves with the use of metacognition. The sample was comprised of first-year psychology students at Public University of the North of Spain who were undergoing the aforementioned program; PENCRISAL was used to evaluate critical thinking skills and the Metacognitive Activities Inventory (MAI) for evaluating metacognition. We expected an increase in critical thinking scores and metacognition following this intervention. As a conclusion, we indicate actions to incentivize metacognitive work among participants, both individually via reflective questions and decision diagrams, and at the interactional level with dialogues and reflective debates which strengthen critical thinking.",,This study was partly financed by the Project FONDECYT no. 11220056 ANID-Chile.,Frontiers in Psychology,,,,2022-06-15,2022,2022-06-15,,13,,913219,All OA; Gold,Article,"Rivas, Silvia F.; Saiz, Carlos; Ossa, Carlos","Rivas, Silvia F.

Methods: A descriptive, retrospective, cross-sectional, and bibliometric study was carried out. The Scopus database was used as a source to evaluate the worldwide scientific production on intestinal microbiota and its relationship with Parkinson's disease. Data were extracted from Scopus using a formula developed with thesaurus terms MeSH (Medline) and Emtree (Embase).
Results: A total of 591 documents were found. The retrieved manuscripts received an average of 41.9 citations per document. Four of the 10 most productive authors were Italian. The University of Helsinki (Finland) was the institution with the highest scientific production (19 papers) and the highest impact (5921 citations). In terms of productivity and impact, Movement Disorders ranked first with 38 papers and 2782 citations, and those papers published in Q1 quartile journals exceeded the sum of the remaining quartiles. Papers with international collaboration were the most cited. Keyword analysis showed that the terms Parkinson Disease, Disease, and Intestine Flora were the most frequent.
Conclusion: The number of papers on Parkinson's disease and gut microbiota has been increasing; however, high-quality journals maintain the same high publication rate. International collaboration from high-income countries played an important role in the impact generated by the publications.",,,BioMed Research International,,Gessica Sala,Bibliometrics; Cross-Sectional Studies; Gastrointestinal Microbiome; Humans; Parkinson Disease; Retrospective Studies,2022-06-27,2022,2022-06-27,2022-06-27,2022,,4144781,All OA; Gold,Article,"Cabanillas-Lazo, Miguel; Quispe-Vicuña, Carlos; Barja-Ore, John; Fernandez-Giusti, Alicia; Munive-Degregori, Arnaldo; Retamozo-Siancas, Yesenia; Guerrero, Maria Eugenia; Mayta-Tovalino, Frank","Cabanillas-Lazo, Miguel (Sociedad Científica San Fernando, Universidad Nacional Mayor de San Marcos, Lima, Peru, unmsm.edu.pe; Grupo Peruano de Investigación Epidemiológica, Unidad para la Generación y Síntesis de Evidencias en Salud, Universidad San Ignacio de Loyola, Lima, Peru); Quispe-Vicuña, Carlos (Sociedad Científica San Fernando, Universidad Nacional Mayor de San Marcos, Lima, Peru, unmsm.edu.pe; Grupo Peruano de Investigación Epidemiológica, Unidad para la Generación y Síntesis de Evidencias en Salud, Universidad San Ignacio de Loyola, Lima, Peru); Barja-Ore, John (Dirección de Investigación, Universidad Privada del Norte, Lima, Peru); Fernandez-Giusti, Alicia (Postgradute Department, Faculty of Medicine, Universidad Nacional Mayor de San Marcos, Lima, Peru, unmsm.edu.pe); Munive-Degregori, Arnaldo (Master’s Program in Library and Information Sciences, Faculty of Letters and Human Sciences, Universidad Nacional Mayor de San Marcos, Lima, Peru, unmsm.edu.pe); Retamozo-Siancas, Yesenia (Postgradute Department, Faculty of Medicine, Universidad Nacional Mayor de San Marcos, Lima, Peru, unmsm.edu.pe); Guerrero, Maria Eugenia (Academic Department of Medical and Surgical Stomatology, Universidad Nacional Mayor de San Marcos, Lima, Peru, unmsm.edu.pe); Mayta-Tovalino, Frank (Vicerrectorado de Investigación, Universidad San Ignacio de Loyola, Lima, Peru)","Mayta-Tovalino, Frank (Universidad San Ignacio de Loyola)","Cabanillas-Lazo, Miguel (National University of San Marcos; Universidad San Ignacio de Loyola); Quispe-Vicuña, Carlos (National University of San Marcos; Universidad San Ignacio de Loyola); Barja-Ore, John (Private University of the North); Fernandez-Giusti, Alicia (National University of San Marcos); Munive-Degregori, Arnaldo (National University of San Marcos); Retamozo-Siancas, Yesenia (National University of San Marcos); Guerrero, Maria Eugenia (National University of San Marcos); Mayta-Tovalino, Frank (Universidad San Ignacio de Loyola)",16,14,1.95,22.35,https://downloads.hindawi.com/journals/bmri/2022/4144781.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1149199349,46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4610 Library and Information Studies,

It generates significant computational consumption, reducing the computational efficiency of the victim's computer. This attack has increased due to the rise of cryptocurrencies and their profitability and its difficult detection by the user. The identification and blocking of this type of malware have become an aspect of research related to cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology; in the literature, some machine learning and deep learning techniques are presented, but they are still susceptible to improvement. In this work, we explore multiple Machine Learning classification models for detecting cryptojacking on websites, such as Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting Classifier, k-Nearest Neighbor, and XGBoost. To this end, we make use of a dataset, composed of network and host features' samples, to which we apply various feature selection methods such as those based on statistical methods, e.g., Test Anova, and other methods as Wrappers, not only to reduce the complexity of the built models but also to discover the features with the greatest predictive power. Our results suggest that simple models such as Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and k-Nearest Neighbor models, can achieve success rate similar to or greater than that of advanced algorithms such as XGBoost and even those of other works based on Deep Learning.",,This work was carried out with the support of the program “Convocatoria 779 de 2017- Doctorado Nacional Convocatoria para la Formación de Capital Humano de Alto Nivel para el Departamento de Boyacá–2017” and the Universidad del Norte.,Sensors,,"Nima Karimian, Hossein Sayadi",Machine Learning; Algorithms; Logistic Models,2022-11-27,2022,2022-11-27,,22,23,9219,All OA; Gold,Article,"Aponte-Novoa, Fredy Andrés; Álvarez, Daniel Povedano; Villanueva-Polanco, Ricardo; Orozco, Ana Lucila Sandoval; Villalba, Luis Javier García","Aponte-Novoa, Fredy Andrés (Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla 081007, Colombia; Department of Systems Engineering, Universidad Santo Tomás, Tunja 150003, Colombia); Álvarez, Daniel Povedano (Group of Analysis, Security and Systems (GASS), Department of Software Engineering and Artificial Intelligence (DISIA), Faculty of Computer Science and Engineering, Office 431, Universidad Complutense de Madrid (UCM), Calle Profesor José García Santesmases 9, Ciudad Universitaria, 28040 Madrid, Spain); Villanueva-Polanco, Ricardo (Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla 081007, Colombia); Orozco, Ana Lucila Sandoval (Group of Analysis, Security and Systems (GASS), Department of Software Engineering and Artificial Intelligence (DISIA), Faculty of Computer Science and Engineering, Office 431, Universidad Complutense de Madrid (UCM), Calle Profesor José García Santesmases 9, Ciudad Universitaria, 28040 Madrid, Spain); Villalba, Luis Javier García (Group of Analysis, Security and Systems (GASS), Department of Software Engineering and Artificial Intelligence (DISIA), Faculty of Computer Science and Engineering, Office 431, Universidad Complutense de Madrid (UCM), Calle Profesor José García Santesmases 9, Ciudad Universitaria, 28040 Madrid, Spain)","Aponte-Novoa, Fredy Andrés (Universidad del Norte; Universidad Santo Tomás)","Aponte-Novoa, Fredy Andrés (Universidad del Norte; Universidad Santo Tomás); Álvarez, Daniel Povedano (Complutense University of Madrid); Villanueva-Polanco, Ricardo (Universidad del Norte); Orozco, Ana Lucila Sandoval (Complutense University of Madrid); Villalba, Luis Javier García (Complutense University of Madrid)",4,4,1.88,2.24,https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/22/23/9219/pdf?version=1669945926,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1153190941,46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4611 Machine Learning,

The vicuña (Vicugna vicugna) is a medium-sized South American wild camelid inhabiting Andean ecosystems, where several populations are live-sheared by Andean peasant communities as a way of providing an economic income to the people while promoting vicuña conservation. Institutions and scientists have shown concern for the impact and extent of sarcoptic mange in several vicuña populations across their range, as well as the lack of consistent knowledge about this disease in the species. Here, we perform a review about sarcoptic mange distribution throughout the vicuña's native range, evidence of effects of age and sex, the modes of transmission and the veterinary treatments employed. The review retrieved a few scientific papers, but found several reports and academic studies mostly considered as 'grey literature'. Mange was recorded across the entire native vicuña range (Argentina, Bolivia, Chile and Peru). Mange prevalence varied across vicuña studies (up to 60% prevalence in some populations) and severely affected a number of populations, being an important source of mortality. Mange was reported as more frequent in adults than in offspring. The modes of mange transmission remain unclear, although direct transmission between infected and healthy animals seems to be the most likely, including the transmission between domestic camelids and vicuñas. Regarding the treatments employed, ivermectin was the most frequently used. We further identified several gaps in knowledge and point to future research lines, which seek to promote both species conservation and the maintenance of live-shearing vicuñas under sustainable approaches in low-income Andean peasant communities.","ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS We would like to thank J.

Of 74,270 papers found on 13 search engines between 12 August 2020, and 2 November 2021, we identified six studies (n = 1392 and 1097 were women). We found several results on the perception of both variables during the pandemic. First, physical activity tended to decrease or have negative changes, either because they dedicated less time to it, decreased the type of intensity or because they dedicated more time to sedentary activities. In addition, women were more physically active than men, since men perceived a decrease in their levels of physical activity. Secondly, there were also slight changes in the perception of body image; several students perceived that they gained weight and others had an increase in their BMI. It is even noted that those who were physically active or who were older in the population studied had a better perception of their actual physical condition. Similarly, we found that a concern for body image and even negative changes in the perception of appearance during confinement were reported. In conclusion, we found changes in the perception of physical activity and body image in college students during the COVID-19 pandemic.",The authors acknowledge the support of the Nesh Hubbs Qualitative Unit team.,This research received no external funding.,International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health,,Paul B.

In relation to chemotherapy treatment, the most used drug is 5-fluorouracil (5-FU); however, the use of this drug generates various toxic effects at the systemic level. For this reason, new therapeutic strategies are currently being sought that can be used as neoadjuvant or adjuvant treatments. Recent research has shown that natural compounds, such as genistein, have chemotherapeutic and anticancer effects, but the mechanisms of action of genistein and its molecular targets in human colon cells have not been fully elucidated. The results reported in relation to non-malignant cell lines are also unclear, which does not allow evidence of the selectivity that this compound may have. Therefore, in this work, genistein was evaluated in vitro in both cancer cell lines SW480 and SW620 and in the non-malignant cell line HaCaT. The results obtained show that genistein has selectivity for the SW480 and SW620 cell lines. In addition, it inhibits cell viability and has an antiproliferative effect in a dose-dependent manner. Increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) was also found, suggesting an association with the cell death process through various mechanisms. Finally, the encapsulation strategy that was proposed made it possible to demonstrate that bacterial nanocellulose (BNC) is capable of protecting genistein from the acidic conditions of gastric fluid and also allows the release of the compound in the colonic fluid. This would allow genistein to act locally in the mucosa of the colon where the first stages of CRC occur.","The authors thank Universidad Pontificia Bolivariana, MINCIENCIAS, MINEDUCACIÓN, MINCIT, ICETEX and Corporación para Investigaciones Biológicas for their support.","This research was funded by the Ministry of Sciences MINCIENCIAS, Ministry of Education MINEDUCATION, Ministry of Commerce, Industry and Tourism MINCIT and Colombian Institute of Educational Credit and Technical Studies Abroad ICETEX, through the Scientific Ecosystem component of the Colombia Científica Program (NanoBioCáncer alliance Cod FP44842-211-201-2018, project numbers 58478 and 58674).",Molecules,,Alejandro Baeza,"Humans; Genistein; Reactive Oxygen Species; Cell Line, Tumor; Fluorouracil; Colorectal Neoplasms; Apoptosis",2022-10-19,2022,2022-10-19,,27,20,7042,All OA; Gold,Article,"Rendón, Juan Pablo; Cañas, Ana Isabel; Correa, Elizabeth; Bedoya-Betancur, Vanesa; Osorio, Marlon; Castro, Cristina; Naranjo, Tonny W","Rendón, Juan Pablo (Medical and Experimental Mycology Group, CIB-UPB-UdeA-UDES, Corporación para Investigaciones Biológicas, Carrera 72 A # 78B-141, Medellin 050034, Colombia.); Cañas, Ana Isabel (School of Engineering, Universidad Pontificia Bolivariana, Circular 1 # 70-01, Medellin 050031, Colombia.); Correa, Elizabeth (Medical and Experimental Mycology Group, CIB-UPB-UdeA-UDES, Corporación para Investigaciones Biológicas, Carrera 72 A # 78B-141, Medellin 050034, Colombia.); Bedoya-Betancur, Vanesa (Medical and Experimental Mycology Group, CIB-UPB-UdeA-UDES, Corporación para Investigaciones Biológicas, Carrera 72 A # 78B-141, Medellin 050034, Colombia.); Osorio, Marlon (School of Engineering, Universidad Pontificia Bolivariana, Circular 1 # 70-01, Medellin 050031, Colombia.); Castro, Cristina (School of Engineering, Universidad Pontificia Bolivariana, Circular 1 # 70-01, Medellin 050031, Colombia.); Naranjo, Tonny W (Medical and Experimental Mycology Group, CIB-UPB-UdeA-UDES, Corporación para Investigaciones Biológicas, Carrera 72 A # 78B-141, Medellin 050034, Colombia.; School of Health Sciences, Universidad Pontificia Bolivariana, Calle 78 B # 72 A-109, Medellin 050034, Colombia.)","Rendón, Juan Pablo (Corporación para Investigaciones Biológicas); Naranjo, Tonny W (Corporación para Investigaciones Biológicas; Pontifical Bolivarian University)","Rendón, Juan Pablo (Corporación para Investigaciones Biológicas); Cañas, Ana Isabel (Pontifical Bolivarian University); Correa, Elizabeth (Corporación para Investigaciones Biológicas); Bedoya-Betancur, Vanesa (Corporación para Investigaciones Biológicas); Osorio, Marlon (Pontifical Bolivarian University); Castro, Cristina (Pontifical Bolivarian University); Naranjo, Tonny W (Corporación para Investigaciones Biológicas; Pontifical Bolivarian University)",12,12,1.82,3.15,https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/27/20/7042/pdf?version=1666576725,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1152069478,34 Chemical Sciences; 3404 Medicinal and Biomolecular Chemistry; 3405 Organic Chemistry,

For this reason, the aim of the study was to determine the mediating role of moral disengagement in the relationship between the dark triad and face mask wearing during the second wave of the pandemic. We worked with a sample made up of 534 adults, who were administered the Dirty Dozen Dark test, the Moral Disengagement Mechanisms Scale and a questionnaire on the frequency of use of face masks. The results showed that moral disengagement mediates the effect of each trait of the dark triad (Machiavellianism, psychopathy and narcissism) on the use of face masks. It is concluded that those who possess any of the dark personality traits morally disengage in order not to use a face mask, exercising a reckless behavior of the possible contagion of COVID-19 to others.",The authors would like to thank Oscar Carrillo-Verástegui for translating the manuscript from Spanish into English.,This research received no external funding.,European Journal of Investigation in Health Psychology and Education,,"Iván Herrera-Peco, Carlos Ruiz-Nuñez, África Martos Martínez",,2022-09-02,2022,2022-09-02,,12,9,1300-1310,All OA; Gold,Article,"Chávez-Ventura, Gina; Santa-Cruz-Espinoza, Henry; Domínguez-Vergara, Julio; Negreiros-Mora, Nancy","Chávez-Ventura, Gina (Institute for Research in Science and Technology, Universidad César Vallejo, Trujillo 13009, Peru); Santa-Cruz-Espinoza, Henry (Professional School of Psychology, Universidad Autónoma del Perú, Lima 15842, Peru); Domínguez-Vergara, Julio (Research Direction, Universidad Tecnológica del Perú, Lima 15046, Peru); Negreiros-Mora, Nancy (Professional Career of Psychology, Universidad Privada del Norte, Lima 15314, Peru)","Chávez-Ventura, Gina (Universidad César Vallejo)","Chávez-Ventura, Gina (Universidad César Vallejo); Santa-Cruz-Espinoza, Henry (Universidad Autónoma del Perú); Domínguez-Vergara, Julio (Universidad Tecnológica del Perú); Negreiros-Mora, Nancy (Private University of the North)",10,10,1.8,5.21,https://www.mdpi.com/2254-9625/12/9/90/pdf?version=1662445381,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1150809205,52 Psychology; 5205 Social and Personality Psychology,

There is no disease control program and no official therapeutic protocol. This situation contributes to an unknown disease prevalence and unmet needs of people disabled by this disease who seek access to treatment. This review provides an update on the subject with an emphasis on therapeutic advances in humans. All relevant studies that addressed epidemiology, diagnosis, or therapeutics of lobomycosis were considered. Seventy-one articles published between 1931 and 2021 were included for a narrative literature review on the epidemiology and quest for a cure. An effective therapy for lobomycosis has been found following decades of research led by the State Dermatology Program of Acre in the Amazon rainforest, where the largest number of cases occur. This discovery opened new avenues for future studies. The main recommendations here, addressed to the Brazilian Ministry of Health, are for lobomycosis to become a reportable disease to ensure that disease prevalence is measured, and that it be prioritized such that affected individuals may access treatment free-of-charge.",,This work was supported by Brazilian National Council for Scientific and Technological Development [CNPq grant 307432/2019-0 to GZL].,Journal of Fungi,,"Alessandro C.

Until now, the microbial communities that inhabit or have inhabited soils of hyperarid environments at greater depths have been poorly studied. We analyzed for the first time the variation in microbial communities down to a depth of 3.4 m in one of the driest places of the world, the hyperarid Yungay region in the Atacama Desert, and we related it to changes in soil physico-chemical characteristics. We found that the moisture content changed from 2 to 11% with depth and enabled the differentiation of three depth intervals: (i) surface zone A (0-60 cm), (ii) intermediate zone B (60-220 cm), and (iii) deep zone C (220-340 cm). Each zone showed further specific physicochemical and mineralogical features. Likewise, some bacterial phyla were unique in each zone, i.e., members of the taxa Deinococcota, Halobacterota, and Latescibacterota in zone A; Crenarchaeota, Fusobacteriota, and Deltaproteobacterium Sva0485 in zone B; and Fervidibacteria and Campilobacterota in zone C, which indicates taxon-specific preferences in deep soil habitats. Differences in the microbiota between the zones were rather abrupt, which is concomitant with abrupt changes in the physical-chemical parameters. Overall, moisture content, total carbon (TC), pH, and electric conductivity (EC) were most predictive of microbial richness and diversity, while total sulfur (TS) and total phosphorous (TP) contents were additionally predictive of community composition. We also found statistically significant associations between taxa and soil properties, most of which involved moisture and TC contents. Our findings show that under-explored habitats for microbial survival and existence may prevail at greater soil depths near water or within water-bearing layers, a valuable substantiation also for the ongoing search for biosignatures on other planets, such as Mars.",We want to thank the technician team at beamline 8 of the SLRI for assistance during the P XANES measurements.,,Frontiers in Microbiology,,,,2022-02-07,2022,2022-02-07,,12,,794743,All OA; Gold,Article,"Fuentes, Bárbara; Choque, Alessandra; Gómez, Francisco; Alarcón, Jaime; Castro-Nallar, Eduardo; Arenas, Franko; Contreras, Daniel; Mörchen, Ramona; Amelung, Wulf; Knief, Claudia; Moradi, Ghazal; Klumpp, Erwin; Saavedra, Claudia P.; Prietzel, Jörg; Klysubun, Wantana; Remonsellez, Francisco; Bol, Roland","Fuentes, Bárbara (Departamento de Ingeniería Química, Universidad Católica del Norte, Antofagasta, Chile); Choque, Alessandra (Departamento de Ingeniería Química, Universidad Católica del Norte, Antofagasta, Chile; Programa de Doctorado en Ciencias Mención Geología, Universidad Católica del Norte, Antofagasta, Chile); Gómez, Francisco (Departamento de Ingeniería Química, Universidad Católica del Norte, Antofagasta, Chile); Alarcón, Jaime (Center for Bioinformatics and Integrative Biology, Universidad Andres Bello, Santiago, Chile); Castro-Nallar, Eduardo (Center for Bioinformatics and Integrative Biology, Universidad Andres Bello, Santiago, Chile); Arenas, Franko (Programa de Doctorado en Ciencias Mención Geología, Universidad Católica del Norte, Antofagasta, Chile); Contreras, Daniel (Programa de Doctorado en Ciencias Mención Geología, Universidad Católica del Norte, Antofagasta, Chile); Mörchen, Ramona (Institute of Crop Science and Resource Conservation, Soil Science and Soil Ecology, University of Bonn, Bonn, Germany); Amelung, Wulf (Institute of Crop Science and Resource Conservation, Soil Science and Soil Ecology, University of Bonn, Bonn, Germany); Knief, Claudia (Institute of Crop Science and Resource Conservation, Molecular Biology of the Rhizosphere, University of Bonn, Bonn, Germany); Moradi, Ghazal (Institute of Bio and Geosciences, Agrosphere (IBG-3), Forschungszentrum Jülich GmbH, Jülich, Germany); Klumpp, Erwin (Institute of Bio and Geosciences, Agrosphere (IBG-3), Forschungszentrum Jülich GmbH, Jülich, Germany); Saavedra, Claudia P.

Quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) studies were performed using quinolinone and thiosemicarbazide as pharmacophoric nuclei; the best model showed statistical parameters of R2 = 0.83; F = 47.96; s = 0.31, and was validated by several different methods. The van der Waals volume, electron density, and electronegativity model results suggested a pivotal role in antituberculosis (anti-TB) activity. Subsequently, from this model a new series of quinolinone-thiosemicarbazone 11a-e was designed and docked against two tuberculosis protein targets: enoyl-acyl carrier protein reductase (InhA) and decaprenylphosphoryl-β-D-ribose-2'-oxidase (DprE1). Molecular dynamics simulation over 200 ns showed a binding energy of -71.3 to -12.7 Kcal/mol, suggesting likely inhibition. In vitro antimycobacterial activity of quinolinone-thiosemicarbazone for 11a-e was evaluated against M. bovis, M. tuberculosis H37Rv, and six different strains of drug-resistant M. tuberculosis. All compounds exhibited good to excellent activity against all the families of M. tuberculosis. Several of the here synthesized compounds were more effective than the standard drugs (isoniazid, oxafloxacin), 11d and 11e being the most active products. The results suggest that these compounds may contribute as lead compounds in the research of new potential antimycobacterial agents.","The authors thank Universidad del Norte, Instituto Nacional de Salud, Bogotá 111321, Universidad del Valle and MINCIENCIAS-Project Number: 201477758055 (contract.

The first part of this review summarizes some studies, mostly at the preclinical level, on the mechanisms by which phenolic compounds act in the human organism, taking advantage of their antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antitumor, antithrombotic, antiatherogenic, antimicrobial, antiviral, and other activities. Although the migration of grape components into the must/wine occurs during the winemaking process, the application of new technologies may contribute to increasing the content of phenolic compounds in the finished wine. Some of these technologies have been evaluated on an industrial scale, and in some cases, they have been included in the International Code of Oenological Practice by the International Organization of Vine and Wine (OIV). In this sense, the second part of this review deals with the use of these novel technologies that can increase, or at least maintain, the polyphenol content. For example, in the pre-fermentative stage, phenolic extraction can be increased by treating the berries or must with high pressures, pulsed electric fields (PEF), ultrasound (US), e-beam radiation or ozone. At fermentative level, yeasts with high production of pyranoanthocyanins and/or their precursor molecules, low polyphenol absorption, and low anthocyanin-β-glucosidase activity can be used. Whereas, at the post-fermentative level, aging-on-lees (AOL) can contribute to maintaining polyphenol levels, and therefore transmitting health benefits to the consumer.",,,Frontiers in Nutrition,,,,2022-05-25,2022,2022-05-25,,9,,890066,All OA; Gold,Article,"Vejarano, Ricardo; Luján-Corro, Mariano","Vejarano, Ricardo (Department of Research, Innovation and Social Responsibility, Universidad Privada del Norte (UPN), Trujillo, Peru); Luján-Corro, Mariano (School of Agroindustrial Engineering, Universidad Nacional de Trujillo (UNT), Trujillo, Peru)","Vejarano, Ricardo (Private University of the North)","Vejarano, Ricardo (Private University of the North); Luján-Corro, Mariano (National University of Trujillo)",12,10,1.67,5.54,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnut.2022.890066/pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1148149096,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3210 Nutrition and Dietetics,

Negative pulsed-pressure myofascial vacuum therapy (vacuum treatment (VT)) devices mobilize tissue according to previously programmed parameters of force, time and frequency. The purpose of this study was to compare the effects of VT combined with core therapeutic exercise versus a physical therapy program (PTP) based only on core therapeutic exercise. Fifty participants with chronic non-specific low back pain were randomly assigned to two treatment groups, the VT group (n = 25) or the PTP group (n = 25). Pain, pressure-pain threshold, range of motion, functionality and quality of life were measured before treatment, at the end of treatment, and at one-month and three-month follow-ups. Both groups received 15 therapy sessions over 5 weeks. Statistically significant differences in favor of the VT group were shown in the results. In conclusion, the intervention based on myofascial vacuum therapy improved pain, mobility, pressure pain threshold, functionality and quality of life.",,This research received no external funding.,Journal of Clinical Medicine,,Marco Alessandro Minetto,,2022-04-02,2022,2022-04-02,,11,7,1984,All OA; Gold,Article,"Rodríguez-Huguet, Manuel; Góngora-Rodríguez, Jorge; Vinolo-Gil, Maria Jesus; Martín-Vega, Francisco Javier; Martín-Valero, Rocío; Rodríguez-Almagro, Daniel","Rodríguez-Huguet, Manuel (Department of Nursing and Physiotherapy, University of Cádiz, 11009 Cádiz, Spain;, mariajesus.vinolo@uca.es, (M.J.V.-G.);, javier.martin@uca.es, (F.J.M.-V.); Clinical Management Unit Rehabilitation, University Hospital of Puerta del Mar, 11009 Cádiz, Spain); Góngora-Rodríguez, Jorge (Policlínica Santa María Clinic, 11008 Cádiz, Spain;, jorgem.gongora@gmail.com, or; University School of Osuna, University of Sevilla, 41640 Osuna, Spain); Vinolo-Gil, Maria Jesus (Department of Nursing and Physiotherapy, University of Cádiz, 11009 Cádiz, Spain;, mariajesus.vinolo@uca.es, (M.J.V.-G.);, javier.martin@uca.es, (F.J.M.-V.); Clinical Management Unit Rehabilitation, University Hospital of Puerta del Mar, 11009 Cádiz, Spain); Martín-Vega, Francisco Javier (Department of Nursing and Physiotherapy, University of Cádiz, 11009 Cádiz, Spain;, mariajesus.vinolo@uca.es, (M.J.V.-G.);, javier.martin@uca.es, (F.J.M.-V.)); Martín-Valero, Rocío (Department of Physiotherapy, Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Málaga, 29071 Málaga, Spain;, rovalemas@uma.es); Rodríguez-Almagro, Daniel (Department of Nursing, Physiotherapy and Medicine, University of Almería, 04120 Almería, Spain;, dra243@ual.es)","Rodríguez-Huguet, Manuel (University of Cádiz; Hospital Universitario Puerta del Mar)","Rodríguez-Huguet, Manuel (University of Cádiz; Hospital Universitario Puerta del Mar); Góngora-Rodríguez, Jorge (Policlínica Santa María Clinic, 11008 Cádiz, Spain;, jorgem.gongora@gmail.com, or; University of Seville); Vinolo-Gil, Maria Jesus (University of Cádiz; Hospital Universitario Puerta del Mar); Martín-Vega, Francisco Javier (University of Cádiz); Martín-Valero, Rocío (University of Malaga); Rodríguez-Almagro, Daniel (University of Almería)",5,4,1.66,3.47,https://www.mdpi.com/2077-0383/11/7/1984/pdf?version=1648879276,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1146850649,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3202 Clinical Sciences,

They also provide information on the uneven impact of the pandemic, pointing out vulnerable groups to prioritize which is particularly relevant in unequal societies. However, due to their high cost, they provide limited evidence of spatial spread of the pandemic specially in unequal societies. Our objective was to estimate the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in Chile and model its spatial risk distribution.MethodsDuring Oct–Nov 2020, we conducted a population-based serosurvey in Santiago, Talca, and Coquimbo–La Serena (2493 individuals). We explored the individual association between positive results and socio-economic and health-related variables by logistic regression for complex surveys. Then, using an Empirical Bayesian Kriging model, we estimated the infection risk spatial distribution using individual and census information, and compared these results with official records.ResultsSeroprevalence was 10.4% (95% CI 7.8–13.7%), ranging from 2% (Talca) to 11% (Santiago), almost three times the number officially reported. Approximately 36% of these were asymptomatic, reaching 82% below 15 years old. Seroprevalence was associated with the city of residence, previous COVID-19 diagnosis, contact with confirmed cases (especially at household), and foreign nationality. The spatial model accurately interpolated the distribution of disease risk within the cities finding significant differences in the predicted probabilities of SARS-CoV-2 infection by census zone (IQR 2.5–15.0%), related to population density and education.ConclusionsOur results underscore the transmission heterogeneity of SARS-CoV-2 within and across three urban centers of Chile. Socio-economic factors and the outcomes of this seroprevalence study enable us to identify priority areas for intervention. Our methodological approach and results can help guide the design of interdisciplinary strategies for urban contexts, not only for SARS-CoV-2 but also for other communicable diseases.","The study team acknowledges the support of the participants who opened their doors to this survey–also, the revision and thoughtful comments made by Drs.

The research objective was to evaluate the accuracy of the Serion IgM ELISA EST125M against the Microscopic Agglutination Test (MAT = imperfect reference test); to assess its ability to diagnose acute leptospirosis infections and to detect previous exposure to leptospires in an endemic setting. In addition, to estimate the overall Leptospira spp. seroprevalence in the Wiwa indigenous population in North-East Colombia. We analysed serum samples from confirmed leptospirosis patients from the Netherlands (N = 14), blood donor sera from Switzerland (N = 20), and sera from a cross-sectional study in Colombia (N = 321). All leptospirosis ELISA-positive, and a random of negative samples from Colombia were tested by the MAT for confirmation. The ELISA performed with a sensitivity of 100% (95% CI 77% - 100%) and a specificity of 100% (95% CI 83% - 100%) based on MAT confirmed Leptospira spp. positive and negative samples. In the cross-sectional study in Colombia, the ELISA performed with a sensitivity of 100% (95% CI 2-100%) and a specificity of 21% (95% CI 15-28%). Assuming a 5% Leptospira spp. seroprevalence in this population, the positive predictive value was 6% and the negative predictive value 100%. The Leptospira spp. seroprevalence in the Wiwas tested by the ELISA was 39%; however, by MAT only 0.3%. The ELISA is suitable to diagnose leptospirosis in acutely ill patients in Europe several days after onset of disease. For cross-sectional studies it is not recommended due to its low specificity. Despite the evidence of a high leptospirosis prevalence in other study areas and populations in Colombia, the Wiwa do not seem to be highly exposed to Leptospira spp.. Nevertheless, leptospirosis should be considered and tested in patients presenting with febrile illness.","We would like to thank Dr. Klaus Reither for his constant support, Dr. Tracy Glass for statistical advice (both Swiss TPH) and Dr. Alba Luz-Luque Lommel for her support in Colombia.

This paper describes the development of a BPS µPAD to detect and quantify the S100B biomarker from peripheral whole blood. The device uses NaCl functionalized VF2 filter paper as a sample collection pad, an MF1 filter paper for plasma retention, and an optimized microfluidic channel geometry. An inverted light microscope, scanning electron microscope (SEM), and image processing software were used for visualizing BPS efficiency. A design of experiments (DOE) assessed the device's efficacy using an S100B ELISA Kit to measure clinically relevant S100B concentrations in plasma. The BPS device obtained 50 μL of plasma from 300 μL of whole blood after 3.5 min. The statistical correlation of S100B concentrations obtained using plasma from standard centrifugation and the BPS device was 0.98. The BPS device provides a simple manufacturing protocol, short fabrication time, and is capable of S100B detection using ELISA, making one step towards the integration of technologies aimed at low-cost POC testing of clinically relevant biomarkers.",We thank Universidad del Norte for facilitating the materials and equipment for all the performed experiments and Universidad Simón Bolívar for the financial support.,"This research was funded by Departamento Administrativo de Ciencia, Tecnología e Innovación (COLCIENCIAS) grant number 757–2016 and by Gobernación del Atlántico call number 809-2018.

A total of 21,906 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were detected in UTNGt21A, while 17,610 were disclosed in the UTNGt2 genome. The comparative genomic analysis revealed a greater number of deletions, transversions, and transitions within the UTNGt21A genome, while a small difference in the number of insertions was detected between the strains. A divergent number of types of variant annotations were detected in both strains, and categorized in terms of low, moderate, and high modifier impact on the protein effectiveness. Although both native strains shared common specific genes involved in the stress response to the gastrointestinal environment, which may qualify as a putative probiotic (bile salt, acid, temperature, osmotic stress), they were different in their antimicrobial gene cluster organization, with UTNGt21A displaying a complex bacteriocin gene arrangement and dissimilar gene variants that might alter their defense mechanisms and overall inhibitory capacity. The genome comparison revealed 34 and 9 genomic islands (GIs) in the UTNGt21A and UTNGt2 genomes, respectively, with the overrepresentation of genes involved in defense mechanisms and carbohydrate utilization. In addition, pan-genome analysis disclosed the presence of various strain-specific genes (shell genes), suggesting a high genome variation between strains. This genome analysis illustrates that the bacteriocin signature and gene variants reflect a niche-inherent pattern. These extensive genomic datasets will guide us to understand the potential benefits of the native strains and their utility in the food or pharmaceutical sectors.","The author acknowledges the Technical University of the North, Centre of Research (CUICYT), for funding this work, and expresses their sincere gratitude to D.

Flowers,"In the present study, we identified the Bacillus subtilis strain annotated Fa17.2 isolated from Bromelia flower inflorescences collected from the subtropical humid mesothermal region, Santo Domingo de Los Tsachilas Province, Ecuador. The probiotic capacity and antimicrobial potential against four foodborne pathogens were assessed. The cell culture of Fa17.2 is highly resistant to synthetic gastric acid (pH 2.5, 3.0, and 3.5), bile salts (0.3%), tolerating different sodium chloride concentrations (1, 3, and 5%), and growth conditions (15 °C and 45 °C), suggesting its potential probiotic features. The isolate showed no antibiotic resistance and was considered safe as no hemolysis was detected on sheep blood agar. The optimum medium for bacterial growth and the release of antimicrobial compounds was MRS with 10% glucose. The active components released in the neutralized crude extract (NCE) were insensitive to organic solvents, surfactants, and nonproteolytic enzymes and sensitive to proteolytic enzymes suggesting their proteinaceous nature. The antimicrobial activity was enhanced by heat and maintained active over a wide range of pH (2.0-8.0). Moreover, the crude extract (CE) showed inhibitory activity against several Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria. The molecular weight of partially purified precipitated bacteriocin-like substances (BLISs) was about 14 kDa in 20% Tricine-SDS-PAGE. The CE obtained from Fa17.2 inhibits the growth of four foodborne pathogens, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Kosaconia cowanii, and Shigella dysenteriae, which implies its potential as an antimicrobial producer strain.",The authors are thankful to Technical University of the North for funding this research.,"This research was funded by Technical University of the North, Grant No. 2929/2019.",Microorganisms,,Sabina Fijan,,2022-04-21,2022,2022-04-21,,10,5,860,All OA; Gold,Article,"Tenea, Gabriela N; Gonzalez, Gabriela Lizeth; Moreno, Jose Luis","Tenea, Gabriela N (Biofood and Nutraceutics Research and Development Group, Faculty of Engineering in Agricultural and Environmental Sciences, Technical University of the North, Av. 17 de Julio s-21, Barrio El Olivo, Ibarra 100150, Ecuador.); Gonzalez, Gabriela Lizeth (Biofood and Nutraceutics Research and Development Group, Faculty of Engineering in Agricultural and Environmental Sciences, Technical University of the North, Av. 17 de Julio s-21, Barrio El Olivo, Ibarra 100150, Ecuador.); Moreno, Jose Luis (Biofood and Nutraceutics Research and Development Group, Faculty of Engineering in Agricultural and Environmental Sciences, Technical University of the North, Av. 17 de Julio s-21, Barrio El Olivo, Ibarra 100150, Ecuador.)","Tenea, Gabriela N (Biofood and Nutraceutics Research and Development Group, Faculty of Engineering in Agricultural and Environmental Sciences, Technical University of the North, Av. 17 de Julio s-21, Barrio El Olivo, Ibarra 100150, Ecuador.)","Tenea, Gabriela N (Biofood and Nutraceutics Research and Development Group, Faculty of Engineering in Agricultural and Environmental Sciences, Technical University of the North, Av. 17 de Julio s-21, Barrio El Olivo, Ibarra 100150, Ecuador.); Gonzalez, Gabriela Lizeth (Biofood and Nutraceutics Research and Development Group, Faculty of Engineering in Agricultural and Environmental Sciences, Technical University of the North, Av. 17 de Julio s-21, Barrio El Olivo, Ibarra 100150, Ecuador.); Moreno, Jose Luis (Biofood and Nutraceutics Research and Development Group, Faculty of Engineering in Agricultural and Environmental Sciences, Technical University of the North, Av. 17 de Julio s-21, Barrio El Olivo, Ibarra 100150, Ecuador.)",9,9,1.55,2.75,https://www.mdpi.com/2076-2607/10/5/860/pdf?version=1650531949,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1147347701,31 Biological Sciences; 3106 Industrial Biotechnology; 3107 Microbiology,

Using H2 and diesel in a dual-fuel compression ignition engine appears as a more feasible approach. Here we report an experimental assessment of performance and emissions for a single-cylinder, four-stroke, air-cooled compression ignition engine operating with neat diesel and H2-diesel dual-fuel. Previous studies typically show the performance and emissions for a specific operation condition (i.e. a fixed engine speed and torque) or a limited operating range. Our experiments covered engine speeds of 3000 and 3600 rpm and torque levels of 3 and 7 Nm. An in-house designed and built alkaline cell generated the H2 used for the partial substitution of diesel. Compared with neat diesel, the results indicate that adding H2 decreased the air-fuel equivalence ratio and the Brake Specific Diesel Fuel Consumption Efficiency by around 14-29 % and 4-31 %. In contrast, adding H2 increased the Brake Fuel Conversion Efficiency by around 3-36 %. In addition, the Brake Thermal Efficiency increased in the presence of H2 in the range of 3-37 % for the lower engine speed and 27-43 % for the higher engine speed compared with neat diesel. The dual-fuel mode resulted in lower CO and CO2 emissions for the same power output. The emissions of hydrocarbons decreased with H2 addition, except for the lower engine speed and the higher torque. However, the dual-fuel operation resulted in higher NOx emissions than neat diesel, with 2-6 % and 19-48 % increments for the lower and higher engine speeds. H2 emerges as a versatile energy carrier with the potential to tackle current energy and emissions challenges; however, the dual-fuel strategy requires careful management of NOx emissions.",The authors want to acknowledge the support of the UNIVERSIDAD DEL ATLÁNTICO through the project ING81- CII2019 “Estudio experimental de la sustitución parcial de combustible con HIDROXY (HHO) en motores térmicos de encendido por compresión y la influencia sobre sus prestaciones” and SPHERE ENERGY COMPANY - Colombia on the development of this research by providing access to their facility.,"This research did not receive any specific grant from funding agencies in the public, commercial, or not-for-profit sectors.",Heliyon,,,,2022-04-16,2022,2022-04-16,2022-04,8,4,e09285,All OA; Gold,Article,"Estrada, L.; Moreno, E.; Gonzalez-Quiroga, A.; Bula, A.; Duarte-Forero, J.","Estrada, L.

The bacterial microbiota associated with mother plant's foliar tissues is one of the main sources of bacteria for seeds. Therefore, any ecological factor influencing the mother plant's microbiota may also affect the diversity of the seed's bacterial community. Grasses form associations with beneficial vertically transmitted fungal endophytes of genus Epichloë. The interaction of plants with Epichloë endophytes and insect herbivores can influence the plant foliar microbiota. However, it is unknown whether these interactions (alone or in concert) can affect the assembly of bacterial communities in the produced seed. We subjected Lolium multiflorum plants with and without its common endophyte Epichloë occultans (E+, E-, respectively) to an herbivory treatment with Rhopalosiphum padi aphids and assessed the diversity and composition of the bacterial communities in the produced seed. The presence of Epichloë endophytes influenced the seed bacterial microbiota by increasing the diversity and affecting the composition of the communities. The relative abundances of the bacterial taxa were more similarly distributed in communities associated with E+ than E- seeds with the latter being dominated by just a few bacterial groups. Contrary to our expectations, seed bacterial communities were not affected by the aphid herbivory experienced by mother plants. We speculate that the enhanced seed/seedling performance documented for Epichloë-host associations may be explained, at least in part, by the Epichloë-mediated increment in the seed-bacterial diversity, and that this phenomenon may be applicable to other plant-endophyte associations.",We would like to thank Richard D.

In its sowing, the use of seed is the most accessible propagation mechanism for farmers. However, the induction to germination and emergence is often limited in the absence of stimulants that promote the development and growth of the seedling, added to the interference of infectious agents that notoriously reduce the vitality and viability of the seed. Given this, it was proposed as a research objective to determine the effect of zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZnO NPs) mediated by a green route on the germinative characteristics of Lycopersicon esculentum Mill. 1768 ""tomato"". The experimental phase consisted of the synthesis of ZnO NPs and its subsequent characterization. After its synthesis, its inoculation was conducted during the germination of seeds of L. esculentum, considering six sample groups for the treatment with zinc nanoparticles (T1: Control; T2: 21.31 ppm; T3: 33.58 ppm; T4: 49.15 ppm; T5: 63.59 and T6: 99.076 ppm). The results indicate that concentrations close to 100 ppm of ZnO NPs are ideal in the treatment of L. esculentum seeds, due to the promotion of enzymatic and metabolic activity to achieve cell elongation; likewise, the biosynthesized nanoparticles showed no phytotoxicity, due to the fact that, in all the treatments, there were processes of germination and emergence. This was linked to the generation of a Zn0-phenolate complex through a chelating effect, which generates compatibility with the seed and, compared to classic inorganic synthesis, usually shows phytotoxicity. In this sense, green synthesis is presented as a great alternative in this type of application.",The authors thank LANOTEC-CeNAT for contributing to the characterization of nanoparticles by TEM and FTIR.,"Universidad Privada del Norte, Dirección de Investigación, Innovación & Responsabilidad Social—Concession number: 20201001.",Molecules,,Artur M.

Based on the limitations observed in the treatment of leishmaniasis, such as high cost, significant adverse effects, and the potential for drug resistance, the aim of the present study was to evaluate the leishmanicidal activity of the compounds pseurotin A and monomethylsulochrin isolated from the biomass extract of Aspergillus sp. The chromatographic profiles of the extract were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with a diode-array UV-Vis detector (HPLC-DAD-UV), and the molecular identification of the pseurotin A and monomethylsulochrin were carried out by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry in tandem (LC-ESI-MS-MS) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). Antileishmanial activity was assayed against promastigote and intracellular amastigote of Leishmania amazonensis. As a control, cytotoxicity assays were performed in non-infected BALB/c peritoneal macrophages. Ultrastructural alterations in parasites were evaluated by transmission electron microscopy. Changes in mitochondrial membrane potential were determined by flow cytometry. Only monomethylsulochrin inhibited the promastigote growth (IC50 18.04 ± 1.11 µM), with cytotoxicity to peritoneal macrophages (CC50 5.09 91.63 ± 1.28 µM). Activity against intracellular amastigote forms (IC50 5.09 ± 1.06 µM) revealed an increase in antileishmanial activity when compared with promastigotes. In addition to a statistically significant reduction in the evaluated infection parameters, monomethylsulochrin altered the ultrastructure of the promastigote forms with atypical vacuoles, electron-dense corpuscles in the cytoplasm, changes at the mitochondria outer membrane and abnormal disposition around the kinetoplast. It was showed that monomethylsulochrin leads to a decrease in the mitochondrial membrane potential (25.9%, p = 0.0286). Molecular modeling studies revealed that monomethylsulochrin can act as inhibitor of sterol 14-alpha-demethylase (CYP51), a therapeutic target for human trypanosomiasis and leishmaniasis. Assessed for its drug likeness, monomethylsulochrin follows the Lipinski Rule of five and Ghose, Veber, Egan, and Muegge criteria. Furthermore, monomethylsulochrin can be used as a reference in the development of novel and therapeutically useful antileishmanial agents.",,"This research was funded by the Oswaldo Cruz Institute, by the Coordination for the Improvement of Higher Education Personnel (Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior do Brazil; CAPES), grant number 88887.368507/2019-00, Finance Code 001, and by the Carlos Chagas Filho Foundation for Research Support of the State of Rio de Janeiro (Fundação Carlos Chagas Filho de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado do Rio de Janeiro; FAPERJ), grant number E-26/210.344/2019, E-26/201.765/2019 and E-26/211.680/2021 (269680).

The urgent need for novel agents able to inhibit the function of both pumps, led us to evaluate this property in 137 extracts obtained from Argentinian plants.MethodsThe ability of the extracts to reverse efflux pump-mediated MDR was determined with an agar chemosensitization assay using fluconazole (FCZ) resistant Mdr1- and Cdr1-overexpressing clinical isolates of Candida albicans and Candida glabrata as well as Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains selectively expressing Mdr1 (AD/CaMDR1) or Cdr1 (AD/CaCDR1). The resistance-reversing activity of the most potent extracts was further confirmed using a Nile Red accumulation assay.ResultsFifteen plant extracts overcame the FCZ resistance of Candida albicans 1114, which overexpresses CaMdr1 and CaCdr1, and AD/CaMDR1, with those from Acalypha communis and Solanum atriplicifolium being the most effective showing 4- to 16-fold reversal of resistance at concentrations ≥ 25 µg/mL. Both extracts, and to a lesser extent that from Pterocaulon alopecuroides, also restored FCZ sensitivity in CgCdr1-overexpressing C. glabrata 109 and in AD/CaCDR1 with fold reversal values ranging from 4 to 32 and therefore demonstrating a dual effect against Mdr1 and Cdr1. Both, A. communis and S. atriplicifolium extracts at concentrations ≥ 12.5 and ≥ 25 µg/mL, respectively, increased the intracellular Nile Red accumulation in all yeast strains overexpressing efflux pumps.ConclusionsThe non-toxic and highly active extracts from A. communis and S. atripicifolium, provide promising sources of compounds for potentiating the antifungal effect of FCZ by blocking the efflux function of Mdr1 and Cdr1 transporters.",F.

However, to date, no systematic research overview has been performed in this domain, leaving the body of literature unstructured. This article fills this gap by assessing the motivational factors of choice for the public sector in the health field, and the conceptual and methodological trends of this research stream. (2) Methods: This study follows the PRISMA protocol to ascertain patterns in past research and inform researchers, practitioners, and policymakers. Eighty-nine documents published between 1998 and 2021 were retained after selecting them according to their theme and outlined goals. (3) Results: Common motivational determinants are remuneration, available resources, work conditions, and frequency of contact and interaction with patients. The PSM construct and scale are often employed as main frameworks, but there is also a concern in assessing motivation drawing on psychological constructs that reflect the challenging line of work and environment that is health care, such as presenteeism, stress, and perception of hindrances. (4) Conclusions: By focusing on health professionals' motivation, this study contributes to a timely systematization in challenging times for health institutions and their human resources.","Gonçalo Santinha and Alexandre Fernandes would like to acknowledge the contribution of the research unit on Governance, Competitiveness, and Public Policy (UIDB/04058/2020), funded by national funds through FCT—Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology.","This research was funded by Fundação para a Ciência e Tecnologia, grant number 020.05144.BD, and partially funded by Programa Operacional Centro 2020, through Fundo Social Europeu.",Behavioral Sciences,,,,2022-03-29,2022,2022-03-29,,12,4,95,All OA; Gold,Article,"Fernandes, Alexandre; Santinha, Gonçalo; Forte, Teresa","Fernandes, Alexandre (Governance, Competitiveness and Public Policies (GOVCOPP), Department of Social, Political and Territorial Sciences, University of Aveiro, 3810-193 Aveiro, Portugal.); Santinha, Gonçalo (Governance, Competitiveness and Public Policies (GOVCOPP), Department of Social, Political and Territorial Sciences, University of Aveiro, 3810-193 Aveiro, Portugal.); Forte, Teresa (Governance, Competitiveness and Public Policies (GOVCOPP), Department of Social, Political and Territorial Sciences, University of Aveiro, 3810-193 Aveiro, Portugal.)","Fernandes, Alexandre (University of Aveiro)","Fernandes, Alexandre (University of Aveiro); Santinha, Gonçalo (University of Aveiro); Forte, Teresa (University of Aveiro)",12,10,1.45,7.18,https://www.mdpi.com/2076-328X/12/4/95/pdf?version=1650035815,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1146702847,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3202 Clinical Sciences; 52 Psychology; 5202 Biological Psychology; 5203 Clinical and Health Psychology,3 Good Health and Well Being

It has been associated with a high risk of contracting infectious diseases and with elevated mortality rates. Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is one of the most common infectious diseases worldwide and its prognosis is affected by a large number of recognizable risk factors. This narrative review updates the information on the impact of malnutrition, including both undernutrition and obesity, on the risk and prognosis of adults with CAP. Studies of CAP that have evaluated undernutrition have applied a variety of definitions when assessing the nutritional status of patients. Undernutrition has been associated with unfavorable clinical outcomes, such as prolonged hospital stay, need for intensive care unit admission, and mortality; in contrast, most published studies have found that increased body mass index is significantly associated with higher survival in patients with CAP. However, some authors have presented divergent results, mainly in relation to the etiology of CAP (bacterial versus viral). Influenza infection, caused by influenza A (H1N1) pdm09, has been associated with worse prognosis in obese patients. The current data underscore the need for larger studies to examine the physiological mechanisms that explain the differential impact of malnutrition on outcomes.

High hydrostatic pressure and ultrasound, as emerging extraction methods, constitute an alternative to conventional extraction, improving extractability and obtaining extracts rich in bioactive compounds. Therefore, lemon extracts (LEs) were obtained by conventional (orbital shaking), ultrasound-assisted, and high-hydrostatic-pressure extraction. Extracts were then microencapsulated with maltodextrin at 10% (M10), 20% (M20), and 30% (M30). The impact of microencapsulation on LEs physicochemical properties, phenolics (TPC), flavonoids (TFC) and relative bio-accessibility (RB) was evaluated. M30 promoted a higher microencapsulation efficiency for TPC and TFC, and a longer time required for microcapsules to dissolve in water, as moisture content, water activity and hygroscopicity decreased. The RBs of TPC and TFC were higher in microcapsules with M30, and lower when conventional extraction was used. The data suggest that microencapsulated LE is promising as it protects the bioactivity of phenolic compounds. In addition, this freeze-dried product can be utilized as a functional ingredient for food or supplement formulations.","The authors wish to thank FONDECYT POSTDOCTADO N° 3220661, FONDECYT REGULAR N°1220845 and DIULS PR 1921512.",The APC was funded by DIULS PR 1921512.,Molecules,,,Antioxidants; Capsules; Phenols; Plant Extracts; Water,2022-06-29,2022,2022-06-29,,27,13,4166,All OA; Gold,Article,"Giovagnoli-Vicuña, Claudia; Briones-Labarca, Vilbett; Romero, María Soledad; Giordano, Ady; Pizarro, Sebastián","Giovagnoli-Vicuña, Claudia (Departamento de Ingeniería en Alimentos, Universidad de La Serena, Av.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 112 parents of children and AYAs who had been diagnosed with cancer and who received treatment in Malaga participated in the study. In the study, participated all parents who voluntarily agreed to fulfil the questionnaire. The main inclusion criterion was that their child had cancer. Instruments used were Questionnaire on the Frequency of and Satisfaction with Social Support (QFSSS), Paediatric Inventory for Parents (PIP), Life Satisfaction Scale and Family Satisfaction Scale.
RESULTS: In the mean difference analyses, male parents showed 3.38 (SD = 0.56) in social support received and female parents showed M = 3.08 (SD = 0.72). Conversely, in social support provided, female parents showed 3.22 and male parents showed M = 3.55 (p = 0.020). Significant differences were also found in family satisfaction, where female parents (M = 3.64) feel more satisfied than male parents (M = 3.06; p = 0.027). Parents of children aged between 0 and 14 years (M = 3.06) feel more stress than those parents of children aged 15-21 (M = 2.61; p = 0.021). The correlation analysis shows that there is a negative and significant relation between stress levels experienced by parents when facing different situations related to the child's disease and both types of support, received r = -0.411, p < 0.001 and provided r = -0.282, p < 0.01. There is also a positive and significant relation between life satisfaction and social support received r = 0.292, p < 0.01, and social support provided r = 0.409, p < 0.001. There is a positive and significant relation between family satisfaction and social support received r = 0.330, p < 0.01, in the same way as with social support provided r = 0.222, p < 0.05. The regression analysis related to stress levels of parents indicates that social support received predicts levels of stress significantly p < 0.001, with the variable of number of children being the one that showed to be significant p < 0.05. Social support provided showed the most significant results p = 0.001, meaning that social support provided increased life satisfaction. Social support received explains family satisfaction (p = 0.50), as it increases the family satisfaction of parents of children with cancer.
DISCUSSION: Analysing social support received and provided, as well as sociodemographic and clinical variables, allowed us to broaden the knowledge on the effect social support has on stress levels, life satisfaction and family satisfaction in parents of children and AYAs diagnosed with cancer. This may have relevant practical implications for the design of interventions that would improve parents' lives.","The authors would like to express their gratitude to the Fundación Olivares (Malaga, Spain) and to all the parents who participated in this study.",,Frontiers in Psychology,,,,2022-02-07,2022,2022-02-07,,13,,728733,All OA; Gold,Article,"Melguizo-Garín, Anabel; Martos-Méndez, Mª José; Hombrados-Mendieta, Isabel; Ruiz-Rodríguez, Iván","Melguizo-Garín, Anabel (Department of Social Psychology, University of Malaga, Málaga, Spain); Martos-Méndez, Mª José (Department of Social Psychology, University of Malaga, Málaga, Spain); Hombrados-Mendieta, Isabel (Department of Social Psychology, University of Malaga, Málaga, Spain); Ruiz-Rodríguez, Iván (Department of Social Psychology, University of Malaga, Málaga, Spain)","Melguizo-Garín, Anabel (University of Malaga)","Melguizo-Garín, Anabel (University of Malaga); Martos-Méndez, Mª José (University of Malaga); Hombrados-Mendieta, Isabel (University of Malaga); Ruiz-Rodríguez, Iván (University of Malaga)",4,4,1.37,,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.728733/pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1145352326,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences,

WH16-1,"A ferredoxin protein (AAY72_06850, named FesR) was identified to associate with chromate [Cr(VI)] resistance in Alishewanella sp. WH16-1. FesR and its similar proteins were phylogenetically separated from other reductase families. Unlike the reported Cr(VI) and selenite [Se(IV)] reductases, two 4Fe-4S clusters and one flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) -binding domain were found in the FesR sequence. The experiment in vivo showed that the mutant strain ΔfesR had lost partial Cr(VI) and Se(IV) reduction capacities compared to the wild-type and complemented strains. Furthermore, overexpression in Escherichia coli and enzymatic tests in vitro showed FesR were involved in Cr(VI) and Se(IV) reduction. 4Fe-4S cluster in purified FesR was detected by ultraviolet-visible spectrum (UV-VIS) and Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR). The Km values of FesR for Cr(VI) and Se(IV) reduction were 1682.0 ± 126.2 and 1164.0 ± 89.4 μmol/L, and the Vmax values for Cr(VI) and Se(IV) reduction were 4.1 ± 0.1 and 9.4 ± 0.3 μmol min-1 mg-1, respectively. Additionally, site-directed mutagenesis and redox potential analyses showed that 4Fe-4S clusters were essential to FesR, and FAD could enhance the enzyme efficiencies of FesR as intracellular electron transporters.

Unexpected variants unrelated to referral are being increasingly detected in asymptomatic individuals through ECS. In this study, we reported an asymptomatic male with duplication of exons 56-61 in the DMD gene through ECS using whole-exome sequencing (WES), which was also detected in a male patient diagnosed with typical Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). Breakpoint analysis was then performed to explore the potential mechanisms of phenotypic differences using long-read sequencing (LRS), PacBio single-molecule real-time (PacBio SMRT) target sequencing, and Sanger sequencing. Complex structural variations (SVs) on chromosome X were identified in the asymptomatic male, which revealed that the duplication occurred outside the DMD gene; whereas, the duplication in the patient with DMD was a tandem repeat. The phenotypic differences between the two men could be explained by the different breakpoint junctions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of a breakpoint analysis of DMD duplication in two men with different phenotypes. Breakpoint analysis is necessary when the clinical phenotypes are inconsistent with genotypes, and it applies to prenatal testing.","The authors are very grateful to the families for participating in this study and appreciate Beijing GrandOmics Biosciences Biotechnology Co., Ltd., for the technical support in Nanopore LRS and PacBio SMRT target sequencing.",This work was supported by the National Key Research and Development Project of China (grant number 2018YFC1002203).,Frontiers in Genetics,,,,2022-05-09,2022,2022-05-09,,13,,878806,All OA; Gold,Article,"Bai, Ying; Liu, Ju; Xu, Jinghan; Sun, Yue; Li, Jingjing; Gao, Yong; Liu, Lina; Jia, Cangcang; Kong, Xiangdong; Wang, Li","Bai, Ying (Genetic and Prenatal Diagnosis Center, Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, China); Liu, Ju (Department of Neurology, First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, China); Xu, Jinghan (Genetic and Prenatal Diagnosis Center, Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, China); Sun, Yue (Genetic and Prenatal Diagnosis Center, Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, China); Li, Jingjing (Genetic and Prenatal Diagnosis Center, Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, China); Gao, Yong (GrandOmics Biosciences, Beijing, China); Liu, Lina (Genetic and Prenatal Diagnosis Center, Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, China); Jia, Cangcang (GrandOmics Biosciences, Beijing, China); Kong, Xiangdong (Genetic and Prenatal Diagnosis Center, Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, China); Wang, Li (Genetic and Prenatal Diagnosis Center, Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, China)","Kong, Xiangdong (First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University); Wang, Li (First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University)","Bai, Ying (First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University); Liu, Ju (First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University); Xu, Jinghan (First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University); Sun, Yue (First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University); Li, Jingjing (First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University); Gao, Yong (Grandomics (China)); Liu, Lina (First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University); Jia, Cangcang (Grandomics (China)); Kong, Xiangdong (First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University); Wang, Li (First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University)",8,7,1.36,3.4,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fgene.2022.878806/pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1147724769,31 Biological Sciences; 3105 Genetics,

In this work, quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) approach was used to construct models to identify possible FFA1 agonists by applying four different machine-learning algorithms. The best model (M2) meets the Tropsha's test requirements and has the statistics parameters R2 = 0.843, Q2CV = 0.785, and Q2ext = 0.855. Also, coverage of 100% of the test set based on the applicability domain analysis was obtained. Furthermore, a deep analysis based on the ADME predictions, molecular docking, and molecular dynamics simulations was performed. The lipophilicity and the residue interactions were used as relevant criteria for selecting a candidate from the screening of the DiaNat and DrugBank databases.

The work of public health policies is aimed at reducing its prevalence as well as its pharmaceutical cost. Physical activity (PA) programs are interventions with a high potential for effectiveness.
OBJECTIVES: To establish the relationships between physical activity and the prevalence of depression and antidepressant intake in the Spanish population.
DESIGN: We performed a correlational study that was based on data from the European Health Survey Spain 2020 with 20,287 participants, aged 18-84 years, living in Spain.
RESULTS: Dependency relationships were found between the prevalence of depression, and: the frequency of PA, the number of days of PA per week, and the number of days of muscle strengthening in the population, in both sexes, and in all age groups (p < 0.001). Dependency relationships were found between the three PA variables and the prevalence of taking antidepressants (p < 0.001). An elevated prevalence of depression and antidepressant taking were found in the inactive groups compared to those who performed PA (p < 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: There is an inverse relationship between physical activity and the probability of suffering from depression and the intake of antidepressants. Performing PA 3-4 days/week, including 1-2 days of strength work, could be the best proposal to reduce the prevalence of depression in the Spanish population.",This article has been made possible thanks to the project “Observatorio El Ejercicio Te Cuida” signed between the Fundación Jóvenes y Deporte de la Junta de Extremadura and the University of Extremadura.,"Proyecto 4IE + (0499_4IE_PLUS_4_E); Programa Interreg VA España-Portugal (POCTEP) 2014–2020: 0499_4IE_PLUS_4_E; Desarrollo del Observatorio El Ejercicio Te Cuida (02/03/2021–01/03/2023); The author Á.D.-Z.

These workers are exposed to chronic intermittent hypobaric hypoxia (CIHH), which reduces their sleep quality and increases the risk of accidents and long-term illnesses. Melatonin, a hormone produced by the pineal gland, is a sleep inducer that regulates the circadian cycle and may be altered in populations subjected to CIHH. This work aimed to assess the relationship between altitude, sleep quality, and plasma melatonin concentrations in miners with CIHH exposure. 288 volunteers were recruited from five altitudes (0, 1,600, 2,500, 3,500, and 4,500 m). All volunteers worked for 7 days at altitude, followed by 7 days of rest at sea level. We performed anthropometric assessments, nocturnal oximetry, sleep quality and sleepiness surveys, and serum melatonin levels upon awakening. Although oxygen saturation progressively decreased and heart rate increased at higher altitudes, subjective perception of sleep quality was not significantly different, and sleepiness increased in all groups compared to population at sea level. Similarly, melatonin levels increased at all assessed altitudes compared to the population at sea level. These data confirm that sleep disturbances associated with CIHH increase morning melatonin levels. Therefore, this hormone and could potentially serve as a biomarker of sleep quality.","This work was funded by the Innova-Corfo Project 07CN13ISM-152 “Producción, Aplicación y Validación de Biomarcadores de Exposición Laboral en Trabajadores de Empresas Mineras del Norte de Chile,” executed at the Facultad de Medicina of Universidad Católica del Norte.

These publications have assessed the determinants and outcomes of vaccine conspiracy beliefs using, in some cases, pooled data from different countries, and compared the results across these contexts. However, studies often do not consider measurement invariance as a necessary requirement for comparative analyses. Therefore, the aim of this study was to develop and evaluate the cross-cultural MI of the COVID-19 Vaccine Conspiracy Beliefs Scale (COVID-VCBS) in 12 Latin American countries.
Methods: Confirmatory factor analysis, item response theory analysis and alignment method were applied to test measurement invariance in a large number of groups.
Results: The COVID-VCBS showed robust psychometric properties and measurement invariance for both factor loadings and crosstabs. Also, a higher level of acceptance of conspiracy beliefs about vaccines is necessary to respond to higher response categories. Similarly, greater acceptance of conspiracy beliefs about COVID-19 vaccines was related to a lower intention to be vaccinated.
Conclusion: The results allow for improved understanding of conspiracy beliefs about COVID-19 vaccines in the countries assessed; furthermore, they provide researchers and practitioners with an invariant measure that they can use in cross-cultural studies in Latin America. However, further studies are needed to test invariance in other countries, with the goal of developing a truly international measure of conspiracy beliefs about COVID-19 vaccines.","The authors would like to thank the respondents, who kindly participated in this research study.",This research was funded by a COVID-19 crisis seed grant from the Universidad Privada del Norte to TC-R.,Frontiers in Public Health,,,COVID-19; COVID-19 Vaccines; Cross-Cultural Comparison; Humans; Latin America; Vaccines,2022-06-14,2022,2022-06-14,,10,,908720,All OA; Gold,Article,"Caycho-Rodríguez, Tomás; Valencia, Pablo D.; Ventura-León, José; Vilca, Lindsey W.; Carbajal-León, Carlos; Reyes-Bossio, Mario; White, Michael; Rojas-Jara, Claudio; Polanco-Carrasco, Roberto; Gallegos, Miguel; Cervigni, Mauricio; Martino, Pablo; Palacios, Diego Alejandro; Moreta-Herrera, Rodrigo; Samaniego-Pinho, Antonio; Lobos-Rivera, Marlon Elías; Figares, Andrés Buschiazzo; Puerta-Cortés, Diana Ximena; Corrales-Reyes, Ibraín Enrique; Calderón, Raymundo; Tapia, Bismarck Pinto; Gallegos, Walter L.

In Colombia, this challenge intersects with wider challenges facing post-conflict reconstruction. Our pilot study will explore the feasibility and acceptability of a participatory approach to developing community-led participatory interventions for community mental health systems strengthening and mental health improvement, in two sites in Caquetá, Colombia.
METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The project is divided into three distinct phases aligned with community participatory action research cycles: diagnostic, intervention and evaluation. This allows us to use a participatory approach to design a community-led, bottom-up intervention for mental health systems strengthening and the promotion of mental health and well-being.The diagnostic phase explores local understandings of mental health, mental distress and access to mental health services from community members and health providers. The intervention stage will be guided by a participatory Theory of Change process. Community priorities will inform the development of a participatory, learning and action (PLA) informed group intervention, with a community linkage forum. The pilot of the PLA intervention will be evaluated using MRC process evaluation guidelines.
ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This project has received ethical approval from two sources. Universidad de Los Andes (2021-1393) and the University College London (16127/005). Dissemination of findings will include academic publications, community forums, policy briefs and visual media (cartoons, pod casts and short films).",,"This work is funded by an UKRI/ESRC Newton Award, grant number ES/V013211 and a MINCIENCIAS award, grant number 856-2020.",BMJ Open,,,Humans; Community Mental Health Services; Pilot Projects; Colombia; Research Design; Health Services Research; Polyesters,2022-12-22,2022,2022-12-22,2022-12,12,12,e069329,All OA; Gold,Article,"Burgess, Rochelle; Sanguineti, María Cecilia Dedios; Maldonado-Carrizosa, Darío; Fonseca, Laura; San Juan, Norha Vera; Lucumí, Diego; González-Gort, Mónica; Melgar, Mónica Carreño; Gaviria, María Fanny; Tovar, Diego Ferney; Jovchelovitch, Sandra","Burgess, Rochelle (UCL Institute for Global Health, London, UK); Sanguineti, María Cecilia Dedios (School of Government, Universidad de los Andes, Bogota, Colombia); Maldonado-Carrizosa, Darío (School of Government, Universidad de los Andes, Bogota, Colombia); Fonseca, Laura (Department of Psychological and Behavioural Science, London School of Economics and Political Science, London, UK); San Juan, Norha Vera (UCL Institute for Global Health, London, UK; Rapid Research Appraisal and Evaluation Lab, University College London, London, UK); Lucumí, Diego (School of Government, Universidad de los Andes, Bogota, Colombia); González-Gort, Mónica (School of Government, Universidad de los Andes, Bogota, Colombia); Melgar, Mónica Carreño (School of Government, Universidad de los Andes, Bogota, Colombia); Gaviria, María Fanny (Corporación Manigua, Florencia, Colombia); Tovar, Diego Ferney (Cooperativa Multiactiva Para El Buen Vivir Y La Paz Del Caquetá, Florencia, Colombia); Jovchelovitch, Sandra (Department of Psychological and Behavioural Science, London School of Economics and Political Science, London, UK)","Burgess, Rochelle (University College London)","Burgess, Rochelle (University College London); Sanguineti, María Cecilia Dedios (Universidad de Los Andes); Maldonado-Carrizosa, Darío (Universidad de Los Andes); Fonseca, Laura (London School of Economics and Political Science); San Juan, Norha Vera (University College London; University College London); Lucumí, Diego (Universidad de Los Andes); González-Gort, Mónica (Universidad de Los Andes); Melgar, Mónica Carreño (Universidad de Los Andes); Gaviria, María Fanny (Corporación Manigua, Florencia, Colombia); Tovar, Diego Ferney (Cooperativa Multiactiva Para El Buen Vivir Y La Paz Del Caquetá, Florencia, Colombia); Jovchelovitch, Sandra (London School of Economics and Political Science)",6,6,1.26,3.56,https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/bmjopen/12/12/e069329.full.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1153897247,42 Health Sciences; 4203 Health Services and Systems; 4206 Public Health,3 Good Health and Well Being

For high-performance athletes, these interventions are very relevant, given that they constantly face pressure towards obtaining sporting achievements.
Methods: This systematic review aims to analyze the scientific articles between 2010 and 2020 that evaluated the effect of psychological interventions on high-performance athletes. In the search procedure, nine studies were selected, the most studied variables were psychological skills, psychological flexibility, and stress.
Results: The 44% of the interventions were designed by the research authors themselves, while the remaining 56% were replicated programs, which already had scientific evidence.
Discussion: Psychological interventions have a positive impact on sports performance.

DESIGN: A scoping review was performed according to the guidelines of the Joanna Briggs Institute.
STUDY SELECTION: All studies about intervention programmes for PA and nutritional behaviours in Colombia were included.
METHODS: Searches in Medline/PubMed, Embase, Cochrane, Scielo and Lilacs, using MeSH, Decs and Emtree terms, were performed up to August 2020. Additionally, a manual search was made in specialised national journals. An internet documentary search of the official websites on policies and programmes by departmental, district and municipal secretariats was also performed.Two reviewers independently screened titles and abstracts. Then, the full texts were reviewed to select documents to be included.Data management relevant information from selected documents and articles was extracted. A descriptive analysis was considered.
RESULTS: Sixty-seven documents and 70 published articles were found. The programmes were identified in 13 initiatives, 7 in the area of PA and 6 with a nutrition focus. They were on physical and social environmental modifications such as the 'muévete' ('get moving') programmes in Bogota, Quindio and Cartagena; a modification of 'ciclovía'; or bicycle path programmes as well as nutrition programmes in schools, universities and companies.
CONCLUSION: This scoping review identified national programmes and policies in Colombia in the area of nutrition and PA from the environmental perspective in different scenarios: from schools to workplaces and communities. The need to implement such programmes from public and private institutions is also noted, promoting the practice of PA and healthy eating in every scenario in the national territory. New research to determine the impact of these programmes is essential to get a glimpse of the effects of these programmes and the implications for public health.","EDH is a PhD candidate in Methodology of Biomedical Research and Public Health program, Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona (UAB), Barcelona, Spain.","The authors have not declared a specific grant for this research from any funding agency in the public, commercial or not-for-profit sectors.",BMJ Open,,,Colombia; Delivery of Health Care; Exercise; Humans; Public Health; Schools,2022-09-19,2022,2022-09-19,2022-09,12,9,e060085,All OA; Gold,Article,"Hernandez, Edgar D; Guzman, Cristian Arvey; Seron, Pamela","Hernandez, Edgar D (Facultad de Medicina, Human Movement Department, Universidad Nacional de Colombia, Bogotá, Colombia); Guzman, Cristian Arvey (Facultad de Medicina, Universidad Nacional de Colombia, Bogota, Colombia; Physical Therapy Department, Hospital Universitario Nacional de Colombia, Bogota, Colombia); Seron, Pamela (Departamento de Ciencias de la Rehabilitación & CIGES, Facultad de Medicina, Universidad de La Frontera, Temuco, Chile)","Seron, Pamela (University of La Frontera)","Hernandez, Edgar D (National University of Colombia); Guzman, Cristian Arvey (National University of Colombia; Hospital Universitario Nacional de Colombia); Seron, Pamela (University of La Frontera)",3,2,1.21,1.45,https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/bmjopen/12/9/e060085.full.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1151130544,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3210 Nutrition and Dietetics; 42 Health Sciences; 4206 Public Health,

A cross-sectional and predictive design was used, in which 582 Peruvian university students participated, 243 men and 339 women, between the ages of 16 and 41. Student's t-statistics were used to analyze the differences in scores of psychological distress, anxiety, academic self-efficacy, and satisfaction with studies based on the sex of the participants, Pearson's R was used for the analysis of correlations between variables, and multiple linear regressions were used to evaluate the predictive model. In the analyses, the significance level was set at 0.05. The results show that men have higher levels of psychological distress, anxiety, and academic self-efficacy than women do (p < 0.01); high levels of psychological distress correlate with high levels of anxiety (r = 0.580, p < 0.01) and low levels of satisfaction with studies (r = -0.178, p < 0.01) and academic self-efficacy (r = -0.348, p < 0.01); high levels of anxiety correlate with low levels of satisfaction with studies (r = -0.122, p < 0.01) and academic self-efficacy (r = -0.192, p < 0.01); and high levels of academic self-efficacy correlate with high levels of satisfaction with studies (r = 0.429, p < 0.01). Academic self-efficacy was also found to predict satisfaction with studies (β = 0.429, p < 0.01). This concludes that, although there are significant correlations between psychological distress, anxiety, academic self-efficacy, and satisfaction with studies, academic self-efficacy is the variable that most predicts satisfaction with studies in Peruvian university students.",,,Frontiers in Psychology,,,,2022-04-25,2022,2022-04-25,,13,,809230,All OA; Gold,Article,"Esteban, Renzo Felipe Carranza; Mamani-Benito, Oscar; Caycho-Rodriguez, Tomás; Lingán-Huamán, Susana K.; Mamani, Percy G.

We used the significant improvement in the accuracy of protein structure prediction recently implemented in AlphaFold that incorporates novel neural network architectures and training procedures based on the evolutionary, physical, and geometric constraints of protein structures. The wild-type (WT) sequence and the mutated sequence, missing the Phe233, were reconstructed. The predicted local Distance Difference Test (lDDT) for the PURAwt and the PURA-Phe233del showed that the occurrence of the Phe233del affects between 220-320 amino acids. The distortion in the PURA structural conformation in the ~5 Å surrounding area after the p.Phe233del produces a conspicuous disruption of the repeat III, where the DNA and RNA helix unwinding capability occurs. PURA Protein-DNA docking corroborated these results in an in silico analysis that showed a loss of the contact of the PURA-Phe233del III repeat domain model with the DNA. Together, (i) the energetic and stereochemical, (ii) the hydropathic indexes and polarity surfaces, and (iii) the hybrid Quantum Mechanics-Molecular Mechanics (QM-MM) analyses of the PURA molecular models demarcate, at the atomic resolution, the specific surrounding region affected by these mutations and pave the way for future cell-based functional analysis. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of a de novo mutation underpinning a PURA syndrome in a Latin American patient and highlights the importance of predicting the molecular effects in protein structure using artificial intelligence algorithms and molecular and atomic resolution stereochemical analyses.",Our most profound acknowledgment to the patient and her parents.,Keralty (https://www.keralty.com/ (accessed on 22 June 2022)) funded this research.,Brain Sciences,,"Andrew Chih Wei Huang, Seong Soo A.

The tepary bean genotype PI 319443 displays high resistance to Xap, and the common bean genotypes HR45 and Bilu display high resistance and susceptibility to Xap, respectively. To identify candidate genes related to Xap resistance, transcriptomic analysis was performed to compare gene expression levels with Xap inoculation at 0, 24, and 48 h post inoculation (hpi) among the three genotypes. A total of 1,146,009,876 high-quality clean reads were obtained. Differentially expressed gene (DEG) analysis showed that 1,688 DEGs responded to pathogen infection in the three genotypes. Weighted gene coexpression network analysis (WGCNA) was also performed to identify three modules highly correlated with Xap resistance, in which 334 DEGs were likely involved in Xap resistance. By combining differential expression analysis and WGCNA, 139 DEGs were identified as core resistance-responsive genes, including 18 genes encoding resistance (R) proteins, 19 genes belonging to transcription factor families, 63 genes encoding proteins with oxidoreductase activity, and 33 plant hormone signal transduction-related genes, which play important roles in the resistance to pathogen infection. The expression patterns of 20 DEGs were determined by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) and confirmed the reliability of the RNA-seq results.",,"This work was supported by grants from the National Key R&D Program of China (2019YFD1001300 and 2019YFD1001305), China Agriculture Research System of MOF and MARA-Food Legumes CARS-08), and the Agricultural Science and Technology Innovation Program of CAAS.",Frontiers in Plant Science,,,,2022-01-05,2022,2022-01-05,,12,,800535,All OA; Gold,Article,"Yang, Penghui; Chang, Yujie; Wang, Lanfen; Wang, Shumin; Wu, Jing","Yang, Penghui (Institute of Crop Sciences, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Beijing, China); Chang, Yujie (Institute of Crop Sciences, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Beijing, China); Wang, Lanfen (Institute of Crop Sciences, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Beijing, China); Wang, Shumin (Institute of Crop Sciences, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Beijing, China); Wu, Jing (Institute of Crop Sciences, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Beijing, China)","Wu, Jing (Institute of Crop Sciences)","Yang, Penghui (Institute of Crop Sciences); Chang, Yujie (Institute of Crop Sciences); Wang, Lanfen (Institute of Crop Sciences); Wang, Shumin (Institute of Crop Sciences); Wu, Jing (Institute of Crop Sciences)",7,4,1.2,2.9,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpls.2021.800535/pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1144435556,"30 Agricultural, Veterinary and Food Sciences; 3004 Crop and Pasture Production; 31 Biological Sciences; 3102 Bioinformatics and Computational Biology; 3108 Plant Biology",

Therefore, the aim of this study was to develop and validate a scale that assesses monkeypox fear, the Monkeypox Fear Scale (MFS).MethodsA total of 451 Peruvians participated (61% women and 39% men), with a mean age of 28.31 years (SD = 9.72). based on procedures from classical test theory (CTT) and item response theory (IRT). Classical Test Theory (CTT) and Item Response Theory (IRT) procedures were used.ResultsThe results showed that MFS has a two-factor structure related to emotional and physiological fear factors (χ2 = 41.87; df = 12; p < .001; CFI = .99; TLI = .99; RMSEA = .074 [IC90% .051–.100]). In addition, the physiological and emotional factors showed good reliability. Measurement invariance analysis showed that the factor structure of the MFS is strictly invariant between male and female groups. Finally, the discrimination and difficulty parameters of the items show adequacy. In addition, the scale seems to be more accurate in measuring high levels of fear of monkeypox.ConclusionThe MFS has adequate psychometric evidence to assess fear of monkeypox in the Peruvian population.

Design, setting, and participants: This population-based cohort study included all individuals aged 18 years or older, registered in the Information System for Research in Primary Care (SIDIAP), which covers >75% of the population in Catalonia, Spain, from 1 January 2007, to 31 December 2019. Main exposure and outcomes: The exposures were all commercialized opioids and their combinations (ATC-codes): codeine, tramadol, oxycodone, tapentadol, fentanyl, morphine, and other opioids (dihydrocodeine, hydromorphone, dextropropoxyphene, buprenorphine, pethidine, pentazocine). The main outcomes were the annual figures per 1,000 individuals of 1) opioid users, 2) dispensations, and 3) oral morphine milligram equivalents (MME). Results were stratified separately by opioid types, age (5-year age groups), sex (male or female), living area (rural or urban), and socioeconomic status (from least, U1, to most deprived, U5). The overall trends were quantified using the percentage change (PC) between 2007 and 2019. Results: Among 4,656,197 and 4,798,114 residents from 2007 to 2019, the number of opioid users, dispensations and morphine milligram equivalents per 1,000 individuals increased 12% (percentage change: 95% confidence interval (CI) 11.9-12.3%), 105% (95% confidence interval 83%-126%) and 339% (95% CI 289%-390%) respectively. Tramadol represented the majority of opioid use in 2019 (61, 59, and 54% of opioid users, dispensations, and total MME, respectively). Individuals aged 80 years or over reported the sharpest increase regarding opioid users (PC: 162%), dispensations (PC: 424%), and MME (PC: 830%). Strong opioids were increasingly prescribed for non-cancer pains over the years. Conclusion: Despite the modest increase of opioid users, opioid dispensations and MME increased substantially, particularly in the older population. In addition, strong opioids were incrementally indicated for non-cancer pains over the years. These findings suggest a transition of opioid prescriptions from intermittent to chronic and weak to strong and call for more rigorous opioid stewardship.",We thank the physicians and healthcare professionals involved in the recording of healthcare data in busy clinical settings in Catalonia.,"The research was supported by the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Oxford Biomedical Research Centre (BRC).

Although the PSP-inducing species that threaten the most vulnerable commercial species of shellfish are very patchy and spatially heterogeneous in their distribution, the spatial and temporal scales of their effects have largely been ignored in monitoring programs and by researchers. In this study, we examined the spatial and temporal dynamics of PSP toxicity in the clam (Ameghinomya antiqua) in two fishing grounds in southern Chile (Ovalada Island and Low Bay). During the summer of 2009, both were affected by an intense toxic bloom of A. catenella (up to 1.1 × 106 cells L-1). Generalized linear models were used to assess the potential influence of different environmental variables on the field detoxification rates of PSP toxins over a period of 12 months. This was achieved using a four parameter exponential decay model to fit and compare field detoxification rates per sampling site. The results show differences in the spatial variability and temporal dynamics of PSP toxicity, given that greater toxicities (+10-fold) and faster detoxification (20% faster) are observed at the Ovalada Island site, the less oceanic zone, and where higher amounts of clam are annually produced. Our observations support the relevance of considering different spatial and temporal scales to obtain more accurate assessments of PSP accumulation and detoxification dynamics and to improve the efficacy of fisheries management after toxic events.",We thank the Chilean Monitoring Program at IFOP for monthly reports on PSP toxicity concentrations and distributions in southern Chile.

The South Eastern Pacific (SEP) coast is a highly productive coastal system that exhibits a broad biogeographic transition zone around 30-35°S. Here, we present a comparative genome-wide analysis of the sister species Scurria viridula and Scurria zebrina, that occur in parapatry and whose poleward and equatorward range edges intersect in the 30-35°S SEP biogeographic transition zone. We sampled 118 specimens sourced from nine sites from Tocopilla (22°S) to Chiloé (41°S) including one site where both species overlap and analyzed over 8000 biallelic single nucleotide polymorphisms. We found evidence of hybridization between these species in the contact zone and found significant but contrasting population structures for both species. Our results indicate that the genetic structure in S. viridula, which is currently expanding its range poleward, follows a simple isolation by distance model with no traces of natural selection (no evidence of outlier loci). In contrast, S. zebrina, which has  its equatorward range edge at the transition zone, displayed a pronounced genetic break approximately at 32-34°S, along a region of marked environmental heterogeneity in association with a semi-permanent coastal upwelling regime. For S. zebrina we also found 43 outlier loci associated with this genetic break, with a significant proportion of them clustering in a single linkage group. This marked difference in the presence of outlier loci between species suggests that they could be responding differently to local environmental challenges found at their overlapping geographic range edges, thus providing important new insights about genomic changes around biogeographic transition zones in sister species and the forces that shape genetic diversity in intertidal marine species.","ACKNOWLEDGMENTS PS‐A acknowledge support from Fondo Nacionanal de Ciencia y Tecnología (FONDECYT 1190710 and 1200636) and Millenium Nucleus NUTME (ANID NCN19_056), BRB, PAH, and MAL acknowledge support from Millennium Institute SECOS (ANID ICN2019_015) and FONDECYT 1190444.

In this context, this study aimed to uncover the consequences of conflict on victims' health and on health service provision, and their perceived health status during the post-accord stage in the Meta region, located in the country's eastern plains. Historically, this region has been one of the territories most affected by the presence of conflict-related groups and armed confrontations. Through focus groups, this research explored the health perceptions and experiences of victims of armed conflict. Ten focus groups were conducted with men and women, victims of the armed-conflict, in four municipalities with different degrees of armed conflict intensity. The focus group transcripts were coded using NVivo. The results show that the way women have experienced conflict and the effects of conflict on mental health in general for men, women, and children were recurrent themes in the dialogue of victims. Likewise, it highlights the need to understand the barriers that the current health model imposes on the right to health itself. From the victim's perspective, they experience stigmatization, discrimination, and revictimization when accessing health services. These barriers co-occur along with structural limitations of the health system that affect the general population.","We would like to thank the participants, the victims’ organizations, the public officers from the department of Meta Governor’s Office, and the Secretary of Health, partners that facilitated and supported data collection in the territory.","This paper is a result of a project that was funded by the UK Medical Research Council, Economic and Social Research Council, DFID and Wellcome Trust (Joint Health Systems Research Initiative).

To achieve this, teachers must display high levels of socioemotional skills that ensure their own personal, social, and career well-being and, as a result, that of their students. This study seeks to gain an insight into the levels of socioemotional skills of emotional perception, emotional understanding, and emotional regulation and how these are linked to the sociodemographic and career profile of teachers in infant and primary education. For this, we surveyed 351 teachers-310 female and 41 male-aged between 20 and 69. We used the Trait Meta-Mood Scale-24 (TMMS-24) together with a questionnaire (ad hoc) to determine the sociodemographic and career profile of participating teachers. Statistical analysis of the data showed that gender impacts on emotional regulation and emotional perception, while age and number of the children were also seen to have significant difference on emotional regulation and emotional perception. In contrast, professional qualifications were only seen to affect emotional perception. The variable reflecting the level at which staff teach showed significant difference on emotional perception and emotional understanding, while administrative posts held by teachers also demonstrated significant difference on their emotional understanding. The results confirm that sociodemographic and work-related variables impact the level of socioemotional skills of infant and primary education teachers. These aspects should be taken into account in the structure and planning of training aimed at developing socioemotional skills in order to ensure their success.",,This research received no external funding.,International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health,,Carlos Salavera,Achievement; Adult; Aged; Child; Emotional Intelligence; Emotions; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; School Teachers; Students; Surveys and Questionnaires; Young Adult,2022-08-11,2022,2022-08-11,,19,16,9882,All OA; Gold,Article,"Arteaga-Cedeño, Wendy L; Carbonero-Martín, Miguel Á; Martín-Antón, Luis J; Molinero-González, Paula","Arteaga-Cedeño, Wendy L (Grupo de Investigación de Excelencia GIE-179, Departamento de Psicología, Facultad de Educación, Universidad de Valladolid, Paseo Belén N 1, 47011 Valladolid, Spain.); Carbonero-Martín, Miguel Á (Grupo de Investigación de Excelencia GIE-179, Departamento de Psicología, Facultad de Educación, Universidad de Valladolid, Paseo Belén N 1, 47011 Valladolid, Spain.); Martín-Antón, Luis J (Grupo de Investigación de Excelencia GIE-179, Departamento de Psicología, Facultad de Educación, Universidad de Valladolid, Paseo Belén N 1, 47011 Valladolid, Spain.); Molinero-González, Paula (Grupo de Investigación de Excelencia GIE-179, Departamento de Psicología, Facultad de Educación, Universidad de Valladolid, Paseo Belén N 1, 47011 Valladolid, Spain.)","Carbonero-Martín, Miguel Á (University of Valladolid)","Arteaga-Cedeño, Wendy L (University of Valladolid); Carbonero-Martín, Miguel Á (University of Valladolid); Martín-Antón, Luis J (University of Valladolid); Molinero-González, Paula (University of Valladolid)",7,5,1.09,10.02,https://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/19/16/9882/pdf?version=1660197267,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1150177667,39 Education; 3901 Curriculum and Pedagogy; 3903 Education Systems,4 Quality Education

One Chinese family with clinical diagnosis of SMMCI was collected. Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) array was performed and identified variation was confirmed by whole-genome sequencing (WGS). The reported chromosomal abnormalities and pathogenic genes in patients with SMMCI in literature were reviewed and summarized. The proband was an 8-year-old boy presenting a typical solitary median maxillary central incisor with a range of other phenotypic anomalies, including ptosis. SNP array revealed a 14.3 Mbp heterozygous deletion at chromosome 18p11.32-p11.21 in the proband but not in the unaffected parents. WGS further confirmed the identified deletion. 194 genes were involved in the chromosome region. Among them, 12 genes had been shown to be associated with diseases, including TGIF1, a reported SMMCI gene. The de novo 18p deletion resulted in SMMCI in the present study.

Source Leaf Adaptation to Shading Stress Affects Not Only Photosynthetic Physiology Metabolism but Also Control of Key Gene Expression,"Shading stress strongly limits the effective growth of plants. Understanding how plant morphogenesis and physiological adaptation are generated in response to the reduced low light conditions is important for food crop development. In this study, two mung bean (Vigna radiata L.) cultivars, namely, Xilv 1 and Yulv 1, were grown in the field to explore the effects of shading stress on their growth. The results of morphology, physiology, and biochemistry analyses showed that the shading stress significantly weakened the leaf photosynthetic capacity as measured by the decreased net photosynthetic rate, stomatal conductance, and transpiration rate and increased intercellular CO2 concentration. These responses resulted in plant morphological characteristics that increased the light energy absorption in low light conditions. Such variations occurred due to the leaf anatomical structure with destroyed palisade tissues and spongy tissues. Under shading stress, Yulv 1 showed higher physiological metabolic intensity than Xilv 1, which was related to changes in chlorophyll (Chl), such as Chl a and b, and Chl a/b ratio. Compared with normal light conditions, the Chl fluorescence values, photosynthetic assimilation substances, and enzyme activities in mung bean plants under shading stress were reduced to different extent. In addition, the relative expression levels of VrGA2ox, VrGA20ox1, VrGA3ox1, VrROT3, and VrBZR1, which are related to endogenous hormone in mung bean leaves, were upregulated by shading stress, further leading to the improvements in the concentrations of auxin, gibberellins (GAs), and brassinolide (BR). Combined with the morphological, physiological, and molecular responses, Yulv 1 has stronger tolerance and ecological adaptability to shading stress than Xilv 1. Therefore, our study provides insights into the agronomic traits and gene expressions of mung bean cultivars to enhance their adaptability to the shading stress.",,,Frontiers in Plant Science,,,,2022-02-04,2022,2022-02-04,,13,,753264,All OA; Gold,Article,"Gong, Xiangwei; Liu, Chunjuan; Dang, Ke; Wang, Honglu; Du, Wanli; Qi, Hua; Jiang, Ying; Feng, Baili","Gong, Xiangwei (College of Agronomy, Shenyang Agricultural University, Shenyang, China; State Key Laboratory of Crop Stress Biology in Arid Areas, College of Agronomy, Northwest A&F University, Yangling, China); Liu, Chunjuan (College of Agronomy, Shenyang Agricultural University, Shenyang, China); Dang, Ke (State Key Laboratory of Crop Stress Biology in Arid Areas, College of Agronomy, Northwest A&F University, Yangling, China); Wang, Honglu (State Key Laboratory of Crop Stress Biology in Arid Areas, College of Agronomy, Northwest A&F University, Yangling, China); Du, Wanli (College of Agronomy, Shenyang Agricultural University, Shenyang, China); Qi, Hua (College of Agronomy, Shenyang Agricultural University, Shenyang, China); Jiang, Ying (College of Agronomy, Shenyang Agricultural University, Shenyang, China); Feng, Baili (State Key Laboratory of Crop Stress Biology in Arid Areas, College of Agronomy, Northwest A&F University, Yangling, China)","Jiang, Ying (Shenyang Agricultural University); Feng, Baili (North West Agriculture and Forestry University)","Gong, Xiangwei (Shenyang Agricultural University; North West Agriculture and Forestry University); Liu, Chunjuan (Shenyang Agricultural University); Dang, Ke (North West Agriculture and Forestry University); Wang, Honglu (North West Agriculture and Forestry University); Du, Wanli (Shenyang Agricultural University); Qi, Hua (Shenyang Agricultural University); Jiang, Ying (Shenyang Agricultural University); Feng, Baili (North West Agriculture and Forestry University)",10,6,1.09,5.03,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpls.2022.753264/pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1145289983,"30 Agricultural, Veterinary and Food Sciences; 3004 Crop and Pasture Production; 31 Biological Sciences; 3103 Ecology; 3108 Plant Biology",

This paper describes the development of a fully open-source, modular, wireless, battery-powered, smartphone-controlled, low-cost potentiostat capable of conducting electrochemical impedance spectroscopy for the electrochemical detection of the S100B protein captured in an ANTI-S100B functionalized thin-film gold interdigitated electrode platform to support traumatic brain injury diagnosis and treatment. EIS results from the developed potentiostat were validated with a commercial benchtop potentiostat by comparing impedance magnitude and phase values along the EIS frequency range. In addition, an experimental design was performed for detecting S100B in spiked human plasma samples with S100B concentrations of clinical utility, and a calibration curve was found for quantifying S100B detection. No statistically significant differences were found between EIS results from the developed potentiostat and the commercial potentiostat. Statistically significant differences in the changes in charge transfer resistance signal between each tested S100B concentration (p < 0.05) were found, with a limit of detection of 35.73 pg/mL. The modularity of the proposed potentiostat allows easier component changes according to the application demands in power, frequency excitation ranges, wireless communication protocol, signal amplification and transduction, precision, and sampling frequency of ADC, among others, when compared to state-of-the-art open-source EIS potentiostats.

Three well-studied ciliates include Oxytricha trifallax, Tetrahymena thermophila, and Paramecium tetraurelia, but only the Oxytricha lineage has a massively scrambled genome, whose assembly during development requires hundreds of thousands of precisely programmed DNA joining events, representing the most complex genome dynamics of any known organism. Here we study the emergence of such complex genomes by examining the origin and evolution of discontinuous and scrambled genes in the Oxytricha lineage. This study compares six genomes from three species, the germline and somatic genomes for Euplotes woodruffi, Tetmemena sp., and the model ciliate O. trifallax. We sequenced, assembled, and annotated the germline and somatic genomes of E. woodruffi, which provides an outgroup, and the germline genome of Tetmemena sp. We find that the germline genome of Tetmemena is as massively scrambled and interrupted as Oxytricha's: 13.6% of its gene loci require programmed translocations and/or inversions, with some genes requiring hundreds of precise gene editing events during development. This study revealed that the earlier diverged spirotrich, E. woodruffi, also has a scrambled genome, but only roughly half as many loci (7.3%) are scrambled. Furthermore, its scrambled genes are less complex, together supporting the position of Euplotes as a possible evolutionary intermediate in this lineage, in the process of accumulating complex evolutionary genome rearrangements, all of which require extensive repair to assemble functional coding regions. Comparative analysis also reveals that scrambled loci are often associated with local duplications, supporting a gradual model for the origin of complex, scrambled genomes via many small events of DNA duplication and decay.","We thank Toshinobu Suzaki (Kobe University) for the gift of E. woodruffi (strain Iz01 from Shizuoka Prefecture) and Chlorogonium capillatum.

Studies have linked inflammation to breast cancer development, but data is limited in premenopausal women, especially in Latin America.MethodsWe investigated the associations between serum biomarkers of chronic inflammation (interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, IL-10, tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interferon-γ (IFN-γ), leptin, adiponectin) and risk of premenopausal breast cancer among 453 cases and 453 matched, population-based controls from Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, and Mexico. Odds ratios (OR) were estimated using conditional logistic regression models. Analyses were stratified by size and hormonal receptor status of the tumors.ResultsIL-6 (ORper standard deviation (SD) = 1.33 (1.11–1.60)) and TNF-α (ORper SD = 1.32 (1.11–1.58)) were positively associated with breast cancer risk in fully adjusted models. Evidence of heterogeneity by estrogen receptor (ER) status was observed for IL-8 (P-homogeneity = 0.05), with a positive association in ER-negative tumors only. IL-8 (P-homogeneity = 0.06) and TNF-α (P-homogeneity = 0.003) were positively associated with risk in the largest tumors, while for leptin (P-homogeneity = 0.003) a positive association was observed for the smallest tumors only.ConclusionsThe results of this study support the implication of chronic inflammation in breast cancer risk in young women in Latin America. Largest studies of prospective design are needed to confirm these findings in premenopausal women.","The authors wish to acknowledge the substantial support provided by the research nurses and health workers as well as Tracy Lignini, Dacia Cristin, Cecile Le Duc, Jordi de Battle, Ana Cristina Ocampo, and Dr Talita Duarte-Salles for the logistics and data basis development.

The objective of this research was to observe the influence on the generation of bioelectricity of sucrose, with different percentages (0%, 5%, 10% and 20%), in papaya waste using microbial fuel cells (MFCs). It was possible to generate voltage and current peaks of 0.955 V and 5.079 mA for the cell with 20% sucrose, which operated at an optimal pH of 4.98 on day fifteen. In the same way, the internal resistance values of all the cells were influenced by the increase in sucrose, showing that the cell without sucrose was 0.1952 ± 0.00214 KΩ and with 20% it was 0.044306 ± 0.0014 KΩ. The maximum power density was 583.09 mW/cm2 at a current density of 407.13 A/cm2 and with a peak voltage of 910.94 mV, while phenolic compounds are the ones with the greatest presence in the FTIR (Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy) absorbance spectrum. We were able to molecularly identify the species Achromobacter xylosoxidans (99.32%), Acinetobacter bereziniae (99.93%) and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (100%) present in the anode electrode of the MFCs.

Early sex assignment and early diagnosis of different genetic variations with a proper technique are important to reduce mortality and morbidity. Proper early sex identification reduces emotional, social, and psychological stress. Aim: Detection of a spectrum of aberrations in the CYP21A2 gene, including copy number variations, gene conversion, chimeric genes, and point variations. Methods: The CYP21A2 gene was screened using MLPA assay in 112 unrelated Egyptian children with 21-OHD CAH (33 males and 79 females). Results: In the studied group, 79.5% were diagnosed within the first month of life. 46.8% of the genetic females were misdiagnosed as males. Among the copy number variation results, large deletions in 15.4% and three types of chimeric genes in 9% (CH-1, CH-7, and CAH-X CH-1) were detected. Regarding gene dosage, one copy of CYP21A2 was found in 5 cases (4.5%), three copies were detected in 7 cases (6.3%), and one case (0.9%) showed four copies. Eight common genetic variants were identified, I2G, large deletions, large gene conversion (LGC), I172N, F306 + T, -113 SNP, 8bp Del, and exon 6 cluster (V237E and M239K) with an allelic frequency of 32.62%, 15.45%, 7.30%, 3.00%, 2.58%, 2.15%, 0.86%, and 0.86%, respectively.

It is the first cause of inability worldwide, which entails high economic costs for the public system. Current evidence suggests that physical activity is an effective tool for the prevention and treatment of depressive symptoms.
OBJECTIVE: To examine the relationship between the cases of depressive symptoms and depression presented by the adult Spanish population and the days per week of physical activity and strength training that they perform.
DESIGN: It is a cross-sectional study with data from the European Health Survey of Spain 2020 (EESE 2020), consisting of 10,024 males and 11,126 females, between 18 and 84 years, which conformed the sample of 21,150 participants.
RESULTS: Depressive symptoms and depression were related to days of PA per week, PA frequency per week and strength training days per week (p < 0.001), depressive symptoms and depression were found to have higher prevalence in the inactive groups than in the active groups (p < 0.05); this phenomenon was found in both sexes and age groups.
CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of depressive symptoms and depression were associated with physical activity in the general population, by sex and by age group too. The prevalence of both were higher in the inactive population than in the active population of all ages and sexes. Future studies are required to confirm the relationship between PA and depression prevalence, in order to establish the scope of the effect of PA on depressive symptoms and depression.",,"The author A.

The effects of these BSC at the micro-site scale have been related to the development of diverse plant species that, otherwise, might be strongly limited by the harsh abiotic conditions found in environments with low water availability. Here, we describe for the first time the bacterial composition of BSCs found in the proximities of Admiralty Bay (Maritime Antarctica) through 16S metabarcoding. In addition, we evaluated their effect on soils (nutrient levels, enzymatic activity, and water retention), and on the fitness and performance of Colobanthus quitensis, one of the two native Antarctic vascular plants. This was achieved by comparing the photochemical performance, foliar nutrient, biomass, and reproductive investment between C. quitensis plants growing with or without the influence of BSC. Our results revealed a high diversity of prokaryotes present in these soil communities, although we found differences in terms of their abundances. We also found that the presence of BSCs is linked to a significant increase in soils' water retention, nutrient levels, and enzymatic activity when comparing with control soils (without BSCs). In the case of C. quitensis, we found that measured ecophysiological performance parameters were significantly higher on plants growing in association with BSCs. Taken together, our results suggest that BSCs in Antarctic soils are playing a key role in various biochemical processes involved in soil development, while also having a positive effect on the accompanying vascular flora. Therefore, BSCs would be effectively acting as ecosystem engineers for the terrestrial Antarctic ecosystem.",We thank Maria Jose Romero Urrutia for her field assistance.

This study aimed to determine the relationship between omega-3 fatty acid status and the severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Methods: Using a case−control design, we compared hospitalized patients with severe SARS-CoV-2 infection (cases, n = 73) with a group of ambulatory patients with mild SARS-CoV-2 infection (controls, n = 71). No patients were vaccinated against SARS-CoV-2. Results: The cases were older (p = 0.003), less educated (p = 0.001), had larger neck and smaller waist circumferences (p = 0.035 and p = 0.003, respectively), more frequently had diabetes (p < 0.001), consumed less fish (p < 0.001), consumed higher proportions of fried fish (p = 0.001), and had lower Omega-3 Index (O3I) values (p = 0.001) than controls. Cases had significantly lower rates of upper airway symptoms than controls. Lower O3I was associated with an increased likelihood of developing severe COVID-19 after adjusting for potential confounders (OR: 0.52; CI 0.32−0.86). Diabetes (OR: 4.41; CI 1.60−12.12), neck circumference (OR: 1.12; CI 1.03−1.21), and older age (OR: 1.03; CI 1.002−1.062) were also linked to COVID-19 severity. Fried fish consumption and low educational level were independent risk factors for severe COVID-19. Conclusions: This study suggests incorporating nutritional interventions to improve omega-3 status within nonpharmacological measures may help to reduce the severity of COVID-19.",The authors appreciate the contribution of the fourth year 2021 nutrition students of the Universidad Católica del Norte.,This research received no external funding.,International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health,,Paul B.

This study aims to assess the incidence of life-threatening arrhythmias in patients with Takotsubo cardiomyopathy and evaluate the outcomes of patients with life-threatening arrhythmias (LTAs) in Takotsubo cardiomyopathy compared with those without LTA.
METHODS: We comprehensively searched the PubMed, Google Scholar, and Embase databases from inception to February 2021. The primary aim of the study was to determine the incidence of LTAs in TC patients. Other outcomes of interest were the odds of in-hospital, long-term mortality, and cardiogenic shock (CS) in TC patients with LTAs versus those without LTAs. For all statistical analyses, ReviewManager and MedCalc were used.
RESULTS: Eighteen studies were included in this study involving 55,557 participants (2,185 with LTAs and 53,372 without LTAs). The pooled incidence of LTAs in the patients of TC was found to be 6.29% (CI: 4.70-8.08%; I2 = 94.67%). There was a statistically significant increased risk of in-hospital mortality (OR = 4.74; CI: 2.24-10.04; I2 = 77%, p < 0.0001) and cardiogenic shock (OR = 5.60; CI: 3.51-8.95; I2 = 0%, p < 0.00001) in the LTA group versus the non-LTA group. LTA was not associated with long-term mortality (OR = 2.23; CI: 0.94-5.28; I2 = 53%, p = 0.07).
CONCLUSION: The pooled incidence of life-threatening arrhythmias in the patients of TC was found to be 6.29%. In the group of TC patients with LTAs, the odds of in-hospital mortality and CS, was higher than in the TC patients without LTAs.",None.,No funding sources to declare.,Indian Heart Journal,,,"Arrhythmias, Cardiac; Hospital Mortality; Humans; Incidence; Shock, Cardiogenic; Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy",2022-02-02,2022,2022-02-02,2022-03,74,2,110-119,All OA; Gold,Article,"Rathore, Sawai Singh; Iqbal, Kinza; Shafqat, Shameel; Tariq, Eleze; Tousif, Sohaib; UlHaq, Zain Ghufran; Fernández-Sánchez, David; Hernández-Woodbine, María José; Granados-Mendoza, Sofia Carolina; Lacouture-Cárdenas, Natalia Andrea; Avendaño-Capriles, Camilo Andrés; Maheshwari, Chanchal; Iqbal, Aimen; Mahalwar, Gauranga; Shariff, Mariam; Kumar, Ashish","Rathore, Sawai Singh (Department of Internal Medicine, Dr. Sampurnanand Medical College, Jodhpur, Rajasthan, India); Iqbal, Kinza (Department of Internal Medicine, Dow Medical College, Dow University of Health Sciences, Karachi, Pakistan); Shafqat, Shameel (Department of Internal Medicine, Aga Khan University, Karachi, Pakistan); Tariq, Eleze (Department of Internal Medicine, Aga Khan University, Karachi, Pakistan); Tousif, Sohaib (Department of Internal Medicine, Ziauddin University, Karachi, Pakistan); UlHaq, Zain Ghufran (Department of Internal Medicine, Ziauddin University, Karachi, Pakistan); Fernández-Sánchez, David (Department of Internal Medicine, Universidad Del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); Hernández-Woodbine, María José (Department of Internal Medicine, Universidad Del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); Granados-Mendoza, Sofia Carolina (Department of Internal Medicine, Universidad Del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); Lacouture-Cárdenas, Natalia Andrea (Department of Internal Medicine, Universidad Del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); Avendaño-Capriles, Camilo Andrés (Department of Internal Medicine, Universidad Del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); Maheshwari, Chanchal (Department of Internal Medicine, Karachi Medical College and Hospital, Karachi, Pakistan); Iqbal, Aimen (Bahria University Medical and Dental College, Karachi, Pakistan); Mahalwar, Gauranga (Department of Internal Medicine, Cleveland Clinic Akron General, Akron, OH, USA); Shariff, Mariam (Department of Surgery, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA); Kumar, Ashish (Department of Internal Medicine, Cleveland Clinic Akron General, Akron, OH, USA; Section of Cardiovascular Research, Heart, Vascular and Thoracic Department, Cleveland Clinic Akron General, Akron, OH, USA)","Kumar, Ashish (Cleveland Clinic; Cleveland Clinic)","Rathore, Sawai Singh (Department of Internal Medicine, Dr. Sampurnanand Medical College, Jodhpur, Rajasthan, India); Iqbal, Kinza (Dow University of Health Sciences); Shafqat, Shameel (Aga Khan University); Tariq, Eleze (Aga Khan University); Tousif, Sohaib (Ziauddin University); UlHaq, Zain Ghufran (Ziauddin University); Fernández-Sánchez, David (Universidad del Norte); Hernández-Woodbine, María José (Universidad del Norte); Granados-Mendoza, Sofia Carolina (Universidad del Norte); Lacouture-Cárdenas, Natalia Andrea (Universidad del Norte); Avendaño-Capriles, Camilo Andrés (Universidad del Norte); Maheshwari, Chanchal (Department of Internal Medicine, Karachi Medical College and Hospital, Karachi, Pakistan); Iqbal, Aimen (Bahria University); Mahalwar, Gauranga (Cleveland Clinic); Shariff, Mariam (Mayo Clinic); Kumar, Ashish (Cleveland Clinic; Cleveland Clinic)",4,3,0.94,2.78,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ihj.2022.01.005,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1145197559,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3202 Clinical Sciences,3 Good Health and Well Being

Given the pronounced interspecies differences of chemical biotransformation, the present study aimed to compare biotransformation rate values and BCF predictions obtained with hepatocytes from the cold-water species, rainbow trout, to data obtained with hepatocytes of the warm-water species, common carp (Cyprinus carpio). In a first step, we adapted the protocol for the trout hepatocyte assay, including the cryopreservation method, to carp hepatocytes. The successful adaptation serves as proof of principle that the in vitro hepatocyte biotransformation assays can be technically transferred across fish species. In a second step, we compared the in vitro intrinsic clearance rates (CLin vitro, int) of two model xenobiotics, benzo[a]pyrene (BaP) and methoxychlor (MXC), in trout and carp hepatocytes. The in vitro data were used to predict in vivo biotransformation rate constants (kB) and BCFs, which were then compared to measured in vivo kB and BCF values. The CLin vitro, int values of BaP and MXC did not differ significantly between trout and carp hepatocytes, but the predicted BCF values were significantly higher in trout than in carp. In contrast, the measured in vivo BCF values did not differ significantly between the two species. A possible explanation of this discrepancy is that the existing in vitro-in vivo prediction models are parameterized only for trout but not for carp. Therefore, future research needs to develop species-specific extrapolation models.",,"This project was funded by the Fraunhofer-Gesellschaft, Germany and by Stiftung 3R, Munsingen, Switzerland (Project 141–14).",Frontiers in Toxicology,,,,2022-09-23,2022,2022-09-23,,4,,1021880,All OA; Gold,Article,"Bischof, Ina; Arnot, Jon A.; Jürling, Heinrich; Knipschild, Georg; Schlechtriem, Christian; Schauerte, Anna; Segner, Helmut","Bischof, Ina (Fraunhofer Institute for Molecular Biology and Applied Ecology, Schmallenberg, Germany; Centre for Fish and Wildlife Health, University of Bern, Bern, Switzerland); Arnot, Jon A.

Individuals with ULEDs require assistive robots to fulfill all their activities of daily living (ADLs). However, a theory for the optimal design of assistive robots that reduces energy consumption while increasing the workspace is unavailable. Thus, this research presents an algorithm for the optimal link length selection of an assistive robot mounted on a wheelchair to minimize the torque demands of each joint while increasing the workspace coverage. For this purpose, this research developed a workspace to satisfy a list of 18 ADLs. Then, three torque indices from the literature were considered as performance measures to minimize; the three torque measures are the quadratic average torque (QAT), the weighted root square mean (WRMS), and the absolute sum of torques (AST). The proposed algorithm evaluates any of the three torque measures within the workspace, given the robot dimensions. This proposed algorithm acts as an objective function, which is optimized using a genetic algorithm for each torque measure. The results show that all tree torque measures are suitable criteria for assistance robot optimization. However, each torque measures yield different optimal results; in the case of the QAT optimization, it produces the least workspace with the minimum overall torques of all the joints. Contrarily, the WRMS and AST optimization yield similar results generating the maximum workspace coverage but with a greater overall torque of all joints. Thus, the selection between the three methods depends on the designer's criteria.

However, uncertainty in the staff demand challenges the accomplishment of that objective. This research studies the personnel assignment problem considering uncertain demand and multiskilled workforce configured through a 2-chaining strategy. We develop a two-stage stochastic optimization (TSSO) approach to calculate the multiskilling requirements that minimize the training costs and the expected costs of staff surplus/shortage. Later, we evaluate and compare the performance of the TSSO approach solutions with the solutions of two alternative optimization approaches under uncertainty - robust optimization (RO) and closed-form equation (CF). These two alternative approaches were published in Henao et al. [1] and Henao et al. [2], respectively. In addition, we compare the performance of the TSSO approach solutions with the solution of the deterministic (DT) approach and the solutions of myopic multiskilling approaches. To make performance comparisons between the different approaches, we used both real and simulated data derived from a retail store operating in Chile. The results show that, for different demand variability levels, TSSO, RO, and CF always belong to the set of approaches with the lowest average total cost. That is, in this group, there are no statistical differences from one approach to another, so these approaches are the most cost-effective. We also provide insights to retail decision-makers for addressing two key aspects. First, the methodology allows to address two fundamental multiskilling issues: how much multiskilling to add and how it should be added. Second, it is provided understanding on how to select the most suitable approach according to the balance between the conservatism and the reliability associated with the solutions delivered by each approach. Finally, we identify some methodological challenges for future research, such as the evaluation of k-chaining strategies with k≥2.",,,Mathematical Biosciences and Engineering,,,Benchmarking; Cost-Benefit Analysis; Humans; Reproducibility of Results; Uncertainty,2022,2022,,2022,19,5,4946-4975,All OA; Gold,Article,"Henao, César Augusto; Batista, Ana; Porto, Andrés Felipe; González, Virginia I.","Henao, César Augusto (Department of Industrial Engineering, Universidad del Norte, Km. 5 Vía Puerto Colombia, Barranquilla, Colombia); Batista, Ana (Industrial and Systems Engineering Department, Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile, Santiago, Chile); Porto, Andrés Felipe (Department of Industrial Engineering, Corporación Universitaria Americana, Barranquilla, Colombia); González, Virginia I.

In silico analysis has led to identifying a wide range of biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) and metabolic compounds. The genome had a total of 3,558,611 bp with GC of 43.96%, harboring 3,449 protein-coding genes, among which 3,209 were assigned by the EggNOG database, and 240 hypothetical proteins have no match in the BLASTN database. It also contains 68 tRNAs, 1 23S rRNA, 1 16S rRNA, 6 5S rRNA, and 1 tmRNA. In addition, no acquired resistance genes nor virulence and pathogenic factors were predicted, indicating that UTNGt21A is a safe strain. Three areas of interest (AOI) consisting of multiple genes encoding for bacteriocins and ABC transporters were predicted with BAGEL4, while eight secondary metabolite regions were predicted with the antiSMASH web tool. GutSMASH analysis predicted one metabolic gene cluster (MGC) type pyruvate to acetate-formate, a primary metabolite region essential for anaerobe growth. Several lanthipeptides and non-ribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) clusters were detected in the UTNGt21A but not the reference genomes, suggesting that their genome diversity might be linked to its niche-specific lineage and adaptation to a specific environment. Moreover, the application of a targeted genome mining tool (RiPPMiner) uncovered a diverse arsenal of important antimicrobial molecules such as lanthipeptides. Furthermore, in vitro analysis indicated that the crude extract (CE) of UTNGt21A exerted a wide spectrum of inhibition against several pathogens. The results indicated that the possible peptide-protein extract (PC) from UTNGt21A induces morphological and ultrastructural changes of Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica ATCC51741, compatible with its inhibitory potential. Genome characterization is the basis for further in vitro and in vivo studies to explore their use as antimicrobial producers or probiotic strains.",We acknowledged Technical University of the North for funding this research and would like to express their sincere gratitude to D.

The aims of this paper were: firstly, to test the effectiveness of the programme in emotional education implemented through group segmentation based on teachers' sociodemographic and work profile factors, and secondly, to ascertain whether there were any significant differences in the factors that make up the model of emotional intelligence with regard to the sociodemographic and work variables of teachers in the experimental group in a pre-post analysis study. The design of the research was experimental. The sample was made up of 351 infant and primary education teachers, 190 in the experimental group and 161 in the control group. We used the Trait Meta-Mood Scale-24 together with a questionnaire to define teachers' sociodemographic and work profiles. Implementing the emotional education programme led to significant differences in the three factors of emotional intelligence (perception, understanding and emotional regulation) depending on the sociodemographic and work profile of the teachers in the experimental group. Applying segmentation allows us to conclude that intervention programmes should be adapted to the sociodemographic and work profile of the participant group.

However, many aspects of the biology of the species are unknown or have little information available. These include intestinal microbiota, an element that may play an important role in the nutrition and defense of cultured animals for meat production. This study compares the microbiota composition of the intestinal contents of wild and aquaculture fish to explore the microbial communities present and their potential contribution to the host. DNA was extracted from the intestinal content samples and the V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene was amplified and sequenced using the Ion Torrent platform. After the examination of the sequences, strong differences were found in the composition at the level of phylum, being Firmicutes and Tenericutes the most abundant in aquaculture and wild condition, respectively. At the genus level, the Vagococcus (54%) and Mycoplasma (97%) were the most prevalent in the microbial community of aquaculture and wild condition, respectively. The evaluation of predicted metabolic pathways in these metagenomes showed that in wild condition there is an important presence of lipid metabolism belonging to the unsaturated fatty acid synthesis. In the aquaculture condition, the metabolism of terpenoids and polyketides were relevant. To our knowledge, this is the first study to characterize and compare the intestinal microbiota of red cusk-eel (Genypterus chilensis) of wild and aquaculture origin using high-throughput sequencing.","The authors acknowledge Piero Magnolfi and all staff of the Colorado Chile S.A., for providing material and assisting during the red cusk-eel sampling.

Benchmarking low-coverage nanopore long-read sequencing for the assembling of mitochondrial genomes using the vulnerable silky shark Carcharhinus falciformis,"BackgroundWhole mitochondrial genomes are quickly becoming markers of choice for the exploration of within-species genealogical and among-species phylogenetic relationships. Most often, ‘primer walking’ or ‘long PCR’ strategies plus Sanger sequencing or low-pass whole genome sequencing using Illumina short reads are used for the assembling of mitochondrial chromosomes. In this study, we first confirmed that mitochondrial genomes can be sequenced from long reads using nanopore sequencing data exclusively. Next, we examined the accuracy of the long-reads assembled mitochondrial chromosomes when comparing them to a ‘gold’ standard reference mitochondrial chromosome assembled using Illumina short-reads sequencing.ResultsUsing a specialized bioinformatics tool, we first produced a short-reads mitochondrial genome assembly for the silky shark C. falciformis with an average base coverage of 9.8x. The complete mitochondrial genome of C. falciformis was 16,705 bp in length and 934 bp shorter than a previously assembled genome (17,639 bp in length) that used bioinformatics tools not specialized for the assembly of mitochondrial chromosomes. Next, low-pass whole genome sequencing using a MinION ONT pocket-sized platform plus customized de-novo and reference-based workflows assembled and circularized a highly accurate mitochondrial genome in the silky shark Carcharhinus falciformis. Indels at the flanks of homopolymer regions explained most of the dissimilarities observed between the ‘gold’ standard reference mitochondrial genome (assembled using Illumina short reads) and each of the long-reads mitochondrial genome assemblies. Although not completely accurate, mitophylogenomics and barcoding analyses (using entire mitogenomes and the D-Loop/Control Region, respectively) suggest that long-reads assembled mitochondrial genomes are reliable for identifying a sequenced individual, such as C. falciformis, and separating the same individual from others belonging to closely related congeneric species.ConclusionsThis study confirms that mitochondrial genomes can be sequenced from long-reads nanopore sequencing data exclusively. With further development, nanopore technology can be used to quickly test in situ mislabeling in the shark fin fishing industry and thus, improve surveillance protocols, law enforcement, and the regulation of this fishery. This study will also assist with the transferring of high-throughput sequencing technology to middle- and low-income countries so that international scientists can explore population genomics in sharks using inclusive research strategies. Lastly, we recommend assembling mitochondrial genomes using specialized assemblers instead of other assemblers developed for bacterial and/or nuclear genomes.",The author thanks Dr. Vince P.

Recent findings reveal that lncRNAs can code for micropeptides in various species. Micropeptides are generated from small open reading frames (smORFs) and have been discovered frequently in short mRNAs and non-coding RNAs, such as lncRNAs, circular RNAs, and pri-miRNAs. The most accepted definition of a smORF is an ORF containing fewer than 100 codons, and ribosome profiling and mass spectrometry are the most prevalent experimental techniques used to identify them. Although the majority of micropeptides perform critical roles throughout plant developmental processes and stress conditions, only a handful of their functions have been verified to date. Even though more research is being directed toward identifying micropeptides, there is still a dearth of information regarding these peptides in plants. This review outlines the lncRNA-encoded peptides, the evolutionary roles of such peptides in plants, and the techniques used to identify them. It also describes the functions of the pri-miRNA and circRNA-encoded peptides that have been identified in plants.",,"This work was supported by the University Grants Commission under CSIR/UGC Fellowship and Department of Biotechnology, Government of India (DBT).",Frontiers in Plant Science,,,,2022-10-24,2022,2022-10-24,,13,,975938,All OA; Gold,Article,"Sruthi, K Bharathan; Menon, Athira; P, Akash; Vasudevan Soniya, Eppurath","Sruthi, K Bharathan (Transdisciplinary Biology Lab, Rajiv Gandhi Centre for Biotechnology, Thiruvananthapuram, Kerala, India.); Menon, Athira (Transdisciplinary Biology Lab, Rajiv Gandhi Centre for Biotechnology, Thiruvananthapuram, Kerala, India.); P, Akash (Transdisciplinary Biology Lab, Rajiv Gandhi Centre for Biotechnology, Thiruvananthapuram, Kerala, India.); Vasudevan Soniya, Eppurath (Transdisciplinary Biology Lab, Rajiv Gandhi Centre for Biotechnology, Thiruvananthapuram, Kerala, India.)","Vasudevan Soniya, Eppurath (Rajiv Gandhi Centre for Biotechnology)","Sruthi, K Bharathan (Rajiv Gandhi Centre for Biotechnology); Menon, Athira (Rajiv Gandhi Centre for Biotechnology); P, Akash (Rajiv Gandhi Centre for Biotechnology); Vasudevan Soniya, Eppurath (Rajiv Gandhi Centre for Biotechnology)",7,6,0.86,3.1,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpls.2022.975938/pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1152151003,"30 Agricultural, Veterinary and Food Sciences; 3004 Crop and Pasture Production; 31 Biological Sciences; 3108 Plant Biology",

United Nations Children's Emergency Fund (UNICEF) partnered with the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) to address this important gap by investing in an advance purchase commitment (APC) mechanism to accelerate the development and evaluation of Zika rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) for case detection and surveillance. This paper describes the performance evaluation of five Zika RDTs eligible for procurement.
Methods: A network of European Union-funded ZikaPLAN sites in Africa, Asia, Latin America with access to relevant serum specimens were selected to evaluate RDTs developed for the UNICEF APC mechanism. A standardised protocol and evaluation panels were developed and a call for specimens for the evaluation panels issued to different sites. Each site contributed specimens to the evaluation from their biobank. Data were collated, analysed and presented to the UNICEF Procurement Review Group for review.
Findings: Three RDTs met the criteria for UNICEF procurement of sensitivity and specificity of 85% against a refence standard. The sensitivity/specificity of the ChemBio anti-Zika Virus (ZIKV) immunoglobulin M (IgM) test was 86.4 %/86.7% and the ChemBio ZCD system for anti-ZIKV IgM was 79.0%/97.1%, anti-dengue virus (DENV) IgM 90.0%/89.2%, anti-Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) IgM 90.6%/97.2%. The sensitivity/specificity of the SD Biosensor anti-ZIKV IgM was 96.8 %/90.8%, anti-DENV IgM 71.8%/83.5%, the DENV nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) glycoprotein 90.0%/90.2%, anti- yellow fever virus (YFV) IgM 84.6%/92.4%, anti-CHIKV IgM 86.3%/97.5%.
Interpretation: Three RDTs fulfilled the performance thresholds set by WHO and were eligible for UNICEF procurement. These tests will improve the diagnosis of ZIKV and other arboviral infections as well as providing countries with better tools for surveillance and response to future epidemics.

METHODS: We carried out a secondary data analysis of the National Health Services Users' Satisfaction Survey (ENSUSALUD), 2016. This nationally representative survey evaluates doctors and nurses working in clinical settings. We defined scientific activity as i) having published an original article (journal indexed in Web of Science, Scopus or Medline); and ii) having authored an abstract in a national or international conference. We estimated crude and adjusted disparities prevalence ratios (aDPR) and 95% confidence intervals (95%CI).
RESULTS: We included 2025 doctors and 2877 nurses in the analysis; 71% of doctors doctor were male, and 93% of nurses were female (p<0.001). Among doctors, 13.9% had published an article, and 8.4% presented an abstract at a conference in the last two years, while these proportions were 0.6% and 2.5% for nurses, respectively. The adjusted models showed that doctors, when compared to nurses, were approximately 27 times likely to have published a paper (aDPR = 27.86; 95% CI 10.46 to 74.19) and twice as likely to have authored a conference abstract (aDPR = 2.51; 95% CI 1.39 to 4.53).
CONCLUSIONS: There are important disparities in scientific activity between doctors and nurses working in clinical settings in Peru. Disparities are more significant for article publication than for authoring in conference abstracts. We suggest public policies that promote research dissemination between health professionals, with emphasis on nurses.",To Dr. Tomasa Cajas-Bravo for her help with revision and suggestions.,The author(s) received no specific funding for this work.,PLOS ONE,,Monica Guberti,Bibliometrics; Delivery of Health Care; Female; Humans; Male; Peru; Physicians; Research,2022-09-02,2022,2022-09-02,,17,9,e0273031,All OA; Gold,Article,"Vergara-Mejía, Angélica; Niño-Garcia, Roberto; Zeta-Solis, Ludwing; Soto-Becerra, Percy; Al-kassab-Córdova, Ali; Pereyra-Elías, Reneé; Cabieses, Báltica; Mezones-Holguin, Edward","Vergara-Mejía, Angélica (Universidad Nacional Hemilio Valdizán, Escuela de Postgrado, Huánuco, Perúa; Seguro Social en Salud (EsSalud), Hospital Nacional Guillermo Almenara Irigoyen, Lima, Peru); Niño-Garcia, Roberto (Universidad Nacional de Piura, Facultad de Ciencias de la Salud, Sociedad Científica de Estudiantes de Medicina de la Universidad Nacional de Piura (SOCIEMUNP), Piura, Peru); Zeta-Solis, Ludwing (Universidad Nacional de Piura, Facultad de Ciencias de la Salud, Sociedad Científica de Estudiantes de Medicina de la Universidad Nacional de Piura (SOCIEMUNP), Piura, Peru); Soto-Becerra, Percy (Universidad San Ignacio de Loyola, Centro de Excelencia en Investigaciones Económicas y Sociales en Salud, Lima, Peru; Epi-gnosis Solutions, Piura, Peru); Al-kassab-Córdova, Ali (Universidad San Ignacio de Loyola, Centro de Excelencia en Investigaciones Económicas y Sociales en Salud, Lima, Peru); Pereyra-Elías, Reneé (Nuffield Department of Population Health, University of Oxford, National Perinatal Epidemiology Unit, Oxford, United Kingdom; Facultad de Ciencias de la Salud, Universidad Peruana de Ciencias Aplicadas, Lima, Peru); Cabieses, Báltica (Facultad de Medicina Clínica Alemana, Universidad del Desarrollo, Programa de Estudios Sociales en Salud-Instituto de Ciencias e Innovación en Salud, Santiago de Chile, Chile); Mezones-Holguin, Edward (Universidad San Ignacio de Loyola, Centro de Excelencia en Investigaciones Económicas y Sociales en Salud, Lima, Peru; Epi-gnosis Solutions, Piura, Peru)","Mezones-Holguin, Edward (Universidad San Ignacio de Loyola; Epi-gnosis Solutions, Piura, Peru)","Vergara-Mejía, Angélica (Universidad Nacional Hemilio Valdizán, Escuela de Postgrado, Huánuco, Perúa; EsSALUD); Niño-Garcia, Roberto (Universidad Nacional de Piura); Zeta-Solis, Ludwing (Universidad Nacional de Piura); Soto-Becerra, Percy (Universidad San Ignacio de Loyola; Epi-gnosis Solutions, Piura, Peru); Al-kassab-Córdova, Ali (Universidad San Ignacio de Loyola); Pereyra-Elías, Reneé (University of Oxford; Peruvian University of Applied Sciences); Cabieses, Báltica (Universidad del Desarrollo); Mezones-Holguin, Edward (Universidad San Ignacio de Loyola; Epi-gnosis Solutions, Piura, Peru)",2,2,0.85,1.4,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0273031&type=printable,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1150701566,42 Health Sciences; 4203 Health Services and Systems,

This nematode is known to damage cotton, corn, and soybean crops. Hoplolaimus galeatus is also an economically important pest of turfgrasses. Despite its economical importance, no genomic resources exist for this parasite.
METHODS: Using 300 bp paired-end short read sequencing, this study estimated genome size, analyzed a nearly complete mitochondrial chromosome, and explored nuclear repetitive elements, including microsatellites, in H. galeatus for the first time. The phylogenetic placement of H. galeatus in the superfamily Tylenchoidea was also examined.
RESULTS: The average haploid genome size estimated using a k-mer approach was 517.69 Mbp. The partially assembled mitochondrial genome of H. galeatus is 16,578 bp in length and comprised of 11 protein-coding genes, two ribosomal RNA genes, and 16 transfer RNA genes. A maximum likelihood phylogenetic analysis confirmed the monophyly of the genus Hoplolaimus and the superfamily Tylenchoidea. Repetitive elements constituted  50% of the nuclear genome while half of the genome represented single- or low-copy sequences. A large portion of repetitive sequences could not be assigned to known repeat element families. Considering only annotated repetitive elements, the most ubiquitous belonged to Class II- Subclass 2-Maverick elements, Class I-LTR-Ty-3/Bel-Pao elements, and satellites. 45S ribosomal DNA was also abundant and a total of 36 SSRs were identified.This study developed genomic resources for the plant-parasitic nematode Hoplolaimus galeatus that will contribute to the better understanding of meta-population connectivity and putative genomic mechanisms involved in the exploitation of the broad range of host plants used by H. galeatus.","This work was supported by the South Carolina Cotton Board award number SC15-130.

The model heavy metal-resistant bacterium Cupriavidus metallidurans CH34 possesses cadmium and mercury resistance, as well as genes related to the catabolism of hazardous BTEX aromatic hydrocarbons. The aims of this study were to analyze the aromatic catabolic potential of C. metallidurans CH34 and to determine the functionality of the predicted benzene catabolic pathway and the influence of cadmium and mercury on benzene degradation. Three chromosome-encoded bacterial multicomponent monooxygenases (BMMs) are involved in benzene catabolic pathways. Growth assessment, intermediates identification, and gene expression analysis indicate the functionality of the benzene catabolic pathway. Strain CH34 degraded benzene via phenol and 2-hydroxymuconic semialdehyde. Transcriptional analyses revealed a transition from the expression of catechol 2,3-dioxygenase (tomB) in the early exponential phase to catechol 1,2-dioxygenase (catA1 and catA2) in the late exponential phase. The minimum inhibitory concentration to Hg (II) and Cd (II) was significantly lower in the presence of benzene, demonstrating the effect of co-contamination on bacterial growth. Notably, this study showed that C. metallidurans CH34 degraded benzene in the presence of Hg (II) or Cd (II).","The authors thank Danilo Pérez-Pantoja and Raúl Donoso for providing strain P. putida F1, vanillin, and L-phenylalanine.

In response to this challenge, the scientific community is developing a new generation of antibacterial molecules. Contributing to this effort, and inspired by the resveratrol structure, five new resveratrol-dimers (9a−9e) and one resveratrol-monomer (10a) were synthetized using 2,5-dibromo-1,4-diaminobenzene (8) as the core compound for Schiff base bridge conformation. These compounds were evaluated in vitro against pathogenic clinical isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus sp., and Listeria monocytogenes. Antibacterial activity measurements of resveratrol-Schiff base derivatives (9a−9e) and their precursors (4−8) showed high selectivity against Listeria monocytogenes, being 2.5 and 13.7 times more potent than chloramphenicol, while resveratrol showed an EC50 > 320 µg/mL on the same model.

In our study, we explored the plant defense response induced by Bacillus velezensis BBC047 in relation to its application before or after Botrytis cinerea infection of tomato plants. The inoculation of BBC047 did not considerably alter the gene expression of the tomato tissues, whereas infection with B. cinerea in BBC047-primed plants induced expression of LRR and NBS-LRR receptors, which are highly related to the ISR response. As expected, B. cinerea infection generated molecular patterns typical of a defense response to pathogen infection as the overexpression of pathogenesis-related proteins (PRs) in leaflets distant to the point of infection. The curative treatment (P + F + B) allowed us to gain insights into plant response to an inverted priming. In this treatment, B. cinerea caused the m tissue damage, extending nearly entirely across the entire infected leaves. Additionally, genes generally associated with early SAR response (<16 h) were overexpressed, and apparently, the beneficial strain was not perceived as such. Therefore, we infer that the plant defense to the curative treatment represents a higher degree of biological stress triggered by the incorporation of strain BBC047 as second arriving microorganism. We highlight the importance the phytosanitary status of plants prior to inoculation of beneficial microorganism for the biocontrol of pathogens.","We acknowledge the technical support of Stefanie Maldonado and Williams Arancibia, as well as methodological advice provided by Teodoro Coba de la Peña.

In this context, this work aimed to study the influence of cucurbit[7]uril (CB7) on dyes such as 7-(dimethylamino)-aza-coumarins, which have more than one basic site along their molecular structure. For this, three 3-styryl derivatives of 7-(dialkylamino)-aza-coumarin dyes (SAC1-3) were synthesized and characterized by NMR, ESI-HRMS and IR. The spectral behaviour of the SACs in the absence and presence of CB7 was studied. The results showed large shifts in the UV-vis spectrum in acid medium: a hypsochromic shift of ≈5400 cm-1 (SAC1-2) and ≈3500 cm-1 (SAC3) in the absence of CB7 and a bathochromic shift of ≈4500 cm-1 (SAC1-3) in the presence of CB7. The new absorptions at long and short wavelengths were assigned to the corresponding protomers by computational calculations at the density functional theory (DFT) level. Additionally, the binding mode was corroborated by molecular dynamics simulations. Findings revealed that in the presence of CB7 the heterocyclic nitrogen was preferably protonated instead of the dialkylamino group. Namely, CB7 induces a change in the protonation preference at the basic sites of the SACs, as consequence of the molecular recognition by the macrocycle.",JJA is grateful for the CONICYT Doctoral Fellowship 21170793.

It contains metals that are critical for a sustainable development of modern society. Due to a shortage of global resources of many metals, efficient large-scale processing of RM has been receiving increasing attention from both researchers and industry. This study investigated the solubilization of metals from RM, together with RM dealkalization, via sulfur (S0) oxidation catalyzed by the moderately thermophilic bacterium Sulfobacillus thermosulfidooxidans. Optimization of the bioleaching process was conducted in shake flasks and 5-L bioreactors, with varying S0:RM mass ratios and aeration rates. The ICP analysis was used to monitor the concentrations of dissolved elements from RM, and solid residues were analyzed for surface morphology, phase composition, and Na distribution using the SEM, XRD, and STXM techniques, respectively. The results show that highest metal recoveries (89% of Al, 84% of Ce, and 91% of Y) were achieved with the S0:RM mass ratio of 2:1 and aeration rate of 1 L/min. Additionally, effective dealkalization of RM was achieved under the above conditions, based on the high rates (>95%) of Na, K, and Ca dissolution. This study proves the feasibility of using bacterially catalyzed S0 oxidation to simultaneously dealkalize RM and efficiently extract valuable metals from the amassing industrial waste.","The authors would like to thank Zi-jian Xu, Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility, Shanghai Institute of Applied Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, for technical assistance and helpful discussions.",This work was supported by the Funds for International Cooperation and Exchange of the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 51861135305) and the Open Fund of Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility (2022-SSRF-PT-021591).,Frontiers in Microbiology,,,,2022-08-29,2022,2022-08-29,,13,,973568,All OA; Gold,Article,"Zhang, Duo-rui; Chen, Hong-rui; Xia, Jin-lan; Nie, Zhen-yuan; Zhang, Rui-Yong; Pakostova, Eva","Zhang, Duo-rui (School of Minerals Processing and Bioengineering, Central South University, Changsha, China; Key Lab of Biometallurgy of Ministry of Education of China, Central South University, Changsha, China); Chen, Hong-rui (School of Minerals Processing and Bioengineering, Central South University, Changsha, China; Key Lab of Biometallurgy of Ministry of Education of China, Central South University, Changsha, China); Xia, Jin-lan (School of Minerals Processing and Bioengineering, Central South University, Changsha, China; Key Lab of Biometallurgy of Ministry of Education of China, Central South University, Changsha, China); Nie, Zhen-yuan (School of Minerals Processing and Bioengineering, Central South University, Changsha, China; Key Lab of Biometallurgy of Ministry of Education of China, Central South University, Changsha, China); Zhang, Rui-Yong (School of Minerals Processing and Bioengineering, Central South University, Changsha, China; Key Lab of Biometallurgy of Ministry of Education of China, Central South University, Changsha, China; Key Laboratory of Marine Environmental Corrosion and Bio-fouling, Institute of Oceanology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Qingdao, China; Open Studio for Marine Corrosion and Protection, Pilot National Laboratory for Marine Science and Technology (Qingdao), Qingdao, China); Pakostova, Eva (Centre for Sport, Exercise and Life Sciences, Coventry University, Coventry, United Kingdom)","Xia, Jin-lan (Central South University; Central South University)","Zhang, Duo-rui (Central South University; Central South University); Chen, Hong-rui (Central South University; Central South University); Xia, Jin-lan (Central South University; Central South University); Nie, Zhen-yuan (Central South University; Central South University); Zhang, Rui-Yong (Central South University; Central South University; Institute of Oceanology; Qingdao National Laboratory for Marine Science and Technology); Pakostova, Eva (Coventry University)",8,8,0.8,2.9,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2022.973568/pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1150569566,31 Biological Sciences; 3107 Microbiology; 32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3207 Medical Microbiology,12 Responsible Consumption and Production

Autophagy is essential for cell survival, development, and homeostasis. It not only regulates cell defense and stress, but also has a close relationship with innate and adaptive immunity. Complement is an important part of innate immunity, which could be activated by three approaches, including classic, alternative, and lectin pathways. All the three pathways result in the activation of C3, and generate anaphylatoxin fragments C3a and C5a, and formation of the membrane attack complex. Either C3a or C5a induces the inflammatory cytokines through binding to C3aR or C5aR, respectively. However, it is still unknown whether the complement could regulate the autophagy of intracellular microorganisms or not. In this study, we constructed a Toxoplasma gondii (T. gondii) and macrophages co-culture experimental model using T. gondii expressing enhanced green fluorescence protein (EGFP) fluorescence and C3-/-C57BL/6 J mice for that T. gondii invaded peritoneal macrophages in mice. Western blot, laser confocal microscopy (LCM), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) were used to observe the changes of autophagy between the macrophages from wild-type (WT) and C3-/- mice. Flow cytometry and LCM were used to investigate the effect of autophagy on the killing ability of macrophages against T. gondii. Here, we found that local C3 could suppress not only the canonical autophagy of macrophage, but also the xenophagy to T. gondii. Interestingly, the inhibition of C3 on host cell autophagy could significantly suppress the clearance of T. gondii by the IFN-γ-primed macrophage. Finally, we investigated the mechanism of the autophagy regulation of C3 that the effect of C3 on the macrophage-specific autophagy against T. gondii depends on mTOR. And, there is C3a but not C5a/C5aR involved in regulating macrophage xenophagy against T. gondii. Collectively, our findings suggest locally generated C3 regulates the clearance of T. gondii by Macrophage through the regulation of the non-canonical IFN-γ-dependent autophagy pathway, and paint a clearer picture in the regulation of autophagy by innate immune components.",,This work was supported by grants from the Hygiene and Health Development Scientific Research Fostering Plan of Haidian District Beijing (HP2021-25-80101 and HP2021-25-80102).,Frontiers in Microbiology,,,,2022-08-04,2022,2022-08-04,,13,,944006,All OA; Gold,Article,"Liu, Bo; Yan, Yan; Wang, Xiaoreng; Chen, Nannan; Wu, Jue","Liu, Bo (Department of Hematology.

The aeration process response variables are defined in terms of oxygen transfer and aeration efficiency through the standard volumetric mass transfer coefficient (KLa20), standard oxygen transfer rate (SOTR), and standard aeration efficiency (SAE). Two methods of air injection were analyzed: 1. Air injection in the throat chamber of the Venturi generator; 2. air supplying in the suction side of the hydraulic pump of the aeration system. Experimental results indicate that the water renewal time variable (RT) is a statistically significant factor with respect to the KLa20, which can be maximized by decreasing RT. The effects of the variable flow ratio (FR) are greater than the effects of renewal time and area-volume ratio (AVR) concerning SOTR and SAE, indicating a maximum response with a minimum flow ratio, using the Venturi-Vortex microbubble generator. When the flow ratio decreases, the air flow increases, generating and transferring a greater amount of microbubbles (MB) into the water. It was found that increasing the air flow produced an increase in the standard oxygen transfer rate SOTR and standard aeration efficiency SAE. Results allow concluding that the injection of the air flow from the suction side of the pump promotes the generation of microbubbles (MB) for a maximum air flow allowed by the system. SOTR and SAE could be maximized whit the flow ratio factor and the Venturi-Vortex generator, supplying air flow from the suction side of the hydraulic pump.",,"This research did not receive any specific grant from funding agencies in the public, commercial, or not-for-profit sectors.",Heliyon,,,,2022-10-01,2022,2022-10-01,2022-10,8,10,e10824,All OA; Gold,Article,"De Oro Ochoa, Esteban; García, Mauricio Carmona; Padilla, Néstor Durango; Remolina, Andrés Martínez","De Oro Ochoa, Esteban (Mechanical Engineering Department, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); García, Mauricio Carmona (Mechanical Engineering Department, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); Padilla, Néstor Durango (Mechanical Engineering Department, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); Remolina, Andrés Martínez (Association for the Development of Aquaponics in Colombia “ADACOL”, Colombia)","García, Mauricio Carmona (Universidad del Norte)","De Oro Ochoa, Esteban (Universidad del Norte); García, Mauricio Carmona (Universidad del Norte); Padilla, Néstor Durango (Universidad del Norte); Remolina, Andrés Martínez (Association for the Development of Aquaponics in Colombia “ADACOL”, Colombia)",5,5,0.79,1.07,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9557901,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1151524161,40 Engineering; 4004 Chemical Engineering,

In contrast to patient-specific sources of information, mass media may potentially reach healthy people, thus preventing them from becoming part of the diabetes statistics. Articles published within a selected corpus from the years 2013 to 2018 and related to awareness regarding diabetes were sampled, and their readability was scored using Flesch Kinkaid Reading Ease (FKRE). Features of three articles ranked as the best and worst for readability were qualitatively analyzed. The average readability for the materials is low at 49.6 FKRE, which may impede the uptake of information contained in the articles. Feature analysis of articles with the best and worst readability indicates that medical practitioners may not be the best spokesperson to reach the public. It also indicates that simple sentence structures could help improve readability. There is still much room for improvement in attaining good public health literacy through mass media communication.

However, for copper metallurgy activities higher copper ion concentrations cause the ureolytic bacteria to lose their activity, leading to some difficulty in forming carbonate precipitation for copper immobilization (referred to also as ""biomineralization""). A series test tube experiments were conducted in the present work to investigate the effects of bacterial inoculation and pH conditions on the copper immobilization efficiency. The numerical simulations mainly aimed to compare with the experimental results to verify its applicability. The copper immobilization efficiency was attained through azurite precipitation under pH in a 4-6 range, while due to Cu2+ migration and diffusion, it reduced to zero under pH below 4. In case pH fell within a 7-9 range, the immobilization efficiency was attained via malachite precipitation. The copper-ammonia complexes formation reduced the immobilization efficiency to zero. The reductions were attributed either to the low degree of urea hydrolysis or to inappropriate pH conditions. The findings shed light on the necessity of securing the urease activity and modifying pH conditions using the two-step biomineralization approach while applying the MICP technology to remedy copper-rich water bodies.",,This manuscript was based upon work supported by the Shaanxi Educational Department under Grant No. 2020TD-005 through the innovative ability support scheme.,Frontiers in Microbiology,,,,2022-09-16,2022,2022-09-16,,13,,1001464,All OA; Gold,Article,"Xue, Zhong-Fei; Cheng, Wen-Chieh; Wang, Lin; Xie, Yi-Xin","Xue, Zhong-Fei (School of Civil Engineering, Xi’an University of Architecture and Technology, Xi’an, China; Shaanxi Key Laboratory of Geotechnical and Underground Space Engineering (XAUAT), Xi’an, China); Cheng, Wen-Chieh (School of Civil Engineering, Xi’an University of Architecture and Technology, Xi’an, China; Shaanxi Key Laboratory of Geotechnical and Underground Space Engineering (XAUAT), Xi’an, China); Wang, Lin (School of Civil Engineering, Xi’an University of Architecture and Technology, Xi’an, China; Shaanxi Key Laboratory of Geotechnical and Underground Space Engineering (XAUAT), Xi’an, China); Xie, Yi-Xin (School of Civil Engineering, Xi’an University of Architecture and Technology, Xi’an, China; Shaanxi Key Laboratory of Geotechnical and Underground Space Engineering (XAUAT), Xi’an, China)","Cheng, Wen-Chieh (Xi'an University of Architecture and Technology; Xi'an University of Architecture and Technology)","Xue, Zhong-Fei (Xi'an University of Architecture and Technology; Xi'an University of Architecture and Technology); Cheng, Wen-Chieh (Xi'an University of Architecture and Technology; Xi'an University of Architecture and Technology); Wang, Lin (Xi'an University of Architecture and Technology; Xi'an University of Architecture and Technology); Xie, Yi-Xin (Xi'an University of Architecture and Technology; Xi'an University of Architecture and Technology)",11,9,0.79,3.45,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2022.1001464/pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1151067356,31 Biological Sciences; 3107 Microbiology,

Soluble guanylyl cyclase (sGC) participates in signaling pathways that induce vascular vasodilation and reduce vascular remodeling. However, when sGC is oxidized and/or loses its heme group, it does not respond to nitric oxide (NO), losing its vasodilating effects. sGC protein expression and function is reduced in hypertensive neonatal lambs. Currently, NPHT is treated with NO inhalation therapy; however, new treatments are needed for improved outcomes. We used Cinaciguat (BAY-582667), which activates oxidized and/or without heme group sGC in pulmonary hypertensive lambs studied at 3,600 m. Our study included 6 Cinaciguat-treated (35 ug kg-1 day-1 x 7 days) and 6 Control neonates. We measured acute and chronic basal cardiovascular variables in pulmonary and systemic circulation, cardiovascular variables during a superimposed episode of acute hypoxia, remodeling of pulmonary arteries and changes in the right ventricle weight, vasoactive functions in small pulmonary arteries, and expression of NO-sGC-cGMP signaling pathway proteins involved in vasodilation. We observed a decrease in pulmonary arterial pressure and vascular resistance during the acute treatment. In contrast, the pulmonary pressure did not change in the chronic study due to increased cardiac output, resulting in lower pulmonary vascular resistance in the last 2 days of chronic study. The latter may have had a role in decreasing right ventricular hypertrophy, although the direct effect of Cinaciguat on the heart should also be considered. During acute hypoxia, the pulmonary vascular resistance remained low compared to the Control lambs. We observed a higher lung artery density, accompanied by reduced smooth muscle and adventitia layers in the pulmonary arteries. Additionally, vasodilator function was increased, and vasoconstrictor function was decreased, with modifications in the expression of proteins linked to pulmonary vasodilation, consistent with low pulmonary vascular resistance. In summary, Cinaciguat, an activator of sGC, induces cardiopulmonary modifications in chronically hypoxic and pulmonary hypertensive newborn lambs. Therefore, Cinaciguat is a potential therapeutic tool for reducing pulmonary vascular remodeling and/or right ventricular hypertrophy in pulmonary arterial hypertension syndrome.",In memory of our dear friend and colleague Dr. Julian T.

However, aDNA studies that examine environmental microbes routinely fail to authenticate aDNA, examine laboratory and environmental contamination, and control for biases introduced during sample processing. Here, we surveyed the available literature for environmental aDNA projects—from sample collection to data analysis—and assessed previous methodologies and approaches used in the published microbial aDNA studies. We then integrated these concepts into a case study, using shotgun metagenomics to examine methodological, technical, and analytical biases during an environmental aDNA study of soil microbes. Specifically, we compared the impact of five DNA extraction methods and eight bioinformatic pipelines on the recovery of microbial aDNA information in soil cores from extreme environments. Our results show that silica-based methods optimized for aDNA research recovered significantly more damaged and shorter reads (<100 bp) than a commercial kit or a phenol−chloroform method. Additionally, we described a stringent pipeline for data preprocessing, efficiently decreasing the representation of low-complexity and duplicated reads in our datasets and downstream analyses, reducing analytical biases in taxonomic classification.","We thank Alberto Ticuna and Roxana Herrera for their field assistance.

This pathogen activates multiple regulatory mechanisms in response to stress, and cobalamin biosynthesis might have a potential role in bacterial protection. Low temperature is a strategy used in the food industry to control bacteria proliferation; however, L. monocytogenes can grow in cold temperatures and overcome different stress conditions. In this study we selected L. monocytogenes List2-2, a strain with high tolerance to the combination of low temperature + copper, to understand whether the cobalamin biosynthesis pathway is part of the tolerance mechanism to this stress condition. For this, we characterized the transcription level of three cobalamin biosynthesis-related genes (cbiP, cbiB, and cysG) and the eutV gene, a transcriptional regulator encoding gene involved in ethanolamine metabolism, in L. monocytogenes strain List2-2 growing simultaneously under two environmental stressors: low temperature (8 °C) + copper (0.5 mM of CuSO4 × 5H2O). In addition, the gene cbiP, which encodes an essential cobyric acid synthase required in the cobalamin pathway, was deleted by homologous recombination to evaluate the impact of this gene in L. monocytogenes tolerance to a low temperature (8 °C) + different copper concentrations.ResultsBy analyzing the KEGG pathway database, twenty-two genes were involved in the cobalamin biosynthesis pathway in L. monocytogenes List2-2. The expression of genes cbiP, cbiB, and cysG, and eutV increased 6 h after the exposure to low temperature + copper. The cobalamin cbiP mutant strain List2-2ΔcbiP showed less tolerance to low temperature + copper (3 mM) than the wild-type L. monocytogenes List2-2. The addition of cyanocobalamin (5 nM) to the medium reverted the phenotype observed in List2-2ΔcbiP.ConclusionThese results indicate that cobalamin biosynthesis is necessary for L. monocytogenes growth under stress and that the cbiP gene may play a role in the survival and growth of L. monocytogenes List2-2 at low temperature + copper.",Not applicable.,"ENLACE ENL12/20.

However less is known about pathogen avoidance mechanisms underlying stigma towards SMI, specially in samples of non-industrialised societies of Latin America and the Caribbean. The primary aim of this study was to examine pathogen-disgust sensitivity and danger appraisal mechanisms in responses of stigma towards SMI.MethodsCross-sectional design with convenience sampling. Using an online survey, volunteers at the Universidad del Norte in Colombia (N = 271) provided their sociodemographic data and completed the Three-Domain Disgust Scale (TDDS). Participants were randomised to different descriptions of someone with SMI that varied in terms of aggressiveness (with and without danger) and causes of the SMI. Then, following the attribution questionnaire (AQ-27), respondents reported affective and discriminatory responses to the person in the description.ResultsIncreased disgust sensitivity to pathogen stimuli resulted in stronger reports of anger (β = .14; p = .03), and fear (β = 0.27; p < 0.001). The relationship between disgust sensitivity and discriminatory responses was indirectly mediated by fear towards SMI (Bootstrapped CI =—.04,—.009). Dangerousness attributions in the description of SMI predicted stronger feelings of anger (β = .23; p = 0.001) and fear (β = .40; p < .001), as well increased support for coercion-segregation of SMI (β = .34; p = 0.04), but less intentions to help (β = -.26; p = 0.003). The relationship between dangerousness and support for coercion was mediated by fear (Bootstrapped CI = .72, 1.37) and anger (Bootstrapped CI = .06, .44), whereas pity (Bootstrapped CI = .03, .38) and fear (Bootstrapped CI = -1.39, -.69) mediated responses of support for coercion-segregation of SMI. Attributions about causes and personal responsibility were not significantly linked to stigma towards SMI (p > 0.05).ConclusionsFindings suggested that pathogen avoidance and danger appraisal systems interplay in the generation of discriminatory behaviour towards SMI. Anti-stigma programs and policy makers would benefit from introducing strategies that challenge stereotypes of dangerousness and unpredictability by promoting positive contact with people with SMI.",We would like to thank all the volunteers who took part in this study.,This study was not funded.,BMC Psychiatry,,,Cross-Sectional Studies; Humans; Mental Disorders; Social Perception; Social Stigma; Surveys and Questionnaires,2022-05-12,2022,2022-05-12,2022-12,22,1,330,All OA; Gold,Article,"Chamorro Coneo, Ana; Aristizabal Diazgranados, Edith; Hoyos de los Rios, Olga; Aguilar Santander, Daniela","Chamorro Coneo, Ana (Psychology department, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla-Atlántico, Colombia); Aristizabal Diazgranados, Edith (Psychology department, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla-Atlántico, Colombia); Hoyos de los Rios, Olga (Psychology department, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla-Atlántico, Colombia); Aguilar Santander, Daniela (Psychology department, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla-Atlántico, Colombia)","Chamorro Coneo, Ana (Universidad del Norte)","Chamorro Coneo, Ana (Universidad del Norte); Aristizabal Diazgranados, Edith (Universidad del Norte); Hoyos de los Rios, Olga (Universidad del Norte); Aguilar Santander, Daniela (Universidad del Norte)",3,3,0.76,2.1,https://bmcpsychiatry.biomedcentral.com/track/pdf/10.1186/s12888-022-03951-x,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1147797260,42 Health Sciences; 4203 Health Services and Systems,3 Good Health and Well Being

In this work, we evaluated the effect of other non-viable L. rhamnosus strains and their peptidoglycans on the respiratory immune response and their impact on primary and secondary respiratory infections. In addition, the duration of the protective effect induced by NV1505 and PG1505 as well as their ability to protect against different Streptococcus pneumoniae serotypes were evaluated. Our results showed that among the five selected L. rhamnosus strains (CRL1505, CRL498, CRL576, UCO25A and IBL027), NV1505 and NVIBL027 improved the protection against viral and pneumococcal infections by modulating the respiratory immune response. Of note, only the PG1505 presented immunomodulatory activities when compared with the other purified peptidoglycans. Studies on alveolar macrophages showed that NV1505 and PG1505 differentially modulated the expression of IL-6, IFN-γ, IFN-β, TNF-α, OAS1, RNAseL and IL-27 genes in response to RSV infection, and IL-6, IFN-γ, IL-1β, TNF-α, CCL2, CXCL2, CXCL10 and IL-27 in response to pneumococcal challenge. Furthermore, we demonstrated that NV1505 and PG1505 treatments protected mice against secondary pneumococcal pneumonia produced by different serotypes of S. pneumoniae until 30 days after stimulation with poly(I:C). This work advances the characterization of the protective effect of NV1505 and PG1505 by demonstrating that they increase resistance against the pneumococcal serotypes 3, 6B, 14 and 19F, with an effect that lasts up to 30 days after the primary viral inflammation. The results also confirm that the immunomodulatory properties of NV1505 and PG1505 are unique and are not shared by other members of this species, and suggest the existence of a capacity to stimulate trained immunity in alveolar macrophages.",,"This study was supported by a Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research (A) (19H00965) from the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS), the research program on development of innovative technology grants (JPJ007097) from the Project of the Bio-oriented Technology Research Advancement Institution (BRAIN), and by Japan Racing Association (JRA) Livestock Industry Promotion Project to Haruki Kitazawa.

Currently, national and international guidelines recommend using Omalizumab for cases refractory to management with antihistamines. Despite advances in the knowledge of Omalizumab for the management of CU, although there are few studies in underdeveloped countries, there are many studies evaluating the impact of Omalizumab treatment. There is not clinical information related with CSU-Omalizumab in patient settled in the Caribbean area. This research aims to evaluate the management of CU with Omalizumab in a real-life scenario in Colombia.
Methodology: We conducted an observational, descriptive, and retrospective study with patient recruitment between 2014 and 2017 of individuals diagnosed with Chronic Urticaria (CU) treating allergology specialists in five Colombian cities. We included patients with CU who failed to achieve disease control after treatment for 4 weeks with fourfold doses of second-generation H1-antihistamines, as recommended by the EAACI/GA2LEN/EDF/WAO guidelines and who received treatment with Omalizumab.
Results: We included 123 patients, 73.1% (n = 90) were women. The mean age was 47.1 years (Standard Deviation, SD: 16.2). The median of the total months of disease evolution was 30 (IQR = 13-58). 81.3 % (n = 100) of patients were diagnosed with chronic spontaneous urticarial (CSU). 4.8% (n = 6) had inducible CU (CIndU), and 13.8% (n = 17) reported mixed urticaria (spontaneous CU with at least one inducible component). Regarding emotional factors, 34.9% (n = 43) of subjects indicated anxiety symptoms, 34.1% (n = 42) had exacerbations associated with stress, and 14.6% (n = 18) manifested episodes of sadness. The percentage of patients with CSU controlled according to medical criteria at 3 months with Omalizumab were 80% (n = 80/100) and at 6 months 87% (n = 87/100). The frequency of adverse events was 29.2% (n = 36), with headache being the most frequent adverse event.
Conclusions: This real-life study with Omalizumab at CU describes percentages of effectiveness and safety similar to those observed in pivotal and real-life studies conducted in other regions around the world.","We thank the patients for their voluntary participation in the study.

This study aimed to select superior soybean genotypes for performance and yield stability, from data from multi-environment trials (METs), through GGE biplot analysis that combines the main effects of the genotype (G) plus the genotype-by-environment (G×E) interaction. As well as, through path analysis, determine the direct and indirect influences of yield components on soybean grain yield, as a genotype selection strategy. Eight soybean genotypes from the breeding program of Empresa Brasileira de Pesquisa Agropecuária (EMBRAPA) were evaluated in field trials using a randomized block experimental design, in an 8 x 8 factorial scheme with four replications in eight different environments of the Cerrado of Northeastern Brazil during two crop seasons. Phenotypic performance data were measured for the number of days to flowering (NDF), height of first pod insertion (HPI), final plant height (FPH), number of days to maturity (NDM), mass of 100 grains (M100) and grain yield (GY). The results revealed that the variance due to genotype, environment, and G×E interaction was highly significant (P < 0.001) for all traits. The ST820RR, BRS 333RR, BRS SambaíbaRR, M9144RR and M9056RR genotypes exhibited the greatest GY stability in the environments studied. However, only the BRS 333RR genotype, followed by the M9144RR, was able to combine good productive performance with high yield stability. The study also revealed that the HPI and the NDM are traits that should be prioritized in the selection of soybean genotypes due to the direct and indirect effects on the GY.",,"This study was financed in part by King Saud University, Ri-yadh, Saudi Arabia under Researchers Support Project number (RSP-2021/219) awarded to MKO, AAH, and HA, and by the Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior – Brasil (CAPES) – Finance Code 001 with one awarded for author WJSS.

Plants are the main producers of AsA for humans and other non-synthesizing animals. It was immediately clear that some plant species have more AsA than others. Further studies evidenced that AsA content varies in different plant organs, in different developmental stages/environmental conditions and even within different cell compartments. With the progressive discovery of the genes of the main (Smirnoff-Wheeler) and alternative pathways coding for the enzymes involved in AsA biosynthesis in plants, the simple overexpression of those genes appeared a suitable strategy for boosting AsA content in any plant species or organ. Unfortunately, overexpression experiments mostly resulted in limited, if any, AsA increase, apparently due to a tight regulation of the biosynthetic machinery. Attempts to identify regulatory steps in the pathways that could be manipulated to obtain unlimited AsA production were also less successful than expected, confirming the difficulties in ""unleashing"" AsA synthesis. A different approach to increase AsA content has been the overexpression of genes coding for enzymes catalyzing the recycling of the oxidized forms of vitamin C, namely monodehydroascorbate and dehydroascorbate reductases. Such approach proved mostly effective in making the overexpressors apparently more resistant to some forms of environmental stress, but once more did not solve the issue of producing massive AsA amounts for human diet. However, it should also be considered that a hypothetical unlimited increase in AsA content is likely to interfere with plant development, which is in many ways regulated by AsA availability itself. The present review article aims at summarizing the many attempts made so far to improve AsA production/content in plants, evidencing the most promising ones, and at providing information about the possible unexpected consequences of a pure biotechnological approach not keeping into account the peculiar features of the AsA system in plants.",We apologized with the many colleagues whose work could not be mentioned here for space limitations.

Despite the essential functions conferred by microbes, the source and acquisition of the rhizosphere are not entirely clear. Therefore, we investigated microbial community diversity and potential source using the only two native Antarctic plants, Deschampsia antarctica (Da) and Colobanthus quitensis (Cq), as models. We interrogated rhizosphere and bulk soil microbiomes at six locations in the Byers Peninsula, Livingston Island, Antarctica, both individual plant species and their association (Da.Cq). Our results show that host plant species influenced the richness and diversity of bacterial communities in the rhizosphere. Here, the Da rhizosphere showed the lowest richness and diversity of bacteria compared to Cq and Da.Cq rhizospheres. In contrast, for rhizosphere fungal communities, plant species only influenced diversity, whereas the rhizosphere of Da exhibited higher fungal diversity than the Cq rhizosphere. Also, we found that environmental geographic pressures (i.e., sampling site, latitude, and altitude) and, to a lesser extent, biotic factors (i.e., plant species) determined the species turnover between microbial communities. Moreover, our analysis shows that the sources of the bacterial communities in the rhizosphere were local soils that contributed to homogenizing the community composition of the different plant species growing in the same sampling site. In contrast, the sources of rhizosphere fungi were local (for Da and Da.Cq) and distant soils (for Cq). Here, the host plant species have a specific effect in acquiring fungal communities to the rhizosphere. However, the contribution of unknown sources to the fungal rhizosphere (especially in Da and Da.Cq) indicates the existence of relevant stochastic processes in acquiring these microbes. Our study shows that rhizosphere microbial communities differ in their composition and diversity. These differences are explained mainly by the microbial composition of the soils that harbor them, acting together with plant species-specific effects. Both plant species acquire bacteria from local soils to form part of their rhizosphere. Seemingly, the acquisition process is more complex for fungi. We identified a significant contribution from unknown fungal sources due to stochastic processes and known sources from soils across the Byers Peninsula.","We would like to thank George Washington University’s high-performance computing facility, Pegasus, for providing data storage, support, and computing power for genomic analyses (https://colonialone.gwu.edu/pegasus/).

We also determined whether the differences in As(III) resistance levels presented by the strains could be attributed to changes in the sequence or structure of this protein. In this context, we found that based on acr3 sequences the strains isolated from the SH grouped together phylogenetically, even though clustering based on gene sequence identity did not reflect the strain's geographical origin. Furthermore, we determined the genetic context of the acr3 sequences and found that there are two versions of the organization of acr3 gene clusters, that do not reflect the strain's origin nor arsenic resistance level. We also contribute to the knowledge regarding structure of the Acr3 protein and its possible implications on the functionality of the pump, finding that although important and conserved components of this family of proteins are present, there are several changes in the amino acidic sequences that may affect the interactions among amino acids in the 3D model, which in fact are evidenced as changes in the structure and residues contacts. Finally, we demonstrated through heterologous expression that the Exiguobacterium Acr3 pump does indeed improve the organisms As resistance level, as evidenced in the complemented E. coli strains. The understanding of arsenic detoxification processes in prokaryotes has vast biotechnological potential and it can also provide a lot of information to understand the processes of evolutionary adaptation.",We thank the illustrator Florence Gutzwiller for Figure 1 (https://spideryscrawl-illustration.webnode.com/).,"This research was sponsored by ANID (Agencia Nacional de Investigación y Desarrollo de Chile) grants.

We evaluated its performance in controls, Peruvians with MCI or AD.
METHODS: A cross-sectional study of older adults attending a neurology institute in Lima (Peru) with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), ad or cognitively healthy. Test-retest reliability (intraclass correlation coefficient, ICC; internal consistency, Cronbach's alpha) and validity were assessed.
RESULTS: We enrolled 276 individuals (ad: 113, MCI: 68, controls: 95) with no age, sex, educational level, and depressive symptom differences. Reliability was ideal (ICC: .996), and Cronbach's alpha was adequate (.937). The ADCS-ADL could not differentiate MCI from controls but did differentiate ad severity. The ADCS-ADL correlated highly with nearly all tools.
CONCLUSIONS: The ADCS-ADL scale is reliable in a population with ad in Lima, Peru. Future work may validate a tool for Peruvians with lower educational levels.",,"FundingThe author disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This work was supported by the National Institute on Aging (1R56AG069118-01, 5P30AG059299).",American Journal of Alzheimer's Disease & Other Dementias®,,,Activities of Daily Living;

AOPs are constructed in modules that include key events (KEs) and key event relationships (KERs). This modular structure facilitates AOP expansion and network development. AOP development requires finding relevant information to evaluate the weight of evidence supporting each KER. To do this, the use of transparent/reproducible search methods, such as systematic review (SR), have been proposed. Applying SR to AOP development in a data-rich area is difficult as SR requires screening each article returned from a search. Here we describe a case study to integrate a single new KE into an existing AOP. We explored the use of SR concepts and software to conduct a transparent and documented literature search to identify empirical data supporting the incorporation of a new KE, increase in cellular reactive oxygen species (ROS), upstream of an existing AOP: ""Oxidative DNA Damage Leading to Chromosomal Aberrations and Mutations"". Connecting this KE to the AOP is supported by the development of five new KERs, the most important being the first adjacent KER (increase in ROS leading to oxidative DNA damage). We initially searched for evidence of all five KERs and screened 100 papers to develop a preliminary evidence map. After removing papers not containing relevant data based on our Population, Exposure, Comparator and Outcome statement, 39 articles supported one or more KERs; these primarily addressed temporal or dose concordance of the non-adjacent KERs with limited evidence supporting the first adjacent KER. We thus conducted a second focused set of searches using search terms for specific methodologies to measure these first two KEs. After screening, 12 articles were identified that contained quantitative evidence supporting the first adjacent KER. Given that integrating a new KE into an existing AOP requires the development of multiple KERs, this approach of building a preliminary evidence map, focusing evidence gathering on the first adjacent KER, and applying reproducible search strategies using specific methodologies for the first adjacent KER, enabled us to prioritize studies to support expansion of this data-rich AOP.",We thank Eunnara Cho and Tatiana Kozbenko for their training and guidance.

The factors affecting patients with early death remain poorly defined. We aimed to study the demographic and clinicopathologic pattern and to develop and validate a prediction model for PHEO/PGL patients with early death.
Methods: Data of 800 participants were collected from the Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) database as a construction cohort, while data of 340 participants were selected as a validation cohort. Risk factors considered included the year of diagnosis, age at diagnosis, gender, marital status, race, insurance status, tumor type, primary location, laterality, the presence of distant metastasis. Univariate and multivariate logistic regressions were performed to determine the risk factors. R software was used to generate the nomogram. Calibration ability, discrimination ability, and decision curve analysis were analyzed in both construction and validation cohorts.
Results: PHEO and PGL patients accounted for 54.3% (N=434) and 45.7% (N=366), respectively. More than half of tumors (N=401, 50.1%) occurred in the adrenal gland, while 16.9% (N=135) were in aortic/carotid bodies. For the entire cohort, the median overall survival (OS) was 116.0 (95% CI: 101.5-130.5) months. The multivariate analysis revealed that older age (versus age younger than 31; age between 31 and 60: OR=2.03, 95% CI: 1.03-4.03, P=0.042; age older than 60: OR=5.46, 95% CI: 2.68-11.12, P<0.001), female gender (versus male gender; OR=0.59, 95% CI: 0.41-0.87, P=0.007), tumor located in aortic/carotid bodies (versus tumor located in adrenal gland; OR=0.49, 95% CI: 0.27-0.87, P=0.015) and the presence of distant metastasis (versus without distant metastasis; OR=4.80, 95% CI: 3.18-7.23, P<0.001) were independent risk factors of early death. The predictive nomogram included variables: age at diagnosis, gender, primary tumor location, and distant metastasis. The model had satisfactory discrimination and calibration performance: Harrell's C statistics of the prediction model were 0.733 in the construction cohort and 0.716 in the validation cohort. The calibration analysis showed acceptable coherence between predicted probabilities and observed probabilities.
Conclusions: We developed and validated a predictive nomogram utilizing data from the SEER database with satisfactory discrimination and calibration capability which can be used for early death prediction for PHEO/PGL patients.",,The present study was sponsored by Natural Science Foundation of China (82011530050).,Frontiers in Oncology,,,,2022-02-25,2022,2022-02-25,,12,,770958,All OA; Gold,Article,"Li, Huiyang; Abbas, Kirellos Said; Abdelazeem, Basel; Xu, Yao; Lin, Yile; Wu, Haixiao; Chekhonin, Vladimir P.; Peltzer, Karl; Zhang, Chao","Li, Huiyang (Department of Obstetrics & Gynecology, Tianjin Medical University General Hospital, Tianjin, China; Tianjin Key Laboratory of Female Reproductive Health and Eugenics, Tianjin, China; The Sino-Russian Joint Research Center for Bone Metastasis in Malignant Tumor, Tianjin, China); Abbas, Kirellos Said (The Sino-Russian Joint Research Center for Bone Metastasis in Malignant Tumor, Tianjin, China; Faculty of Medicine, Alexandria University, Alexandria, Egypt); Abdelazeem, Basel (The Sino-Russian Joint Research Center for Bone Metastasis in Malignant Tumor, Tianjin, China; McLaren Health Care, Flint/Michigan State University, Michigan City, MI, United States); Xu, Yao (The Sino-Russian Joint Research Center for Bone Metastasis in Malignant Tumor, Tianjin, China; Department of Bone and Soft Tissue Tumors, Tianjin Medical University Cancer Institute and Hospital, National Clinical Research Center for Cancer, Key Laboratory of Cancer Prevention and Therapy, Tianjin’s Clinical Research Center for Cancer, Tianjin, China); Lin, Yile (The Sino-Russian Joint Research Center for Bone Metastasis in Malignant Tumor, Tianjin, China); Wu, Haixiao (The Sino-Russian Joint Research Center for Bone Metastasis in Malignant Tumor, Tianjin, China; Department of Bone and Soft Tissue Tumors, Tianjin Medical University Cancer Institute and Hospital, National Clinical Research Center for Cancer, Key Laboratory of Cancer Prevention and Therapy, Tianjin’s Clinical Research Center for Cancer, Tianjin, China); Chekhonin, Vladimir P.

Invasive cell migration has been linked to the aberrant expression of transmembrane solute-linked carriers (SLC). Here, we explore the role of glucose (SLC5A1) and inositol transporters (SLC5A3) in GBM cell migration. (2) Methods: Using immunofluorescence microscopy, we visualized the subcellular localization of SLC5A1 and SLC5A3 in two highly motile human GBM cell lines. We also employed wound-healing assays to examine the effect of SLC inhibition on GBM cell migration and examined the chemotactic potential of inositol. (3) Results: While GBM cell migration was significantly increased by extracellular inositol and glucose, it was strongly impaired by SLC transporter inhibition. In the GBM cell monolayers, both SLCs were exclusively detected in the migrating cells at the monolayer edge. In single GBM cells, both transporters were primarily localized at the leading edge of the lamellipodium. Interestingly, in GBM cells migrating via blebbing, SLC5A1 and SLC5A3 were predominantly detected in nascent and mature blebs, respectively. (4) Conclusion: We provide several lines of evidence for the involvement of SLC5A1 and SLC5A3 in GBM cell migration, thereby complementing the migration-associated transportome. Our findings suggest that SLC inhibition is a promising approach to GBM treatment.",,This research received no external funding.,Cancers,,"Sheila K.

We recently isolated an arsenate-dependent growing bacterium from volcanic arsenic-bearing environments in Northern Chile, Fusibacter sp. strain 3D3 (Fas) and studied the arsenic metabolism in this Gram-positive isolate. Features of Fas deduced from genome analysis and comparative analysis with other arsenate-reducing microorganisms revealed the lack of ArrAB coding genes and the occurrence of two arsC genes encoding for putative cytoplasmic arsenate reductases named ArsC-1 and ArsC-2. Interestingly, ArsC-1 and ArsC-2 belong to the thioredoxin-coupled family (because of the redox-active disulfide protein used as reductant), but they conferred differential arsenate resistance to the E. coli WC3110 ΔarsC strain. PCR experiments confirmed the absence of arrAB genes and results obtained using uncouplers revealed that Fas growth is linked to the proton gradient. In addition, Fas harbors ferredoxin-NAD+ oxidoreductase (Rnf) and electron transfer flavoprotein (etf) coding genes. These are key molecular markers of a recently discovered flavin-based electron bifurcation mechanism involved in energy conservation, mainly in anaerobic metabolisms regulated by the cellular redox state and mostly associated with cytoplasmic enzyme complexes. At least three electron-bifurcating flavoenzyme complexes were evidenced in Fas, some of them shared in conserved genomic regions by other members of the Fusibacter genus. These physiological and genomic findings permit us to hypothesize the existence of an uncharacterized arsenate-dependent growth metabolism regulated by the cellular redox state in the Fusibacter genus.","The authors are appreciative of the technical support of Olga Encalada, Antonio Serrano, Lorena Escudero, Cinthya Tebes-Cayo, Nia Oetiker, and of María Celia Chong D. for her support in the model designing.

The nonlinearity and spatiotemporal variability of the interactions between different flow phases makes the multi-phase flow measurement a challenging task. Two Sliding Mode Observer (SMO) schemes are proposed in this study for the state estimation of a decentralized multi-phase flow measurement system. The developed observers are shown to be theoretically valid and numerically applicable for a real-life case study data. The multi-phase flow system considered in this paper can be described as two interconnected sub-systems including fluid and gas sub-systems, and two scenarios are considered in the design of the observers. The first scenario considers the interconnections as bounded disturbance (SMOD), while the second scenario considers the interconnections as an uncertainty (SMOU). Hence, the Sliding Mode Observers are adopted to mitigate the effects of disturbance in the system and uncertainties in the parameters. Numerical simulations are conducted using MATLAB and dynamic HYSYS simultaneously, using the data obtained from field-based multi-phase flow measurements. The results demonstrate the appropriateness and robustness of the proposed Sliding Mode Observer (SMO) for estimation of the multi-phase fluid specifications including the density, velocity, and the volume phases fraction in each subsystem. The analysis of the results highlights that the proposed model is computationally efficient with fast transient response, accurate tracking capability of the real process data, and very low steady-state error. This study shows that choosing an appropriate Lyapunov-Krasovsky function results in the asymptotic stability of the decentralized system and improves the performance of the proposed observers. Uncertainty analysis is conducted on the velocity estimation results obtained from the Sliding Observers. Overall, SMOU method shown better performance with RMSE of 0.24%, while RMSE of 0.46% was achieved for the SMOD. Comparison of the numerical results with the field-based flow measurement, as a benchmark, shows that although uncertainty in SMOU is approximately half of the uncertainty in SMOD, state estimation for both schemes was achieved in a finite time with high order of precision. It was shown that both observers developed in this study are well capable of estimating the multi-phase flow variables and states.",,"This research did not receive any specific grant from funding agencies in the public, commercial, or not-for-profit sectors.",Heliyon,,,,2022-01-19,2022,2022-01-19,2022-02,8,2,e08768,All OA; Gold,Article,"Farahani, Abolfazl Varvani; Abolfathi, Soroush","Farahani, Abolfazl Varvani (Faculty of Engineering, Shahid Beheshti University, Tehran, Iran); Abolfathi, Soroush (School of Engineering, University of Warwick, Coventry, UK)","Farahani, Abolfazl Varvani (Shahid Beheshti University)","Farahani, Abolfazl Varvani (Shahid Beheshti University); Abolfathi, Soroush (University of Warwick)",14,10,0.68,7.73,https://wrap.warwick.ac.uk/162034/13/WRAP-Sliding-mode-observer-design-decentralized-multi-phase-flow-estimation-2022.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1144778627,"40 Engineering; 4007 Control Engineering, Mechatronics and Robotics; 4010 Engineering Practice and Education",7 Affordable and Clean Energy

The aim of this study is to analyze the effect of socioeconomic conditions on self-rated health from a generational perspective, its differential effect on gender, and its influence on the gender gap in order to explore health diversity using a multidisciplinary approach and considering policy implications in Eastern European countries.
METHODS: We used data drawn from the European Health Interview Survey for eight Eastern European countries and EUROSTAT from 2006 through to 2009. We conducted multilevel analyses to understand the individual and national health determinants of self-rated health by gender and to determine whether national differences remain after controlling for micro variables. In order to analyze the role of equity (Gini quartile) in gender differences, Oaxaca analyses were used.
RESULTS: The self-rated health gender gap increases with age. Individual characteristics, such as educational level or smoking, influence citizens' perceived health, and have a stronger effect on women than on men. Knowing both the characteristics (endowment effects) and the effects of individual characteristics (coefficient effects) on health is important in order to understand gender gaps among people from the silent generation.
CONCLUSIONS: Our research indicates that random effects are greater for men than for women. Moreover, random effects might be explained to a certain extent by economic equity (Gini index). The combined effects of gender, cohort, and geographical differences on self-rated health have to be taken into account to develop public health policies.",,"This research was funded by the Government of Aragón (Reference Group BYCS S16_17R) and co-financed with Feder 2014–2020 “Building Europe from Aragón” and the Ministry of Economy, Industry and Competitiveness, Government of Spain, grant number: “CSO2017-82110-R”.

It can lead to serious issues such as rickets, periodontitis, osteoporosis, weakness, muscle ache, and depression. This study was conducted to determine the vitamin D status of patients with CKD in Pakistan and evaluate the correlation between serum vitamin D and renal function progression. Methodology A retrospective study enrolled patients who visited Liaquat National Hospital, Karachi, Pakistan, from January 2015 to January 2021 with a primary diagnosis of CKD. Anthropometric, laboratory, and demographic data were collected from the hospital management information system (HMIS). Results A total of 513 patients with CKD were included in the study. More than 50% of the patients were from stage 3 to stage 5 of CKD while the rest were from stage 1 and stage 2. Significant differences are in relation to calcium, phosphate, and albumin across categories of severity of CKD. Calcium is lowest in stage 5 while phosphate is highest in stage 5. Vitamin D deficiency was found in all participants, but serum vitamin D concentration was lowest in stage 5, i.e., 8.14+6.00. The changing of vitamin D level was associated with the severity of CKD staging (p-value=0.003). Conclusion The current study has shown that vitamin D deficiency, calcium deficiency, and hyperphosphatemia are more common in patients with CKD, but their severity is more common in advanced stages of CKD.",,,Cureus,,"Alexander Muacevic, John R Adler",,2022-01-13,2022,2022-01-13,2022-01-13,14,1,e21221,All OA; Gold,Article,"Kantas, Theodosios; Capriles, Camilo Andrés Avendaño; Babor, Sabir; Tamdin, Tenzin; Al-Rihani, Hady; Thalla, Anusha; Abdelmawla, Ahmed Adel; Muthanna, Fares Mohammed Saeed; Tousif, Sohaib; Capriles, Camilo Andres Avendaño; Tanding, Tenzing","Kantas, Theodosios (); Capriles, Camilo Andrés Avendaño (); Babor, Sabir (); Tamdin, Tenzin (); Al-Rihani, Hady (); Thalla, Anusha (); Abdelmawla, Ahmed Adel (); Muthanna, Fares Mohammed Saeed (); Tousif, Sohaib (); Capriles, Camilo Andres Avendaño (); Tanding, Tenzing ()","Muthanna, Fares Mohammed Saeed ()","Kantas, Theodosios (); Capriles, Camilo Andrés Avendaño (); Babor, Sabir (); Tamdin, Tenzin (); Al-Rihani, Hady (); Thalla, Anusha (); Abdelmawla, Ahmed Adel (); Muthanna, Fares Mohammed Saeed (); Tousif, Sohaib (); Capriles, Camilo Andres Avendaño (); Tanding, Tenzing ()",3,2,0.65,2.08,https://assets.cureus.com/uploads/original_article/pdf/82236/20220317-1132-1ixzlhl.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1144676958,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3202 Clinical Sciences,

Consequently, they need to scavenge cholesterol from the host cell by either enhancing the uptake of extracellular cholesterol sources or by upregulating host cellular de-novo biosynthesis. Given that Eimeria bovis macromeront formation in bovine lymphatic endothelial host cells in vivo is a highly cholesterol-demanding process, we here examined host parasite interactions based on host cellular uptake of different low-density lipoprotein (LDL) types, i.e., of non-modified (LDL), oxidized (oxLDL), and acetylated LDL (acLDL). Furthermore, the expression of lipoprotein-oxidized receptor 1 (LOX-1), which mediates acLDL and oxLDL internalization, was monitored throughout first merogony, in vitro and ex vivo. Moreover, the effects of inhibitors blocking exogenous sterol uptake or intracellular transport were studied during E. bovis macromeront formation in vitro. Hence, E. bovis-infected primary bovine umbilical vein endothelial cells (BUVEC) were treated with inhibitors of sterol uptake (ezetimibe, poly-C, poly-I, sucrose) and of intracellular sterol transport and release from endosomes (progesterone, U18666A). As a read-out system, the size and number of macromeronts as well as merozoite I production were estimated. Overall, the internalization of all LDL modifications (LDL, oxLDL, acLDL) was observed in E. bovis-infected BUVEC but to different extents. Supplementation with oxLDL and acLDL at lower concentrations (5 and 10 µg/ml, respectively) resulted in a slight increase of both macromeront numbers and size; however, at higher concentrations (25-50 µg/ml), merozoite I production was diminished. LOX-1 expression was enhanced in E. bovis-infected BUVEC, especially toward the end of merogony. As an interesting finding, ezetimibe treatments led to a highly significant blockage of macromeront development and merozoite I production confirming the relevance of sterol uptake for intracellular parasite development. Less prominent effects were induced by non-specific inhibition of LDL internalization via sucrose, poly-I, and poly-C. In addition, blockage of cholesterol transport via progesterone and U18666A treatments resulted in significant inhibition of parasite development. Overall, current data underline the relevance of exogenous sterol uptake and intracellular cholesterol transport for adequate E. bovis macromeront development, unfolding new perspectives for novel drug targets against E. bovis.","The authors wish to acknowledge Axel Wehrend and all staff members of the Clinic for Obstetrics, Gynecology and Andrology of Large and Small Animals, Justus Liebig University Giessen (Giessen, Germany) for the continuous supply of bovine umbilical cords for BUVEC isolation.

Desde el primer reporte en la provincia de Wuhan (China) en el año 2019, el SARS-CoV-2 se ha diseminado por todo el mundo, provocando un enorme impacto en la salud pública. Para su diagnóstico, la Organización Mundial de la Salud ha incentivado el desarrollo de pruebas rápidas, de simple ejecución, sensibles y específicas, que complementan la RT-qPCR como prueba de referencia. La prueba RT-LAMP ha mostrado ser una excelente alternativa para la detección del SARS-CoV-2 en diferentes biofluidos.
OBJETIVO: Validar la técnica RT-LAMP colorimétrica en muestras de hisopado nasofaríngeo previamente confirmadas por RT-qPCR, usando el protocolo Charité, Berlín, Alemania. Materiales y métodos. Un total de 153 muestras de hisopado nasofaríngeo de individuos con sospecha de COVID-19 se sometieron a RT-qPCR y RT-LAMP, usando un estuche comercial colorimétrico (NEB, Germany). La RT-LAMP se practicó con las muestras de ARN extraídas del hisopado nasofaríngeo y con muestras crudas sin previa extracción de ARN. El resultado fue evaluado por un simple cambio de color en la reacción.
RESULTADOS: La sensibilidad y especificidad de la técnica RT-LAMP para detectar el gen N del SARS-CoV-2 mediante un set de cebadores previamente reportados (set de Broughton), arrojó valores de 0,97 (0,85-1,00) y 0,81 (0,65-0,92), respectivamente, con un intervalo de confianza del 95%. Otro set de cebadores dirigidos contra otra región del mismo gen (set de Lalli) arrojó valores de sensibilidad y especificidad de 0,96 (0,78-1,00) y 0,77 (0,55-0,92), respectivamente. Sin previa extracción de ARN, se encontró que la sensibilidad fue del 0,95 (0,74-1,00) y la especificidad del 0,88 (0,64-0,99).
CONCLUSIONES: Estos resultados evidencian que la técnica RT-LAMP podría considerarse una prueba diagnóstica rápida, de fácil ejecución, libre de equipos sofisticados, sensible y específica, para el diagnóstico del SARS-CoV-2 en muestras de hisopados nasofaríngeos.","Agradecemos a la Secretaría de Salud del Distrito de Barranquilla, a la Secretaría de Salud del Departamento del Atlántico y al Instituto Nacional de Salud, por el apoyo logístico en relación con las muestras clínicas y su remisión a la Unidad de Genética y Biología Molecular de la Universidad Simón Bolívar.

In the past 28 years, the South African government has tried to implement policies in order to advance political and socioeconomic shifts toward a more equitable society. The healthcare sector was an early target for transformation that was aimed at increasing access to services and the expansion of primary healthcare and hospital facilities to previously underserved areas. This paper seeks to discuss these changes in broad terms, but with specific reference to general health care and pharmacy practice in particular. It will look at the changes in the legislative framework and pharmacy education and factors impacting the pharmacy practices in South Africa over the past 28 years. A discussion of the critical issues that have affected the profession in the last three decades will also be delineated, and future prospects for the profession as a whole, in terms of pharmacy practice and perspectives, will be discussed. We review the current aspects of the pharmacy profession in South Africa today and how the education of those future professionals is a major contribution to the pharmaceutical climate.",,This research received no external funding.,Pharmacy,,,,2022-12-21,2022,2022-12-21,,11,1,3,All OA; Gold,Article,"Mosiane, Thokozile; Nkonde, Kalaba; Mahlatsi, Gauda; Mncwangi, Nontobeko P","Mosiane, Thokozile (School of Pharmacy, Department of Pharmacy Practice, Sefako Makgatho Health Sciences University, P.O.

The study aimed to evaluate the psychometric properties of the Environmental Reward Observation Scale (EROS-R) in a sample of psychiatric patients. A sample of 228 psychiatric patients of both sexes (56.1% men and 43.9% women) aged between 18 and 70 years was selected. Along with the EROS-R, other instruments were administered to assess depression and anxiety. The results show that the scale fits a unidimensional model, presenting adequate fit indices (RMSEA = 0.077 (IC 90% 0.055−0.100); SRMR = 0.048; CFI = 0.98; TLI = 0.98). It was also shown that the degree of reward provided by the environment (EROS-R) correlates negatively with the level of depression (ρ = −0.54; p < 0.01) and anxiety (ρ = −0.34; p < 0.01). From the IRT perspective, all the items present adequate discrimination indices, where item 4 is the most precise indicator to measure the degree of environmental reward. All this leads us to conclude that the EROS-R is an instrument with robust psychometric guarantees from TCT and IRT’s perspectives, making it suitable for use in clinical contexts.",We thank the Universidad Norbert Wiener for excellently implementing its research support policies.

Due to the limited number of cases described in literature, guidelines regarding non-surgical treatment, prognosis, and management remain equivocal. Among the mesenchymal tumors of the penis, leiomyosarcoma has the highest propensity for recurrence. It originates in the smooth muscle cells from two distinct locations: superficial and deep. The deep subtype is the most aggressive and has the highest potential for metastasis. Surgical treatment should be implemented early and must be locally aggressive.

However, this association has been almost exclusively explored in people in a different-sex couple relationship, and there is little evidence referring to gay, lesbian, and bisexual (LGB) people in a same-sex relationship. The present study examines the association between romantic attachment and dyadic forgiveness in individuals involved in a same-sex couple relationship. (2) Methods: A total of 248 participants (52.8% female) aged 18-67 years (mean age: 31.02 ± 9.39) completed the Experiences in Close Relationships questionnaire and the Transgression-Related Interpersonal Motivation Inventory. (3) Results: Structural equation modeling showed that attachment avoidance was more strongly associated with dyadic forgiveness than attachment anxiety. Higher levels of attachment anxiety and avoidance were both linked to higher levels of avoidance motivation in response to partner transgressions, and higher attachment avoidance was linked to lower benevolence motivation. Multigroup analyses indicated a gender-specific association between attachment avoidance and revenge motivations, which was positive and significant among men only. (4) Conclusions: In the present study, we have identified that attachment avoidance plays a more prominent role in the tendency to forgive in same-sex couples.

The MAAS-5 has been used in different countries; however, an assessment of its cross-cultural measurement invariance (MI) has not been conducted. Therefore, the study aimed to evaluate the cross-cultural measurement invariance of the MAAS-5 in university students from two countries: Peru and Mexico. A total of 1144 university students from Peru (N = 822) and Mexico (N = 322) responded online to the Spanish version of the 5-item Mindful Attention Awareness Scale (MAAS-5). A multigroup confirmatory factor analysis was performed. Measurement invariance tests the hypothesis that the model behind a set of scores is comparable between groups. The results showed that the unidimensional structure of the MAAS-5 is the same between Peruvian and Mexican university students. Therefore, it is suggested that university students from both countries conceptualize the mindfulness in a similar way. As a result, the MAAS-5 can be used to compare differences between countries. No significant differences were observed in the MAAS-5 score between Peruvian and Mexican university students. The present study contributes to a better understanding of the psychometric properties of the MAAS-5 by presenting MI results in two Latin American countries.

T. gondii can evade the host's immune response, a process known as immune evasion. Our main objective was to evaluate the role played by Sirtuin1 (SIRT1) [one of the sirtuins (SIRTs) that are a family of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD)-dependent histone deacetylases (HDACs)] in the T. gondii infection of RAW264.7 macrophages. In this study, we evaluated and observed alterations in the activity, expression, and localization of SIRT1 and assessed its involvement in the CD154/IFN-γ (CD40 ligand/interferon gamma) killing pathway and in autophagy during T. gondii infection. The inhibition of SIRT1 in host cells effectively reduced the number of intracellular tachyzoites, and the mechanism behind this effect might be the upregulation of IRGM1 [murine ortholog of IRGM (immunity-related GTPase family M)] and the initiation of autophagy. To the best of our knowledge, our study is the first to prove that T. gondii infection upregulates SIRT1 in RAW264.7 cells and that the inhibition of SIRT1 reduces the number of intracellular tachyzoites. Moreover, the upregulation of IRGM1 and the activation of autophagy may contribute to the intracellular inhibition of T. gondii caused by SIRT1 inhibition.",,This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant Nos. 81902086 and 81672048).,Frontiers in Microbiology,,,,2022-11-17,2022,2022-11-17,,13,,1017696,All OA; Gold,Article,"Dong, Kai; Jiang, Ziyang; Zhang, Jianhui; Qin, Hanxiao; Chen, Jianping; Chen, Qiwei","Dong, Kai (Department of Parasitology, West China School of Basic Medical Sciences and Forensic Medicine, Sichuan University, Chengdu, China); Jiang, Ziyang (Department of Parasitology, West China School of Basic Medical Sciences and Forensic Medicine, Sichuan University, Chengdu, China); Zhang, Jianhui (Department of Parasitology, West China School of Basic Medical Sciences and Forensic Medicine, Sichuan University, Chengdu, China); Qin, Hanxiao (Department of Parasitology, West China School of Basic Medical Sciences and Forensic Medicine, Sichuan University, Chengdu, China); Chen, Jianping (Department of Parasitology, West China School of Basic Medical Sciences and Forensic Medicine, Sichuan University, Chengdu, China; Animal Disease Prevention and Food Safety Key Laboratory of Sichuan Province, Chengdu, China); Chen, Qiwei (Department of Parasitology, West China School of Basic Medical Sciences and Forensic Medicine, Sichuan University, Chengdu, China)","Chen, Jianping (Sichuan University; Animal Disease Prevention and Food Safety Key Laboratory of Sichuan Province, Chengdu, China); Chen, Qiwei (Sichuan University)","Dong, Kai (Sichuan University); Jiang, Ziyang (Sichuan University); Zhang, Jianhui (Sichuan University); Qin, Hanxiao (Sichuan University); Chen, Jianping (Sichuan University; Animal Disease Prevention and Food Safety Key Laboratory of Sichuan Province, Chengdu, China); Chen, Qiwei (Sichuan University)",3,3,0.59,1.09,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2022.1017696/pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1152823096,31 Biological Sciences; 3107 Microbiology; 32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3207 Medical Microbiology,

We developed a protocol for viability determination and storage of E. racemosa pollen for breeding new varieties. The medium components for E. racemosa pollen germination was optimized by using an Orthogonal Assay Test Strategy (OATS). The germination rates of E. racemosa pollen were investigated after storing at different temperatures and different storage periods. The size of E. racemosa pollen was medium with three germination ditches, and the sculptural type of pollen was striate. Red ink and 2,3,5-triphenyl tetrazolium chloride (TTC) can effectively distinguish viable pollen from the unviable pollen of E. racemosa. The most suitable medium (CK2) for E. racemosa was composed of 150 g· L-1 sucrose, 100 mg·L-1 boric acid, 150 mg· L-1 Ca(NO3)2 and 50 mg· L-1 GA3. Low-temperature stress produced the greater inhibition of pollen tube growth compared with high-temperature conditions. The CK2 medium at pH 6.5 resulted in the highest pollen germination rate and most extended pollen tube length. The optimal temperature for storage of dried pollen was -80°C (P < 0.01), and the germination rate was 53.60% after storage for 390 days. Thawing in a 35°C water bath produced the best viability of E. racemosa pollen after storage at -20°C and -80°C. The short-term storage of E. racemosa fresh pollen at 4°C was better than that at -20°C and -80°C (P < 0.01).

However, efficient flotation of copper sulfides from non-valuable phases is best achieved at a pH > 10.5, and raising the pH of seawater leads to magnesium precipitates that adversely affect subsequent tailings dewatering. Seawater pre-treatment with lime can precipitate the majority of magnesium present, with these solids then being removed by filtration. To understand how such treatment may aid tailings dewatering, treated seawater (TSw) was mixed with raw seawater (Rsw) at different ratios, analyzing the impact on the flocculated settling rate, aggregate size as measured by focused beam reflectance measurement (FBRM), and vane yield stress for two synthetic clay-based tailings. A higher proportion of Tsw (10 mg/L Mg2+) led to larger aggregates and higher settling rates at a fixed dosage, with FBRM suggesting that higher calcium concentrations in Tsw may also favor fines coagulation. The yield stress of concentrated suspensions formed after flocculation decreased with higher proportions of Tsw, a consequence of lower flocculant demand and the reduced presence of precipitates; while the latter is a minor phase by mass, their high impact on rheology reflects a small particle size. Reducing magnesium concentrations in seawater in advance of use in processing offers advantages in the water return from thickening and subsequent underflow transport. However, this may not require complete removal, with blending Tsw and Rsw an option to obtain acceptable industrial performance.","Ricardo I.

In line with plant resistance being an efficient tool to control diseases, the findings of a previous work showed that some corn hybrids are resistant to D. maidis. In this work, we assessed the probing behavior of D. maidis on susceptible and resistant corn hybrids using EPG (Electrical Penetration Graph) technology. Feeding of fifteen-day-old, non-inoculative females was recorded for 20 hours, with access to hybrids DK390, DK670, DK79-10, and DK72-10. Compared to the susceptible hybrid DK670, the other hybrids shifted D. maidis probing behavior in a way consistent with plant resistance to insects. This shift consisted of a higher number of probes of short duration, difficulties in attaining phloem ingestion and increase in xylem ingestion. In addition to this common shift in probing behavior, a phloem-located resistance factor was inferred in DK72-10 based on the longer time spent in phloem conditioning to attain phloem ingestion. In contrast, DK390 expressed the highest level of mesophyll and phloem-based resistance, in both cases seen with repeated attempts of short duration, a behavior typically associated with failed attempts to ingest. These findings support and are consistent with previous research, providing useful information to characterize maize hybrids resistant to D. maidis, and consequently to corn stunt.","To Jazmín and Antonella Carpane, for their love, time, and patience while the authors carried out this work.

However, vaccine trials and mother-to-child natural history cohort investigations indicate that antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC), not nAbs, correlate with prevention. The ADCC characteristics associated with lack of HIV-1 acquisition remain unclear. Here, we examine ADCC and nAb properties in pretransmission plasma from HIV-1-exposed infants and from the corresponding transmitting and nontransmitting mothers' breast milk and plasma. Breadth and potency (BP) were assessed against a panel of heterologous, nonmaternal variants. ADCC and neutralization sensitivity were estimated for the strains in the infected mothers. Infants who eventually acquired HIV-1 and those who remained uninfected had similar pretransmission ADCCBP. Viruses circulating in the transmitting and nontransmitting mothers had similar ADCC susceptibility. Infants with higher pretransmission ADCCBP and exposure to more ADCC-susceptible strains were less likely to acquire HIV-1. In contrast, higher preexisting infant neutralization BP and greater maternal virus neutralization sensitivity did not associate with transmission. Infants had higher ADCCBP closer to birth and in the presence of high plasma IgG relative to IgA levels. Mothers with potent humoral responses against their autologous viruses harbored more ADCC-sensitive strains. ADCC sensitivity of the exposure variants and preexisting ADCCBP influenced mother-to-child HIV-1 transmission during breastfeeding. Vaccination strategies that enhance ADCC are likely insufficient to prevent HIV-1 transmission because some strains may have low ADCC susceptibility.","We would like to thank the participants of the BAN study.

They are usually small and heat-stable peptides, exhibiting inhibitory activity against Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria. In this way, studies on broad-spectrum AMPs found in amphibians with the remarkable capability to regenerate a wide array of tissues are of particular interest in the search for new strategies to treat multidrug-resistant bacterial strains. In this work, the use of bioinformatic approaches such as sequence alignment with Fasta36 and prediction of antimicrobial activity allowed the identification of the Ramosin peptide from the de novo assembled transcriptome of the plethodontid salamander Bolitoglossa ramosi obtained from post-amputation of the upper limb tissue, heart, and intestine samples. BLAST analysis revealed that the Ramosin peptide sequence is unique in Bolitoglossa ramosi. The peptide was chemically synthesized, and physicochemical properties were characterized. Furthermore, the in vitro antimicrobial activity against relevant Gram-positive and Gram-negative human pathogenic bacteria was demonstrated. Finally, no effect against eukaryotic cells or human red blood cells was evidenced. This is the first antibacterial peptide identified from a Colombian endemic salamander with interesting antimicrobial properties and no hemolytic activity.","Universidad de Antioquia, Pontificia Universidad Católica de Valparaíso, and Universidad Católica del Norte.","This work was funded by grants from the University of Antioquia (CODI) and COLCIENCIAS 569,027-2013 and COLCIENCIAS 647 to LM and Fondecyt 1210056 of ANID-Chile to FG.

The microbiome in ticks is an endosymbiotic, pathogenic and is yet to be fully understood.ResultsAdult male Amblyomma scalpturatum (A. scalpturatum) and Amblyomma ovale (A. ovale) ticks were collected from Tapirus terrestris (T. terrestris) captured in the rural area of San Lorenzo Village, and males Amblyomma sabanerae were collected from Chelonoidis denticulate (C. denticulate) of the Gamita Farm in the Amazon region of Madre de Dios, Peru. The Chao1 and Shannon–Weaver analyses indicated a greater bacterial richness and diversity in male A. sabanerae (Amblyomma sabanerae; 613.65–2.03) compared to male A. scalpturatum and A. ovale (A. scalpturatum and A. ovale; 102.17–0.40). Taxonomic analyses identified 478 operational taxonomic units representing 220 bacterial genera in A. sabanerae and 86 operational taxonomic units representing 28 bacterial genera in A. scalpturatum and A. ovale. Of the most prevalent genera was Francisella (73.2%) in A. sabanerae, and Acinetobacter (96.8%) in A. scalpturatum and A. ovale to be considered as the core microbiome of A. sabanerae and A. scalpturatum/A. ovale respectively.ConclusionsWe found a high bacterial diversity in male of A. sabanerae collected from C. denticulata showed prevalence of Francisella and prevalence of Acinetobacter in male A. scalpturatum and A. ovale collected from T. terrestris. The greatest bacterial diversity and richness was found in males A. sabanerae.

Thus, to better understand the effects of oil exploitation activities on cytogenetic endpoint frequency, we conducted a biomonitoring study in the Hitnü indigenous populations from eastern Colombia by using the cytokinesis micronucleus cytome assay (CBMN-cyt). PAH exposure was also measured by determine urine 1-hydroxypyrene (1-OHP) using HPLC. We also evaluated the relationship between DNA damage and 1-OHP levels in the oil exploitation area, as well as the modulating effects of community health factors, such as Chagas infection; nutritional status; and consumption of traditional hallucinogens, tobacco, and wine from traditional palms. The frequencies of the CBMN-cyt assay parameters were comparable between PZOI and Hitnü populations outside the zone of influence of mining activities (POZOI); however, a non-significant incremental trend among individuals from the PZOI for most of the DNA damage parameters was also observed. In agreement with these observations, levels of 1-OHP were also identified as a risk factor for increased MN frequency (PR = 1.20) compared to POZOI (PR = 0.7). Proximity to oil exploitation areas also constituted a risk factor for elevated frequencies of nucleoplasmic bridges (NPBs) and APOP-type cell death. Our results suggest that genetic instability and its potential effects among Hitnü individuals from PZOI and POZOI could be modulated by the combination of multiple factors, including the levels of 1-OHP in urine, malnutrition, and some traditional consumption practices.","The authors gratefully acknowledge the support of the local authorities of Arauca department; Oscar Suárez, director of Universidad Nacional de Colombia Arauca; and all members of the settlements of Las Vegas, Monogarra, La Ilusión, Aspejená, Caño Jesús, and Bello Horizonte who decided to participate in this research.","This research was funded by MINCIENCIAS and MINSALUD Colombia (grant number 942/2019), Universidad Industrial de Santander, and Universidad del Sinú (UNISINU).",International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health,,"Hanns Moshammer, Guiying Li",Colombia; DNA Damage; Hallucinogens; Humans; Micronucleus Tests; Petroleum; Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons,2022-09-06,2022,2022-09-06,,19,18,11189,All OA; Gold,Article,"Galeano-Páez, Claudia; Ricardo-Caldera, Dina; Jiménez-Vidal, Luisa; Peñata-Taborda, Ana; Coneo-Pretelt, Andrés; Rumié-Mendoza, Margarita; Humanez Álvarez, Alicia; Salcedo-Arteaga, Shirley; Arteaga-Arroyo, Gean; Pastor-Sierra, Karina; Espitia-Pérez, Pedro; Avilés-Vergara, Paula A.; Tovar-Acero, Catalina; Soto-De León, Sara; Brango, Hugo; Bru-Cordero, Osnamir Elias; Jiménez-Narváez, Marvin; Stashenko, Elena E.; Gamboa-Delgado, Edna M.; Idrovo, Alvaro J.; Espitia-Pérez, Lyda","Galeano-Páez, Claudia (Grupo de Investigación Biomédicas y Biología Molecular, Universidad del Sinú E.B.Z., Montería 230001, Colombia); Ricardo-Caldera, Dina (Grupo de Investigación Enfermedades Tropicales y Resistencia Bacteriana, Universidad del Sinú E.B.Z., Montería 230001, Colombia); Jiménez-Vidal, Luisa (Grupo de Investigación Biomédicas y Biología Molecular, Universidad del Sinú E.B.Z., Montería 230001, Colombia); Peñata-Taborda, Ana (Grupo de Investigación Biomédicas y Biología Molecular, Universidad del Sinú E.B.Z., Montería 230001, Colombia); Coneo-Pretelt, Andrés (Grupo de Investigación Biomédicas y Biología Molecular, Universidad del Sinú E.B.Z., Montería 230001, Colombia); Rumié-Mendoza, Margarita (Grupo de Investigación Biomédicas y Biología Molecular, Universidad del Sinú E.B.Z., Montería 230001, Colombia); Humanez Álvarez, Alicia (Grupo de Investigación Biomédicas y Biología Molecular, Universidad del Sinú E.B.Z., Montería 230001, Colombia); Salcedo-Arteaga, Shirley (Grupo de Investigación Biomédicas y Biología Molecular, Universidad del Sinú E.B.Z., Montería 230001, Colombia); Arteaga-Arroyo, Gean (Grupo de Investigación Biomédicas y Biología Molecular, Universidad del Sinú E.B.Z., Montería 230001, Colombia); Pastor-Sierra, Karina (Grupo de Investigación Biomédicas y Biología Molecular, Universidad del Sinú E.B.Z., Montería 230001, Colombia); Espitia-Pérez, Pedro (Grupo de Investigación Biomédicas y Biología Molecular, Universidad del Sinú E.B.Z., Montería 230001, Colombia); Avilés-Vergara, Paula A.

During the construction and analysis of the psychometric characteristics of the scale, an Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) and a Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) were performed. To test EES scores based on gender and school year, the T-Student test for independent samples and ANOVA were used, respectively. To verify the relationship between the scores of the different types of emotions and academic performance, the Pearson correlation test was performed. A total of 562 students belonging to the 5th (n = 228) and 6th (n = 186) primary school year and the 1st (n = 134) and 2nd (n = 94) secondary school year participated in the research. Age between 10 and 15 years old (mean = 11.66, standard deviation = 1.206) both males (50.5%) and females (49.5%). The results offered support for the three-factor structure. The analysis of invariance with respect to gender showed that the factor structure was invariant. Boys scored higher on the positive emotions factor and lower scores on anxiety than girls. Regarding school year, negative emotions and anxiety related to exams increase in the secondary courses compared to Primary while for positive emotions it is primary school students who obtain higher scores. The correlation coefficient between negative emotions (as well as anxiety) and school performance is negative whereas the correlation coefficient between positive emotions and academic performance is positive.

It gave priority to older adults, who constituted 77.7% of deaths from this illness in the year 2020. The main goal of the plan is to decrease specific mortality and the number of serious COVID-19 cases, however, the number of deaths avoided by this strategy is unknown. The objective of this study was to estimate the number of avoided deaths in Colombia by fully vaccinating older adults against COVID-19, during the first year of the implementation of the national vaccination plan. Methods: This study took on the design of an ecological, longitudinal study. Full vaccination coverage for older adults was calculated for each epidemiological week and age group from March to December 2021, based on which the number of avoided COVID-19 deaths was estimated. A sensitivity analysis was performed taking into account variations in the vaccines' effectiveness by age group. Results: In Colombia, over 5.3 million adults 60 years of age and older received full COVID-19 vaccinations between March and December 2021. During that same period, nearly 46,000 deaths of older adults from this cause were registered. We estimated that vaccination has avoided around 22,000 more older adults from dying from COVID-19 in Colombia, that is, 32.4% of expected deaths in 2021. According to the sensitivity analysis, the number of lives saved ranged from 19,597 to 36,507. Conclusions: Colombia's strategy to vaccinate older adults against COVID-19 has avoided mortality for this age group from being 48.0% higher than what was observed during the study period. Even more lives have been saved when taking into account the parameters that were defined and the omission of the contribution from partial vaccinations.",,The author(s) declared that no grants were involved in supporting this work.,F1000Research,,,Aged; COVID-19; COVID-19 Vaccines; Colombia; Humans; Longitudinal Studies; Vaccination,2022-07-07,2022,2022-07-07,,11,,198,All OA; Gold,Article,"Rojas-Botero, Maylen Liseth; Fernández-Niño, Julián Alfredo; Arregocés-Castillo, Leonardo; Ruiz-Gómez, Fernando","Rojas-Botero, Maylen Liseth (Ministerio de Salud y Protección Social, Bogota, Bogota, 110311, Colombia); Fernández-Niño, Julián Alfredo (Ministerio de Salud y Protección Social, Bogota, Bogota, 110311, Colombia; Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); Arregocés-Castillo, Leonardo (Ministerio de Salud y Protección Social, Bogota, Bogota, 110311, Colombia); Ruiz-Gómez, Fernando (Ministerio de Salud y Protección Social, Bogota, Bogota, 110311, Colombia)","Fernández-Niño, Julián Alfredo (Ministry of Health and Social Protection; Universidad del Norte)","Rojas-Botero, Maylen Liseth (Ministry of Health and Social Protection); Fernández-Niño, Julián Alfredo (Ministry of Health and Social Protection; Universidad del Norte); Arregocés-Castillo, Leonardo (Ministry of Health and Social Protection); Ruiz-Gómez, Fernando (Ministry of Health and Social Protection)",7,5,0.53,4.86,https://f1000research.com/articles/11-198/v3/pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1149313267,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3202 Clinical Sciences; 42 Health Sciences,3 Good Health and Well Being

Thus, we expect their association to vary as a function of other socially-embedded variables which have proven meaningful in the academic domain. The present study takes a critical theory approach to assess gender-related and contextual variability in the association between peer-assessed school performance and self-perceived cognitive competence. The sample consisted of 719 preadolescents (M age = 9.5 years, range = 9 to 12.5 years) living in lower- and upper-middle-class neighborhoods in Montreal, Canada and Barranquilla, Columbia. Multigroup comparisons revealed that (a) peer-assessed school competence was more strongly associated with self-perceived cognitive competence for upper-middle-class than lower-middle-class participants from Barranquilla, whereas the opposite pattern was observed with Montreal participants, and (b) that the association between communal orientation and self-perceived cognitive competence was stronger for girls than for boys across the sample, especially in the upper-middle-class school in Montreal. These findings highlight the nuanced degree of gender differences in preadolescents' perceived academic competence and emphasize the role of SES in shaping self-perceptions.","We thank the schools, teachers, principals, parents, participants, and all those who helped with the data collection.",OK and WB were supported by the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada and the Fonds de recherche du Queìbec: Socieìteì et culture.,Frontiers in Psychology,,,,2022-11-03,2022,2022-11-03,,13,,919870,All OA; Gold,Article,"Kuzyk, Olivia; Gendron, Alice; Lopez, Luz Stella; Bukowski, William M.","Kuzyk, Olivia (Department of Psychology, Concordia University, Montréal, QC, Canada); Gendron, Alice (Department of Psychology, Concordia University, Montréal, QC, Canada); Lopez, Luz Stella (Department of Education, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); Bukowski, William M.

To obtain a better understanding of the genetic consequences of the Quaternary glacial cycles in Galaxias maculatus, in this work we compared landlocked and migratory populations collected in areas that were differentially affected by ice advances and retreats. We included nine populations of G. maculatus, four collected from lakes (landlocked) and five from their associated estuaries/rivers (migratory) in three estuary-lake systems across southern Chile. Genetic analyses were performed using the mitochondrial control region and nine microsatellite loci. Genetic diversity measured with both markers was significantly higher in migratory than in landlocked populations across the study area. The levels of genetic differentiation showed higher differentiation among lakes than estuaries. Genetic diversity was higher in migratory populations located in areas that were less impacted by ice during Quaternary glacial processes. These results may be the consequence of recent recolonization of small freshwater bodies following the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM). Finally, the greatest differentiation was observed in populations that were exposed to continental ice advances and retreats during the LGM. Thus, in the present work we corroborate a pattern of differentiation between lakes and estuaries, using mtDNA sequences and microsatellite nuclear markers. This pattern may be due to a combination of biological factors, i.e., resident non-migratory behaviour or landlocking and natal homing-in, as well as geological factors, i.e., Expansion-Contraction Quaternary glacial biogeographic processes.",,"This study was supported by the postdoctorate 3120075 fellowship.

METHODOLOGY: The methodology was qualitative with a phenomenological descriptive design, through which discourses from health personnel in the public primary and secondary care system were explored (n = 23). Next, meanings and practices in intercultural health for international migrants in health establishments are described from the perspective of health personnel in the northern Chilean city of Antofagasta.
RESULTS: The participants presented trees of thematic categories. There were three thematic categories overall: (1) The meaning of interculturality included features of understanding of the concept, with respect for culture being the transversal axis in all discourses. (2) Practices in health care, where voluntariness, references, and the adequacy or non-technicality of the language are fundamental axes. (3) Training in the intercultural approach, where there is often self-knowledge and lack of supply in the health system.
CONCLUSIONS: The findings show essential elements to consider in the care of international migrants, including the training and awareness of staff about the intercultural approach through strategies following the local reality in which each health establishment exists.",,"The project FONIS SAI190I066 ANID, Government of Chile.",International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health,,"Amit Arora, Tinashe Dune, Zelalem Mengesha, Pranee Liamputtong",Humans; Health Personnel; Delivery of Health Care; Chile; Transients and Migrants,2022-10-21,2022,2022-10-21,,19,20,13670,All OA; Gold,Article,"Cruz-Riveros, Consuelo; Urzúa, Alfonso; Macaya-Aguirre, Gustavo; Cabieses, Báltica","Cruz-Riveros, Consuelo (Escuela de Psicología, Universidad Católica del Norte, Antofagasta 1270709, Chile; Escuela de Enfermería, Facultad de Salud, Universidad Santo Tomás, Concepción 3460000, Chile); Urzúa, Alfonso (Escuela de Psicología, Universidad Católica del Norte, Antofagasta 1270709, Chile); Macaya-Aguirre, Gustavo (Facultad de Ciencias Sociales, Universidad Alberto Hurtado, Santiago 8320000, Chile); Cabieses, Báltica (Facultad de Medicina Clínica Alemana, Universidad del Desarrollo, Santiago 7610658, Chile)","Cruz-Riveros, Consuelo (Catholic University of the North; Universidad Santo Tomás)","Cruz-Riveros, Consuelo (Catholic University of the North; Universidad Santo Tomás); Urzúa, Alfonso (Catholic University of the North); Macaya-Aguirre, Gustavo (Alberto Hurtado University); Cabieses, Báltica (Universidad del Desarrollo)",2,1,0.51,1.4,https://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/19/20/13670/pdf?version=1666343915,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1152183194,42 Health Sciences; 4203 Health Services and Systems; 44 Human Society,

It is a concept which possesses ample evidence regarding its predictive nature for the course of Schizophrenia. The study aimed to analyze the latent profiles of premorbid adjustment and their relationship with symptomatology, functionality, subjective recovery, stigma resistance and years of untreated psychosis. Latent class analysis (LCA) was used to elaborate a solution of three premorbid adjustment profiles in a sample of 217 patients diagnosed with Schizophrenia from Public Mental Health Centers in the city of Arica, Chile. The results show that premorbid adjustment was significantly correlated with recovery indicators and that latent profiles of better premorbid adjustment predict better outcomes in subjective recovery and stigma resistance. The results show that premorbid adjustment not only has implications for the severity of the disorder, but that psychosocial functioning prior to psychosis affects the patient's subjectivity, the representation of the disorder and the recovery process.",,This study was funded by the Agencia Nacional de Investigación y Desarrollo de Chile ANID through FONDECYT 1200785.,Journal of Clinical Medicine,,,,2022-07-02,2022,2022-07-02,,11,13,3840,All OA; Gold,Article,"Caqueo-Urízar, Alejandra; Ponce-Correa, Felipe; Semir-González, Carla; Urzúa, Alfonso","Caqueo-Urízar, Alejandra (Instituto de Alta Investigación, Universidad de Tarapacá, Arica 1000000, Chile); Ponce-Correa, Felipe (Programa Doctorado en Psicología, Escuela de Psicología y Filosofía, Universidad de Tarapacá, Arica 1000000, Chile;, fponcec@academicos.uta.cl); Semir-González, Carla (Escuela de Psicología y Filosofía, Universidad de Tarapacá, Arica 1000000, Chile;, carla.semir.gonzalez@alumnos.uta.cl); Urzúa, Alfonso (Escuela de Psicología, Universidad Católica del Norte, Antofagasta 1270709, Chile;, alurzua@ucn.cl)","Caqueo-Urízar, Alejandra (University of Tarapacá)","Caqueo-Urízar, Alejandra (University of Tarapacá); Ponce-Correa, Felipe (University of Tarapacá); Semir-González, Carla (University of Tarapacá); Urzúa, Alfonso (Catholic University of the North)",3,2,0.51,,https://www.mdpi.com/2077-0383/11/13/3840/pdf?version=1656746669,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1149197269,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences,3 Good Health and Well Being

By 31 December 2021, 84.1% of the population was fully vaccinated, and 56.1% received booster doses using different COVID-19 vaccines. In this context, we aimed to estimate the prevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies following the infection and vaccination campaign. Using a three-stage stratified sampling, we performed a population-based cross-sectional serosurvey based on a representative sample of three Chilean cities. Selected participants were blood-sampled on-site and answered a short COVID-19 and vaccination history questionnaire using Wantai SARS-CoV-2 Ab ELISA to determine seroprevalence. We recruited 2198 individuals aged 7-93 between 5 October and 25 November 2021; 2132 individuals received COVID-19 vaccinations (97%), 67 (3.1%) received one dose, 2065 (93.9%) received two doses, and 936 received the booster jab (42.6%). Antibody seroprevalence reached 97.3%, ranging from 40.9% among those not vaccinated to 99.8% in those with booster doses (OR = 674.6, 154.8-2938.5). SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were associated with vaccination, previous COVID-19 diagnosis, age group, and city of residence. In contrast, we found no significant differences in the type of vaccine used, education, nationality, or type of health insurance. We found a seroprevalence close to 100%, primarily due to the successful vaccination program, which strongly emphasizes universal access.",The authors acknowledge the WHO for the donation of tests to measure SARS-CoV-2 antibodies.,"This research has been supported by WHO Unity Studies, a global seroepidemiological standardization initiative, with funding to the WHO by the COVID-19 Solidarity Response Fund and the German Federal Ministry of Health (BMG) COVID-19 Research and Development Fund.",Vaccines,,S.

When the renal secretion capacity exceeds, calcium oxalate forms stones that accumulate in the kidneys. In this respect, detailed QSAR analysis, molecular docking, and dynamics simulations of a series of inhibitors containing glycolic, glyoxylic, and salicylic acid groups have been performed employing different regression machine learning techniques. Three robust models with less than 9 descriptors—based on a tenfold cross (Q2CV) and external (Q2EXT) validation—were found i.e., MLR1 (Q2CV = 0.893, Q2EXT = 0.897), RF1 (Q2CV = 0.889, Q2EXT = 0.907), and IBK1 (Q2CV = 0.891, Q2EXT = 0.907). An ensemble model was built by averaging the predicted pIC50 of the three models, obtaining a Q2EXT = 0.933. Physicochemical properties such as charge, electronegativity, hardness, softness, van der Waals volume, and polarizability were considered as attributes to build the models. To get more insight into the potential biological activity of the compouds studied herein, docking and dynamic analysis were carried out, finding the hydrophobic and polar residues show important interactions with the ligands. A screening of the DrugBank database V.5.1.7 was performed, leading to the proposal of seven commercial drugs within the applicability domain of the models, that can be suggested as possible PHT1 treatment.","The authors are grateful with the USFQ-POLI grants 2022-2023 for the financial support.

La enfermedad de Chagas y la leishmaniasis tradicionalmente se han considerado zoonosis endémicas de áreas rurales del país. Sin embargo, la aparición de casos de estas enfermedades en áreas urbanas sugiere nuevos ciclos de circulación de estos parásitos. Por esta razón, se ha propuesto a los perros como centinelas de estos agentes zoonóticos, dado su rol como huéspedes accidentales o reservorios. Objetivo. Evaluar la circulación silenciosa de Leishmania spp. y Trypanosoma cruzi en perros de zonas urbanas de la ciudad de Sincelejo, Sucre. Materiales y métodos. Se analizaron 100 muestras de sangre de perros para amplificar la región ITS1 de Leishmania spp. Las muestras positivas se utilizaron para amplificar la región conservada del minicírculo del ADN del cinetoplasto de Leishmania infantum y para el análisis de polimorfismos de longitud de fragmentos de restricción con la endonucleasa HaeIII. Por otra parte, se amplificó un fragmento del ADN satelital de T. cruzi. Además, se evaluó la presencia de infecciones por Ehrlichia canis y Anaplasma platys, como potencialmente modificadoras de las manifestaciones clínicas. Resultados. De los 100 perros estudiados, se detectó: Leishmania spp. en 32, T. cruzi en 12, ambos parásitos en 7 y L. infantum en 18.

The aim of this study was to estimate the prevalence and risk factors associated with mental health in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic in young people in northern Chile. The sample consisted of 1315 young people between the ages of 14 and 18. Univariate analysis and multiple logistic regression were performed to identify the risk factors associated to the considered symptomatology. Depressive symptomatology was reported at 36.3%, anxiety at 6%, and social phobia at 27.8%. Adolescent females reported a higher probability of presenting depressive (OR, 3.409), anxious (OR, 3.949), and social phobia (OR, 3.027) symptomatology. Young women between the ages of 17 and 18 were more likely to present anxiety (OR, 2.172); moreover, being a migrant was related to lower odds of presenting anxiety (OR, 0.259) and depression (OR, 0.662). Having a family member diagnosed with COVID-19 was associated with depressive symptomatology (OR, 1.369). The COVID-19 pandemic can have serious repercussions on the mental health of adolescents. It is important to generate interventions to meet the needs of youth during the post-confinement period.","The authors would like to thank the Children and Youth Observatory team and the Innovation Fund for Competitiveness of the Regional Government of Antofagasta, Chile.","This work was supported by the Children and Youth Observatory of the Universidad Católica del Norte de Antofagasta, Chile (Tel.: +56-(55)-235-5825) and the Innovation Fund for Competitiveness of the Regional Government of Antofagasta, Chile.",Journal of Clinical Medicine,,,,2022-12-29,2022,2022-12-29,,12,1,269,All OA; Gold,Article,"Moya-Vergara, Rodrigo; Portilla-Saavedra, Diego; Castillo-Morales, Katherin; Espinoza-Tapia, Ricardo; Pastén, Sandra Sandoval","Moya-Vergara, Rodrigo (Escuela de Psicología, Facultad de Humanidades, Universidad Católica del Norte, Antofagasta 1240000, Chile); Portilla-Saavedra, Diego (Escuela de Psicología, Facultad de Humanidades, Universidad Católica del Norte, Antofagasta 1240000, Chile; Escuela de Psicología, Facultad de Ciencias Sociales, Universidad Santo Tomás, Antofagasta 1240000, Chile); Castillo-Morales, Katherin (Escuela de Psicología, Facultad de Ciencias Sociales, Universidad Santo Tomás, Antofagasta 1240000, Chile); Espinoza-Tapia, Ricardo (Escuela de Psicología, Facultad de Humanidades, Universidad Católica del Norte, Antofagasta 1240000, Chile); Pastén, Sandra Sandoval (Escuela de Psicología, Facultad de Humanidades, Universidad Católica del Norte, Antofagasta 1240000, Chile)","Moya-Vergara, Rodrigo (Catholic University of the North)","Moya-Vergara, Rodrigo (Catholic University of the North); Portilla-Saavedra, Diego (Catholic University of the North; Universidad Santo Tomás); Castillo-Morales, Katherin (Universidad Santo Tomás); Espinoza-Tapia, Ricardo (Catholic University of the North); Pastén, Sandra Sandoval (Catholic University of the North)",4,4,0.48,,https://www.mdpi.com/2077-0383/12/1/269/pdf?version=1672307031,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1154105572,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences,3 Good Health and Well Being

E-Point Septal Separation (EPSS) measure through Point-of-Care Ultrasound (POCUS) has been used to evaluate systolic function in echocardiography. We analyzed EPSS for diagnosis of Left Ventricle Ejection Fraction <50% and ≤40% in ED patients. Methods: Retrospective analysis of a convenience sample of patients presenting to ED with chest pain or dyspnea who underwent admission POCUS evaluation by Internal Medicine Specialist unaware of Transthoracic Echocardiogram. Accuracy was assessed with sensitivity, specificity, likelihood ratios (LR) and Receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve. The best cut off point was calculated using Youden Index. Results: Ninety-six patients were included. Median EPSS and LVEF were 10mm and 41% respectively. Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC-ROC) to diagnose a LVEF <50% was 0.90 (IC95% 0.84-0.97). Youden Index was 0.71 with cut off point EPSS at 9.5mm, performing with a sensitivity of 0.80, a specificity of 0.91, a positive LR of 9.8 and a negative LR of 0.2. AUC-ROC to diagnose a LVEF ≤40% was 0.91 (IC95% 0.85-0.97). Youden Index was 0.71 with a cut off point EPSS at 9.5mm, performing with a sensitivity of 0.91 and specificity of 0.80, a positive LR of 4.7 and a negative LR of 0.1. Conclusion: EPSS can reliably diagnose reduced LVEF in a set of ED patients with cardiovascular symptoms.

The main complications are related to the procedure, with infection being the least common. We present the case of a 67-year-old woman with a secundum atrial septal defect, who, 3 years after repair with an Amplatzer occluder, was admitted with sepsis and bacteraemia following recent hospitalization in an intensive care unit. Transoesophageal echocardiography showed the presence of a mobile echogenic structure in the left atrium suggestive of a vegetation. Few cases of late endocarditis involving the Amplatzer device have been reported, even though partial endothelization is one of the risk factors. There are no guidelines for the prevention, diagnosis or management of this complication.
LEARNING POINTS: The Amplatzer septal occluder is one of several alternatives for the closure of atrial septal defects and has few related complications, with infection being the least common.Device-related endocarditis presents either early (<6 months) or late (>6 months).In our case, transoesophageal echocardiography played a key role in the diagnosis of late endocarditis.",,,European Journal of Case Reports in Internal Medicine,,,,2022-03-15,2022,2022-03-15,,9,3,003238,All OA; Gold,Article,"Ana Milena Mejía Sanjuelo, Ana Milena Mejía Sanjuelo; Maria Carolina Manzur Barbur, Maria Carolina Manzur Barbur; Maria Cristina Martinez-Ávila, Maria Cristina Martinez-Ávila; Juan Camilo García Dominguez, Juan Camilo García Dominguez","Ana Milena Mejía Sanjuelo, Ana Milena Mejía Sanjuelo (Internal Medicine Department, Hospital Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); Maria Carolina Manzur Barbur, Maria Carolina Manzur Barbur (Internal Medicine Department, Centro Hospitalario Serena del Mar, Cartagena, Colombia); Maria Cristina Martinez-Ávila, Maria Cristina Martinez-Ávila (Internal Medicine Department, Centro Hospitalario Serena del Mar, Cartagena, Colombia); Juan Camilo García Dominguez, Juan Camilo García Dominguez (Cardiology Division, Centro Hospitalario Serena del Mar, Cartagena, Colombia)","Maria Cristina Martinez-Ávila, Maria Cristina Martinez-Ávila (Internal Medicine Department, Centro Hospitalario Serena del Mar, Cartagena, Colombia)","Ana Milena Mejía Sanjuelo, Ana Milena Mejía Sanjuelo (Universidad del Norte); Maria Carolina Manzur Barbur, Maria Carolina Manzur Barbur (Internal Medicine Department, Centro Hospitalario Serena del Mar, Cartagena, Colombia); Maria Cristina Martinez-Ávila, Maria Cristina Martinez-Ávila (Internal Medicine Department, Centro Hospitalario Serena del Mar, Cartagena, Colombia); Juan Camilo García Dominguez, Juan Camilo García Dominguez (Cardiology Division, Centro Hospitalario Serena del Mar, Cartagena, Colombia)",3,3,0.46,2.34,https://www.ejcrim.com/index.php/EJCRIM/article/download/3238/3055,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1146292871,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3201 Cardiovascular Medicine and Haematology; 3202 Clinical Sciences,

Concurrence with the inflammatory neuropathy Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) is observed in 1:4,000 ZIKV cases. Whether the neurologic symptoms of ZIKV infection are immune mediated is unclear. We used rodent and human live cellular models to screen for anti-peripheral nerve reactive IgG and IgM autoantibodies in the sera of patients with ZIKV with and without GBS.
METHODS: In this study, 52 patients with ZIKV-GBS were compared with 134 ZIKV-infected patients without GBS and 91 non-ZIKV controls. Positive sera were taken forward for target identification by immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry, and candidate antigens were validated by ELISA and cell-based assays. Autoantibody reactions against glycolipid antigens were also screened on an array.
RESULTS: Overall, IgG antibody reactivities to rat Schwann cells (SCs) (6.5%) and myelinated cocultures (9.6%) were significantly higher, albeit infrequent, in the ZIKV-GBS group compared with all controls. IgM antibody immunoreactivity to dorsal root ganglia neurones (32.3%) and SCs (19.4%) was more frequently observed in the ZIKV-GBS group compared with other controls, whereas IgM reactivity to cocultures was as common in ZIKV and non-ZIKV sera. Strong axonal-binding ZIKV-GBS serum IgG antibodies from 1 patient were confirmed to react with neurofascin 155 and 186. Serum from a ZIKV-infected patient without GBS displayed strong myelin-binding and putative antilipid antigen reaction characteristics. There was, however, no significant association of ZIKV-GBS with any known antiglycolipid antibodies.
DISCUSSION: Autoantibody responses in ZIKV-GBS target heterogeneous peripheral nerve antigens suggesting heterogeneity of the humoral immune response despite a common prodromal infection.","The authors thank Professors Peter Brophy and Sarosh Irani for kindly providing the anti-periaxin antibody and healthy human control sera, respectively.

UI presents a social, medical, and mental issue with financial consequences.ObjectiveThis paper proposes a framework based on machine learning for predicting urination time, which can benefit people with various degrees of UI.MethodA total of 850 data points were self-recorded by 51 participants to investigate how different factors impact urination time. The participants were instructed to record input data (such as the time of consumption and the number of drinks) and output data (i.e., the time the individual urinated). Other factors, such as age and BMI, were also considered. The study was conducted in two phases: (1) data was prepared for modeling, including missing values, data encoding, and scaling; and (2) a classification model was designed with four output classes of the next urination time: <  = 30 min, 31–60 min, 61–90 min, > 90 min. The model was built in two steps: (1) feature selection and (2) model training and testing. Feature selection methods such as lasso regression, decision tree, random forest, and chi-square were used to select the best features, which were then used to train an extreme gradient boosting (XGB) algorithm model to predict the class of the next urination time.ResultThe feature selection steps resulted in nine features considered the most important features affecting UI. The accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score of the XGB predictive model are 0.70, 0.73, 0.70, and 0.71, respectively.ConclusionThis research is the first step in developing a machine learning model to predict when a person will need to urinate. A precise predictive instrument can enable healthcare providers and caregivers to assist people with various forms of UI in reliable, prompted voiding. The insights from this predictive model can allow future apps to go beyond current UI-related apps by predicting the time of urination using the most relevant factors that impact voiding frequency.",The study was funded through Dr. Ali’s start-up funds.

This study reports, for the first time, the complete mitochondrial genome of T. bairdii and examines the phylogenetic position of T. bairdii amongst closely related species in the same family and order to which it belongs using mitochondrial protein-coding genes (PCG's). The circular, double-stranded, A-T rich mitochondrial genome of T. bairdii is 16,697 bp in length consisting of 13 protein-coding genes (PCG's), two ribosomal RNA genes (rrnS (12s ribosomal RNA and rrnL (16s ribosomal RNA)), and 22 transfer RNA (tRNA) genes. A 33 bp long region was identified to be the origin of replication for the light strand (OL), and a 1,247 bp long control region (CR) contains the origin of replication for the heavy strand (OH). A majority of the PCG's and tRNA genes are encoded on the positive, or heavy, strand. The gene order in T. baiirdi is identical to that of T. indicus and T. terrestris, the only two other species of extant tapirs with assembled mitochondrial genomes. An analysis of Ka/Ks ratios for all the PCG's show values <1, suggesting that all these PCGs experience strong purifying selection. A maximum-likelihood phylogenetic analysis supports the monophyly of the genus Tapirus and the order Perissodactyla. The complete annotation and analysis of the mitochondrial genome of T. bairdii will contribute to a better understanding of the population genomic diversity and structure of this species, and it will assist in the conservation and protection of its dwindling populations.","The authors are grateful to Dr. Vincent P.

Thus, the meta-analysis was conducted to report and review the association between PD-L1 and survival in penile cancer patients.
Methods: PubMed, Cochrane Library, EMBASE, and Web of Science were all searched, screened, and reviewed by June 1, 2022. Hazard ratio (HR) was used to evaluate the relationship between PD-L1 and survival outcome, and odds ratio (OR) was for tumor features.
Results: Nine retrospective studies (1,003 patients) were incorporated. The prevalence of PD-L1 in patients with penile cancer was 51.4% (95% CI = 42.1%-60.8%, I 2 = 88.5%). Higher PD-L1 on tumor cells was related to shorter cancer-specific survival (CSS) in patients (HR = 1.578, 95% CI = 1.227-2.029, I 2 = 23.3%), but had no associations with overall survival (OS) (HR = 1.123, 95% CI = 0.511-2.465, I 2 = 0.0%). Subgroup analysis indicated that higher PD-L1 was related to shorter CSS in Caucasus (HR = 1.827, 95% CI = 1.355-2.465, I 2 = 0.0%) only. Furthermore, PD-L1 had associations with tumor stage (pT1 vs. pT2-4, OR = 0.480, 95% CI = 0.346-0.667, P = 0.001) and tumor grade (Well and moderate vs. Poor, OR = 0.377, 95% CI = 0.264-0.538, P < 0.001). PD-L1 positivity was also related to lymph node (LN) status (pN0/NX vs. pN1-3, OR = 0.541, 95% CI = 0.385-0.759, P = 0.001) and HPV status (Positive vs. Negative, OR = 0.510, 95% CI = 0.322-0.810, P = 0.003). A trend toward statistical significance between PD-L1 and histological types was also observed (Usual SCC vs. Others, OR = 1.754, 95% CI = 0.984-3.124, P = 0.070).
Conclusions: PD-L1 over-expression was related to worse survival outcomes and several clinicopathological features of penile cancer. PD-L1 expression can be applied to select appropriate treatment strategies for penile malignancies.

We had previously shown that cultured macrophages infected with Leishmania parasites release EVs (LiEVs) containing parasite-derived molecules. In this study we show that LdVash, a molecule previously identified in LiEVs from L. donovani infected RAW264.7 macrophages, is widely distributed in the liver of L. donovani infected mice. This result shows for the first time that parasite molecules are released in EVs and distributed in infected tissues where they can be endocytosed by cells in the liver, including macrophages that significantly increase numbers as the infection progresses. To evaluate the potential impact of LiEVs on macrophage functions, we show that primary peritoneal exudate macrophages (PECs) express transcripts of signature molecules of M2 macrophages such as arginase 1, IL-10, and IL-4R when incubated with LiEVs. In comparative studies that illustrate how intracellular pathogens control the composition and functions of EVs released from macrophages, we show that EVs from RAW264.7 macrophages infected with Salmonella Typhimurium activate PECs to express transcripts of signature molecules of M1 macrophages such as iNOS, TNF alpha, and IFN-gamma and not M2 signature molecules. Finally, in contrast to the polarized responses observed in in vitro studies of macrophages, both M1 and M2 signature molecules are detected in L. donovani infected livers, although they exhibit differences in their spatial distribution in infected tissues. In conclusion, EVs produced by macrophages during Leishmania infection lead to the gene expression consistent with M2 polarization. In contrast, the EVs produced during S. Typhimurium infection stimulated the transcription of genes associated with M1 polarization.",,"This work was supported by U. S.

The European Union (EU) Regulation No. 1379/2013 imposes the declaration of an official commercial designation and scientific names for all the fishery and aquaculture products to be offered for sale to the final consumers. DNA analyses are used to enforce this regulation and to test authenticity in processed foods. We compared the performance of two mono-locus approaches for species identification (SI) in 61 Mytilus mussels: the high-resolution melting analysis of the polyphenolic adhesive protein gene and the partial sequencing of the histone H1C gene. The H1C sequences were analyzed with five different methods. Both approaches show discrepancies in the identification of putative hybrids (0.0 < κ < 0.687 and 0.0 < MCC < 0.724). Excluding putative hybrids, methods show substantial to perfect agreement (0.772 < κ < 1.0 and 0.783 < MCC < 1.0).

From the point of view of well-being, it is an aerobic activity that prevents and improves cardiovascular diseases. According to data provided by the United Nations, within the framework of the International Year of Mountains, mountain tourism represents around 15% to 20% of total world tourism revenue. This approach aims to critically analyze the scientific production on trail tourism (HT) with contributions from authors from around the world from 1991 to 2022, in order to respond to the connection between this research, knowledge management and the sustainable development of the industry. Key knowledge contributions are examined using a scientometric approach as a method (spatial, production, impact, and relational) based on registry data stored in the Web of Science (JCR and ESCI). Regarding the results, there has been an increase in scientific production in the last decade, which is manifested in the quality of the publications.",,This research received no external funding.,International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health,,Yeongbae Choe,Environment; Knowledge Management; Sports; Sustainable Development; Tourism,2022-07-13,2022,2022-07-13,,19,14,8534,All OA; Gold,Article,"Acevedo-Duque, Ángel; Llanos-Herrera, Gonzalo R.; García-Salirrosas, Elizabeth Emperatriz; Simón-Isidoro, Selene; Álvarez-Herranz, Agustín Pablo; Álvarez-Becerra, Rina; Díaz, Lisette C.

Nowadays, developing products for new business models based on renting and servitization practices is of paramount importance. Furthermore, durability enables the application of circularity strategies for product lifespan extension, including reuse, repair, refurbish, and remanufacture. However, despite the growing trend around durability, there is no precise tracing of its evolution, implementation, and potential benefits from the product design stage. Therefore, this article aims to analyze the existing literature about durability and its relationship with the circular economy concept starting from the product design process, uncovering potential research directions, challenges, and trends for its application. A total of 147 articles were selected and analyzed from 40 years of research using two main approaches. First, a keyword-based analysis was used to identify trending topics around the concept of durability. Second, a content-based analysis was used, encompassing four main aspects: objectives and methodology; actors involved and lifecycle phases; circular economy strategies; and design phase, design attributes, and type of products involved. The analysis identified how the concept has evolved during the last four decades, indicating that future trends envisage methodologies, assessment tools, and guidelines to support product life extension.",,"This work was supported by Vicerrectoría de Investigación, Creación e Innovación Universidad del Norte.",Heliyon,,,,2022-09-22,2022,2022-09-22,2022-09,8,9,e10734,All OA; Gold,Article,"Mesa, Jaime A.; Gonzalez-Quiroga, Arturo; Aguiar, Marina Fernandes; Jugend, Daniel","Mesa, Jaime A.

Some species exclusively affect humans, contaminating wounds, mucous membranes, and other tissues. It is a disease with marked socioeconomic connotations.
Case Presentation: The current case involves a 95-year-old woman, an inhabitant of the Andean region of Ecuador with a history of resection of basal cell carcinoma in the left zygomatic region and a diagnosis of chronic leukemia. The surgical wound was secondarily infested with Cochliomyia hominivorax fly larvae and the patient was readmitted to the hospital to treat this complication. A marked clinical improvement was observed after surgical debridement, removal of larvae and administration of ivermectin and antibiotics.
Conclusion: The determinants of this infestation were advanced age, neglect, and destitution in a patient with an open wound on the face after resection of a basal cell carcinoma. This case illustrates the appalling reality of the marginalized and excluded population of South America. Also of concern is the expansion of myiasis-producing fly populations to areas outside their natural humid and warm habitat.

We evaluated the potential role of the uplift of the Eastern Cordillera (EC) of the Colombian Andes and the Mérida Andes (MA) of Venezuela as drivers of vicariance between lowland populations co-distributed on both flanks. We synthesized published geological data and provided a new reconstruction showing that the EC-MA grew from north to south, reaching significant heights and separating drainages and changing sediment composition by 38-33 million years ago (Ma). A few lowland passes across the EC-MA may have reached their current heights (~1,900 m a.s.l.) at 3-5 Ma. We created a comparative phylogeographic data set for 37 lineages of lowland tetrapods. Based on molecular phylogenetic analyses, most divergences between sister populations or species across the EC-MA occurred during Pliocene and the Quaternary and a few during the latest Miocene, and coalescent simulations rejected synchronous divergence for most groups. Divergence times were on average slightly but significantly more recent in homeotherms relative to poikilotherms. Because divergence ages are mostly too recent relative to the geological history and too asynchronous relative to each other, divergence across the northern Andes may be better explained by organism-environment interactions concomitant with climate oscillations during the Pleistocene, and/or dispersal across portals through the Andes.",We are grateful to Michael J.

The design followed in this work was empirical, not experimental, and cross-sectional with a correlational objective. The sample included a total of 399 participants (199 patients with HIV and 200 without pathology). The instruments applied for data collection were as follows: a questionnaire on socio-demographic data, the Psychological Well-being Scale, the Resilience Scale and the Coping Strategies Questionnaire. The study period was from February 2018 to January 2020. Patients with HIV had a significantly lower score than healthy subjects, in the resilience factors of perseverance and self-confidence. Subjects with HIV scored less in all dimensions of psychological well-being, with the exception of the dimension of autonomy. Finally, it was observed that HIV-positive subjects used rational coping strategies less frequently than healthy subjects, based on social support seeking and problem-solving coping.

Therefore, the objective was to determine the relationship of the severity of climacteric symptomatology with depression and sexual function in women.
Materials and methods: It was a descriptive, cross-sectional study, with a sample of 60 women between 40 and 65 years old. The Female Sexual Function Questionnaire-2, the Menopause Rating Scale, and the Beck Depression Inventory were used.
Results: The mean age of the women was 49.1 ±5.6 years. 21.7% of the women had severe depression, 28.3% moderate, and 50% mild/minimal. Changes in sleep habits (1.73 ±0.88) and in appetite (1.63 ±0.73) were the most severe manifestations. Difficulty sleeping (1.05 ±0.99), physical and mental fatigue (1.48 ±0.98), and vaginal sequelae (1.45 ±1.26) were the most serious complaints in the somatic, psychological, and urogenital domains, respectively. 60% presented severe sexual dysfunction regarding genital pain and 55% in vaginal penetration. Communicating sexual preferences to the partner was common in 75% of women. 88.3% had frequent sexual activity, but 63.3% had zero or low sexual satisfaction.

In this study, we developed genomic resources for T. crocea. Using low-pass (=low-coverage, ~6×) short read sequencing, this study, for the first time, estimated the genome size, unique genome content, and nuclear repetitive elements, including the 45S rRNA DNA operon, in T. crocea. Furthermore, we tested if the mitochondrial genome can be assembled from RNA sequencing data. The haploid genome size estimated using a k-mer strategy was 1.31-1.39 Gbp, which is well within the range reported before for other members of the family Cardiidae. Unique genome content estimates using different k-mers indicated that nearly a third and probably at least 50% of the genome of T. crocea was composed of repetitive elements. A large portion of repetitive sequences could not be assigned to known repeat element families. Taking into consideration only annotated repetitive elements, the most common were classified as Satellite DNA which were more common than Class I-LINE and Class I-LTR Ty3-gypsy retrotransposon elements. The nuclear ribosomal operon in T. crocea was partially assembled into two contigs, one encoding the complete ssrDNA and 5.8S rDNA unit and a second comprising a partial lsrDNA. A nearly complete mitochondrial genome (92%) was assembled from RNA-seq. These newly developed genomic resources are highly relevant for improving our understanding of the biology of T. crocea and for the development of conservation plans and the fisheries management of this iconic reef-dwelling invertebrate.",J.A.B thanks Vincent P.

The aim of this study was to determine the relation between behavioral problems, emotional problems, and substance use as well as the mediating role of contextual problems and sensation seeking in this relation. A cross-sectional study of 2277 adolescents from Northern Chile was conducted. The System for the Evaluation of Children and Adolescents (SENA) was used to assess substance use, contextual problems, sensation seeking, and emotional and behavioral problems. Through a mediational model, it was observed that substance use has a positive indirect effect on emotional and behavioral problems when both contextual problems and sensation seeking act as mediating variables. An indirect effect of substance use on contextual problems with sensation seeking as a mediator was also observed. The results suggests that context and sensation seeking are a relevant source of information in understanding adolescents and their propensity to use drugs.

Microbial fuel cells provide a novel solution for the use of waste as fuel for electricity generation. In this investigation, onion waste was used, and managed to generate maximum peaks of 4.459 ± 0.0608 mA and 0.991 ± 0.02 V of current and voltage, respectively. The conductivity values increased rapidly to 179,987 ± 2859 mS/cm, while the optimal pH in which the most significant current was generated was 6968 ± 0.286, and the ° Brix values decreased rapidly due to the degradation of organic matter.

In this sense, this research uses single-chamber microbial fuel cells with zinc and copper as electrodes and pineapple waste as fuel (substrate). Current and voltage peaks of 4.95667 ± 0.54775 mA and 0.99 ± 0.03 V were generated on days 16 and 20, respectively, with the substrate operating at an acid pH of 5.21 ± 0.18 and an electrical conductivity of 145.16 ± 9.86 mS/cm at two degrees Brix. Thus, it was also found that the internal resistance of the cells was 865.845 ± 4.726 Ω, and a maximum power density of 513.99 ± 6.54 mW/m2 was generated at a current density of 6.123 A/m2, and the final FTIR spectrum showed a clear decrease in the initial transmittance peaks. Finally, from the biofilm formed on the anodic electrode, it was possible to molecularly identify the yeast Wickerhamomyces anomalus with 99.82% accuracy.

These problems have limited the generation of large datasets to develop accurate and applicable regression models. This study presents a QSPR approach developed on the KNIME analytical platform and based on a structurally diverse dataset of over 4900 molecules. Interpretable models were obtained using random forest supervised recursive algorithms for data cleaning and feature selection. The development of a conditional consensus model based on regional and global regression random forest produced models with RMSE values between 0.43-0.51 for all validation sets. The potential applicability of the model as a surrogate for the in vitro Caco-2 assay was demonstrated through blind prediction of 32 drugs recommended by the International Council for the Harmonization of Technical Requirements for Pharmaceuticals (ICH) for validation of in vitro permeability methods. The model was validated for the preliminary estimation of the BCS/BDDCS class. The KNIME workflow developed to automate new drug prediction is freely available. The results suggest that this automated prediction platform is a reliable tool for identifying the most promising compounds with high intestinal permeability during the early stages of drug discovery.,All the authors acknowledge KNIME and its many contributors for making the KNIME data-mining environment available free of charge.,This research received no external funding.,Pharmaceutics,,Gus R.

Here, we present the Science Clubs Colombia (Clubes de Ciencia Colombia-SCC) program, a pioneering STEAM capacity-building initiative led by volunteer scientists to engage youth and children from underserved communities in science. The program brings together researchers based in Colombia and abroad to lead intensive project-based learning workshops for young students in urban and rural areas. These projects focus on channeling the students' technical and cognitive scientific aptitudes to tackle challenges of both local and global relevance. The program provides high-quality STEAM education adapted to communities' needs and articulates long-lasting international collaborations using the mobility of the Colombian diaspora. The program's success is tangible via its sustained growth and adaptability. Since its first version in 2015, 722 volunteer scientists living abroad or in Colombia have collaborated to create 364 clubs with the participation of 9,295 students. We describe elements of the SCC program that lead to a scalable and reproducible outcome to engage science diasporas in STEAM education. Additionally, we discuss the involvement of multiple stakeholders and the generation of international networks as potential science diplomacy outcomes. The SCC program strengthens the involvement of Latin American youth in science, demonstrates the potential of engaging scientific diasporas in science education, and enriches connections between the Global South and the Global North.","The authors acknowledge that data collection and analysis from the program execution comes from different sources of the impact assessment reports, internal data collection for the execution of the program once instructors accept to participate, and other sources that allow authors to complement the data analysis presented. This paper constitutes an initial exploration of the data and the authors will not focus on participant perception or student success as both areas are beyond the scope of this contribution. We want to acknowledge all the volunteers who make the Science Clubs Program possible, including instructors, learning assistants, curricular evaluators, logistical support, application reviewers, and evaluators.

The Diabetes Stigma Assessment Scale 2 (DSAS 2) was designed to specifically measure the stigma associated with this type of diabetes. However, the psychometric properties of its Spanish version have not yet been addressed.
Objective: To analyze the validity and reliability of the Spanish version of DSAS 2 in a Colombian population.
Materials and methods: In total, 501 patients with type 2 diabetes from Barranquilla answered the Spanish version of DSAS 2, a questionnaire with sociodemographic and clinical indicators, as well as instruments to measure depression, self-efficacy, and stress. We performed a factor analysis (exploratory and confirmatory) to determine the internal structure of the DSAS 2 in Spanish and used the alpha coefficient (α) to evaluate its reliability. Additionally, we analyzed the relationship between the DSAS 2 scores and the other variables under study.
Results: The three-factor structure (different treatment / judgment, guilt and shame) showed good fit to the data (RMSEA = 0.081, CFI = 0.959, TLI = 0.95) and good reliability (α = 0.76). Significant correlations of the scores of the DSAS 2 Spanish version were observed with self-efficacy (rs=-0.37, p<0.001), stress (rs =0.24 , p<0.001), and depression (rs=0.1, p=0.021). Besides, the scores showed variations associated with sociodemographic and clinical variables.
Conclusions: The Spanish version showed certain differences compared with the original version of the DSAS2 but there was adequate evidence of its validity and reliability to be used in Colombia.",,Universidad Andrés Bello.

There is a growing number of studies with multimodal approaches in the management of these patients, combining physical and behavioral therapies such as osteopathic manipulative treatment, associating pain education and clinical hypnosis. The aim of the present study will be to evaluate the effects of osteopathic manipulative treatment (OMT) associated with pain neuroscience education (PNE) and clinical hypnosis (CH) on pain and disability in participants with CLBP compared to PNE, CH, and sham therapy.MethodsA randomized controlled clinical trial will be conducted in participants aged 20–60 years with CLBP who will be divided into two groups. Group 1 will receive PNE and CH associated with OMT, and G2 will receive PNE, CH, and sham therapy. In both groups, 4 interventions of a maximum of 50 min and with an interval of 7 days will be performed. As primary outcomes, pain (numerical pain scale), pressure pain threshold (pressure algometer), and disability (Oswestry Disability Questionnaire) will be evaluated and, as a secondary outcome, global impression of improvement (Percent of Improvement Scale), central sensitization (Central Sensitization Questionnaire), biopsychosocial aspects (Start Beck Toll Questionnaire), and behavior of the autonomic nervous system (heart rate variability) will be assessed. Participants will be evaluated in the pre-intervention moments, immediately after the end of the protocol and 4 weeks after the procedures. Randomization will be created through a simple randomized sequence and the evaluator will be blinded to the allocation of intervention groups.DiscussionThe guidelines have been encouraging multimodal, biopsychosocial approaches for patients with CLBP; in this sense, the results of this study can help clinicians and researchers in the implementation of a model of treatment strategy for these patients. In addition, patients may benefit from approaches with minimal risk of deleterious effects and low cost. In addition, it will enable the addition of relevant elements to the literature, with approaches that interact and do not segment the body and brain of patients with CLBP, allowing new studies in this scenario.Trials registrationDate: September 4, 2021/Number: NCT05042115.",Not applicable.,The authors own the funding.,Trials,,,"Humans; Low Back Pain; Manipulation, Osteopathic; Pain Measurement; Educational Status; Hypnosis; Chronic Pain; Treatment Outcome; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic",2022-12-30,2022,2022-12-30,,23,1,1066,All OA; Gold,Article,"Luchesi, Guilherme Luis Santana; da Silva, Anne Kastelianne França; Amaral, Otávio Henrique Borges; de Paula, Vanessa Cristina Godoi; Jassi, Fabrício José","Luchesi, Guilherme Luis Santana (Postgraduate Program in Human Movement Sciences at the Health Sciences Center of the State University of the North of Paraná, Alameda Padre Magno, n° 841 - Nova Jacarezinho, 86400-000, Jacarezinho, Paraná, Brazil; Docusse Institute of Osteopathy and Manual Therapy (IDOT), Presidente Prudente, São Paulo, Brazil); da Silva, Anne Kastelianne França (Docusse Institute of Osteopathy and Manual Therapy (IDOT), Presidente Prudente, São Paulo, Brazil; Post-doctoral Program of São Paulo State University (UNESP), Faculty of Science and Technology, Presidente Prudente, São Paulo, Brazil); Amaral, Otávio Henrique Borges (Postgraduate Program in Human Movement Sciences at the Health Sciences Center of the State University of the North of Paraná, Alameda Padre Magno, n° 841 - Nova Jacarezinho, 86400-000, Jacarezinho, Paraná, Brazil); de Paula, Vanessa Cristina Godoi (Postgraduate Program in Human Movement Sciences at the Health Sciences Center of the State University of the North of Paraná, Alameda Padre Magno, n° 841 - Nova Jacarezinho, 86400-000, Jacarezinho, Paraná, Brazil); Jassi, Fabrício José (Postgraduate Program in Human Movement Sciences at the Health Sciences Center of the State University of the North of Paraná, Alameda Padre Magno, n° 841 - Nova Jacarezinho, 86400-000, Jacarezinho, Paraná, Brazil; Docusse Institute of Osteopathy and Manual Therapy (IDOT), Presidente Prudente, São Paulo, Brazil)","Luchesi, Guilherme Luis Santana (Postgraduate Program in Human Movement Sciences at the Health Sciences Center of the State University of the North of Paraná, Alameda Padre Magno, n° 841 - Nova Jacarezinho, 86400-000, Jacarezinho, Paraná, Brazil; Docusse Institute of Osteopathy and Manual Therapy (IDOT), Presidente Prudente, São Paulo, Brazil)","Luchesi, Guilherme Luis Santana (Postgraduate Program in Human Movement Sciences at the Health Sciences Center of the State University of the North of Paraná, Alameda Padre Magno, n° 841 - Nova Jacarezinho, 86400-000, Jacarezinho, Paraná, Brazil; Docusse Institute of Osteopathy and Manual Therapy (IDOT), Presidente Prudente, São Paulo, Brazil); da Silva, Anne Kastelianne França (Docusse Institute of Osteopathy and Manual Therapy (IDOT), Presidente Prudente, São Paulo, Brazil; São Paulo State University); Amaral, Otávio Henrique Borges (Postgraduate Program in Human Movement Sciences at the Health Sciences Center of the State University of the North of Paraná, Alameda Padre Magno, n° 841 - Nova Jacarezinho, 86400-000, Jacarezinho, Paraná, Brazil); de Paula, Vanessa Cristina Godoi (Postgraduate Program in Human Movement Sciences at the Health Sciences Center of the State University of the North of Paraná, Alameda Padre Magno, n° 841 - Nova Jacarezinho, 86400-000, Jacarezinho, Paraná, Brazil); Jassi, Fabrício José (Postgraduate Program in Human Movement Sciences at the Health Sciences Center of the State University of the North of Paraná, Alameda Padre Magno, n° 841 - Nova Jacarezinho, 86400-000, Jacarezinho, Paraná, Brazil; Docusse Institute of Osteopathy and Manual Therapy (IDOT), Presidente Prudente, São Paulo, Brazil)",2,2,0.38,1.63,https://trialsjournal.biomedcentral.com/counter/pdf/10.1186/s13063-022-07040-y,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1154065333,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3202 Clinical Sciences; 42 Health Sciences; 4201 Allied Health and Rehabilitation Science,4 Quality Education

OBJECTIVE: The primary objective was to determine the health care attributes respondents at 2 pediatric institutions rate as important when prioritizing machine learning model implementation. The secondary objective was to describe their perspectives on implementation using a qualitative approach.
METHODS: In this mixed methods study, we distributed a survey to health system leaders, physicians, and data scientists at 2 pediatric institutions. We asked respondents to rank the following 5 attributes in terms of implementation usefulness: the clinical problem was common, the clinical problem caused substantial morbidity and mortality, risk stratification led to different actions that could reasonably improve patient outcomes, reducing physician workload, and saving money. Important attributes were those ranked as first or second most important. Individual qualitative interviews were conducted with a subsample of respondents.
RESULTS: Among 613 eligible respondents, 275 (44.9%) responded. Qualitative interviews were conducted with 17 respondents. The most common important attributes were risk stratification leading to different actions (205/275, 74.5%) and clinical problem causing substantial morbidity or mortality (177/275, 64.4%). The attributes considered least important were reducing physician workload and saving money. Qualitative interviews consistently prioritized implementations that improved patient outcomes.
CONCLUSIONS: Respondents prioritized machine learning model implementation where risk stratification would lead to different actions and clinical problems that caused substantial morbidity and mortality. Implementations that improved patient outcomes were prioritized.

Despite the introduction of genetically resistant farmed Atlantic salmon and vaccination strategies in the Chilean salmon industry since 2019, the number of IPN outbreaks has been increasing in farmed Atlantic salmon in the freshwater phase. This study examined gross and histopathological lesions of IPNV-affected fish, as well as the IPNV nucleotide sequence encoding the VP2 protein in clinical cases. The mortality reached 0.4% per day, and the cumulative mortality was from 0.4 to 3.5%. IPNV was isolated in the CHSE-214 cell line and was confirmed by RT-PCR, and VP2 sequence analysis. The analyzed viruses belong to IPNV genotype 5 and have 11 mutations in their VP2 protein. This is the first report of IPN outbreaks in farmed Atlantic salmon genetically resistant to IPNV in Chile. Similar outbreaks were previously reported in Scotland and Norway during 2018 and 2019, respectively. This study highlights the importance of maintaining a comprehensive surveillance program in conjunction with the use of farmed Atlantic salmon genetically resistant to IPNV.",,This study was supported by Centro de Investigaciones Biológicas Aplicadas.,Pathogens,,,,2022-11-16,2022,2022-11-16,,11,11,1368,All OA; Gold,Article,"Godoy, Marcos; Kibenge, Molly J.

MATERIALS AND METHODS.: Mixed method, explanatory study, with an initial quantitative and then qualitative sequence. The quantitative phase was carried out using validated instruments: characterization sheet of the person with chronic illness-family caregiver dyad; the Nkongho Caregiving Ability Inventory (CAI), and the Zarit burden scale. The qualitative phase was conducted with a hermeneutic phenomenological approach; the information was collected through in-depth interviews to understand the needs of the caregivers.
RESULTS.: The caregivers were mostly women, mainly mothers and daughters, home-occupied and self-employed, with basic primary education, low socioeconomic level and low caregiving skill level; a significant number of caregivers perceived some degree of overload. The themes identified in the analysis of the interviews were: feeling fear before the disease; the experience of caregiver fatigue; losing one's job: another cost of the disease; fear of delegating care; love: a support for the caregiver; needing support to care.

This was a multicentre, prospective, cohort study. Patients were divided into two groups depending on the 30-day mortality. The heart rate variability and more specifically the relative parasympathetic activity (ANIm), and the SDNN (Energy), were measured. To predict severity and mortality multivariate analyses of ANIm, Energy, SOFA score, and RASS scales were conducted. 112 patients were collected, the survival group (n = 55) and the deceased group (n = 57). The ANIm value was higher (p = 0.013) and the Energy was lower in the deceased group (p = 0.001); Higher Energy was correlated with higher survival days (p = 0.009), and a limit value of 0.31 s predicted mortalities with a sensitivity of 71.9% and a specificity of 74.5%. Autonomic nervous system and heart rate variability monitoring in critically ill patients with COVID-19 allows for predicting survival days and 30-day mortality through the Energy value.

Nevertheless, more research is needed with cross-national samples concerning the differential effects of lifestyles on life satisfaction. The aim of this cross-sectional study was to analyze the associations between the frequency of playing sports/exercise or playing electronic games on life satisfaction in a sample of 12-year-old children from nine countries from the European Union. The data used in this publication come from the third wave of the Children's Worlds project, an international survey of children's lives and well-being whose administration started in 2017. The sample was composed of 10,626 children (50.9% boys) from Estonia, Belgium, Croatia, Hungary, Italy, Malta, Poland, Romania, and Spain. They completed the Student Life Satisfaction Scale and answered two questions to assess the frequency of playing sport or exercise, and the frequency of playing electronic games. The results indicated notable scores in life satisfaction in all participating countries. The results showed some differences between boys and girls, and among the countries, in the frequency of sport practice and electronic games in the leisure time, as well as in the overall level of life satisfaction. The results also underlined that sport practice had a greater positive effect on life satisfaction than the use of electronic games. Thus, this study highlights the need to design programs to promote sport practice in leisure time for 12-year-old children in Europe, in order to protect their subjective well-being.","The data used in this publication come from the third wave of the Children’s Worlds project, an international survey of children’s lives and well-being (www.isciweb.org, accessed on 1 August 2022).

Children are at a higher risk for progression to TB disease than adults. Isoniazid prophylaxis treatment period is long and can cause liver damage. Alternatives to isoniazid, such as rifamycin containing regimens, should be considered for prophylaxis. Previous systematic reviews, with different study designs and data combining results on children and adults, have evaluated the comparative efficacy and harms of LTBI treatment regimens. We aim to determine the effectiveness and safety of all the different regimens available for the treatment of LTBI for children and adolescents less than 18 years of age, contacts of drug-susceptible TB, without HIV infection.
METHODS AND ANALYSIS: MEDLINE, Embase and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials will be systematically searched for randomised controlled trials without any language or publication date restriction. Screening and extraction will be performed in duplicate. Risk of bias will be performed in duplicate with Cochrane Risk of Bias tool V.2. Pairwise meta-analysis of direct comparisons and network meta-analyses (NMAs) will be performed. Heterogeneity will be assessed using I2 and Cochrane thresholds. Direct and indirect estimates in an NMA will be combined if justifiable. Subgroups analyses will be performed in different mean age and study year groups. Sensitivity analysis based on the risk of bias will be conducted. Publication bias will be investigated using funnel plots and Egger's regression test. Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) criteria will assess certainty of the evidence for the direct comparisons. GRADE approach for NMA will assess the quality of the evidence from the indirect and NMA.
ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethical approval is not required as no primary data are collected. This systematic review will be disseminated in a peer-reviewed journal.

Current genomic resources on M. depressus are rare, limiting the understanding of its adaptation to terrestrial life in species that evolved from marine ancestors. This study reports the complete mitochondrial genome of M. depressus assembled using Sanger sequencing. The AT-rich mitochondrial genome of M. depressus is 15,765 bp in length and comprises 13 protein-coding genes (PCGs), 2 ribosomal RNA genes, and 22 transfer RNA genes. A single 691 bp-long intergenic space is assumed to be the control region (CR) or D-loop. A set of selective pressure analyses indicate that the entirety of the PCGs experience purifying selection. Cox1, cox2, nad5, cox3, and atp6 experience strong purifying selection, and atp8 experiences weak purifying selection compared to the rest of the PCGs. The secondary structures of most tRNA genes exhibit a standard 'cloverleaf' structure, with the exception of trnS1, which lacks the dihydroxyuridine (DHU) arm but not the loop, the trnH gene, which lacks the thymine pseudouracil cytosine (T) loop but not the arm, and trnM, which exhibits an overly developed T loop. A maximum likelihood phylogenetic analysis based on all PCGs indicated that M. depressus is more closely related to the genera Clistocoeloma, Nanosesarma, and Parasesarma than to Chiromantes, Geosesarma, and Orisarma. This study contributes to deciphering the phylogenetic relationships within the family Sesarmidae and represents a new genomic resource for this iconic crab species.",J.A.B. thanks Vincent P.

Inbreds to Develop Hybrids With Low Phytic Acid and High-Quality Protein,"Maize is a major staple crop with high value as food and feed in the poultry sector. Considering the overall nutritional value, maize-based diets comprise two major constraints, i.e., higher phytic acid (PA) and lack of tryptophan. To overcome these issues, a set of identified stable donors for low PA (lpa) and higher tryptophan were crossed in a line × tester fashion, and the hybrids obtained were evaluated at three locations with two replications. Among the inbreds for yield, UMI 1201 and UMI 1205 were the stable good combiners, and for PA, UMI 447 and LPA-2-285 were identified as efficient combiners across locations. Subsequently, 72 hybrids developed from these inbreds had a reduced phytate and higher tryptophan compared with checks having alterations in their yield levels. From Additive Main Effects and Multiplicative Interaction (AMMI) and Genotype main effect plus genotype-by-environment interaction (GGE) biplots, DMR-QPM-09-13-1 × UMI 1099 (PA:9.38 mg/g, trp:0.06%, and yield:184.35 g) and UMI 1205 × UMI 467 (PA:7.04 mg/g, trp:0.06%, and yield:166.39 g) were stable for their high yield with medium PA and tryptophan. Also, across environments, UMI 1200 × UMI 467 had a stable average yield of 129.91 g along with the lowest PA of 4.50 mg/g and higher tryptophan of 0.07%. Thus, these hybrids could be selected and evaluated in upcoming biofortification trials to benefit the poultry sector. Furthermore, the parental inbreds utilized were grouped into heterotic pools to serve as a source population for the development of lpa hybrids in future programs.",,,Frontiers in Plant Science,,,,2022-01-19,2022,2022-01-19,,12,,781469,All OA; Gold,Article,"Pramitha, J.

Annual mortality data 2014–2019 by municipality of residence and pooled effect measures for total, natural and specific causes of mortality were used to calculate the number of annual avoidable deaths and years of potential life lost (YPLL) related to the excess of PM2.5 concentration over the current mean annual national standard of 25 µg/m3 and projected standard of 15 µg/m3.ResultsCompared to surface data from 28 municipalities with monitoring stations in 2019, ACAG and CAMSRA models under or overestimated annual mean PM2.5 concentrations. Estimations from ACAG model had a mean bias 1,7 µg/m3 compared to a mean bias of 4,7 µg/m3 from CAMSRA model. Using ACAG model, estimations of total nationally attributable deaths to PM2.5 exposure over 25 and 15 µg/m3 were 142 and 34,341, respectively. Cardiopulmonary diseases accounted for most of the attributable deaths due to PM2.5 excess of exposure (38%). Estimates of YPLL due to all-cause mortality for exceeding the national standard of 25 µg/m3 were 2,381 years.ConclusionComparison of two global air quality models for estimating surface PM2.5 concentrations during 2014–2019 at municipality scale in Colombia showed important differences. Avoidable deaths estimations represent the total number of deaths that could be avoided if the current and projected national standard for PM2.5 annual mean have been met, and show the health-benefit of the implementation of more restrictive air quality standards.","The authors would like to thank Yurley Rojas for her contribution to the generation of maps.

Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the Adhesion G Protein-Coupled Receptor L3 (ADGRL3) gene are associated with increased susceptibility to developing ADHD worldwide. However, the effect of ADGRL3 non-synonymous SNPs (nsSNPs) on the ADGRL3 protein function is vastly unknown. Using several bioinformatics tools to evaluate the impact of mutations, we found that nsSNPs rs35106420, rs61747658, and rs734644, previously reported to be associated and in linkage with ADHD in disparate populations from the world over, are predicted as pathogenic variants. Docking analysis of rs35106420, harbored in the ADGLR3-hormone receptor domain (HRM, a common extracellular domain of the secretin-like GPCRs family), showed that HRM interacts with the Glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP), part of the incretin hormones family. GIP has been linked to the pathogenesis of diabetes mellitus, and our analyses suggest a potential link to ADHD. Overall, the comprehensive application of bioinformatics tools showed that functional mutations in the ADGLR3 gene disrupt the standard and wild ADGRL3 structure, most likely affecting its metabolic regulation. Further in vitro experiments are granted to evaluate these in silico predictions of the ADGRL3-GIP interaction and dissect the complexity underlying the development of ADHD.","We express our highest appreciation to the families who, for the last 25 years, have participated in our genetic studies of ADHD.

In teleost fish, the brain and gastrointestinal tract integrate signals that include the perception of stress factors regulating physiological responses, such as social stress by fish population density, where peripheral and central signals, such as peptide hormones, are the main regulators. Therefore, we proposed in this study to analyze the effect of different stock densities (SD) in the gene expression of brain neuropeptide Y (NPY) and calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), together with the gastrointestinal peptide hormones leptin (Lep), vasointestinal peptide (VIP), and protachykinin-1 (Prk-1) in Salmo salar post-smolt. The coding sequence of S. salar VIP and Prk-1 precursors were firstly cloned and characterized. Then, the mRNA expression of these genes, together with the NPY, Lep, and CGRP genes, were evaluated in post-smolts kept at 11 Kg/m3, 20 Kg/m3, and 40 Kg/m3. At 14 days of culture, the brain CGRP and liver leptin mRNA levels increased three and tenfold in the post-smolt salmons kept at the highest SD, respectively. The high levels of leptin were kept during all the fish culture experiments. In addition, the highest expression of intestine VIP mRNA was obtained on Day 21 in the group of 40 Kg/m3 returning to baseline on Day 40. In terms of stress biochemical parameters, cortisol levels were increased in the 20 Kg/m3 and 40 Kg/m3 groups on Day 40 and were the highest in the 20 Kg/m3 group on Day 14. This study provides new insight into the gastrointestinal signals that could be affected by chronic stress induced by high stock density in fish farming. Thus, the expression of these peptide hormones could be used as molecular markers to improve production practices in fish aquaculture.",,"This research was funded by Program for Sanitary Management in Aquaculture of the Ministry of Economy, Development and Tourism of Chile (FIE-2015-V014 201708070149 to L.M.) and the ANID-Chile Grants: FONDECYT 11180042 (C.A.Á.), FONDECYT 1191763 (L.M.), FONDECYT 1210056 (F.G.), and REDES BIO0009 (P.A.A).",Animals,,,,2022-05-04,2022,2022-05-04,,12,9,1174,All OA; Gold,Article,"Álvarez, Claudio A.; Santana, Paula A.; Cárcamo, Claudia B.; Cárdenas, Constanza; Morales-Lange, Byron; Ramírez, Felipe; Valenzuela, Cristian; Boltaña, Sebastián; Alcaíno, Javier; Guzmán, Fanny; Mercado, Luis","Álvarez, Claudio A.

However, fexA variants mediating resistance only to chloramphenicol have been identified, such as in the case of a Staphylococcus aureus isolate recovered from poultry meat illegally imported to Germany. The effects of the individual mutations detected in the fexA sequence of this isolate were investigated in this study. A total of 11 fexA variants, including prototype fexA and variants containing the different previously described mutations either alone or in different combinations, were generated by on-chip gene synthesis and site-directed mutagenesis. The constructs were inserted into a shuttle vector and transformed into three recipient strains (Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, and Salmonella Typhimurium). Subsequently, minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of florfenicol and chloramphenicol were determined. In addition, protein modeling was used to predict the structural effects of the mutations. The lack of florfenicol-resistance mediating properties of the fexA variants could be attributed to the presence of a C110T and/or G98C mutation. Transformants carrying fexA variants containing either of these mutations, or both, showed a reduction of florfenicol MICs compared to those transformants carrying prototype fexA or any of the other variants. The significance of these mutations was supported by the generated protein models, indicating a substitution toward more voluminous amino-acids in the substrate-binding site of FexA.

Citrus EOs, a common by-product of the orange juice industry, can be an interesting alternative from a financial perspective due to their huge offer in the global market. Thus, the effect of a citrus EO, and specifically different formulations of Brazilian Orange Terpenes (BOT), on pig gut microbiota was evaluated by means of an in vitro fermentation model simulating different sections of the pig gut (stomach, ileum, and colon). Treatments consisted in: BOT in its unprotected form (BOT, 1.85 and 3.70 mg/mL), microencapsulated BOT (MBOT, 3.50 and 7.00 mg/mL), colistin (2 μg/mL), and a control. BOT and MBOT altered in a similar way the total bacterial 16S rRNA gene copies in the stomach only from 18 h of incubation onwards, and no metabolite production in terms of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) was detected. In ileal and colonic fermentations, BOT and MBOT affected ileal and colonic microbiota in terms of total bacterial 16S rRNA gene copies, reduced phylogenetic diversity, and altered composition (p < 0.05) as evidenced by the significant reduction of certain bacterial taxa. However, more pronounced effects were found for MBOT, indicating its higher antimicrobial effects compared to the unprotected BOT, and suggesting that the antibacterial efficiency of the unprotected BOT was probably enhanced by microencapsulation. Furthermore, MBOT stimulated lactate production in ileal fermentations and greatly stimulated overall SCFA production in colonic fermentations. This indicates that besides the shifts in ileal and colonic microbiota by the delivered EO (BOT), the wall material of microcapsules (chitosan/modified starch) might have worked as an additional carbon source with prebiotic functioning, stimulating growth and metabolic activity (SCFAs) of colonic bacteria.","The authors are grateful to CIENCIACTIVA for CA Ph.D. scholarship (Contract 278-2015-FONDECYT) from the Consejo Nacional de Ciencia, Tecnología e Inovación Tecnológica (CONCYTEC–Peru).

Therefore, the objective is to analyze the bibliometric characteristics of the application of artificial intelligence (AI) in tuberculosis in Scopus.
Methods: A bibliometric study, the Scopus database was used using a search strategy composed of controlled and free terms regarding tuberculosis and AI. The search fields ""TITLE,"" ""ABSTRACT,"" and ""AUTHKEY"" were used to find the terms. The collected data were analyzed with Scival software. Bibliometric data were described through the figures and tables summarized by absolute values and percentages.
Results: Thousand and forty-one documents were collected and analyzed. Yudong Zhang was the author with the highest scientific production; however, K. C. Santosh had the greatest impact. Anna University (India) was the institution with the highest number of published papers. Most papers were published in the first quartile. The United States led the scientific production. Articles with international collaboration had the highest impact.
Conclusion: Articles related to tuberculosis and AI are mostly published in first quartile journals, which would reflect the need and interest worldwide. Although countries with a high incidence of new cases of tuberculosis are among the most productive, those with the highest reported drug resistance need greater support and collaboration.",,,International Journal of Mycobacteriology,,,Humans; United States; Artificial Intelligence; Bibliometrics; Tuberculosis; India,2022-10,2022,,2022-10,11,4,389-393,All OA; Gold,Article,"Cabanillas-Lazo, Miguel; Quispe-Vicuña, Carlos; Pascual-Guevara, Milagros; Barja-Ore, John; Guerrero, Maria Eugenia; Munive-Degregori, Arnaldo; Mayta-Tovalino, Frank","Cabanillas-Lazo, Miguel (Department of Academic, Grupo Peruano De Investigación Epidemiológica, Unidad Para La Generación Y Síntesis De Evidencias En Salud, Universidad San Ignacio De Loyola; Department of Academic, Sociedad Científica De San Fernando, Lima, Perú.); Quispe-Vicuña, Carlos (Department of Academic, Grupo Peruano De Investigación Epidemiológica, Unidad Para La Generación Y Síntesis De Evidencias En Salud, Universidad San Ignacio De Loyola; Department of Academic, Sociedad Científica De San Fernando, Lima, Perú.); Pascual-Guevara, Milagros (Department of Academic, Sociedad Científica De San Fernando; Department of Academic, Faculty of Medicine, Universidad Nacional Mayor De San Marcos, Lima, Perú.); Barja-Ore, John (Department of Academic, Research Direction, Universidad Privada Del Norte, Lima, Perú.); Guerrero, Maria Eugenia (Department of Academic, Universidad Nacional Mayor De San Marcos, Lima, Perú.); Munive-Degregori, Arnaldo (Department of Academic, Universidad Nacional Mayor De San Marcos, Lima, Perú.); Mayta-Tovalino, Frank (Department of Posgraduate, Vicerrectorado De Investigación, Universidad San Ignacio De Loyola, Lima, Perú.)",,"Cabanillas-Lazo, Miguel (Universidad San Ignacio de Loyola; Department of Academic, Grupo Peruano De Investigación Epidemiológica, Unidad Para La Generación Y Síntesis De Evidencias En Salud, Universidad San Ignacio De Loyola; Department of Academic, Sociedad Científica De San Fernando, Lima, Perú.); Quispe-Vicuña, Carlos (Universidad San Ignacio de Loyola; Department of Academic, Grupo Peruano De Investigación Epidemiológica, Unidad Para La Generación Y Síntesis De Evidencias En Salud, Universidad San Ignacio De Loyola; Department of Academic, Sociedad Científica De San Fernando, Lima, Perú.); Pascual-Guevara, Milagros (Department of Academic, Sociedad Científica De San Fernando; Department of Academic, Faculty of Medicine, Universidad Nacional Mayor De San Marcos, Lima, Perú.; National University of San Marcos); Barja-Ore, John (Private University of the North); Guerrero, Maria Eugenia (National University of San Marcos); Munive-Degregori, Arnaldo (National University of San Marcos); Mayta-Tovalino, Frank (Universidad San Ignacio de Loyola)",3,3,0.26,1.61,https://doi.org/10.4103/ijmy.ijmy_134_22,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1153557484,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3202 Clinical Sciences; 3207 Medical Microbiology,3 Good Health and Well Being

Methods: A cross-sectional study conducted during the first months of lockdowns in Peru. 694 adults completed a web-based survey about changes experienced in the process of acquiring food during lockdown, changes in their intake and self-perceived body weight. A multinomial logistic regression analysis was conducted to evaluate the factors associated with changes in body weight.
Results: Weight gain was perceived in 38% of the participants and 22.8% perceived weight loss. 39.2% did not perceive changes in their weight. Risk factors for body weight gain were increased alcohol consumption (OR=4.510, 95% CI 1.764 to 11.531) and decreased fruit consumption (OR=2.129, 95% CI 1.290 to 3.515), while decreasing cereal intake (OR=0.498, 95% CI 0.269 to 0.922) and choosing nutritious food as a driver for purchase (OR=0.512, 95% CI 0.320 to 0.821) were found to be protective against gaining weight. Decreasing food intake during the pandemic (OR=2.188, 95% CI 1.348 to 3.550) and having to miss important foods (OR=2.354, 95% CI 1.393 to 3.978), were associated with weight loss.
Conclusions: During confinement, weight gain was mostly associated with food consumption and personal food system factors.

A systematic review and meta-analysis of cohort studies,"Objectives: The objective of the present work was to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the association between periodontal disease (PD) and urogenital cancer (UC) risk.
Materials and methods: An electronic search in PubMed, EMBASE, the Cochrane Library, and Web of Science was conducted using MeSH terms to identify cohort studies published before May 17, 2022. Cohort studies examining the association between PD and UC risk were included. We used a random-effects model to summarize the effect sizes with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of the included studies with PD as the indicator and UC as the outcome.
Results: Eleven cohort studies met the inclusion criteria. Our results suggest that PD patients increases the risk of UC by 1.24-fold (hazard ratio (HR), 1.24; 95% CI, 1.17-1.31; I2, 22.4%). The strength of the sensitivity analysis and cumulative meta-analysis confirmed the reliability of the results.
Conclusion: We found that PD is a potential risk factor for UC. Our results indicate that along with the decrease in the incidence of PD,PD treatment may help prevent UC. We hope that our study will raise awareness of periodontal health, thereby reducing the incidence of UC.

Although the inhibitors of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerases (PARPs) have been utilized as potent anti-cancer agents, their efficacy in clinical trials varied among patient groups and has often been unpredictable. Such outcome cannot be interpreted solely by the inability to keep PARP-driven DNA repair in check. The focus of studies on PARP-driven tumorigenesis have recently been shifted toward PARP-dependent regulation of transcription. Here we utilized the controlled overexpression of poly(ADP-ribose) glycohydrolase (PARG), a sole pADPr-degrading enzyme, to investigate pADPr-dependent gene regulation in prostate cancer PC-3 cells. We demonstrated that PARG upregulation reduces pADPr levels and inhibits the expression of genes in key tumor-promoted pathways, including TNFα/NF-kB, IL6/STAT3, MYC, and KRAS signaling, the genes involved in inflammation response, especially chemokines, and endothelial-mesenchymal transition. The observed effect of PARG on transcription was consistent across all tested prostate cancer cell lines and correlates with PARG-induced reduction of clonogenic potential of PC-3 cells in vitro and a significant growth inhibition of PC-3-derived tumors in nude mice in vivo.","We thank Dr. Diane Darland for valuable comments on the paper, and our colleagues in the University of the North Dakota Department of Biomedical Sciences for stimulating discussions.

This solitary, territorial, and large top predator is in major need of genomic resources to inform conservation management strategies. This study formally tested if complete mitochondrial genomes of P. tigris altaica can be assembled from non-enriched metagenomic libraries generated from scat eDNA samples using the Illumina sequencing platform and open-access bioinformatics pipelines. The mitogenome of P. tigris altaica was assembled and circularized using the pipeline GetOrganelle with a coverage ranging from 322.7x to 17.6x in four different scat eDNA samples. A nearly complete mitochondrial genome (101x) was retrieved from a fifth scat eDNA sample. The complete or nearly complete mitochondrial genomes of P. tigris altaica were AT-rich and composed of 13 protein coding genes (PCGs), 22 transfer RNA genes, two ribosomal RNA genes, and a putative control region. Synteny observed in all assembled mitogenomes was identical to that reported before for P. tigris altaica and other felids. A phylogenomic analysis based on all PCGs demonstrated that the mitochondrial genomes assembled from scat eDNA reliably identify the sequenced samples as belonging to P. tigris and distinguished the same samples from closely and distantly related congeneric species. This study demonstrates that it is viable to retrieve accurate whole and nearly complete mitochondrial genomes of P. tigris altaica (and probably other felids) from scat eDNA samples without library enrichment protocols and using open-access bioinformatics workflows. This new genomic resource represents a new tool to support conservation strategies (bio-prospecting and bio-monitoring) in this iconic cat.",Many thanks to Dr. Vincent P.

Based on interviews from samples of 384 and 383 elderly Chilean adults collected before and after confinement, the evolution of the effects (paths) was analysed using the TPB model applying the PLS-SEM technique. The intention to use social networks and its association with three factors were evaluated: attitude toward the behaviour, subjective norms, and perceived control over the behaviour. The model explains the intention to use social networks by 27% before confinement, increasing its magnitude to 50% after confinement. After the period of confinement, their attitudes become more significant, their perceptions of control become less important, and social pressures remain permanent in predicting the behaviour. In conclusion, better access and greater use of social networks by older people during the lockdown period increased the predictive strength of the attitude towards these technologies.",The authors acknowledge the support that students and interviewers gave to collect the information in the field.,This research was funded by ANID/FONDECYT Regular 1210130.,International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health,,"Daniel W.L.

Interspecific hybridization is critical for resolving parental genetic diversity bottleneck problems. The reciprocal interspecific hybrids and their parents (Gossypium hirsutum and Gossypium barbadense) have been applied in this study to elucidate the transcription regulatory mechanism of early biomass heterosis. Phenotypically, the seed biomass, plant height over parent heterosis, leaf area over parent heterosis, and fresh and dry biomass were found to be significantly higher in hybrids than in parents. Analysis of leaf areas revealed that the one-leaf stage exhibits the most significant performance in initial vegetative growth vigor and larger leaves in hybrids, increasing the synthesis of photosynthesis compounds and enhancing photosynthesis compound synthesis. Comparative transcriptome analysis showed that transgressive down-regulation (TDR) is the main gene expression pattern in the hybrids (G. hirsutum × G. barbadense, HB), and it was found that the genes of photosystem I and Adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-binding may promote early growth vigor. Transgressive up-regulation (TUR) is the major primary gene expression pattern in the hybrids (G. barbadense × G. hirsutum, BH), and photosystem II-related genes mediated the performance of early biomass heterosis. The above results demonstrated that overdominance mediates biomass heterosis in interspecific hybrid cotton and the supervisory mechanism divergence of hybrids with different females. Photosynthesis and other metabolic process are jointly involved in controlling early biomass heterosis in interspecific hybrid cotton. The expression pattern data of transcriptome sequencing were supported using the qRT-PCR analysis. Our findings could be useful in theoretical and practical studies of early interspecific biomass heterosis, and the results provide potential resources for the theoretical and applied research on early interspecific biomass heterosis.",We thank Nanjing Personalbio Corporation (http://www.personalbio.cn/) for assistance with RNA-seq.,"This work was supported by the National Key R&D Program for Crop Breeding (2016YFD0101417), State Key Laboratory of Cotton Biology Open Fund (CB2021C11), and the Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province, China (Y21C130006).",Frontiers in Plant Science,,,,2022-07-01,2022,2022-07-01,,13,,892805,All OA; Gold,Article,"Li, Tengyu; Wang, Fuqiu; Yasir, Muhammad; Li, Kui; Qin, Yuan; Zheng, Jing; Luo, Kun; Zhu, Shouhong; Zhang, Hua; Jiang, Yurong; Zhang, Yongshan; Rong, Junkang","Li, Tengyu (The Key Laboratory for Quality Improvement of Agricultural Products of Zhejiang Province, Zhejiang Agriculture and Forestry University, Hangzhou, China; State Key Laboratory of Cotton Biology, Institute of Cotton Research, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Anyang, China; National Key Laboratory of Crop Genetic Improvement, Huazhong Agricultural University, Wuhan, China); Wang, Fuqiu (National Key Laboratory of Crop Genetic Improvement, Huazhong Agricultural University, Wuhan, China); Yasir, Muhammad (The Key Laboratory for Quality Improvement of Agricultural Products of Zhejiang Province, Zhejiang Agriculture and Forestry University, Hangzhou, China); Li, Kui (Institute of Food and Nutrition Development, Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Beijing, China); Qin, Yuan (National Key Laboratory of Crop Genetic Improvement, Huazhong Agricultural University, Wuhan, China); Zheng, Jing (The Key Laboratory for Quality Improvement of Agricultural Products of Zhejiang Province, Zhejiang Agriculture and Forestry University, Hangzhou, China); Luo, Kun (The Key Laboratory for Quality Improvement of Agricultural Products of Zhejiang Province, Zhejiang Agriculture and Forestry University, Hangzhou, China); Zhu, Shouhong (State Key Laboratory of Cotton Biology, Institute of Cotton Research, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Anyang, China); Zhang, Hua (The Key Laboratory for Quality Improvement of Agricultural Products of Zhejiang Province, Zhejiang Agriculture and Forestry University, Hangzhou, China); Jiang, Yurong (The Key Laboratory for Quality Improvement of Agricultural Products of Zhejiang Province, Zhejiang Agriculture and Forestry University, Hangzhou, China); Zhang, Yongshan (State Key Laboratory of Cotton Biology, Institute of Cotton Research, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Anyang, China); Rong, Junkang (The Key Laboratory for Quality Improvement of Agricultural Products of Zhejiang Province, Zhejiang Agriculture and Forestry University, Hangzhou, China)","Zhang, Yongshan (State Key Laboratory of Cotton Bio-breeding and Integrated Utilization); Rong, Junkang (Zhejiang A&F University)","Li, Tengyu (Zhejiang A&F University; State Key Laboratory of Cotton Bio-breeding and Integrated Utilization; Huazhong Agricultural University); Wang, Fuqiu (Huazhong Agricultural University); Yasir, Muhammad (Zhejiang A&F University); Li, Kui (Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences); Qin, Yuan (Huazhong Agricultural University); Zheng, Jing (Zhejiang A&F University); Luo, Kun (Zhejiang A&F University); Zhu, Shouhong (State Key Laboratory of Cotton Bio-breeding and Integrated Utilization); Zhang, Hua (Zhejiang A&F University); Jiang, Yurong (Zhejiang A&F University); Zhang, Yongshan (State Key Laboratory of Cotton Bio-breeding and Integrated Utilization); Rong, Junkang (Zhejiang A&F University)",5,5,0.23,2.37,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpls.2022.892805/pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1149148933,"30 Agricultural, Veterinary and Food Sciences; 3001 Agricultural Biotechnology; 31 Biological Sciences",

Material and Methods: Cross-sectional analytical study; a non-probabilistic sampling was carried out at a national level. The Google Forms tool was used; a document was submitted using a national database. The instrument consisted of four sections: socio-demographic data, biopsychosocial symptoms, insomnia severity index (ISI), and the Epworth sleepiness scale (ESS). The data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and the zero-inflated negative binomial model.
Results: Of a total of 2,532 surveyed people, 29% were male; 43% was younger than 30 years old. The 50% of the sample suffers from sleepiness and 71% shows some type of insomnia. The marginal effects of the zero-inflated negative binomial model show that women, people aged 51 or older, who are neither studying a healthcare degree nor working in the healthcare sector, that are exposed to 4 or more hours per day to the news and that live in areas near or very near the riots, have significantly higher ISI (marginal effect 1.356, SE 0.381, p-value 0.000) and ESS scores (marginal effect 0.693, SE 0.320, p-value 0.030). To live/work in rioting areas has the greater marginal effect compared to other determinants. Finally, neither employment status nor educational level are associated with significant effects in the aforementioned scales.

Two of these styrylquinolines are new and were elucidated by spectroscopic analysis. The chemopreventive potential of these compounds was evaluated against SW480 human colon adenocarcinoma cells, its metastatic derivative SW620, and normal cells (HaCaT). According to the results, compounds 3a and 3d showed antiproliferative activity in SW480 and SW620 cells, but their effect seemed to be caused by different mechanisms of action. Compound 3a induced apoptosis independent of ROS production, as evidenced by increased levels of caspase 3, and had an immunomodulatory effect, positively regulating the production of different immunological markers in malignant cell lines. In contrast, compound 3d generated a pro-oxidant response and inhibited the growth of cancer cells, probably by another type of cell death other than apoptosis. Molecular docking studies indicated that the most active compound, 3a, could efficiently bind to the proapoptotic human caspases-3 protein, a result that could provide valuable information on the biochemical mechanism for the in vitro cytotoxic response of this compound in SW620 colon carcinoma cell lines. The obtained results suggest that these compounds have chemopreventive potential against CRC, but more studies should be carried out to elucidate the molecular mechanisms of action of each of them in depth.","The authors thank Pontifical Bolivarian University, MINCIENCIAS, MINEDUCACIÓN, MINCIT, ICETEX, University of Antioquia, Corporation for Biological Research and the sustainability grant from the Research Committee (CODI) of the University of Antioquia for their support.","This work has been funded by MINCIENCIAS, MINEDUCACIÓN, MINCIT and ICETEX through the Program Ecosistema Científico Cod.

This study evaluates the antimicrobial potential of several combinations of peptide-protein extracts (PCs) consisting of peptide extracts from three native probiotic strains, Lactiplantibacillus plantarum UTNGt2, Lactococcus lactis UTNGt28, and L. plantarum UTNGt21A, alone or in combination with EDTA (ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid) against multidrug-resistant Staphylococcus aureus ATCC1026 and Citrobacter freundii UTNB3Sm1. Based on the antimicrobial assay, among the 19 tested PCs, two (PC11 and PC17) produced a greater zone of inhibition against both pathogens in vitro. Time-killing assays indicated the rapid death of S. aureus after exposure to PC11 and PC17, while C. freundii was rapidly inhibited by PC11 and PC1 (UTNGt2 only), suggesting that the inhibitory action is pathogen and dose-dependent of a particular molecule present in the extract. A marginal inhibitory effect was observed when the peptides were combined with EDTA. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) revealed the structural membrane damage of both target strains upon interaction with individual peptide extracts. Different degrees of cell deformation, condensed cytoplasm, membrane blebbing, and ghost cell formation with visibly broken cell walls were observed in S. aureus. Likewise, the separation of the cytoplasmic membrane from the outer membrane, ghost cells, along with ovoid and deformed cells with undulated cell walls were observed for C. freundii. Furthermore, scanning electronic microscopy (SEM) analysis revealed different wrinkled and deformed cells covered by debris. A leakage of aromatic molecules was detected for both pathogens, indicating that PCs disrupted the cell wall integrity, inducing cell death. Given their inhibitory action and capacity to induce damage of the cytoplasmic membrane, the selected PCs may serve to slow bacterial growth in vitro; further research is required to prove their efficiency ex vitro to battle against food poisoning and subsequent human infection.",The authors are thankful to Technical University of the North for funding this research.

However, rather few studies have evaluated geocoding quality, with most of them being performed in the US and Europe. This article aims to compare the quality of three automatic online geocoding tools against a reference method. A subsample of 300 handwritten addresses from hospital records was geocoded using Bing, Google Earth, and Google Maps. Match rates were higher (> 80%) for Google Maps and Google Earth compared with Bing. However, the accuracy of the addresses was better for Bing with a larger proportion (> 70%) of addresses with positional errors below 20m. Generally, performance did not vary for each method for different socioeconomic status. Overall, the methods showed an acceptable, but heterogeneous performance, which may be a warning against the use of automatic methods without assessing quality in other municipalities, particularly in Chile and Latin America.","Impact of Wood Burning Air Pollution on Preeclampsia and other Pregnancy Outcomes in Temuco, Chile (DPI20140093) was garanted by CONICYT and Research Councils UK.

Plenty of risk and new causative genes for COPD have been identified in patients of the Chinese Han population. In contrast, we know considerably little concerning the genetics in the Kashi COPD population (Uyghur). This study aims at clarifying the genetic maps regarding COPD susceptibility in Kashi (China). Whole-exome sequencing (WES) was used to analyze three Uyghur families with COPD in Kashi (eight patients and one healthy control). Sanger sequencing was also used to verify the WES results in 541 unrelated Uyghur COPD patients and 534 Uyghur healthy controls. WES showed 72 single nucleotide variants (SNVs), two deletions, and small insertions (InDels), 26 copy number variants (CNVs), and 34 structural variants (SVs), including g.71230620T > A (rs12449210T > A, NC_000,016.10) in the HYDIN axonemal central pair apparatus protein (HYDIN) gene and g.61190482A > G (rs777591A > G, NC_000002.12) in the ubiquitin-specific protease 34 (USP34) gene.

The origin of this autoreactive response remains unclear. However, for several autoreactive responses, molecular mimicry between environmental antigens and human proteins is key to trigger autoantibodies and finally autoimmunity manifestations. Considering that PR3 is a serine protease and house dust mite (HDM) group 3 allergens share this biochemical activity, the aim of this study was to identify cross-reactive epitopes between serine proteases from human and mites using an in silico approach. Methods: Multi alignment among amino acid sequences of PR3 and HDM group 3 allergens was performed to explore identity and structural homology. ElliPro and BepiPred  in silico tools were used to predict B and T cell epitopes. Consurf tool was used to conduct identification of conserved regions in serine proteases family. Results: PR3 and HDM group 3 allergens shared moderate identity and structural homology (root mean square deviation < 1). One B cell cross reactive epitope among serine proteases was identified (29I, 30V, 31G, 32G, 34E, 36K, 37A, 38L, 39A and 54C) and two T cell epitopes.

EB is accompanied by congenital absence of skin (EB with CAS) in some patients. Pathogenic variants of COL7A1 are responsible for EB with CAS in the vast majority of cases. Type and subtype diagnosis of EB with CAS generally requires specific immunohistological examinations that are not widely available plus targeted gene analysis. The present study aimed to determine the clinical features of five patients affected by EB with CAS and to identify the underlying genetic defects using whole exome sequencing (WES) followed by focused analysis of the target genes. Four patients had generalized skin involvement and one had localized defects. Two patients exhibited extremely severe skin manifestations and congenital cloudy cornea along with pyloric atresia, and one had partial esophagogastric obstruction and anuria due to vesicoureteric obstruction. In the WES analysis, the average coverage of the target exons was 99.05% (726 of 733 exons), with a range of 96.4-100% for individual genes. We identified four novel and two known pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants of five distinct genes in the examined families: PLEC:c.2536G > T (p.Glu846Ter); LAMC2:c.3385C > T (p.Arg1129Ter); KRT5:c.429G > A (p.Glu477Lys); ITGB4:c.794dupC (p.Ala266SerfsTer5); COL7A1:c.5440C > T (p.Arg1814Cys); and COL7A1:c.6103delG. All alleles were inherited from the parents, except for the KRT5 variant as a de novo finding. The findings reveal extremely rare phenotypes found in EB with CAS, namely congenital cloudy cornea, esophagogastric obstruction, and anuria, and extend the genotypic spectrum of EB-related genes. The data confirm that WES provides very high coverage of coding exons/genes and support its use as a reasonable alternative method for diagnosis of EB. The present data from an underrepresented population in Southeast Asia could further broaden the knowledge and research on EB.","We thank the patients’ families for their participation in this study.

The goal of the current study was to determine the relationship between populist attitudes, based on the populist demand and the perception of the populist offer, and several indices of political cynicism and attitudes toward democracy in Peru. To do this, a quantitative correlational study including 391 participants from diverse Peruvian locations was carried out. Both populist attitudes and critical perception of the populist offer are found to be directly related to Political Cynicism in its dimensions of Political Distrust, Political Hopelessness, and Political Moral Laxity, and inversely related to the dimension of Political System Change. Similarly, both dimensions of populism are directly related to Democratic Support and inversely related to Democratic Satisfaction. The findings support the notion that populist attitudes emerge in the context of distrust of the system and express an ambivalent relationship with democracy.

Recent studies have identified novel metabolites produced by Penicillium sclerotiorum that have antibacterial, antifouling and pharmaceutical activities. Here, we report the isolation of a P. sclerotiorum (LM 5679) from Amazonian soil and carry out a culture-based study to determine whether it can produce any novel secondary metabolite(s) that are not thus-far reported for this genus. Using a submerged culture system, secondary metabolites were recovered by solvent extract followed by thin-layer chromatography, nuclear magnetic resonance, and mass spectroscopy. One novel secondary metabolite was isolated from P. sclerotiorum (LM 5679); the phenolic compound 5-pentadecyl resorcinol widely known as an antifungal, that is produced by diverse plant species. This metabolite was not reported previously in any Penicillium species and was only found once before in fungi (that time, in a Fusarium).

To locate the precise breakpoints, whole genomes of DNA were sequenced based on the nanopore GridION platform, and bioinformatic analyses were further confirmed by polymerase-chain-reaction (PCR) and copy number variation (CNV). Nanopore sequencing results were consistent with the karyotype analysis. Meanwhile, two breakpoints were successfully validated using polymerase-chain-reaction and Sanger Sequencing. LOC105378102 and LMLN genes were disrupted at the breakpoint junctions. Notably, observations found that seemingly balanced translocation was unbalanced due to a cryptic 269 kilobases (Kb) microduplication and a 25 bp deletion at the breakpoints of chromosome (chr) 6 and chr 3, respectively. Furthermore, 269 Kb microduplication was also confirmed by copy number variation analyses. In summary, nanopore sequencing was a rapid and direct method for identifying the precise breakpoints of a balanced translocation despite low coverage (3.8×). In addition, cryptic deletion and duplication were able to be detected at the single-nucleotide level.",This study was completed in the Genetic and Prenatal Diagnosis Center of First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University.,This study was supported by Key Scientific Research Projects in Colleges and Universities of Henan Province (22A320075).,Frontiers in Genetics,,,,2022-08-26,2022,2022-08-26,,13,,883398,All OA; Gold,Article,"Wang, Yanan; Zhao, Zhenhua; Fu, Xinyu; Li, Shufang; Zhang, Qiuyan; Kong, Xiangdong","Wang, Yanan (Genetic and Prenatal Diagnosis Center, Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, China); Zhao, Zhenhua (Genetic and Prenatal Diagnosis Center, Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, China); Fu, Xinyu (Genetic and Prenatal Diagnosis Center, Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, China); Li, Shufang (Genetic and Prenatal Diagnosis Center, Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, China); Zhang, Qiuyan (Genetic and Prenatal Diagnosis Center, Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, China); Kong, Xiangdong (Genetic and Prenatal Diagnosis Center, Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, China)","Kong, Xiangdong (First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University)","Wang, Yanan (First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University); Zhao, Zhenhua (First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University); Fu, Xinyu (First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University); Li, Shufang (First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University); Zhang, Qiuyan (First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University); Kong, Xiangdong (First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University)",1,1,0.17,0.42,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fgene.2022.883398/pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1150500235,31 Biological Sciences; 3105 Genetics,

Furthermore, calcium influx through store-operated channels (SOCs) is particularly important in the vasoconstrictor response to hypoxia. Previously, we found a decrease in pulmonary hypertension and remodeling in normoxic newborn lambs partially gestated under chronic hypoxia, when treated with 2-aminoethyldiphenyl borinate (2-APB), a non-specific SOC blocker. However, the effects of 2-APB are unknown in neonates completely gestated, born, and raised under environmental hypoxia. Accordingly, we studied the effects of 2-APB-treatment on the cardiopulmonary variables in lambs under chronic hypobaric hypoxia. Experiments were done in nine newborn lambs gestated, born, and raised in high altitude (3,600 m): five animals were treated with 2-APB [intravenous (i.v.) 10 mg kg-1] for 10 days, while other four animals received vehicle. During the treatment, cardiopulmonary variables were measured daily, and these were also evaluated during an acute episode of superimposed hypoxia, 1 day after the end of the treatment. Furthermore, pulmonary vascular remodeling was assessed by histological analysis 2 days after the end of the treatment. Basal cardiac output and mean systemic arterial pressure (SAP) and resistance from 2-APB- and vehicle-treated lambs did not differ along with the treatment. Mean pulmonary arterial pressure (mPAP) decreased after the first day of 2-APB treatment and remained lower than the vehicle-treated group until the third day, and during the fifth, sixth, and ninth day of treatment. The net mPAP increase in response to acute hypoxia did not change, but the pressure area under the curve (AUC) during hypoxia was slightly lower in 2-APB-treated lambs than in vehicle-treated lambs. Moreover, the 2-APB treatment decreased the pulmonary arterial wall thickness and the α-actin immunoreactivity and increased the luminal area with no changes in the vascular density. Our findings show that 2-APB treatment partially reduced the contractile hypoxic response and reverted the pulmonary vascular remodeling, but this is not enough to normalize the pulmonary hemodynamics in chronically hypoxic newborn lambs.","The authors thank Carlos Brito, Juan Carlos Fuenzalida, and Gabino Llusco for excellent technical assistance.","This work was supported by grants 1120605, 1140647, 1201283, 1210504, and 1211443 from the National Fund for Scientific and Technological Development of Chile (FONDECYT) and Puente ICBM 2019 grants.",Frontiers in Physiology,,,,2022-01-10,2022,2022-01-10,,12,,765281,All OA; Gold,Article,"Castillo-Galán, Sebastián; Parrau, Daniela; Hernández, Ismael; Quezada, Sebastián; Díaz, Marcela; Ebensperger, Germán; Herrera, Emilio A.; Moraga, Fernando A.; Iturriaga, Rodrigo; Llanos, Aníbal J.; Reyes, Roberto V.","Castillo-Galán, Sebastián (Laboratorio de Neurobiología, Facultad de Ciencias Biológicas, Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile, Santiago, Chile); Parrau, Daniela (Unidad de Fisiología y Fisiopatología Perinatal, Programa de Fisiopatología, Facultad de Medicina, Instituto de Ciencias Biomédicas, Universidad de Chile, Santiago, Chile); Hernández, Ismael (Unidad de Fisiología y Fisiopatología Perinatal, Programa de Fisiopatología, Facultad de Medicina, Instituto de Ciencias Biomédicas, Universidad de Chile, Santiago, Chile); Quezada, Sebastián (School of Health and Biomedical Sciences, RMIT University, Bundoora, VIC, Australia); Díaz, Marcela (Departamento de Promoción de la Salud de la Mujer y el Recién Nacido, Facultad de Medicina, Universidad de Chile, Santiago, Chile); Ebensperger, Germán (Unidad de Fisiología y Fisiopatología Perinatal, Programa de Fisiopatología, Facultad de Medicina, Instituto de Ciencias Biomédicas, Universidad de Chile, Santiago, Chile; International Center for Andean Studies, Universidad de Chile, Santiago, Chile); Herrera, Emilio A.

Compounds 3a, 3b, 3d, 3e, and 3h showed remarkable cytotoxic activity on specific human cancer cell lines when compared to the anti-cancer drug, paclitaxel. Compound 3a was found to be particularly effective on promyelocytic leukaemia HL60 and non-Hodgkin lymphoma U937, with IC50 values of 21 and 30 μM, respectively. Compound 3d showed significant activity against cervical cancer HeLa (IC50 = 10 μM). The compounds 3e and 3h were strongly active against glioblastoma multiform tumour T98G, with IC50 values of 12 and 22 μM, respectively. These five compounds showed an interesting cytotoxic activity on four human cancer cell types of high incidence. The molecular docking results reveal a good correlation between experimental activity and calculated binding affinity on dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR).

METHODS: This is a cross-sectional survey. An online questionnaire based on the ""Noise Exposure Questionnaire"", plus 11 questions regarding hearing loss were sent to 730 randomly selected students. Participants self-reported time spent on different leisure noise activities and their subjective evaluation of the loudness of these activities, converted into equivalent noise levels, were used to estimate weekly noise exposure levels that were compared to occupational noise limits (> 85 dBA = hazardous). Inference statistics was applied to relate hearing symptoms and ""likely or having some degree of hearing loss"" with hazardous weekly leisure noise exposure levels.
RESULTS: Ninety-three percent of the participants reported at least one hypoacusis symptom. The most frequent sound-related ear symptom was tinnitus (72%). Fifty-five percent of the individuals presented weekly exposure to noise >85 dBA. Symptoms of hearing loss were more prevalent in those exposed to weekly noise levels >85 dBA.
CONCLUSION: This study suggests that there may be hearing loss caused by exposure to high levels of leisure noise in a large part of the study population. Health promotion of hearing conservation should be emphasized at university level.

Previous studies have found that vitamin D deficiency and vitamin D receptor (VDR) TaqI, BsmI, FokI, and ApaI gene single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) influence immune response and susceptibility to skin disorders.
AIM: To explore the role of VDR SNPs, and the association of vitamin D serum levels in a sample of Colombian Caribbean CSU patients. Methods: It is a case-control study. A group of CSU patients (n = 100) was compared with healthy individuals as a control group (n = 100). VDR polymorphisms were genotyped by quantitative polymerase chain reaction and Taqman® probes. Allelic, genotypic, and haplotype associations were estimated. Serum vitamin D levels were measured using enzyme-linked-immunosorbent serologic assay.
RESULTS: Compared to the control group, the presence of G allele in TaqI and A allele in FokI SNPs of VDR gene was found to be a risk factor for CSU (odds ratio (OR) estimated using logistic regression adjusted by gender: 2.08 and 1.61, respectively, all P values < 0.05). The individuals who carry GCCA haplotype showed decrease in vitamin D levels (11.34 ng/mL; P = 0.002) with the G allele of TaqI and A allele of FokI gene SNPs.

By reducing biomass fluctuation, biodiversity could mitigate the impact of changing environmental conditions on rural incomes as long as people exploits a diverse set of natural assets. This effect is analogous to the risk-spreading function of financial portfolios. This paper presents evidence of the portfolio effect for an open-access artisanal fishery in an estuarine ecosystem, located in a Colombian Biosphere Reserve. Using catch statistics from 2002 to 2018, we evaluate the contribution of catch diversity to the stabilization of fishing income. We find that changes in catch composition are related to seasonal and interannual variations in salinity conditions. The portfolio effect arises from asynchronous fluctuations of fish species due to fluctuating environmental conditions. Catch diversification, instead of specialization, help achieve resilient fisheries.",,"Andrés Vargas and David Diaz received funding from Universidad del Norte, www.uninorte.edu.co.

The findings show that the Casanare department had the highest risk of producing victims (SMR: 2.545). In departments where the educational level of women is at or below primary school, there is a high-risk β = 0.343 (0.285, 0.397) of them being assaulted. For the departments in which the employment of women is in sales and services or office workers, the associated factor presents a higher risk β = 0.361 (0.201, 0.485), as in the risk related to affiliation with the social security system β = 0.338 (0.246, 0.498), as well as sexual and reproductive life β = 0.143 (0.003, 0.322). The following categories were associated with physical gender violence: no education and low participation in making purchases at home β = 0.106 (0.049, 0.199), low participation in decisions about their health, and visits to family and friends β = 0.240 (0.170, 0.299). Therefore, public health programs should strengthen women's empowerment in household decisions and increase their educational level to reduce this incidence.",,The author(s) received no specific funding for this work.,PLOS ONE,,Yann Benetreau,Humans; Female; Colombia; Bayes Theorem; Violence; Intimate Partner Violence; Sexual Behavior; Sexual Partners; Risk Factors,2022-12-22,2022,2022-12-22,,17,12,e0279444,All OA; Gold,Article,"Freile, Isaac Esteban Camargo; Lozano, Karen Cecilia Flórez; Crespo, Carlos Alberto Sarmiento; Camargo, Carolina Mercedes Vecchio; Acosta, Sandra Milena Rodríguez; Florez-Garcia, Victor; Lechuga, Edgar Navarro","Freile, Isaac Esteban Camargo (Department of Mathematics and Statistics, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia; School of Basic Sciences, Technology, and Engineering, Universidad Nacional Abierta y a Distancia–UNAD, Barranquilla, Colombia); Lozano, Karen Cecilia Flórez (Department of Mathematics and Statistics, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); Crespo, Carlos Alberto Sarmiento (National Institute of Legal Medicine and Forensic Sciences—North Regional, Bogota, Colombia); Camargo, Carolina Mercedes Vecchio (Department of Economics, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); Acosta, Sandra Milena Rodríguez (Department of Economics, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); Florez-Garcia, Victor (Department of Public Health, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia; Joseph J.

All diagnoses by renal biopsy with light microscopy and immunofluorescence obtained between January 2008 and June 2018 were recorded. Eight hundred and seventy-one renal biopsies were obtained. The main clinical indication for biopsy was nephritic syndrome (36%). SGD was more frequent than PGD (55% vs. 45%). Within SGD group, lupus nephritis (LN) was the most frequent etiology (83%). Within PGD group, membranous nephropathy (33%) and focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) (19%) were the most common glomerular diseases.

The catalysts were characterized by XRF, XRD, textural properties, XPS, Raman, Py-TPD, and EDS elemental mapping. The chemical analyses by X-ray fluorescence (XRF), EDS elemental mapping, and CHNS-O elemental analysis showed stoichiometric values Al/Mg = 38-40, Mo:Ni:P ∼ 1, and S ≤ 4.5 wt % (this value means that the molar ratio Mo:S ∼ 1.0:1.6, i.e., MoS2); also EDS elemental mapping confirmed the presence of Mo, Ni, Al, O, P, Mg, and S with good distribution on Al2O3-MgO. The impregnation of metals leads to a decrease in the surface area and pore volume as follows NiMoP-S/γ-Al2O3-MgO < MoP-S/γ-Al2O3-MgO < NiP-S/γ-Al2O3-MgO < Al2O3-MgO < Al2O3 (unimodal pore size distribution), propitiating a pseudo bimodal pore size distribution with Dp-BJH between ∼5-7 nm and 11.8-14.2 nm for the presence of MgO. XRD confirmed differences between metallic phosphates and phosphides, and XPS confirmed the presence at the surface of Moδ+(0 < δ+ < 2), Mo4+, Mo6+, Niδ+(0 < δ+ < 2), Ni2+, S2-, SO4 2-, Pδ+, and P5+ species. Raman revealed the presence of MoS2 only in MoP-S/γ-Al2O3-MgO and NiMoP-S/γ-Al2O3-MgO, while the NiMoP-S/γ-Al2O3-MgO catalyst had a more significant number of Brønsted and Lewis sites, although the increasing temperature decreased the Lewis sites. MoP-S/γ-Al2O3-MgO was more active at HDO showing the highest production rate for octadecane of 53 mol/(gcat·h), whereas NiP-S/γ-Al2O3-MgO was more active at HDCx-HDCn [45 mol/(gcat·h)] and HCK [6 mol/(gcat·h)]; meanwhile, NiMoP-S/γ-Al2O3-MgO had a mix of HDO [47 mol/(gcat·h)] and HDCx-HDCn [41 mol/(gcat·h)]. This showed production towards octadecane, heptadecane, and light hydrocarbons, meaning that the fatty acids were deoxygenated through bifunctional sites for hydrogenation (HYD) and hydrogenolysis (HYG) as follows: MoP-S/γ-Al2O3-MgO (K1 = 0.08 and K2 = 0.03 L/mol) < NiMoP-S/γ-Al2O3-MgO (K1 = 0.25 and K2 = 0.45 L/mol) < NiP-S/γ-Al2O3-MgO (K1 = 2.5 and K2 = 6.5 L/mol). For this reason, we considered that phosphide acts as a structural promoter with sulfur on its surface as a ""mixed phosphidic-sulphidic species"", allowing the largest generation of heptadecane and octadecane by the presence of BRIM sites for HYD and CUS sites for HYG.","The authors would like to acknowledge financial support by Universidad del Atlántico and Universidad del Norte, and the fine technical assistance of Catalysis Research Center-CICAT UIS.

This is especially relevant if there are important gaps among these locations in terms of significant factors such as job opportunities, quality of health service, among others. This research presents a methodology to perform a recommended geographic redistribution of immigrants to improve their chances of socio-economic integration. The proposed methodology adapts a data-driven algorithm developed by the Immigration Policy Lab at Stanford University to allocate immigrants based on a socio-economic integration outcome across available locations. We extend their approach to study the immigration process between two developing countries. Specifically, we focus on the case of the arrival of immigrants from Venezuela to Colombia. We consider the absorptive capacity of locations in Colombia and include the health and education needs of immigrants in our analysis. From the application in the Venezuelan-Colombian context, we find that the proposed redistribution increases the probability that immigrants access formal employment by more than 50%. Furthermore, we identify variables associated with immigrants' formal employment and discuss specific strategies to improve the probability of success of vulnerable immigrants.","We would like to specially thank Dr. Duncan Lawrence, Dr. Jens Hainmueller, and Jennifer Fei from the Immigration Policy Lab for accompanying us in this research and for providing their support and feedback.

In Colombia and Latin America, there are few studies on the immune response of the newborn against SARS-CoV-2.
AIM: To determine the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in umbilical cord blood in two hospital centers in Córdoba and Sucre.
METHODS: Between March and June 2021, a prospective descriptive cross-sectional study was carried out. Two hospitals from the departments of Córdoba and Sucre, located in the Northwest Caribbean area of Colombia, participated. Three hundred sixty umbilical cord blood samples were taken at the two hospitals. A commercial ELISA was performed to detect total IgG, IgM, and IgA antibodies against the N protein of SARS-CoV-2. The ethics committee approved the study of the participating institutions.
RESULTS: Of 3.291 women who gave birth in the hospital centers included in the study, 360 (11%) participated. Complete clinical data were obtained for 223 women. The mean age of the women was 24 years (range, 15-42). 29.4% (106/360) of the umbilical cord samples had total antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. Pregnant women did not have blood samples taken. 58% of the women were asymptomatic. There was no association between umbilical cord samples, clinical, epidemiological characteristics, and serological response to antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 (p > 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of umbilical cord blood samples was 29.4% for total SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. The study provides essential aspects for the epidemiological approach to neonates infected with SARS-CoV-2.","To Dr. Oscar Vergara of the University of Córdoba, for his advice on the statistical analysis.

Using copper-catalyzed Chan-Lam coupling, we synthesized 32 new N-aryl-3-formyl-2-quinolone derivatives at 80 °C, in air and using inexpensive phenylboronic acids as arylating agents. 3-formyl-2-quinolones and substituted 3-formyl-2-quinolones can act as substrates, and among the products, the p-methyl derivative 9a was used as a substrate to obtain different derivatives such as alcohol, amine, nitrile, and chalcone.","The authors thank Universidad del Norte, Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile, Fondecyt and MINCIENCIAS for financial support.","This research was funded by Fondecyt, grant number: 1210751 (EGP) and the Basal project, grant number: AFB180001 (PH-I).",Molecules,,"Dominique Agustin, Jana Pisk",Copper; Catalysis; Amines,2022-11-30,2022,2022-11-30,,27,23,8345,All OA; Gold,Article,"Valencia, Jhesua; Sánchez-Velasco, Oriel A; Saavedra-Olavarría, Jorge; Hermosilla-Ibáñez, Patricio; Pérez, Edwin G; Insuasty, Daniel","Valencia, Jhesua (Departamento de Química y Biología, División de Ciencias Básicas, Universidad del Norte, Km 5 Vía Puerto Colombia, Barranquilla 081007, Colombia.); Sánchez-Velasco, Oriel A (Department of Organic Chemistry, Faculty of Chemistry and Pharmacy, Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile, Santiago 7820436, Chile.); Saavedra-Olavarría, Jorge (Department of Organic Chemistry, Faculty of Chemistry and Pharmacy, Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile, Santiago 7820436, Chile.); Hermosilla-Ibáñez, Patricio (Center for the Development of Nanoscience and Nanotechnology (CEDENNA), Materials Chemistry Department, Faculty of Chemistry and Biology, University of Santiago, Chile, Santiago 9170022, Chile.); Pérez, Edwin G (Department of Organic Chemistry, Faculty of Chemistry and Pharmacy, Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile, Santiago 7820436, Chile.); Insuasty, Daniel (Departamento de Química y Biología, División de Ciencias Básicas, Universidad del Norte, Km 5 Vía Puerto Colombia, Barranquilla 081007, Colombia.)","Pérez, Edwin G (Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile); Insuasty, Daniel (Universidad del Norte)","Valencia, Jhesua (Universidad del Norte); Sánchez-Velasco, Oriel A (Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile); Saavedra-Olavarría, Jorge (Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile); Hermosilla-Ibáñez, Patricio (University of Santiago Chile); Pérez, Edwin G (Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile); Insuasty, Daniel (Universidad del Norte)",3,3,,0.87,https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/27/23/8345/pdf?version=1669801206,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1153265306,34 Chemical Sciences; 3402 Inorganic Chemistry; 3405 Organic Chemistry,

OBJECTIVE: To identify differentially expressed gene profiles of leukoplakia and its progression to oral squamous cell carcinoma, essential for the discovery of new biomarkers to predict and prevent the presence of diseases in the oral cavity.
METHODS: Initially, gene profiles of GSE85514 and GSE160042 from the Gene Expression Omnibus database were used. Differentially expressed genes were identified using GEO2R. The CLUEGO plugin in Cytoscape was used for DEG functionality and enrichment analysis. Finally, a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was constructed using Cytoscape from data collected online from the STRING server.
RESULTS: According to the MCC algorithm, the 10 most found gene sequences were HNRNPU, SMC1A, PAFAH1B1, EHMT1, SPTBN4, OLFM1, NCAM1, SF3B3, FGF2, and UBE2I; with HNRNPU, SMC1A, and PAFAH1B1 being the most representative of the modules.
CONCLUSIONS: We were able to describe the gene sequences that promote the progression from leukoplakia to oral squamous cell carcinoma. Within these genes, the HNRNPU, SMC1A, and PAFAH1B1 constitute the main promising therapeutic targets to counteract the progression of oral cancer, they could also be important biomarkers for the diagnosis and classification of the disease.",We thank the computer time provided by the University of Cartagena and the Professors Antistio Alviz-Amador and Rafael Pineda-Aleman,,Asian Pacific Journal of Cancer Prevention,,,"Humans; Mouth Neoplasms; Squamous Cell Carcinoma of Head and Neck; Carcinoma, Squamous Cell; Computational Biology; Leukoplakia; Head and Neck Neoplasms; Gene Expression",2022-11-01,2022,2022-11-01,2022-11-01,23,11,3833-3842,All OA; Gold,Article,"de Avila, Jaime Guzman; Redondo, Carlos Silvera; Alviz-Amador, Antistio","de Avila, Jaime Guzman (Department of Oral Medicine, School of Dentistry, University of Cartagena Cartagena, Colombia.); Redondo, Carlos Silvera (Department of Genetics, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia.); Alviz-Amador, Antistio (Pharmacology and Therapeutic Group, Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Cartagena, Health Science Campus, Colombia.)","Alviz-Amador, Antistio (University of Cartagena)","de Avila, Jaime Guzman (University of Cartagena); Redondo, Carlos Silvera (Universidad del Norte); Alviz-Amador, Antistio (University of Cartagena)",1,1,,0.49,http://journal.waocp.org/article_90375_a21f6087284bf5346bca4ba23b01d100.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1153204503,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3211 Oncology and Carcinogenesis,

Consequently, a solution-based up-scalable synthesis approach is developed for polymeric quinone composites with graphene. Cellulose nanocrystals play a vital role in achieving greener processing and improving the composite electrochemical energy storage performance. The synthesis method emphasizes using aqueous reaction media, incorporates low-cost and biomass-derived feedstocks, avoids critical or scarce materials, and maintains temperatures below 200 °C. Stable aqueous graphene dispersions were obtained by hydrothermal reduction of electrochemically exfoliated graphene oxide in the presence of cellulose nanocrystals. Dispersions served as a reaction medium for quinone cationic polymerization, leading to core-shell type structures of polymer-covered mono-to-few layer graphene, thanks to the nanosheet restacking prevention effect provided by cellulose nanocrystal dispersions. A sample consisting of 5 wt% cellulose nanocrystals and 5 wt% graphene achieved storage metrics of 720.5 F g-1 and 129.6 mA h g-1 at 1 A g-1, retaining over 70% of the performance after 1000 charge/discharge cycles.",The authors would like to acknowledge Minciencias for the financial support given within the framework of the PhD National Scholarship Colciencias No. 617-2014 (UN-OJ-2014-26159).,,RSC Advances,,,,2022-03-21,2022,2022,2022-03-21,12,15,9416-9423,All OA; Gold,Article,"Illera-Perozo, Danny; Gomez-Vega, Humberto; Ram, Manoj","Illera-Perozo, Danny (Department of Mechanical Engineering, Universidad Del Norte km 5 Vía Puerto Colombia Barranquilla Atlántico 081007 Colombia.); Gomez-Vega, Humberto (Department of Mechanical Engineering, Universidad Del Norte km 5 Vía Puerto Colombia Barranquilla Atlántico 081007 Colombia.); Ram, Manoj (PolyMaterials APP, LLC Tampa FL 33612 USA.)","Illera-Perozo, Danny (Universidad del Norte)","Illera-Perozo, Danny (Universidad del Norte); Gomez-Vega, Humberto (Universidad del Norte); Ram, Manoj (PolyMaterials APP, LLC Tampa FL 33612 USA.)",2,1,,0.5,https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlepdf/2022/ra/d2ra01232d,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1146555543,34 Chemical Sciences; 3403 Macromolecular and Materials Chemistry; 3406 Physical Chemistry,7 Affordable and Clean Energy

The variables of synthesis were the ethylene glycol:citric acid molar ratio and the pH. High reproducibility of the anatase and tenorite phase was obtained for all synthesis routes. The degree of purity of the powders was confirmed by XRD, FTIR, UV-Vis absorption and XPS spectra. SEM and TEM images revealed the powders are composed of micrometer grains that can have a spherical shape (only in the TiO2) or formed by a non-compacted nanocrystalline conglomerate. FTIR spectra only displayed vibrational modes associating TiO2 and CuO with nanoparticle behavior. UV-Vis absorption spectra revealed the values of maximum absorbance percentage of both systems are reached in the ultraviolet region, with percentages above 83% throughout the entire visible light spectrum for the CuO system, a relevant result for solar cell applications. Finally, XPS experiments allow the observation of the valence bands and the calculation of the energy bands of all oxides.","The authors gratefully acknowledge the financial support of Fondo CTeI—Sistema General de Regalías, through project BPIN 2018000100092.

However, fruit structure is incompletely known within the family, thus the importance of this character is unclear. This study of fruit anatomy in the traditional tribe Canarieae examines the distribution of the tissues that correspond to the exo-, meso-, and endocarp. The detailed arrangement and measurement of the tissues are reported here for the first time in all eight genera in the tribe. The evidence suggests that in all cases except Pseudodacryodes, the endocarp has at least one layer of parenchyma cells within which a sclereid layer is evident and, in some cases, an inner epidermis. All Canarieae fruits exhibit secretory canals, and some taxa have epidermal glands with resin-like contents. Evidence of carpellar sutures was found for all Canarieae, and in Dacryodes, Haplolobus, Rosselia, and Santiria, an articulated plate is present that corresponds to an abortive locule. The anatomical and morphological characters presented here are useful in delimiting genera within Canarieae.","I thank Douglas C.

The group of participants were 302 students who are studying in different universities of the city and took their virtual or remote classes with a flipped classroom strategy. Students identified their learning styles, experiences and characteristics of the virtual or remote classes and their class preferences. In addition, they mentioned resources and learning spaces used by the teachers that promote collaboration and knowledge development and technology used by the university to develop classes. Given the results of the survey, it was determined that flipped classroom strategy is a useful method for the students because it allowed them to be more self-taught (independent learning) during pandemic. It was possible to identify their learning styles and to create spaces of greater participation with the teachers as guides. Flipped classrooms allow learning by doing, developing and participating and no memorizing (traditional method) supported by emerging technologies applied in university teaching.

METHODS: We compare national to diaspora IMRs over the period 1980-2018. National IMRs are death-to-birth ratios reported by the official vital statistics, whereas diaspora IMRs are calculated by using a semiparametric regression model on the summary birth histories collected in the population censuses. We analyse the diaspora IMRs according to whether their arrival corresponds to precrisis or crisis-driven migration.
RESULTS: During crises, diaspora IMRs show better health outcomes than those of non-migrants. The Colombian diaspora had an average annual IMR of -1.8 (95% CI -3.3 to 0.28) per year and the Venezuelan diaspora had -4.5 (95% CI -5.8 to -3.3). However, the protective role of migration is neither guaranteed nor consistent, as a crisis in the country of destination exposes immigrants to worse health outcomes than the non-migrant population.
CONCLUSION: Migration is a survival strategy that allows people to reduce the negative effects they face during a crisis in their country of origin. The distinction between crisis-driven and precrisis migration provides a framework for assessing the cross-border effects on health outcomes due to diaspora composition, particularly when populations face adverse conditions.",,"JA received funding from the European Union's Horizon 2020 Excellent Science, Marie Skłodowska–Curie, Individual fellowship program 2019 (Grant agreement No: 892134).

Experiencia de un centro de la ciudad de Medellín, Colombia","OBJETIVO: El objetivo de este estudio fue caracterizar la clasificación hemodinámica de la hipertensión pulmonar en una serie de pacientes llevados a cateterismo cardíaco derecho.
MÉTODOS: Se realizó un estudio retrospectivo y se revisaron los registros de los cateterismos cardíacos derechos practicados en personas mayores de 18 años entre enero de 2017 y diciembre del 2018. Se excluyó a aquéllos con datos incompletos o no concluyentes y se definieron los perfiles hemodinámicos de acuerdo con el resultado de la presión en cuña y la resistencia vascular pulmonar.
RESULTADOS: Se incluyó a 92 sujetos de los cuales se descartó hipertensión pulmonar en 4. El 26.1% se clasificó como precapilar, 31.8% como poscapilar y 42% como combinada. No hubo diferencias entre los tres grupos en edad y sexo; las presiones pulmonares fueron más elevadas en el grupo de hipertensión pulmonar precapilar. Se encontró presión en cuña elevada en el 73.8% de los pacientes y el cateterismo derecho reclasificó al 35% de los pacientes en un grupo hemodinámico diferente al esperado. En la mayor parte de estos casos se sospechaba HP precapilar por el diagnóstico anterior al procedimiento, pero los perfiles hemodinámicos encontrados correspondieron a hipertensión poscapilar o combinada.
CONCLUSIÓN: El cateterismo cardíaco derecho es necesario para la clasificación hemodinámica de la hipertensión pulmonar, que es importante no sólo para el diagnóstico sino para evaluar la causa de la enfermedad.
OBJECTIVE: To characterize the hemodynamic classification of pulmonary hypertension in a series of patients undergoing to right cardiac catheterization.
METHODS: This is a retrospective study, we analyze the records of all right heart catheterizations performed between January 2017 and December 2018, all patient older than 18 years were included and those with incomplete or inconclusive data were excluded. We identify three hemodynamic profiles according to the result of right heart catheterization.
RESULTS: 92 subjects were included and pulmonary hypertension was ruled out in 4 of them; 26.1% were classified as precapillary, 31.8% postcapillary and 42% as combined pulmonary hypertesion. There were no differences between the 3 groups in age or sex, pulmonary pressures were higher in the precapillary pulmonary hypertension group, right catheterization reclassified 35% of the patients in a hemodynamic group in a different from that expected. Precapillary PH was suspected in most of these cases, but the hemodynamic profiles found in cardiac catheterization corresponded to post-capillary or combined pulmonay hypertension.

Falls have become a social and global public health concern due to the current aging population in Africa and across the globe. However, their prevalence and risk factors have received little attention in Africa.
Purpose: Thus, this study aimed to provide a baseline survey to determine the prevalence and associated risk factors for falls among older adults attending a primary care facility in Cape Coast, Ghana.
Results: Participants (n = 244) were patients aged 60 years and older who visited the University of Cape Coast Hospital. The prevalence of falls identified in this hospital-based study was 40.2%. The following independent variables were found to be statistically significant predictors of risk of falls among the participants when compared with their respective reference categories; age 80 years and above [OR = 3.707, 95% CI = 1.738 - 7.907, p = 0.001], participants who had a history of falls [OR = 2.234, 95% CI = 1.326 - 3.765, p = 0.003], participants with three or more co-morbidities [OR = 16.456, 95% CI = 2.099 - 129.020, p = 0.008] and obesity [OR = 2.211, 95% CI = 1.151 - 4.250, p = 0.017].
Conclusion: The prevalence of falls among older adults is high. Thus, clinicians in the primary care setting should screen for, give fall prevention education, and prescribe appropriate interventions to at-risk patients.",,,Malawi Medical Journal,,,"Humans; Middle Aged; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Prevalence; Ghana; Risk Factors; Primary Health Care",2022-12-16,2022,2022-12-16,2022-12,34,4,225-230,All OA; Gold,Article,"Adanusa, Madison; Pobee, Seth Kofi; Zaabaar, Ebenezer; Mawuko, Vukey; Asiedu, Kofi; Amuzu, Solomon Kweku; Adubofour, Wendy; Bazayeya, Celestine; Senaya, Ethel Enam Yawo; Ofori, Desiree Citsofe; Kyei, Samuel","Adanusa, Madison (Division of Family Medicine, Directorate of University Health Services, University of Cape Coast, Cape Coast, Ghana); Pobee, Seth Kofi (Department of Physician Assistant Studies, College of Health and Allied Sciences, University of Cape Coast, Cape Coast, Ghana); Zaabaar, Ebenezer (Department of Optometry and Vision Science, College of Health and Allied Sciences, University of Cape Coast, Cape Coast, Ghana); Mawuko, Vukey (Department of Imaging Technology and Sonography, College of Health and Allied Sciences, University of Cape Coast, Cape Coast, Ghana); Asiedu, Kofi (School of Optometry and vision science, Faculty of Medicine and Health, University of New South Wales, Sydney, Australia); Amuzu, Solomon Kweku (Department of Physician Assistant Studies, College of Health and Allied Sciences, University of Cape Coast, Cape Coast, Ghana); Adubofour, Wendy (Department of Physician Assistant Studies, College of Health and Allied Sciences, University of Cape Coast, Cape Coast, Ghana); Bazayeya, Celestine (Department of Physician Assistant Studies, College of Health and Allied Sciences, University of Cape Coast, Cape Coast, Ghana); Senaya, Ethel Enam Yawo (Department of Physician Assistant Studies, College of Health and Allied Sciences, University of Cape Coast, Cape Coast, Ghana); Ofori, Desiree Citsofe (Department of Physician Assistant Studies, College of Health and Allied Sciences, University of Cape Coast, Cape Coast, Ghana); Kyei, Samuel (Department of Optometry and Vision Science, College of Health and Allied Sciences, University of Cape Coast, Cape Coast, Ghana)","Kyei, Samuel (University of Cape Coast)","Adanusa, Madison (University of Cape Coast); Pobee, Seth Kofi (University of Cape Coast); Zaabaar, Ebenezer (University of Cape Coast); Mawuko, Vukey (University of Cape Coast); Asiedu, Kofi (UNSW Sydney); Amuzu, Solomon Kweku (University of Cape Coast); Adubofour, Wendy (University of Cape Coast); Bazayeya, Celestine (University of Cape Coast); Senaya, Ethel Enam Yawo (University of Cape Coast); Ofori, Desiree Citsofe (University of Cape Coast); Kyei, Samuel (University of Cape Coast)",1,1,,0.59,https://www.ajol.info/index.php/mmj/article/download/238541/225434,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1157402736,42 Health Sciences; 4203 Health Services and Systems; 4206 Public Health,

AIM: To determine the factors associated with a low level of physical activity in adults during confinement during the COVID-19 pandemic.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Adults from Chile, Colombia, México and Perú were invited through social networks to answer an online survey. Questions about sociodemographic, health status and lifestyle variables were included. The level of physical activity and sedentary behavior were determined through the short version of the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ).
RESULTS: The survey was answered by 3,362 adults aged between 18 and 60 years. Respondents more likely to be inactive were women, those with less than eight years of education, those with overweight or obesity, those who smoked at least one cigarette a day, consumed alcohol four or more times a week, slept less than six hours per day and spent more than 6 hours per day in sedentary behaviors.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings provide a sociodemographic and lifestyle profile associated with physical inactivity during the period of confinement in Latin American adults.

This paper was devoted to the optimization of the thumb prosthesis's mechanism by taking into consideration the manufacturing cost model based on machining cost theory which took into detail the shape of the workpieces and the strength reliability of all the parts composing the entire mechanism. Every optimization problem displays a particular set of an independent vector of optimal parameters, showing the impact of each objective function on the configuration of the prosthetic device. The multiobjective optimization showed that the mechanical reliability and the production cost included in any combination of the simultaneous optimization enabled the achievement of the same optimum variables design, though with some exceptions. With the inclusion of the labor charges, the depreciation rate of the equipment, and production assets in the mathematical's manufacturing cost model, the optimal manufacturing cost generated from the numerical simulation was 501.0021 USD. Therefore, the global manufacturing cost and the mechanical strength reliability of the whole prosthesis mechanism have a real impact on the customization of the structure, due to the stochastic nature of the trajectory of the cutting tools during the manufacturing processes.",,,Applied Bionics and Biomechanics,,Francesca Cordella,,2022-09-05,2022,2022-09-05,2022-09-05,2022,,9647956,All OA; Gold,Article,"Tsamo, Nestor; Toko, Denis Tcheukam; Talla, Pierre Kisito","Tsamo, Nestor (Laboratory of Mechanics and Modelling of Physical Systems (L2MPS), Department of Physics, Faculty of Science, University of Dschang, P.

Manifest simultaneously as Poland-Möbius (Poland-Moebius) syndrome, debate continues as to whether this is a distinct nosological entity or represents phenotypic variation as part of a spectrum of disorders of rhomboencephalic development. Etiological hypotheses implicate both genetic and environmental factors. The PLXND1 gene codes for a protein expressed in the fetal central nervous system and vascular endothelium and is thus involved in embryonic neurogenesis and vasculogenesis. It is located at chromosome region 3q21-q22, a locus of interest for Möbius syndrome.Case presentationWe present the first report of a patient with Poland-Möbius syndrome and a mutation in the PLXND1 gene. A child with Poland-Möbius syndrome and a maternally inherited missense variant (NM_015103.2:ex14:c.2890G > Ap.V964M) in the PLXND1 gene is described. In order to contextualize these findings, the literature was examined to identify other confirmed cases of Poland-Möbius syndrome for which genetic data were available. Fourteen additional cases of Poland-Möbius syndrome with genetic studies are described in the literature. None implicated the PLXND1 gene which has previously been implicated in isolated Möbius syndrome.ConclusionsThis report provides further evidence in support of a role for PLXND1 mutations in Möbius syndrome and reasserts the nosological link between Möbius and Poland’s syndromes.Level of evidenceLevel V, Descriptive Study.","The authors would like to thank Ms Anushka Hardas, librarian at Sidra Medicine for help with the literature search and acquisition of the source papers, Mr Carl Sulit, photographer at Sidra Medicine for the clinical images and Ms Julie Melville and Ms Rebecca Watson-Brown for therapeutic evaluation of the patient from the point of view of facial palsy (JM) and Poland’s syndrome (RW-B).

The aerial parts of the plant are used in traditional medicine to treat skin diseases such as irritations, infections, and wounds. In this study, the essential oil of this plant was characterized, and its antimicrobial activity was evaluated. This species has large glands in its leaves; therefore, for quality control purposes, an anatomical study of the leaves was performed. The essential oil was isolated from the aerial parts of the plant through hydro-distillation and analyzed using a gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) system. Its anti-yeast activity was evaluated against three Candida species and ten bacterial strains using the disk diffusion technique. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), minimum fungicidal concentration (MFC), and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) were determined using broth microdilution. Anatomical study was performed on the middle part of the leaf. A yield of 0.5% of the essential oil was obtained from the herb, and Eighteen compounds in the essential oil were identified, within them trans pinocamphone (29.5%), limonene (24.7%), pinocarvone (21.8%), and cis pinocamphone (8.0%) were the main components. The inhibition zones were between 10 mm and 20 mm, and the MIC and MFC against the three Candida species ranged from 60 to 500 μg/ml. The leaf anatomy showed anisocytic stomata, simple and glandular trichomes of different types, and large and elliptical-shaped lysigenous glands, which can be used for taxonomic identification. The A. porophyllum var. cancellatum essential oil can serve as an alternative source of natural antimicrobial agents as an affordable approach to control infectious diseases.

The antifungal susceptibility profile was then identified and established. Descriptive statistics, Chi square test, and bivariate analysis were conducted using the Statgraphics Centurion XVII software with odds ratio (OR) for the probability of occurrence. A total of 107 Candida strains were identified belonging to 15 species, C. albicans with 23%, C. glabrata with 18%, C. tropicalis 13%, C. krusei 10%, C intermedia, and C. lipolytica with 1.5%. Species other than C. albicans were identified in 77% of the cases. A relationship between reproductive system cancer and C. guilliermondii was identified (p = 0.0001, <0.05) OR: 17.0. Between C. colliculosa and respiratory cancer (p = 0.0003, <0.05) OR 19.5. With regard to antifungal susceptibility, 99% of the identified Candida species were susceptible to the following antifungals: fluconazole, voriconazole, caspofungin, and micafungin. Only one strain of C. krusei was resistant. It is concluded that there was a diversity of Candida species, either single or mixed in cancer patients, which could determine that only one species is not responsible for fungal infection in the oral cavity.","Agradecimientos A la Dra.

The aim of this study was to examine the walkability of school environments using the Delphi method. This study used the Delphi method to measure the walkability. A total of 18 experts were selected. First, a list of variables was designed by the control group and sent three times to the experts. Later, the items were analyzed qualitatively and quantitatively to test the consensus of the experts. The list of variables that influence walkability showed a good consensus among the experts at the end of the process. This list was formed by 48 items and organized in six factors: traffic and safety (eleven items), signage (eight items), sidewalk (ten items), transport consistency (five items), activity (five items), and finally, urban planning (nine items). The experts agreed on the need to analyze the environments of educational centers and measure the variables that affect walkability. This study has identified the most important barriers. In the future, a measurement instrument should be developed that allows centers to be compared with others in terms of their levels of walkability. Moreover, it might be a resource for more policies to be developed with the aim to promote active commuting to school.",Thanks to all the experts who collaborated in the preparation of this study.,This research received no external funding.,International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health,,"Stefania Toselli, Pasqualino Maietta Latessa, Sofia Marini",Environment Design; Residence Characteristics; Delphi Technique; Transportation; Walking; Schools,2022-10-30,2022,2022-10-30,,19,21,14201,All OA; Gold,Article,"Cerro-Herrero, David; Prieto-Prieto, Josué; Vaquero-Solis, Mikel; Tapia-Serrano, Miguel Ángel; Sánchez-Miguel, Pedro Antonio","Cerro-Herrero, David (Department of Didactic of Musical, Plastic and Body Expression, Faculty of Teacher Training, University of Extremadura, 10071 Cáceres, Spain); Prieto-Prieto, Josué (Department of Didactic of Musical, Plastic and Body Expression, School of Education and Tourism, University of Salamanca, 05003 Ávila, Spain); Vaquero-Solis, Mikel (Department of Didactic of Musical, Plastic and Body Expression, Faculty of Sport Sciences, University of Extremadura, 10071 Cáceres, Spain); Tapia-Serrano, Miguel Ángel (Department of Didactic of Musical, Plastic and Body Expression, Faculty of Sport Sciences, University of Extremadura, 10071 Cáceres, Spain); Sánchez-Miguel, Pedro Antonio (Department of Didactic of Musical, Plastic and Body Expression, Faculty of Teacher Training, University of Extremadura, 10071 Cáceres, Spain)","Cerro-Herrero, David (University of Extremadura)","Cerro-Herrero, David (University of Extremadura); Prieto-Prieto, Josué (University of Salamanca); Vaquero-Solis, Mikel (University of Extremadura); Tapia-Serrano, Miguel Ángel (University of Extremadura); Sánchez-Miguel, Pedro Antonio (University of Extremadura)",2,2,,1.16,https://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/19/21/14201/pdf?version=1667897157,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1152350723,33 Built Environment and Design; 42 Health Sciences; 4206 Public Health; 44 Human Society; 4406 Human Geography,

This has had a major effect on climate change and global environmental catastrophe. In many countries, the strategy of closing various activities such as tourism and industrial production stopped normal life, transportation, etc. This closure has a positive impact on the environment. However, the massive use of masks and personal protection could significantly increase pollution worldwide. The impact on the environment needs to be calculated to have information for public health actions.

The present study used a descriptive correlational type of quantitative approach on a sample of 389 older adults aged 60 years and over, who were recruited by non-probabilistic convenience sampling. For the application of the survey technique, the instrument used was a questionnaire modified by the authors. In terms of research ethics for the development of the study, the respondents provided informed consent, and other ethical considerations were addressed. In relation to sociodemographic variables of mental health, it was found that women had a greater incidence of anxiety (p < 0.01) and that people with fewer years of study had a greater incidence of depression (p < 0.01) and anxiety in sparsely populated areas. Exposure to news through television was associated with depression, and news obtained from other people was associated with depression (p < 0.001). An association was also found between the number of hours of television news and stress (p < 0.05), and radio news was associated with anxiety (p < 0.05). In terms of psychological consequences, the highest mean for television exposure was fear, while the greatest psychological consequence of radio news was fear, followed by stress and awareness. Finally, negative, inverse, and significant relationships were found that indicate protective factors, such as depression with awareness and indignation, and anxiety was inversely related to awareness.",,This research received no external funding.,International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health,,Malgorzata Sobieszczanska,Aged; Anxiety; COVID-19; Depression; Fear; Female; Humans; Mental Health; Middle Aged; Peru,2022-09-12,2022,2022-09-12,,19,18,11470,All OA; Gold,Article,"Cachicatari-Vargas, Elena; Cuellar, Karimen Jetzabel Mutter; Chipana, Wender Florencio Condori; de Maria Miranda Socasaire, Flor; Acevedo-Duque, Ángel; Arpasi-Quispe, Orfelina","Cachicatari-Vargas, Elena (Faculty of Health Sciences, Universidad Nacional Jorge Basadre Grohmann, Tacna 23001, Peru); Cuellar, Karimen Jetzabel Mutter (Faculty of Health Sciences, Universidad Nacional Jorge Basadre Grohmann, Tacna 23001, Peru; Programa de Doctorado en Ciencias Sociales, Universidad Autónoma de Chile, Santiago 7500912, Chile); Chipana, Wender Florencio Condori (Faculty of Health Sciences, Universidad Nacional Jorge Basadre Grohmann, Tacna 23001, Peru; Graduate School, Norbert Wiener University, Lima 15046, Peru); de Maria Miranda Socasaire, Flor (Faculty of Health Sciences, Universidad Nacional Jorge Basadre Grohmann, Tacna 23001, Peru); Acevedo-Duque, Ángel (Programa de Doctorado en Ciencias Sociales, Universidad Autónoma de Chile, Santiago 7500912, Chile); Arpasi-Quispe, Orfelina (Graduate School, Norbert Wiener University, Lima 15046, Peru; Faculty of Health Sciences, Universidad Peruana Unión, Lima 15046, Peru)","Acevedo-Duque, Ángel (Universidad Autónoma de Chile)","Cachicatari-Vargas, Elena (Jorge Basadre Grohmann National University); Cuellar, Karimen Jetzabel Mutter (Jorge Basadre Grohmann National University; Universidad Autónoma de Chile); Chipana, Wender Florencio Condori (Jorge Basadre Grohmann National University; Graduate School, Norbert Wiener University, Lima 15046, Peru); de Maria Miranda Socasaire, Flor (Jorge Basadre Grohmann National University); Acevedo-Duque, Ángel (Universidad Autónoma de Chile); Arpasi-Quispe, Orfelina (Graduate School, Norbert Wiener University, Lima 15046, Peru; Peruvian Union University)",2,1,,2.53,https://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/19/18/11470/pdf?version=1662987761,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1150980381,"42 Health Sciences; 47 Language, Communication and Culture; 4701 Communication and Media Studies",3 Good Health and Well Being

Vulnerable school populations are distinguished by having predisposing factors to overweight and obesity, which results in a greater risk of suffering from the disease and its ravages. Additionally, the effects of the COVID-19 contingency can worsen the situation. Previous reviews of prevention, treatment and control of the disease have focused on schoolchildren from high- and middle-income countries. The objective of this review was to gather the evidence from the studies that evaluate the effectiveness of multicomponent lifestyle intervention programs (MLIP) on adiposity indicators in vulnerable populations. Five electronic databases were searched: PubMed, MEDLINE, Cochrane Library, EMBASE, and Google Scholar. The eligibility criteria were schoolchildren (5 to 12 years old), inhabitants of rural area, with low socioeconomic level and/or belonging to an indigenous community. Randomized and quasi-experimental controlled trials were included. Interventions that included two or more of the following components were considered: physical activity, nutrition, psychology, school meals and/or family/community involvement. Of the 11 interventions included 73 % had significant improvements in at least one variable related to adiposity. The most successful interventions had components of nutrition, physical activity and family/community involvement, the majority (80 %) had a duration of ≥ 6 months and were provided, in 80 % of the cases, by previously trained teachers. In conclusion, there is evidence that MLIPs are effective in improving indicators of adiposity in vulnerable schoolchildren.",,,Nutrición Hospitalaria,,,"Adiposity; COVID-19; Child; Child, Preschool; Humans; Life Style; Obesity; Overweight",2022,2022,,2022,39,5,1122-1134,All OA; Gold,Article,"Dórame López, Norma Alicia; Esparza Romero, Julián","Dórame López, Norma Alicia (Diabetes Research Unit.

We specifically focus on melanoma and heart murmurs. We use a comparative study of two convolution networks in the Complex and Real numerical domains. The idea is to obtain a powerful approach for building portable systems for early disease detection. Two similar algorithmic structures were chosen so that there is no bias determined by the number of parameters to train. Three clinical data sets, ISIC2017, PH2, and Pascal, were used to carry out the experiments. Mean comparison hypothesis tests were performed to ensure statistical objectivity in the conclusions. In all cases, complex-valued networks presented a superior performance for the Precision, Recall, F1 Score, Accuracy, and Specificity metrics in the detection of associated anomalies. The best complex number-based classifier obtained in the Receiving Operating Characteristic (ROC) space presents a Euclidean distance of 0.26127 with respect to the ideal classifier, as opposed to the best real number-based classifier, whose Euclidean distance to the ideal is 0.36022 for the same task of melanoma detection. The 27.46% superiority in this metric, as in the others reported in this work, suggests that complex-valued networks have a greater ability to extract features for more efficient discrimination in the dataset.",CEIBA and Government of Nariño Colombia.

Uma estratégia para o tratamento de quadros graves da COVID-19 foi o uso de plasma convalescente, obtido de doadores convalescentes da doença, com alta produção de anticorpos, de forma a permitir a neutralização do vírus e melhora no quadro clínico. Embora muitos estudos destaquem o uso do plasma convalescente, poucos descrevem propostas para coletar plasma com concentração de anticorpos anti-Spike aceitáveis para o uso em indivíduos acometidos com a forma grave da COVID-19. Dessa forma, o objetivo deste estudo foi avaliar os fatores sociodemográficos ligados à produção de anticorpos IgG anti-Spike em candidatos à doação de plasma convalescente na cidade de Manaus-AM. Material e métodos Foram incluídos no estudo 123 candidatos à doação de plasma convalescente, do gênero masculino, que tiveram o diagnóstico da COVID-19 30 dias antes da doação, sem histórico de vacinação prévia. Foi realizada uma coleta de 4 mL do sangue periférico para obtenção do soro, utilizado para quantificação de anticorpos IgG anti-Spike por quimioluminescência, expressos em AU/mL, através do kit Architect SARS-CoV-2 IgG II Quant (Abbott). Os doadores foram segregados com base na concentração de anticorpos em baixa produção (< 50 AU/mL), produção intermediária (50-1,280 AU/mL) e alta produção (> 1,280 AU/mL), segundo informações do kit, e recomendação internacional. Os dados sociodemográficos de idade, gênero, cor de pele, índice de massa corporal (IMC), uso de ventilação mecânica e dias internados foram utilizados para fins de comparação entre os grupos. Foi realizado o teste de ANOVA, Qui-Quadrado e teste exato de Fisher para comparação dos dados sociodemográficos, além dos testes de correlação de Spearman. Resultados Nossos dados demonstraram uma maior prevalência de doadores com alto índice de IMC na população de alto produtores de anticorpos (p = 0.0254). Além disso, também observamos que a concentração dos anticorpos IgG anti-Spike apresentou grau de correlação positiva com a idade (r = 0.240; p = 0.008) e IMC (r = 0.247; p < 0.006). Discussão Nossos resultados demonstram uma relação entre a idade e o IMC na produção de anticorpos anti-Spike em doadores convalescentes com alta concentração de anticorpos. Essa relação pode estar atrelada à efeitos de imunomodulação, bem como ao grau de lesão tecidual e sistêmico apresentado pelos pacientes mais velhos e/ou com maior IMC. A relação desses fatores com a produção de anticorpos ainda é uma área pouco explorada, o que salienta a necessidade de compreender os mecanismos imunológicos associados à produção de anticorpos, junto com a proteção dos pacientes convalescentes. Conclusão Nosso estudo demonstrou que o IMC dos acometidos pela COVID-19 pode contribuir para a alta produção de anticorpos de classe IgG anti-Spike. No entanto, estudos adicionais são necessários para compreender os aspectos imunológicos associados à maior proteção da população, bem como produção de anticorpos com maior eficácia pelos indivíduos acometidos pela COVID-19. *AM e AGC contribuíram igualmente para este trabalho.",,,Hematology Transfusion and Cell Therapy,,,,2022-10-15,2022,2022-10-15,2022-10,44,,s393,All OA; Gold,Article,"Silva-Junior, AL; Oliveira, LS; Costa, TCC; Xabregas, LA; Dias, S; Crispim, MAE; Sabino, EC; Fraiji, NA; Malheiro, A; Costa, AG","Silva-Junior, AL (Universidade Federal do Amazonas (UFAM), Manaus, AM, Brasil; Fundação Hospitalar de Hematologia e Hemoterapia do Amazonas (HEMOAM), Manaus, AM, Brasil); Oliveira, LS (Fundação Hospitalar de Hematologia e Hemoterapia do Amazonas (HEMOAM), Manaus, AM, Brasil); Costa, TCC (Fundação Hospitalar de Hematologia e Hemoterapia do Amazonas (HEMOAM), Manaus, AM, Brasil); Xabregas, LA (Fundação Hospitalar de Hematologia e Hemoterapia do Amazonas (HEMOAM), Manaus, AM, Brasil); Dias, S (Fundação Hospitalar de Hematologia e Hemoterapia do Amazonas (HEMOAM), Manaus, AM, Brasil); Crispim, MAE (Fundação Hospitalar de Hematologia e Hemoterapia do Amazonas (HEMOAM), Manaus, AM, Brasil; Universidade do Estado do Amazonas (UEA), Manaus, AM, Brasil); Sabino, EC (Universidade Federal de São Paulo (UNIFESP), São Paulo, Brasil); Fraiji, NA (Universidade Federal do Amazonas (UFAM), Manaus, AM, Brasil; Fundação Hospitalar de Hematologia e Hemoterapia do Amazonas (HEMOAM), Manaus, AM, Brasil); Malheiro, A (Universidade Federal do Amazonas (UFAM), Manaus, AM, Brasil; Fundação Hospitalar de Hematologia e Hemoterapia do Amazonas (HEMOAM), Manaus, AM, Brasil; Universidade do Estado do Amazonas (UEA), Manaus, AM, Brasil); Costa, AG (Universidade Federal do Amazonas (UFAM), Manaus, AM, Brasil; Fundação Hospitalar de Hematologia e Hemoterapia do Amazonas (HEMOAM), Manaus, AM, Brasil; Universidade do Estado do Amazonas (UEA), Manaus, AM, Brasil)",,"Silva-Junior, AL (Federal University of Amazonas; Fundação Hospitalar de Hematologia e Hemoterapia do Amazonas); Oliveira, LS (Fundação Hospitalar de Hematologia e Hemoterapia do Amazonas); Costa, TCC (Fundação Hospitalar de Hematologia e Hemoterapia do Amazonas); Xabregas, LA (Fundação Hospitalar de Hematologia e Hemoterapia do Amazonas); Dias, S (Fundação Hospitalar de Hematologia e Hemoterapia do Amazonas); Crispim, MAE (Fundação Hospitalar de Hematologia e Hemoterapia do Amazonas; University of the State of Amazonas); Sabino, EC (Federal University of São Paulo); Fraiji, NA (Federal University of Amazonas; Fundação Hospitalar de Hematologia e Hemoterapia do Amazonas); Malheiro, A (Federal University of Amazonas; Fundação Hospitalar de Hematologia e Hemoterapia do Amazonas; University of the State of Amazonas); Costa, AG (Federal University of Amazonas; Fundação Hospitalar de Hematologia e Hemoterapia do Amazonas; University of the State of Amazonas)",0,0,,0.0,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.htct.2022.09.665,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1151924064,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3201 Cardiovascular Medicine and Haematology,

There is a need in academia to address workers' health issues at the time of graduation. Nearpod is an educational application founded on a web-based learning tool. In the field of Health Sciences, the use of Nearpod has been scarce. The objective of this study was to determine the level of satisfaction with using this interactive tool and to assess the influence of using Nearpod in class on students' performance while dealing with the topic of musculoskeletal disorders in third-year Degree in Physiotherapy students during the 2021-2022 academic year. The participants were students at the University of Cadiz. They were randomly divided into two groups, a control group using a PowerPoint presentation and an experimental group using the interactive Nearpod application. The experimental group took two surveys to determine their satisfaction with the method used. Students also took a multiple-choice test to assess the knowledge acquired. In the surveys, a high percentage of satisfaction was obtained (97.62% and 99.39%). There were no significant differences in the scores obtained by the two groups, although there were significant differences in response time in favor of the experimental group (p = 0.022).

The design and implementation of appropriate protection systems for MG and ADN must be addressed, which imposes new technical challenges. This paper presents the implementation and validation aspects of an adaptive fault detection strategy based on neural networks (NNs) and multiple sampling points for ADN and MG. The solution is implemented on an edge device. NNs are used to derive a data-driven model that uses only local measurements to detect fault states of the network without the need for communication infrastructure. Multiple sampling points are used to derive a data-driven model, which allows the generalization considering the implementation in physical systems. The adaptive fault detector model is implemented on a Jetson Nano system, which is a single-board computer (SBC) with a small graphic processing unit (GPU) intended to run machine learning loads at the edge. The proposed method is tested in a physical, real-life, low-voltage network located at Universidad del Norte, Colombia. This testing network is based on the IEEE 13-node test feeder scaled down to 220 V. The validation in a simulation environment shows the accuracy and dependability above 99.6%, while the real-time tests show the accuracy and dependability of 95.5% and 100%, respectively. Without hard-to-derive parameters, the easy-to-implement embedded model highlights the potential for real-life applications.",,,Journal of Modern Power Systems and Clean Energy,,,,2022,2022,,2022,10,6,1648-1657,All OA; Gold,Article,"Marin-Quintero, J.; Orozco-Henao, C.; Bretas, A.

The purpose of this study is to develop a methodology for predicting the trend of stock value based on the relationship between the fluctuation of Tobin's Q by sector as a trend index and the stock price variation of the Columbia stock market. To this end, a quantitative quasi-experimental survey will be conducted on shares traded by December 30, 2019. This is at least 90% of the time we have traded in the last 5 years. From the average Q value of the relevant economic sector, the value of each company's stock is adjusted to calculate the estimated price of the company's stock. If there is a disparity between the estimated value of the stock and the value at time t, you can forecast the stock price transition. If the computation yields a more significant result than what is now witnessed in the market, the next period's development will be positive; if it yields a lower result, its development will be negative. The results allow us to establish a significant influence of industry results on the performance of corporate Tobin's Q at the individual level. The significance level is greater than 50% in all cases, and profitability does not go below 30% in any sector, even reaching 100%.

The health-related quality of life in these patients is not systematically evaluated.
Objectives: The present study sought to describe the health-related quality of life and complications in children who underwent hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.
Materials and methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted on pediatric transplanted survivors. Health-related quality of life was measured using the KIDSCREEN-27 scale and Short Form-12 (SF-12) in patients between 8 and 14 years of age and those over 14 years, respectively. Statistical analysis was performed using STATA 12 software. We used the Rasch model person parameter estimates translated into T-values to score the questionnaire.
Results: A total of 42 children answered the questionnaires. The most frequent adverse events were chronic graft Vs. host disease and endocrine complications. According to European norm data in the KIDSCREEN-12 scale, scores for the school dimension and social and peer support were below the 50th. percentile.

AIM: To determine the association between educational attainment and suspicion of cognitive imparirment in older Chilean population.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Data from 2,005 adults aged ≥ 60 years assessed during 2016-2017 Chilean National Health Survey were included. Education was self-reported and categorized as primary: ≤ 8 years; secondary: 9 to 12 years and beyond secondary: > 12 years. suspicion of cognitive imparirment was assessed with the Mini-Mental questionnaire.
RESULTS: Men and women with low education attainment had a higher prevalence of cognitive impairment (33% [95% confidence intervals (CI): 24; 41] and 27% [95% CI: 21; 33], respectively). Men who reported less schooling (≤ 8 years) were more likely to be at risk of suspicion of cognitive imparirment (Odds ratio (OR): 4.53 [95% CI: 1.10, 18.62]) compared to their peers. Women showed a substantially higher magnitude of association than men. The probability of suspicion of cognitive imparirment increased 9-times (OR: 9.96 [95% CI: 1.24; 79.6]) for 9-12 years and 18-times for ≤ 8 years of education (OR: 18.8 [95% CI: 2.42; 146.1]) compared to women with higher education.

Materials and methods: Cross-sectional, descriptive observational study of records of pregnant women between 35 and 41 years of age affiliated to the Cauca Indigenous Association Health Benefit Plan Management Organization-I (EAPB AIC-I) and registered in the prenatal care program, between 2016 and 2018. Duplicate records and records with incomplete information were excluded. Sociodemographic and clinical variables, as well as program outcomes, were analyzed using descriptive statistics. Odds ratios and their confidence intervals were calculated.
Results: In 1016 patients between 35 and 41 years of age, a frequency of 61.3 % of non-adherence to at least six prenatal visits was found. History of abortion (adjusted OR: 0.46; 95 % CI 0.33-0.64) and pregnancy of five or more (adjusted OR: 3,22; IC 95 % 1,50-6,91) were the associated factors.
Conclusions: Non-adherence to prenatal care by pregnant women of 35 years or more affiliated to the Cauca EAPB AIC-I is high. Further qualitative studies are needed to examine the cultural and social factors present in these communities that may affect adherence to prenatal monitoring, together with prospective studies to confirm the exploratory analysis of factors associated with non adherence. Insurance organizations in the subsidized regime should be called upon to conduct promotion activities in these communities in order to improve adherence.",Los autores manifiestan su profundo agradecimiento con el mentor y maestro Dr. Rodrigo Alberto Álzate por todas las orientaciones en el tema de la salud materno perinatal.,FINANCIACIÓN: Los autores no tuvieron ninguna fuente de financiación.,Revista Colombiana de Obstetricia y Ginecología,,,Humans; Female; Pregnancy; Pregnant Women; Colombia,2022-09-30,2022,2022-09-30,,73,3,255-264,All OA; Gold,Article,"del Carmen Londoño-Cadena, Pamela; Ibáñez-Correa, Lina María; Valencia-Rivas, Windy Yirleza; Anacona-Cruz, María Yubely; Abou-Trabi, Rayan El Barkachi; BSC, Robinson Pacheco-López","del Carmen Londoño-Cadena, Pamela (Universidad Libre, seccional Cali (Colombia)., Universidad Libre, Universidad Libre, Cali, Colombia); Ibáñez-Correa, Lina María (Universidad Libre, seccional Cali (Colombia)., Universidad Libre, Universidad Libre, Cali, Colombia; Clínica Versalles S.A., Cali (Colombia)., Clínica Versalles S.A, Cali, Colombia); Valencia-Rivas, Windy Yirleza (Universidad Libre, seccional Cali (Colombia)., Universidad Libre, Universidad Libre, Cali, Colombia); Anacona-Cruz, María Yubely (Universidad Libre, seccional Cali (Colombia)., Universidad Libre, Universidad Libre, Cali, Colombia; Entidad Administradora de Planes de Beneficios, Asociación Indígena del Cauca, Popayán (Colombia)., Asociación Indígena del Cauca, Popayán, Colombia); Abou-Trabi, Rayan El Barkachi (Universidad Libre, seccional Cali (Colombia)., Universidad Libre, Universidad Libre, Cali, Colombia); BSC, Robinson Pacheco-López (Universidad Libre, seccional Cali (Colombia)., Universidad Libre, Universidad Libre, Cali, Colombia)","del Carmen Londoño-Cadena, Pamela (Free University of Colombia)","del Carmen Londoño-Cadena, Pamela (Free University of Colombia); Ibáñez-Correa, Lina María (Free University of Colombia; Clínica Versalles S.A., Cali (Colombia)., Clínica Versalles S.A, Cali, Colombia); Valencia-Rivas, Windy Yirleza (Free University of Colombia); Anacona-Cruz, María Yubely (Free University of Colombia; Entidad Administradora de Planes de Beneficios, Asociación Indígena del Cauca, Popayán (Colombia)., Asociación Indígena del Cauca, Popayán, Colombia); Abou-Trabi, Rayan El Barkachi (Free University of Colombia); BSC, Robinson Pacheco-López (Free University of Colombia)",0,0,,0.0,https://revista.fecolsog.org/index.php/rcog/article/download/3833/3828,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1151579792,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3215 Reproductive Medicine; 42 Health Sciences,3 Good Health and Well Being

Methods: Ethnographic data was obtained through the application of in-depth interviews centered on topics such as migration history, personal experience with COVID-19 and beliefs about the pandemic. This information was further analyzed through a narrative approach and Atlas Ti.
Main findings: US Title 42 and the Migrant Protection Protocols (MPP) have stranded thousands of individuals in the US-Mexico border region, a situation that has overcrowded the available shelters in the area and forced many of the immigrants to live on the streets and in improvised encampments. Thus, exposing them to a higher risk of contagion. Furthermore, the majority of the interviewed Central American and Caribbean immigrants consider that Mexico is more lenient when it comes to the enforcement of sanitary measures, especially when compared to their countries of origin. Finally, vaccination hesitancy was low among the interviewees, mainly due to the operative aspects of the vaccination effort in Mexico and the fear of ruining their chances to attain asylum in the US. These findings are backed up by the discovery of five recurring narratives among the interviewees regarding: (1) The pandemic's psychological impact. (2) The uncertainty of being stranded in Mexico and the long wait. (3) Their fear of violence over the fear of contagion. (4) The perceived leniency of Mexico with the pandemic when compared to their countries of origin, and (5) their beliefs about the pandemic and vaccines.
Key finding: The mental health of stranded Central American and Caribbean immigrants in Mexico during the COVID-19 pandemic is mostly affected by their inability to make it across the US-Mexico border using legal means.",We would like to acknowledge the role and guidance provided by our group of colleagues that participated in the aforementioned research project.,"Funding was provided by the Canadian Institutes for Health Research (CIHR), as part of a grant issued to the COVID-19's differential impact on the mental and emotional health of Indigenous Peoples and Newcomers: A socioeconomic analysis of Canada, US and Mexico project.",Frontiers in Public Health,,,Humans; Mental Health; COVID-19; Mexico; Cities; Pandemics; Emigrants and Immigrants,2022-11-09,2022,2022-11-09,,10,,982389,All OA; Gold,Article,"Piñeiro, Rodolfo Cruz; Ibarra, Carlos S.","Piñeiro, Rodolfo Cruz (Population Studies Department, El Colegio de la Frontera Norte, Tijuana, Mexico); Ibarra, Carlos S.

This study examines the influence of the organisational context on the implementation of a psycho-educational programme and an academic levelling module at Colombian schools. Specifically, we evaluate the work design characteristics of teachers and their impact on the fidelity, effectiveness, and sustainability of the intervention. Information was collected from 102 teachers who acted as facilitators in the implementation of these interventions at a total of 72 schools in the city of Barranquilla. With a work design questionnaire, the characteristics of the task and working conditions of the teaching staff were analysed. To evaluate the implementation of the programme, indicators of fidelity, dose, frequency, and perceived effectiveness of the intervention were obtained. The results show that the autonomy and intrinsic characteristics of the task are positively related to the fidelity of the implementation. A certain influence of the working conditions of the teaching staff was also observed in the dose of the educational activities performed. Complementary to this, we describe the impact of confinement during the coronavirus pandemic on the implementation of programmes. Work design influences the process of implementing programmes in educational contexts. Both active hierarchical supervision and the motivational characteristics of teachers’ work affect the sustainability of interventions, especially in crisis circumstances. To conclude, we reflect on the organisational characteristics that facilitate the sustainability of the interventions.","This study was supported by the grant provided by the Andalusian Research Plan (PAIDI in Spanish) to the Research Group “Laboratory of Personal Networks and Communities” (2019/HUM-059).

Su importancia surge cuando se analizan las conductas de los seres humanos en el mbito de la interaccin social y se trata de comprender y dar significados a sus actos, guindonos para la interpretacin y comprensin de sus actuaciones en el marco de lo social. As conductas de tipo conflictivas, cooperativas y competitivas nos muestran diversos modos de comportamientos, pero tambin diversas formas a travs de los cuales las personas solucionan sus conflictos, los cuales finalmente derivan en la mayora de los casos, del sistema jurdico propio de cada pas, que se caracterizan por la intervencin o no, de terceros que actan como facilitadores o decisores del conflicto. El presente artculo, resultado de una investigacin doctoral, tiene como objetivo analizar cmo el Derecho define el conflicto y al mismo tiempo cmo lo regula, con el propsito de analizar la importancia de los desarrollos legales que vienen dando sobre formas diferentes al proceso judicial pero que tienen los mismos efectos jurdicos en relacin a la solucin del conflicto, y que en pases como Colombia, resultan ser formas de administracin de justicia, diferentes al proceso judicial, operadas por particulares que tienen facultad para administrar justicia de manera ocasional y transitoria. De ese modo, el Estado tiene el deber de garantizar, siempre que exista un conflicto, el que las partes pueden acceder a la justicia ordinaria pero tambin a los mecanismos alternativos, para solucionarlos.

Abstract Alternative dispute resolution mechanisms demand an analysis of the relationship between conflict and the Law. Its importance arises when the behaviors of human beings in the field of social interaction are analyzed and the meaning of their actions discovered, guiding us to interpret and understand their actions within the social framework. Thus, behaviors of a conflictive, cooperative and competitive type show us not only different modes of behavior but also different ways through which people solve their conflicts, in accord and framed by the legal system of each country. Different conflict styles are characterized by the intervention or not of third parties who act as facilitators or decision makers of the conflict solving. This paper aims to analyze how the Law defines the conflict while at the same time regulates it, using data from my doctoral research. It analyzes legal developments differing from the judicial process but having the same legal effects in relation to the resolution of the conflict, and in countries like Colombia, they turn out to be forms of administration of justice, separated and different from the judicial process, operated by individuals who have the power to administer justice occasionally and temporarily. In this way, the State has the duty to guarantee, whenever there is a conflict, that the parties can access both ordinary justice but also alternative mechanisms to solve them. Hence, the Law performs one of its most important functions, promoting the resolution of conflicts.",,,Ius et Praxis,,,,2022-04,2022,2022-04,,28,1,236-253,All OA; Gold,Article,"de Jess Illera Santos, Mara","de Jess Illera Santos, Mara ()",,"de Jess Illera Santos, Mara ()",4,3,,4.71,http://www.scielo.cl/pdf/iusetp/v28n1/0718-0012-iusetp-28-01-236.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1147981882,44 Human Society; 4404 Development Studies; 48 Law and Legal Studies,"16 Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions"

We show that in this case, the nonlinear optics processes (absorption and scattering) along the optical path can be described using an analogy with the kinetic processes that occur in a chemical reaction. A key result is that it is possible to define an apparent equilibrium constant that regulates the competition of the photonic processes that take place, an idea conceptually similar to Einstein’s model for spontaneous emission and how it can be connected to induced emission in atoms and molecules but including an extension to nonlinear optical and relaxation processes. Our model can be generalized to describe a variety of phenomena in nano-photonics and plasmonic systems.","The authors (J.L.P., M.L.) are grateful to the UNMSM collaboration, Grant No. C21071281.

The characteristics of the pump-power dependence of the nonlinear signal are reproduced by a theoretical model based on the coupling between pump-probe, considering signal fields and propagation effects. The effect of the intramolecular coupling on the nonlinear intensity of the FWM signal is studied using a model molecule consisting of two-coupled harmonic curves of electronic energies with minima displaced in energy and nuclear positions. Two-vibrational states are considered while including non-adiabatic effects for the two-state model. Moreover, the coupling among the field components, as well as the propagation effects, are studied by considering a constant pump-intensity. Our calculation scheme, considering both the intramolecular coupling effects in the description of the molecular structure and the effects produced by the propagation of the FWM signal along the optical length, allows the exponential dependence of the latter, as the intensity of the pumping beam increases. Our treatments do not require the inclusion of other non-resonant processes outside the RWA approximation, due to the consideration of an adiabatic basis.","The authors (JLP, ML) are grateful to the UNMSM collaboration, grants C21071281.

The specific mortality rates adjusted by age and sex were calculated. A normality analysis was conducted using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. In addition, a chi-square test of independence for associations and multivariate logistic regression was applied to determine the probability of death.
Results: Between 2008 and 2012 there were 10,718 deaths due to rare diseases, 53.2% of them occurred among women. The average annual mortality rate was 3.9 per 100,000 inhabitants: 4.1 in women and 3.8 in men. The main causes of mortality among women were Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, anencephaly and autoinmune hepatitis, and among men, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, muscular dystrophy and anencephaly. Women are 1.75 times more likely to die than men (adjusted Odds Ratio (aOR) = 1.75; 95% CI: 1.69 - 1.82). The highest probability of dying occurred among children aged 0-4 years (aOR = 15.30; 95% CI: 14.10 - 19.20).
Conclusion: Overall, the burden of mortality due to rare disease was higher among women of all ages in Chile between 2002 and 2017.","Al Departamento de Estadística e Información en Salud del Ministerio de Salud de Chile, por proveer las bases de datos con cifras oficiales consolidadas sobre mortalidad para el periodo 2002 a 2017.",No se recibió financiación para la elaboración de este artículo.,Biomédica,,,Anencephaly; Child; Chile; Creutzfeldt-Jakob Syndrome; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Humans; Male; Rare Diseases,2022-09-02,2022,2022-09-02,,42,3,508-521,All OA; Gold,Article,"Avila, Jahir Andrés; Martínez, Julio César","Avila, Jahir Andrés (Hospital Base de Valdivia, Unidad de Diálisis, Valdivia los Ríos, Chile, Hospital Base de Valdivia, Unidad de Diálisis, Valdivia los Ríos, Chile); Martínez, Julio César (Departamento de Salud Pública, Universidad Industrial de Santander, Bucaramanga, Colombia, Universidad Industrial de Santander, Departamento de Salud Pública, Universidad Industrial de Santander, Bucaramanga, Colombia)","Avila, Jahir Andrés (Hospital Base)","Avila, Jahir Andrés (Hospital Base); Martínez, Julio César (Industrial University of Santander)",1,1,,0.59,https://revistabiomedica.org/index.php/biomedica/article/download/6281/5095,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1151145801,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 42 Health Sciences; 4203 Health Services and Systems; 4206 Public Health,3 Good Health and Well Being

Exposure to green spaces improves the physical and mental health of individuals. Chile has privileged conditions for outdoor activities that could benefit millions of people. However, a small percentage of the Chilean population is exposed to green spaces in the recommended amounts to promote health.
AIM: To describe the benefits of green spaces on physical and mental health and their relationship with the practice of physical activity.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Review of the scientific literature in English in the Web of Science (WoS) electronic database published between 2006-2019.
RESULTS: In addition to the direct benefits of green spaces, there are synergistic effects of performing physical activities in these environments such as feelings of good health, satisfaction with life and pleasure, increased physiological relaxation, positive emotions, mental well-being, restoration of attention, decreased perceived stress and a reduction negative affections.
CONCLUSIONS: This review supports strategies for improving access to green spaces in urban areas coupled with physical activity promotion in these settings.

The ultimate objective of this research was to be able to implement actions to improve students' reading comprehension skills using the resources available. To achieve this objective, the results of the Saber 9 National tests for the years 2015, 2016 and 2017 were examined. An ICT maturity level survey was also conducted in 10 schools from the sample and key qualitative criteria were identified and quantified. At the same time, the Meta­plan® technique was applied with 67 teachers in a school from the sample, to collect opinions on the domains and main causes that affect reading comprehension, and be able to cross these with the theory. The results of this analysis show that two factors are necessary to improve performance in reading comprehension: a) the explicit teaching of reading comprehension strategies, and b) the integration of ICT for learning. It is recommended that these two factors be prioritized in teacher training plans and be materialized in schools, as well as in teachers undergraduate degree programs in universities.",,,Íkala Revista de Lenguaje y Cultura,,,,2022-05-18,2022,2022-05-18,,27,2,332-354,All OA; Gold,Article,"Benítez, Wilman Enrique Pérez; Barreto, Carmen Tulia Ricardo","Benítez, Wilman Enrique Pérez (Universidad del Norte); Barreto, Carmen Tulia Ricardo (Universidad Nacional de Estudios a Distancia -UNED)",,"Benítez, Wilman Enrique Pérez (Universidad del Norte); Barreto, Carmen Tulia Ricardo (Universidad Nacional de Estudios a Distancia -UNED)",1,1,,1.43,https://revistas.udea.edu.co/index.php/ikala/article/download/346886/20808036,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1148129296,39 Education; 3901 Curriculum and Pedagogy; 3903 Education Systems,4 Quality Education

An inductive method was applied, which started from the question: Is it possible to market water, a human right, a non-renewable natural resource and good for public use in stock markets or does its nature of human right impose limitations? The hypothesis developed is, focusing on the analysis of the Colombian case, that it is not appropriate and it is contradictory to transform the access and disposal of water to a tradable commodity.

In Colombia, online learning depends on academic and non-academic factors, and this dependence makes e-learning even more difficult. This paper aimed to study the students' viewpoint of Anatomy teaching at Universidad del Norte, Colombia, during the Covid-19 pandemic. One hundred sixteen students answered a questionnaire about their opinions on several topics related to online learning of Anatomy. The strongest correlation observed showed that the students agree that online anatomy classes make the subject more difficult to learn when compared to face-to-face lectures. Negative attitudes toward motivation, lack of personal contact with classmates, and complaints about being taught without laboratory sessions with cadavers were among the principal negative attitudes in students. After almost one year, motivation to participate in online classes went down; however, students improved their judgment about remote anatomy learning and their views about using authentic anatomy images during online sessions and substituting real anatomy images for apps. Anatomy sessions will have to adapt their learning tools to e-learning as time constraints allow, creating a new environment for students to participate, learn, and take advantage of this change.

This article analyses what has been the evolution of these fields of knowledge and practice in the Colombian context, from historical, disciplinary, professional and academic standpoints. For this, a documentary analysis has been carried out methodologically in the two areas of knowledge, with a historical and theoretical review of the disciplines in the country, as well as of the relevant national undergraduate and graduate programmes. This article concludes by establishing that social work has a longer historical trajectory in the country to provide social responses to complex problems and violence, with vocational professionalisation, scientific intervention and wide academic recognition in careers present in the country’s universities. In contrast, social pedagogy has had some attempts at being instituted into careers in the country and presents a great diversification of professions from popular or community education, and has struggled to become professionalised due to the prominence given to social work by public policy and education. Nonetheless, our analysis demonstrates that with the historical influence of critical pedagogies and recent global contributions, there is currently a significant upward trajectory of social pedagogy in Colombia, with two Master’s degrees existing since 2019 (which train educators and social workers in socio-educational action).",,,International Journal of Social Pedagogy,,,,2022-10-31,2022,2022-10-31,,11,1,10,All OA; Gold,Article,"del Pozo Serrano, Francisco José; Amashta, Giselle Paola Polo","del Pozo Serrano, Francisco José (Research Professor of Department of Theory of Education and Social Pedagogy, Faculty of Education, Universidad Nacional de Educación a Distancia (UNED), Madrid, Spain); Amashta, Giselle Paola Polo (Assistant Researcher, Universidad del Norte, Asociación Colombiana de Pedagogía Social y Educación Social (ASOCOPESES), Barranquilla, Colombia)","del Pozo Serrano, Francisco José (National University of Distance Education)","del Pozo Serrano, Francisco José (National University of Distance Education); Amashta, Giselle Paola Polo (Universidad del Norte)",0,0,,0.0,https://uclpress.scienceopen.com/document_file/36d3159a-bbdf-4a41-ae62-fdddb0a312ce/ScienceOpen/IJSP-11-10.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1152653184,"39 Education; 3902 Education Policy, Sociology and Philosophy; 44 Human Society; 4409 Social Work",4 Quality Education

1974,pub.1144809443,10.47872/laer.v31.24,,,Uncovering the wage differential between formal and informal jobs: Analysis from the Colombian Caribbean region,"The paper aims to assess the wage differential that would induce workers to switch between informal and formal sectors, analysing the informal labour market in the Colombian Caribbean region. Relying on the theory of equalising differences, we uncover which workers perceive the highest utility from holding a formal job. Our research sheds light on how workers derive utility from formal and informal job sectors' benefits and to which extent informal workers are willing to accept a lower (or higher) wage to get a job in the formal sector. We also analyse the factors increasing the likelihood to seek employment in the formal sector. Results suggest that, on average, informal workers in the study region are willing to switch to a formal job only if they are offered a salary higher than their current income but are also willing to accept a salary slightly lower than the legal minimum wage in the formal sector. Finally, perceptions of benefits from formal and informal jobs vary with the socio-economic characteristics of individuals, especially by education level and previous work experience.",,,Latin American Economic Review,,,,2022-01-18,2022,2022-01-18,2022-01-18,,,1-25,All OA; Gold,Article,"Cantillo, Tatiana; Cantillo, Víctor; Garcia, Lucy; Cantillo-Garcia, Víctor","Cantillo, Tatiana (Proyectos Técnicos Ltda); Cantillo, Víctor (Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Universidad del Norte); Garcia, Lucy (Department of Systems Engineering, Universidad del Norte); Cantillo-Garcia, Víctor (Proyectos Técnicos Ltda)",,"Cantillo, Tatiana (Proyectos Técnicos Ltda); Cantillo, Víctor (Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Universidad del Norte); Garcia, Lucy (Department of Systems Engineering, Universidad del Norte); Cantillo-Garcia, Víctor (Proyectos Técnicos Ltda)",2,2,,1.95,https://doi.org/10.47872/laer.v31.24,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1144809443,38 Economics; 3801 Applied Economics; 44 Human Society; 4404 Development Studies,8 Decent Work and Economic Growth

The objective of this study was to determine the reasons that led the community of Libertad to rise in arms and repel the abuses of armed groups by testing two hypotheses: (1) the frequency of victimizing acts consisting of sexual violence against the women of the Libertad village provoked the community to take up arms; (2) the presence of social agents, here called provocateurs of the community response, motivated the community’s social cohesion and armed uprising. The research is developed using a qualitative methodology with a narrative approach that involved a sample of 49 informants, including two focus groups. We provide empirical findings which are pivotal to understanding the reasons why defenseless civilians made the decision to defend themselves with arms against illegal armed groups that invaded their territory and harassed their communities, especially when dealing with an ethnic minority such as Afro-descendants.",,"This research was funded by the Ministerio de Ciencia Tecnología e Innovación de Colombia and the Universidad del Norte.

While the political dimension concerns the construction of socio-political relations, the interpersonal dimension focuses on intergroup relationships. Empirical evidence shows that reconciliation should not assign primacy to one dimension over another; rather, it should address the interaction between them. However, research on this topic is scarce. There is a need to develop an instrument to assess the political and interpersonal dimensions of reconciliation in peacebuilding contexts. This study developed the Political and Interpersonal Reconciliation Scale (PIRS) and assessed its psychometric properties based on a sample of Colombian population after the peace agreement between the Colombian government and the FARC guerrilla group. The results show the validity of a factorial structure for two components as well as an acceptable Cronbach’s alpha. Concerning external validity, in line with the existing literature, the scale under study was positively related to confidence in the peace agreement, trust in the ex-combatants, willingness to share with the adversary and community identification. This study provides evidence that the Political and Interpersonal Reconciliation Scale is a valid and reliable instrument for evaluating reconciliation in peacebuilding contexts.",,"This research was funded by the Fundación Universidad del Norte, grant number 2018-14.

1922,pub.1152550077,10.1109/access.2022.3220223,,,A Study on Control Strategies for Aggregated Community Energy Storage Systems in Medium Voltage Distribution Networks,"Community Energy Storage Systems (CESSs) emerge as an innovative way to integrate batteries into Low Voltage (LV) and Medium Voltage (MV) distribution networks to provide ancillary services and improve the quality of energy received by the end user. However, since CESSs are still emerging technologies, there is much research space in this field for proposing innovative and economic control algorithms for such devices. Thus, this paper presents a study of four control strategies applied to an MV distribution network, i.e., peak shaving, line losses control, line congestion reduction, and system voltage control, through an Aggregated Community Energy Storage System (ACESS), which is represented as the sum of multiple CESSs connected in LV systems, viewed from MV side. The proposed strategies are based on Model Predictive Control (MPC), a technique that, using the future demand forecast data, calculates the dispatch of ACESS. The results show, with respect to the base case, an improvement between 12.8% and 15.1% for the line losses control strategy, a reduction of 31.5% on the maximum demand for the peak shaving control strategy, a maximum lowering of 12% on the currents of some lines for the congestion control strategy, and an enhancement of 0.15% for the voltage control strategy. Moreover, for estimating the service lifetime of the ACESS after applying the control algorithms, the Rainflow Counting Algorithm (RCA) is used, exhibiting that, regardless of the control strategy, the degradation is inversely proportional to the storage capacity.",,This work was supported by Universidad del Norte through Internal Research Agendas Program.,IEEE Access,,,,2022-01-01,2022,2022-11-07,2022-01-01,10,,119321-119332,All OA; Gold,Article,"Yepes-Fernéndez, Hernén; Restrepo, Mauricio; Arango-Manrique, Adriana","Yepes-Fernéndez, Hernén (Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, 081007, Colombia); Restrepo, Mauricio (Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, 081007, Colombia); Arango-Manrique, Adriana (Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, 081007, Colombia)","Restrepo, Mauricio (Universidad del Norte)","Yepes-Fernéndez, Hernén (Universidad del Norte); Restrepo, Mauricio (Universidad del Norte); Arango-Manrique, Adriana (Universidad del Norte)",5,5,,2.51,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/ielx7/6287639/6514899/09940955.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1152550077,"40 Engineering; 4008 Electrical Engineering; 4009 Electronics, Sensors and Digital Hardware",7 Affordable and Clean Energy

The application of physically-based models is an effective method to predict landslide susceptibility, which is of great importance in hazard assessments and urban-planning studies. Thus, the objective of this study is to compare landslide susceptibility scenarios created with SHALSTAB and SINMAP at two large watersheds (Mogi and Perequê) in Cubatão, Latin America’s largest petrochemical site. Model calibration is based on the landslide scars inventory of the 1985 event, the geotechnical parameters derived from soil samples and the topography sourced from a 5 m resolution DEM. Using the Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) analysis to assess model performance, SHALSTAB emerges as the best-fit model for both watersheds due to higher concentration of landslide scars in unstable areas (true positive results) and higher global accuracy. Even though SINMAP had similar degree of success, it was slightly less accurate and failed more often in the identification of potentially unstable areas. Comparative performance studies of physically-based models are fundamental to support effective and reliable hazard assessments in mountain regions, providing an outlook in how to proceed with more detailed studies.",,,Revista Brasileira de Geomorfologia,,,,2022-04-06,2022,2022-04-06,,23,2,1394-1419,All OA; Gold,Article,"Cabral, Victor Carvalho; Reis, Fábio Augusto Gomes Vieira; Mendoza, Carolina Martinez; Oliveira, Alan","Cabral, Victor Carvalho (Eberhard Karls Universität Tübingen / Universidade Estadual Paulista ""Júlio de Mesquita Filho""); Reis, Fábio Augusto Gomes Vieira (Universidade Estadual Paulista - UNESP); Mendoza, Carolina Martinez (Universidad del Norte - Uninorte); Oliveira, Alan (Universidade Estadual Paulista - UNESP)",,"Cabral, Victor Carvalho (Eberhard Karls Universität Tübingen / Universidade Estadual Paulista ""Júlio de Mesquita Filho""); Reis, Fábio Augusto Gomes Vieira (São Paulo State University); Mendoza, Carolina Martinez (Universidad del Norte - Uninorte); Oliveira, Alan (São Paulo State University)",8,8,,5.39,https://rbgeomorfologia.org.br/rbg/article/download/2084/386386729,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1146924817,37 Earth Sciences; 3704 Geoinformatics,15 Life on Land

To improve reliability in rural areas, microgrids (MGs) are being integrated into conventional power systems. This study evaluates the effect on the reliability of rural distribution systems when MGs are introduced considering different penetration levels for renewable and nonrenewable distributed generation, and under rated power of energy storage. Here, we first formulate a reliability model for a rural distribution system with MGs. Based on this model, an interactive method using a sequential Monte Carlo simulation method is proposed and applied to calculate different conventional reliability indices. We show that this approach facilitates the selection of the parameters of the different systems constituting the MGs in order to comply with a predefined reliability objective. For instance, by introducing only photovoltaic distributed generation systems to the rural distribution systems under study, achieving the reliability objective is next to impossible. However, when correctly dimensioned-hybrid MGs are introduced, such an objective is successfully achieved. In the future, our model and the results provided herein could be combined with technical and economic studies to obtain an optimal solution that meets a certain reliability objective.",,The work of Jose L.

Geographical codification techniques, like Geohash, can be used to protect individual locations altering the precision of the location so it represents wide area that contains the user’s location but does not give out the exact coordinate. However, this transformation creates some problems when a simple range-based query wants to be performed over coded data: neighbor points may have quite different representations if they fall in different quadrants. This problem, named lack of locality, has been solved by extending the search area of the query by projecting the user’s location in all adjacent grid cells and use the common prefix of the code to identify all the points in the adjacent cells, but the result set increases substantially, creating a problem for the user which needs to filter the useful results from the set returned by the extended query. In this work, the Hall of Mirrors, or HoM strategy is presented, which creates multiple representations of the points of interest in adjacent quadrants. This allows, not only the execution of the traditional common prefix query, but also distance-based queries from the user’s location, using the numerical code difference, which overcomes the locality problem by obtaining the relevant points of interest - PoI and reduces the number of total results. Four PoI projection techniques are introduced and compared to the Adaptive Hilbert-Geohash, or AHG technique and the regular geographic query.

Infrared-transparent membrane films emerged as a viable alternative to improve hybrid radiant cooling by preventing moisture condensation. This case study assesses the potential of membrane-assisted radiant cooling in a rural school building in Santa Lucia, Atlántico (Colombia), a location with a hot and humid tropical climate throughout the year. The study evaluates different cooling strategies, including natural ventilation, mechanical ventilation, hybrid radiant cooling, and membrane-assisted radiant cooling using EnergyPlus® software. Results for a radiant surface temperature of 4 °C below the dew point show that membrane-assisted radiant cooling could reduce annual discomfort hours by 3–6% compared to conventional radiant cooling. Further experimental and modeling studies should focus on the lowest achievable temperature below the dew point without condensation. Our results suggest that radiant cooling with infrared-transparent membranes is a potentially cost-effective alternative for improving thermal comfort in rural school buildings in hot and humid climates.","The authors would like to thank Universidad del Norte and Minciencias through Convocatoria Doctorados Nacionales 727 of Fondo Nacional de Financiamiento para la Ciencia, la Tecnología e Innovación FCTeI, by Sistema General de Regalías SGR for supporting this research.",,International Journal of Thermofluids,,,,2022-11,2022,,2022-11,16,,100214,All OA; Gold,Article,"Albuja, Rafael; Foliaco, Blanca; Bula, Antonio; Gonzalez-Quiroga, Arturo","Albuja, Rafael (Department of Mechanical Engineering, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, 080001, Colombia); Foliaco, Blanca (Department of Mechanical Engineering, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, 080001, Colombia); Bula, Antonio (UREMA Research Unit, Department of Mechanical Engineering, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, 080001, Colombia); Gonzalez-Quiroga, Arturo (UREMA Research Unit, Department of Mechanical Engineering, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, 080001, Colombia)","Gonzalez-Quiroga, Arturo (Universidad del Norte)","Albuja, Rafael (Universidad del Norte); Foliaco, Blanca (Universidad del Norte); Bula, Antonio (Universidad del Norte); Gonzalez-Quiroga, Arturo (Universidad del Norte)",7,7,,7.15,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijft.2022.100214,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1151034805,33 Built Environment and Design; 3301 Architecture,

Individuals with ULEDs require assistive robots to fulfill all their activities of daily living (ADLs). Thus, this research presents an objective function for base placement optimization of assistive robots to increase the workspace required to fulfill ADLs (workspace coverage). The workspace coverage was determined using the xArm 6 robot and experimenting with different ADLs. Also, an object collision algorithm is implemented to avoid collisions between the robot and the user within the workspace. Moreover, the algorithm determines the existence of singularities within the workspace by computing the manipulability index. However, since the manipulability index computation depends on the Jacobian matrix’s eigenvalues yielding incongruences in the units, we divided the Jacobian matrix into two parts; one for the angular and another for the linear velocity. Finally, using the objective function with a genetic algorithm (GA), the optimal base placement for the robot is obtained and validated experimentally.","The contents of this research do not necessarily represent the policy of NIDILRR, ACL, or HHS, and they should not assume endorsement by the Federal Government.","This work was supported in part by the National Institute on Disability, Independent Living, and Rehabilitation Research (NIDILRR) under Grant 90DPGE0018-01-00; and in part by the NIDILRR Center within the Administration for Community Living (ACL), Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).",IEEE Access,,,,2022-01-01,2022,2022-12-23,2022-01-01,10,,134536-134548,All OA; Gold,Article,"De, Javier Dario Sanjuan; Sunny, Samiul Haque; Montenegro, Elias Jose Muñoz; Ahmed, Helal Uddin; Rahman, Mohammad H.","De, Javier Dario Sanjuan (Department of Mechanical Engineering, University of Wisconsin–Milwaukee, Milwaukee, WI, 53212, USA; Department of Mechanical Engineering, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, 081007, Colombia); Sunny, Samiul Haque (Department of Computer Science, University of Wisconsin–Milwaukee, Milwaukee, WI, 53212, USA); Montenegro, Elias Jose Muñoz (Department of Mechanical Engineering, University of Wisconsin–Milwaukee, Milwaukee, WI, 53212, USA); Ahmed, Helal Uddin (Biorobotics Laboratory, University of Wisconsin–Milwaukee, Milwaukee, WI, 53212, USA); Rahman, Mohammad H.

By studying rocks used for stone tools and other everyday artifacts, we explore the volcanic landscapes of early hunter-gatherer groups (11,500–9,500 cal BP) of the highlands of the Atacama Desert (22–24°S/67–68°W). Petrological classification of the lithic assemblages of three Early Holocene archaeological sites showed the procurement of a great diversity of volcanic and subvolcanic rocks, including pumice, granitic rocks, micro-diorites, a large variety of tuffs and andesites, dacites, cherts, basalts, obsidians, among others. Field surveys enabled us to detect many of their sources related to volcanic features such as craters, maars, caldera-domes, lava flows, probable hydrothermal deposits, and ignimbrites. In these places, we also document large quarry-workshops and campsites from different periods, indicating intense and repeated human occupation over time. By comparing the artifacts with geological samples collected in the field, it was possible to assign the source of origin of a large part of the archaeological assemblages. Our data suggest that the volcanic features of the Atacama highlands were integrated into the mobility and interaction networks of ancient hunter-gatherer groups at an early date.","First of all, we would like to acknowledge that this research was conducted on the traditional lands of the Lickanantay People.

It has been detected in different water sources, including drinking water, which could be generating potential damage to human health. In the Metropolitan Area of Cúcuta, intensive rice cultivation is predominant, and as it grows in flooded areas, the use of herbicides has greater contact with water bodies, which are used as sources of supply. Based on this, the concentration of glyphosate was quantified in five sampling points of surface and drinking water of the Pamplonita and Zulia rivers, using UV-Vis spectrophotometry, establishing that the concentration found in drinking water (216 and 204.5 µg/L) was below the maximum allowable limits of countries such as the United States, Canada, and Australia and above those of the European Union and the United Kingdom. Once the occurrence was identified, the removal capacity of glyphosate was evaluated using membrane technology through reverse osmosis (RO) and nanofiltration (NF) in a pilot plant, for which response surface optimization models were implemented, and 100% removals were obtained, with repeatability close to 1% with respect to other reported investigations, highlighting that the NF process was more efficient even though the molecular weight of glyphosate was below the limit of the membrane. In contrast, it was determined that, according to the concentrations found in the drinking water supplied to the Metropolitan Area of Cúcuta, this has a low risk according to the guidelines for drinking water quality in Canada and a moderate risk according to the World Health Organization (WHO). The conventional systems currently used for water purification are insufficient to remove traces of contaminants such as herbicides.

We investigate the role of morphodynamic changes in the flooding of a micro-tidal dissipative beach for both current and sea level rise scenarios. By considering beach morphodynamics and flood processes associated with highly energetic waves, the study allows one to evaluate threats to coastal zones. Coupling of SWAN and XBeach models is employed to propagate offshore wave conditions to the swash zone, estimating morphological changes and flooding associated with wave conditions during cold fronts and hurricanes that affected Cartagena de Indias (Colombia). The numerical models were calibrated from previous research in the study area. The results indicate that numerical modeling of flooding on microtidal dissipative beaches under extreme wave conditions should be approached by considering beach morphodynamics, because ignoring them can underestimate flooding by ∼ 15 %. Moreover, model results suggest that beach erosion and flooding are intensified by sea level rise, resulting in the most unfavorable condition when extreme events are contemporaneous with high tides. In this case, the increase in erosion and flooding is ∼ 69 % and ∼ 65 %, respectively, when compared with the present conditions of sea level.","We thank the Colombian Ministry of Sciences, Technology, and Innovation – Minciencias for partially funding the study.

1753,pub.1147056218,10.1063/5.0089325,,,Predicting new potential antimalarial compounds by using Zagreb topological indices,"Molecular topology allows describing molecular structures following a two-dimensional approach by taking into account how the atoms are arranged internally through a connection matrix between the atoms that are part of a structure. Various molecular indices (unique for each molecule) can be determined, such as Zagreb, Balaban, and topological indices. These indices have been correlated with physical chemistry properties such as molecular weight, boiling point, and electron density. Furthermore, their relationship with a specific biological activity has been found in other reports. Therefore, its knowledge and interpretation could be critical in the rational design of new compounds, saving time and money in their development process. In this research, the molecular graph of antimalarials already in the pharmaceutical market, such as chloroquine, primaquine, quinine, and artemisinin, was calculated and used to compute the Zagreb indices; a relationship between these indices and the antimalarial activities was found. According to the results reported in this work, the smaller the Zagreb indices, the higher the antimalarial activity. This relationship works very well for other compounds series. Therefore, it seems to be a fundamental structural requirement for this activity. Three triazole-modified structures are proposed as possible potential antimalarials based on this hypothesis. Finally, this work shows that the Zagreb indices could be a cornerstone in designing and synthesizing new antimalarial compounds, albeit they must be proved experimentally.",The authors acknowledge the financial support for this research from the Universidad del Norte (Internal Project No. 2019-017) as well as supporting the open access invoice.,,AIP Advances,,,,2022-04-01,2022,2022-04-13,2022-04-01,12,4,045017,All OA; Gold,Article,"Brito, Daniel; Marquez, Edgar; Rosas, Felix; Rosas, Ennis","Brito, Daniel (Departamento de Matemáticas, Universidad de Oriente, Núcleo de Sucre, Cumana, Venezuela); Marquez, Edgar (Grupo de Investigaciones en Química y Biología, Departamento de Química y Biología, Facultad de Ciencias Exactas, Universidad del Norte, Carrera 51B, Km 5, vía Puerto Colombia, Barranquilla 081007, Colombia); Rosas, Felix (Laboratorio de Fisicoquímica Orgánica, Instituto Venezolano de Investigaciones Científicas, Caracas, Venezuela); Rosas, Ennis (Departamento de Ciencias Naturales y Exactas, Universidad de la Costa, Barranquilla, Colombia)","Marquez, Edgar (Universidad del Norte)","Brito, Daniel (Universidad de Oriente); Marquez, Edgar (Universidad del Norte); Rosas, Felix (Instituto Venezolano de Investigaciones Científicas); Rosas, Ennis (University of the Coast)",4,4,,,https://aip.scitation.org/doi/pdf/10.1063/5.0089325,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1147056218,40 Engineering; 51 Physical Sciences,3 Good Health and Well Being

ABE is equivalent to the number of strong acids, other than lactate, which are present in the plasma in abnormal concentrations, negative ABE being associated with higher mortality in sepsis. Hemoperfusion (HPF) is an extracorporeal procedure that involves the passage of blood through an adsorption cartridge, where solutes are removed by direct binding to the sorbent material. Then, it was decided to explore the influence of HPF on negative ABE value in sepsis. Materials and methods: Basal values of ABE, standard base excess (SBE), and lactate (mean, standard deviation [SD]) were obtained. The difference between these parameter values before and after four sessions of HPF (HA330) (delta value) was evaluated. Student’s t-test and Wilcoxon test were applied. Results: From 32 patients (age: 57±13) suffering from respiratory insufficiency secondary to COVID-19 who were treated with HPF in the critical care unit of Clinica de la Mujer, Bogotá (Colombia), 6 patients presented with metabolic acidosis with negative ABE value (‒2.7±1) with negative SBE (‒4.7±1) and high lactate serum value (2±0.7 mmol/L). Delta ABE, SBE, and lactate were: 7.7 (p = 0.005), 6.1 (p = 0.003), and 1.6 (p = NS), respectively. Thus, negative ABE was significantly reversed by HPF, since SBE value turned positive without significant change in lactate. Conclusion: Negative alactic parameter was significantly reversed by HPF in septic patients. It is necessary to carry out evaluations in larger groups to estimate their impact on clinical outcomes.",,,Giornale di Clinica Nefrologica e Dialisi,,,,2022-12-19,2022,2022-12-19,,34,,122-124,All OA; Gold,Article,"Musso, Carlos Guido; Cordoba, Juan P.; Aroca-Marinez, Gustavo; Terrasa, Sergio; Barriga-Moreno, Adriana P.; Lozano-Sanchez, Marcela; Barón-Alvarez, Rafael A.; Gonzalez-Torres, Henry; Cantos, Joaquin; Huespe, Iván","Musso, Carlos Guido (Facultad de Ciencias de la Salud, Universidad Simón Bolivar, Barranquilla - Colombia and Research Department, Hospital Italiano de Buenos Aires, Buenos Aires - Argentina); Cordoba, Juan P.

1748,pub.1146169669,10.3390/app12062807,,,Design and Validation of a Low-Cost Structural Health Monitoring System for Dynamic Characterization of Structures,"Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) is essential to identifying problems that may cause human and material losses produced by disastrous and unexpected structural failures. The dynamic characterization of civil structures adopting SHM systems provides, at a particular moment, accurate information about the current structural response. When considering a proper SHM strategy and affordable economic investment for the maintenance required by structures, it is possible to safeguard the original structural parameters and avoid potential failures. However, traditional SHM systems are not desirable due to the large economic investments involved and demand for exhausting fieldwork. This research presents the design, implementation, and validation of a low-cost SHM system composed of a Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) and a base station in order to identify dynamic properties from the measured structural response. A set of small- and full-scale experimental tests were conducted to validate the WSN system using a wired traditional SHM system. Vibration data recorded through the low-cost SHM system were processed and compared to determine the natural frequencies, mode shapes, and damping properties of different structures by computing modal identification techniques, frequency analysis, and logarithmic decrement. The obtained dynamic characterization results from small- and full-scale experimental testing conclude that the low-cost SHM system can reliably identify the dynamic properties of the tested structures. This proposal provides an inexpensive, functional, and innovative alternative for SHM regarding traditional monitoring systems.",The authors would like to thank Universidad del Norte for providing the National Instrument data acquisition system and PCB Piezotronics accelerometers for the instrumentation of large-scale civil structures.,This research received no external funding.,Applied Sciences,,,,2022-03-09,2022,2022-03-09,,12,6,2807,All OA; Gold,Article,"Caballero-Russi, David; Ortiz, Albert R.; Guzmán, Andrés; Canchila, Carlos","Caballero-Russi, David (Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, The Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA 16802, USA); Ortiz, Albert R.

The transition also caused faculty to reevaluate their professional development (PD). This qualitative exploratory study focused on the pd experienced by a group of foreign language university instructors in Colombia during this crisis. Specifically it identified the challenges encountered and how these were tackled. Data were collected through an open-ended survey and analyzed using content analysis. Results show ten main challenges, which were then categorized into three themes: (a) adaptation to emergency remote teaching, (b) promotion of student engagement, and (c) handling of emotions. Conclusions reveal that professors embraced the crisis with a positive attitude, engaging in different PD opportunities, displaying agency, responsibility, and flexibility. Therefore, the challenges and their reaction to them fostered their PD and learning.

The viability of two native LAB (Lactiplantibacillus plantarum UTNGt2 and Lactiplantibacillus pentosus UTNGt5) was assessed in comparison with two references (Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis ATCC11474 and Limosilactobacillus reuteri DSM17938) strains in supplemented CSMFs throughout storage with refrigeration. The optimum conditions to produce novel beverages supplemented with native LAB were pH 6.6, 42°C, and 1 h of fermentation. Moreover, the effect of LAB strains fortification on pH, titratable acidity, total solids (°Brix), total polyphenolic compounds (TPC), antioxidant capacity (AOX), and ascorbic acid content (AAC), total proteins and fat, at initial and final storage was evaluated. The addition of two native LAB strains did alter the physicochemical quality of CSMFs to a lesser extent, where the bioactive molecules improved significantly (p < 0.05) with the increase of cocoa concentration and depending on the supplied strain. Although a statistically significant (p < 0.05) decrease in cell counts was recorded during storage, the LAB cells were found to be viable up to 21 days of storage at 4°C (>6 logCFU/ml), which is sufficient in number to prove their stability in vitro. Overall organoleptic results suggested that LAB supplementation had a significant impact on sensory attributes with satisfactory acceptability (>78%) of PBs containing the native strains and 1-2% cocoa, while CSMFs counterparts were less appreciated (40%) as perceived off-flavor. It appears that supplying bacteria to CSMF preserves flavor in the final product. Furthermore, the final beverages were free of harmful bacteria; thus, they comply with consumer safety regulations. This study concludes that CSMF can be used as a carrier of native LAB strains, maintaining cell viability, unaltered physicochemical properties, and improved functional and sensory characteristics, for which final beverages can be regarded as functional food. From the application standpoint, these formulations are an alternative to delivering native LAB strains and could help the cocoa and dairy industry to develop more attractive products for the growing regional market.","The authors acknowledge Ing.

In this interface problem, different sets of Maxwell equations must be solved both in the obstacle and outside it, while the tangential components of both electric and magnetic fields are continuous across the interface. We describe an asymptotic procedure, applied for large conductivity, which reflects the skin effect in metals. The key to our method is a special integral equation procedure for the exterior boundary value problems corresponding to perfect conductors. The asymptotic procedure leads to a great reduction in complexity for the numerical solution, since it involves solving only the exterior boundary value problems. Furthermore, we introduce a FEM/BEM coupling procedure for the transmission problem and consider the implementation of Galerkin’s elements for the perfect conductor problem, and present numerical experiments.","This research was supported in part by the ALECOL-DAAD Program and COLCIENCIAS through contract number CT 793-2013, and code 1215-569-33876.

In 50% of children the first febrile seizure occurs at 2 years and in 90% before 3 years, anemia is also a frequent pathology in pediatric patients, in fact, the figures of the World Health Organization (WHO), point out that iron deficiency anemia attacks children under five years of age, occurring worldwide around 799 million, an average, in the last 10 years, of 42%. And in Latin America, the figure is 23%. Iron deficiency anemia can predispose to the development of febrile seizures because iron plays a crucial role in the transport of oxygen to all tissues, its deficiency also produces a dysfunction of myelination, tyrosine, and tryptophan synthesis hydroxylase, which are necessary for the release of neurotransmitters, therefore, if said neurotransmitters are not released, the brain synapse can be altered and lead to a seizure.

One of the most commonly used instruments for evaluating personality in children and adolescents is the BFQ-C. However, its applicability may be limited by its length. The short version of the test has shown stability across different cultures but there is no empirical evidence on its psychometric properties to enable it to be used in the Latin American context. Objective. This study seeks to validate the short version of the Big Five Questionnaire for Children (BFQ-C) in the Colombian population. Method. The questionnaire was administered to 844 adolescents (55% boys and 45% girls) aged between 11 and 16 (M = 13.55 and SD = 2.30). Seven possible models were obtained from a series of exploratory and confirmatory analyses to explain the factorial structure of the test, which were compared with each other to find the model with the best statistical fit. Results. The model with the best absolute fit coincided with the five-factor proposal of the scale, for which empirical evidence is provided for the universality of the Big Five model. The factors showed adequate levels of reliability. Discussion and conclusion. The short version of the BFQ-C has good psychometric properties in adolescents and constitutes a useful instrument for measuring personality in the Latin American context.
Introducción. El modelo teórico y de medición más aceptado en el estudio de la personalidad es el de los Cinco Grandes: Energía, Amabilidad, Conciencia, Inestabilidad Emocional y Apertura a la Experiencia. El BFQ-C es uno de los instrumentos más usados para evaluar a niños y adolescentes. No obstante, su aplicabilidad puede verse limitada por su extensión. Aunque la versión corta ha evidenciado cierta estabilidad en distintas culturas, no hay evidencia empírica sobre sus propiedades psicométricas para usarse en el contexto latinoamericano. Objetivo. Validar en población colombiana la versión corta del Cuestionario de los Cinco Grandes para Niños (BFQ-C). Método. Se aplicó el cuestionario a 844 adolescentes (55% hombres y 45% mujeres), con edades entre los 11 y los 16 años (M = 13.55 y SD = 2.30). A partir de una serie de análisis exploratorios y confirmatorios, se obtuvieron siete modelos posibles para explicar la estructura factorial de la prueba; éstos se compararon entre sí para hallar el modelo con el mejor ajuste estadístico. Resultados. El modelo con el mejor ajuste absoluto coincidió con la propuesta pentafactorial de la escala, por lo que se ofrece evidencia empírica para la universalidad del modelo de los Cinco Grandes. Los factores evidenciaron niveles de confiabilidad adecuados. Discusión y conclusión. En su versión corta, el BFQ-C presenta buenas propiedades psicométricas en adolescentes y constituye un instrumento útil para la medición de la personalidad en el contexto latinoamericano.",,,Salud Mental,,,,2022-01-26,2022,,2022-01-26,45,1,29-34,All OA; Gold,Article,"Robles-Haydar, Claudia A.; Amar-Amar, José; Martínez-González, Marina B.","Robles-Haydar, Claudia A.

There are several forecasting models for forecasting time series data, such as the autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model, which has been considered the most-used regression model in time series prediction for the last four decades, although the ARIMA model cannot estimate non-linear regression behavior caused by high volatility in the time series. In addition, the support vector regression (SVR) model is a pioneering machine learning approach for solving nonlinear regression estimation procedures. For this reason, this paper proposes using a hybrid model benefiting from ARIMA and support vector regression (SVR) models to forecast daily and cumulative returns of selected Colombian companies. For testing purposes, close prices of Bancolombia, Ecopetrol, Tecnoglass, and Grupo Aval were used; these are relevant Colombian organizations quoted on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE).",,L.R. is supported by Universidad del Norte.

One of the most used indices to evaluate the drought is the standardized precipitation index (SPI) due to its practicality and evaluation in a variety of time scales, however, this uses precipitation as the only variable, depending on the deviations in the precipitation values. This is important when evaluating the SPI, because in some ecosystems close to the equatorial zone, there are very warm periods with low rainfall, in which a large proportion of the data collected by the meteorological stations corresponds to zero. In this research, the SPI was calculated in the Pechelín basin located in Colombia, in which there is zero precipitation in a large proportion of the data, registering zero precipitation in the month of January and February in 67% and 70% respectively. As a result, the SPI values increased to “wet” ranges, only when the amount of data with zero precipitation exceeded half of the total data; this means that the SPI determines wrong values when it is calculated with zero-precipitation data in large proportions. Based on this finding, this study aims to modify the index by typing the distribution (using a correction factor K), finally correcting the SPI values, this correction was called SPI-C. The results indicate that the SPI-C improved the identification of drought, obtaining corresponding values that better represent the high frequency of zero precipitation existing in the study area.","The first author is grateful to the Universidad del Norte, Colombia for allowing me to study for a PhD in Engineering.

Abstract. In Chile and Latin America, until this moment doesn’t exist a questionnaire that could be used for showing the level of knowledge about the theoretical-practical relationship that is produced by the supervisión within the initial teacher training, for its main actors, like supervisors and supervisees. That instrument will give information to the Universities and they will take decisions about the factors that most affect the process inside the FID. The objective of this study is to validate two questionnaires that measure the influencing factors on the supervision of pedagogical practices, checking reliability and developing normative values for each category. The sample for supervisees was composed of 26 students, selected by census type (Otzen & Manterola, 2017), being 17 men and nine women, they constituted the 100% of student population of four year of one university in the north of Chile and for supervisors the sample was made of 11 teachers, being seven men and four women. Each questionnaire had 11 questions to determine the components that affect the theoretical-practical relationship in the initial teacher training. It was validated by the confirmatory analysis and reliability was determined by internal consistency. As a result it was obtained that the instruments developed are valid and reliable and it helps to value the factors influencing supervision of pedagogical practices. Besides, the proposed rules could help the professionals of the educational system to assess the supervision of practices in similar populations.

The previuos is a sign of the different cultures that García Márquez (Gabo) lived with. Since Gabo was a child or in his childhood, he experienced a bicultural (colombian and Wayuu) vision where the supernatural, the mythological and the ordinary life were part of his existence. Among these, the Wayuu culture stands out, an indigenous influence that deeply marks the writer's work, because, just as García Márquez feels close to the language of the “Guajiros”, some of his characters seek to communicate only in the Wayuu's mother tongue: Wayuunaiki. In this sense, this article establishes five categories to analyze the symbolic role of bones, life in death, the prediction of the future, the clairvoyance of the dream world and the role of some characters as shamans in that specific social group. These elements of the Wayuu’s culture, which are found explicitly and implicitly in One Hundred Years of Solitude, constituting a great dialogic fabric or unit, in which two cultures of the Colombian Caribbean intersect ways of living and thinking; and the characters do not fully fit into neither the common indigenous canon nor the Western ones.",,,Jangwa Pana,,,,2022-05-19,2022,2022-05-19,,21,2,123-131,All OA; Gold,Article,"Gómez, Cindy Juliana García; Bohórquez, María Isabel Salazar","Gómez, Cindy Juliana García (Universidad Industrial de Santander); Bohórquez, María Isabel Salazar (Universidad Industrial de Santander)",,"Gómez, Cindy Juliana García (Industrial University of Santander); Bohórquez, María Isabel Salazar (Industrial University of Santander)",0,0,,0.0,https://revistas.unimagdalena.edu.co/index.php/jangwapana/article/download/4632/3502,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1152202387,"47 Language, Communication and Culture; 4705 Literary Studies",

The results show that the processes of expansion and progress of the maritime and fluvial port development, particularly the development of Bocas de Ceniza, accelerated environmental deterioration and the subsequent disappearance of these spaces.",,,Historia Y Espacio,,,,2022-05-09,2022,2022-05-09,,18,58,,All OA; Gold,Article,"Delgado, Jose Eduardo Fuentes","Delgado, Jose Eduardo Fuentes (Universidad del valle)",,"Delgado, Jose Eduardo Fuentes (University of Valle)",1,0,,1.17,https://historiayespacio.univalle.edu.co/index.php/historia_y_espacio/article/download/11446/14926,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1147750937,44 Human Society; 48 Law and Legal Studies; 4802 Environmental and Resources Law,

Valor simbólico de la revisión judicial de las reformas constitucionales para la construcción de paz en Colombia,"The legal implementation of the Final Peace Agreement (AFP) signed between the former guerrilla Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) and the government of former President Juan Manuel Santos generated the enforcement of exceptional constitutional norms on legislative and constitutional review processes. In this sense, the Colombian Constitutional Court carried out an exceptional, automatic, and unique review of five legislative acts (AL) that were issued to legally implement what was politically agreed. This article analyzes Sentence C-076/2018 with which the constitutional review of AL 05 of 2017 was made, this review being issued for the implementation of the AFP. Since AL 05 of 2017 amended Article 22 of the Constitution including an express prohibition for the creation, financing, and support for groups of armed civilians with illegal purposes, a question is raised: Is it possible to forbid the forbidden? Methodologically, we display the tensions between the derived constituent and the Court and the application of the constitutional substitution judgment. We conclude that the Court's review was particular not only because of the exceptional nature of the rules, but also because it issued a symbolic sentence. This sentence is worth acknowledging insofar as it highlights the importance of the construction of the transitional justice and peace model derived from the implementation of the AFP.",,,Estudios de derecho,,,,2022-01-03,2022,2022-01-03,,79,173,,All OA; Gold,Article,"Hassan, Viridiana Molinares","Hassan, Viridiana Molinares (Universidad del Norte)",,"Hassan, Viridiana Molinares (Universidad del Norte)",1,1,,3.77,https://revistas.udea.edu.co/index.php/red/article/download/348493/20807854,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1147369008,48 Law and Legal Studies; 4807 Public Law,"16 Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions"

Adaptación de la escala de necesidades psicológicas básicas a futuros docentes,"There are still few studies that address the importance of knowing the psychological needs and frustrations of teachers at the basic levels of education when they are in the training period. The aim of this study was to revalidate the scale of basic psychological needs (S-PNTS) in order to recognize whether it is sufficiently adequate to apply and obtain results with guaranteed success in trainee teachers and to study the inference of socio-demographic and personal variables in frustration and psychological needs. A quantitative methodology has been used following a survey method with a non-experimental design, applied to a sample of 598 university students of the degrees of Teacher in Early Childhood Education and Primary Education, and of the Master’s Degree in Teacher Training in Compulsory Secondary Education of two Spanish universities (one in the north and one in the south) and of equivalent degrees in a Chilean university, with an age range between 18 and 54 years old. The programs used were SPSS.24, Factor.10, MPlus.7 and G*Power 3. After carrying out the factor analyses, the result was that the scale was configured with one less item than the original one but maintaining the three-dimensional scale. The results also reveal that trainee teachers in Primary Education show a greater approximation to frustration than those in Early Childhood and Secondary Education. On the other hand, students from the south of Spain feel less competent, more autonomous and perceive a better relationship in the teaching environment than the rest. Likewise, men perceive themselves as more competent than women.",,,Educación XX1,,,,2022-06-29,2022,2022-06-29,,25,2,89-105,All OA; Gold,Article,"Zagalaz, Javier Cachón; San Pedro Veledo, María Belén; Sánchez, Amador Lara; Sánchez, Maria Luisa Zagalaz; de Mesa, Carmen González González","Zagalaz, Javier Cachón (Universidad de Jaén, Spain); San Pedro Veledo, María Belén (Universidad de Oviedo, Spain); Sánchez, Amador Lara (Universidad de Jaén, Spain); Sánchez, Maria Luisa Zagalaz (Universidad de Jaén, Spain); de Mesa, Carmen González González (Universidad de Oviedo, Spain)",,"Zagalaz, Javier Cachón (University of Jaén); San Pedro Veledo, María Belén (University of Oviedo); Sánchez, Amador Lara (University of Jaén); Sánchez, Maria Luisa Zagalaz (University of Jaén); de Mesa, Carmen González González (University of Oviedo)",3,3,,4.3,https://revistas.uned.es/index.php/educacionXX1/article/download/30442/25439,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1149095220,39 Education; 3901 Curriculum and Pedagogy; 3903 Education Systems,4 Quality Education

MATERIAL AND METHODS: An experimental, in vitro, longitudinal, analytical, and prospective study was carried out. Subsequently, the following groups were formed: Streptococcus mutans vs Vitis® Sensible. S. mutans vs Sensodyne® Repair and Protect. Also, S. mutans vs Colgate® Sensitive Pro-ReliefTM and S. mutans vs Colgate Total 12® at 100, 50, 25, and 12.5%. Each Petri dish was properly labeled with the letter corresponding to the toothpaste and was placed in the incubator for 24 hours at 37°C. A 0.12% chlorhexidine solution was used as a positive control and distilled water as a negative control. The manuscript was written following the checklist for reporting in vitro studies (CRIS) guidelines.
RESULTS: It was found that when comparing the inhibition halos of the desensitizing toothpaste against S. mutans, Colgate® Sensitive Pro-ReliefTM 100% paste had the highest efficacy at 24 and 48 hours with an average of 25.2 ± 1.0 and 23.5 ± 1.1 mm, respectively. On the other way, Sensodyne paste had no efficacy at any of its concentrations 100, 50, 25, and 12.5%. Finally, it was found that there were statistically significant differences between each of the groups evaluated with a p < 0.001.
CONCLUSIONS: It was concluded that mainly the 100% pure concentrations of the desensitizing pastes had antibacterial efficacy against S. mutans. However, Sensodyne® Repair and Protect paste had no effect.
CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: This research has clinical relevance because the use of desensitizing pastes is highly frequent. Therefore, it is necessary to know if these pastes offer an efficient antibacterial effect to control the main microorganisms of the oral cavity.",,,The Journal of Contemporary Dental Practice,,,Streptococcus mutans; Toothpastes; Dentifrices; Prospective Studies; Anti-Bacterial Agents; Sodium Fluoride,2022-11-10,2022,2022-11-10,2022-11-10,23,7,669-673,All OA; Gold,Article,"Romo, Mariela; Mendoza, Roman; Mauricio, Franco; Chiong, Lucy; Munive-Degregori, Arnaldo; Barja-Ore, John; Mayta-Tovalino, Frank","Romo, Mariela (Department of Academic, Faculty of Dentistry, Universidad Nacional Federico Villarreal, Lima, Peru.); Mendoza, Roman (Department of Academic, Faculty of Dentistry, Universidad Nacional Federico Villarreal, Lima, Peru.); Mauricio, Franco (Department of Academic, Faculty of Dentistry, Universidad Nacional Federico Villarreal, Lima, Peru.); Chiong, Lucy (Department of Academic, Faculty of Dentistry, Universidad Nacional Federico Villarreal, Lima, Peru.); Munive-Degregori, Arnaldo (Department of Academic, Faculty of Dentistry, Universidad Nacional Mayor de San Marcos, Lima, Peru.); Barja-Ore, John (Research Directorate, Universidad Privada del Norte, Lima, Peru.); Mayta-Tovalino, Frank (Department of Postgraduate, Faculty of Health Sciences, Universidad Cientifica del Sur, Lima, Peru, Phone: +51 1214-2500, e-mail: fmaytat@cientifica.edu.pe.)",,"Romo, Mariela (Federico Villarreal National University); Mendoza, Roman (Federico Villarreal National University); Mauricio, Franco (Federico Villarreal National University); Chiong, Lucy (Federico Villarreal National University); Munive-Degregori, Arnaldo (National University of San Marcos); Barja-Ore, John (Private University of the North); Mayta-Tovalino, Frank (Scientific University of the South)",0,0,,0.0,https://doi.org/10.5005/jp-journals-10024-3375,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1152665275,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3203 Dentistry,

This work focuses on an industrial-scale rotary kiln for Ferronickel production via the Rotary Kiln-Electric Furnace (RKEF) process. Rotary kilns are prone to mechanical failure exacerbated by thermal effects, mainly during transient operation, such as preheating and cooling. However, few studies have tackled the impact of the transient operation on the stress state in the rotary kiln wall. Therefore, we evaluate the thermal and mechanical behavior of the rotary kiln wall during preheating. Actual operation data and a thermal model enable to obtain the temperature distribution along the kiln length. This temperature distribution is the starting point for calculating the stress state of the shell and refractory. The maximal thermal gradient occurs at 10 m from the hot end, with temperatures at the outer and inner surfaces of 200 °C and 820 °C, respectively. The von Mises stress shows a maximum of 121 MPa at the wheel position in the hot region of the refractory and a range of 30–60 MPa in the shell. In addition, the compressive stress is higher than the ultimate compressive strength of the refractory. However, it does not necessarily represent refractory detachment due to the plastic deformation undergone by the refractory under high temperatures. This work paves the way towards developing a tool for accurately predicting rotary kiln mechanical failure, which can help optimize operating conditions and assist in programming maintenance.",The research leading to these results has received funding from MINCIENCIAS under the project “Incremento en la Capacidad Operativa y Eficiencia de Producción de CERRO MATOSO S.A&quot; with contract number 4684-786-66497.,,Results in Engineering,,,,2022-06,2022,,2022-06,14,,100396,All OA; Gold,Article,"Guillin-Estrada, Wilson D.; Albuja, Rafael; Dávila, Ivan B.; Rueda, Bernardo S.; Corredor, Lesme; Gonzalez-Quiroga, Arturo; Maury, Heriberto","Guillin-Estrada, Wilson D.

We generated a de novo genome assembly of the Psidium guajava, the super fruit ""apple of the tropics"", and successfully transferred 14,268 SNP probesets from Eucalyptus to Psidium at the nucleotide level, to detect genomic loci linked to resistance to the root knot nematode (RKN) Meloidogyne enterolobii derived from the wild relative P. guineense. Significantly associated loci with resistance across alternative analytical frameworks, were detected at two SNPs on chromosome 3 in a pseudo-assembly of Psidium guajava genome built using a syntenic path approach with the Eucalyptus grandis genome to determine the order and orientation of the contigs. The P. guineense-derived resistance response to RKN and disease onset is conceivably triggered by mineral nutrients and phytohormone homeostasis or signaling with the involvement of the miRNA pathway. Hotspots of mapped resistance quantitative trait loci and functional annotation in the same genomic region of Eucalyptus provide further indirect support to our results, highlighting the evolutionary conservation of genomes across genera of Myrtaceae in the adaptation to pathogens. Marker assisted introgression of the resistance loci mapped should accelerate the development of improved guava cultivars and hybrid rootstocks.","We would like to thank Dr. Alexandre Pio Viana, from the State University of the North Fluminense Darcy Ribeiro for providing leaf tissue of the P. guajava selfed S2 plant UENFGO8.1–10 used to generate the de novo P. guajava genome assembly.

Yet, scaling bioproducts and bioenergy to industrial practice requires further investigation, especially for environmental impact minimization and improved process safety. This work assesses two alternatives for valorizing cassava residues via acetone, butanol, and ethanol (ABE) fermentation. Two ABE fermentation routes are assessed. In Route 1, pretreatment and purification involve dilute-acid pretreatment and multi-effect distillation and decantation operations, while Route 2 includes steam explosion and reactive distillation. Hazard Identification and Risk Assessment (HIRA) and Waste Reduction Algorithm (WAR) were applied to assess ABE fermentation. Simulation results indicate butanol yields of 0.10–0.12 kg/kg feedstock and net energy ratio (NER) <1. Route 2 shows the highest total output of Potential Environmental Impacts (PEI) with 5.56 PEI/kg butanol. Both ABE fermentation routes obtained Fire and Explosion Damage Index (FEDI) values above 300 for acetone and ethanol recovery/purification stages. Both routes are classified as “hazardous” considering the flammability of handled substances, and their relative safety performance is remarkably similar. These results pave the way toward deploying both routes for adding value to the cassava residues in North Colombia by applying safe, efficient, and environmentally friendly transformation technologies.",The authors thank the University of Cartagena for providing the financial support to conduct this research.

El 58% eran víctimas directas. Los resultados indican altos niveles de aprobación y de disposición a participar en las actividades de la Comisión, así como cierto escepticismo sobre su utilidad y una baja confianza en las disculpas oficiales de los grupos en conflicto. También se encuentra un alto índice de emociones positivas relacionadas con la comisión y una baja confianza en las instituciones gubernamentales.

For instance, some may be susceptible to a 51% attack, also known as a majority attack, which may suppose a high risk to the trustworthiness of the blockchains. Although this attack is theoretically possible, executing it in practice is often regarded as arduous because of the premise that, with sufficiently active members, it is not ’straightforward’ to have much computing power. Since it represents a possible vulnerability, the community has made efforts to solve this and other blockchain problems, which has resulted in the birth of alternative consensus protocols, e.g., the proof of accuracy protocol. This paper presents a detailed proposal of a proof-of-accuracy protocol. It aims to democratize the miners’ participation within a blockchain, control the miners’ computing power, and mitigate the majority attacks.",,This work was carried out with the support of the program “Convocatoria 779 de 2017-Doctorado Nacional Convocatoria para la Formación de Capital Humano de Alto Nivel para el Departamento de Boyacá–2017” and the Universidad del Norte.,Mathematics,,,,2022-07-19,2022,2022-07-19,,10,14,2504,All OA; Gold,Article,"Aponte-Novoa, Fredy Andres; Villanueva-Polanco, Ricardo","Aponte-Novoa, Fredy Andres (Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla 081007, Colombia;, faponte@uninorte.edu.co; Department of Systems Engineering, Universidad Santo Tomás, Tunja 150003, Colombia); Villanueva-Polanco, Ricardo (Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla 081007, Colombia;, faponte@uninorte.edu.co)","Villanueva-Polanco, Ricardo (Universidad del Norte)","Aponte-Novoa, Fredy Andres (Universidad del Norte; Universidad Santo Tomás); Villanueva-Polanco, Ricardo (Universidad del Norte)",4,1,,,https://www.mdpi.com/2227-7390/10/14/2504/pdf?version=1658215810,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1149617599,49 Mathematical Sciences,

Traditionally, this assessment was entrusted to peers with a recognized track record, eligibility and prestige. However, bibliometric indicators have been used for several years to eliminate subjectivity, which aim at a measurable, objective and multi-dimensional qualification (1,3).  Bibliometric indicators (BI) can be defined as quantifiers of the bibliographic information available in scientific and academic documents susceptible to being analyzed in terms of production and consumption (1,2). There is a typological variety of BI (1,2) based on the object to be examined (researcher, journal or research group) and, in some cases, they are cross-sectional to it. In this way, personal indicators (age, gender and background of the authors) only apply to researchers or groups, while productivity and impact also apply to journals. For journals, the productivity (quantity) and, more so, impact (“quality”) indicators, are routinely used to classify journals and compare them, with the increasingly controversial purpose of measuring their academic and/or social pertinence and relevance (4).",,,Medunab,,,,2022-05-10,2022,2022-05-10,,25,1,5-8,All OA; Gold,Article,"Wilches-Visbal, Jorge Homero; Castillo-Pedraza, Midian Clara","Wilches-Visbal, Jorge Homero (Universidad del Magdalena); Castillo-Pedraza, Midian Clara (Universidad del Magdalena)",,"Wilches-Visbal, Jorge Homero (University of Magdalena); Castillo-Pedraza, Midian Clara (University of Magdalena)",3,3,,4.19,https://revistas.unab.edu.co/index.php/medunab/article/download/4363/3582,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1147976578,46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4610 Library and Information Studies,

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Descriptive and cross-sectional bibliometric study, based on the systematic search of information in Scopus between 2017 and July 10, 2022. The search strategy was elaborated with Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) and Boolean operators. The analysis of bibliometric indicators was performed with Elsevier's SciVal program.
RESULTS: From 2017 to 2022, the number of publications in indexed scientific journals increased, especially in the Q1 (56.1%) and Q2 (30.6%) quartile. Among the journals with the highest production, the majority was from the United States and the United Kingdom, and the Journal of Dental Research has the highest impact (14.9 citations per publication) and the most publications (31). In addition, the Charité - Universitätsmedizin Berlin (FWCI: 8.24) and Krois Joachim (FWCI: 10.09) from Germany were the institution and author with the highest expected performance relative to the world average, respectively. The United States is the country with the highest number of published papers.
CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: There is an increasing tendency to increase the scientific production on artificial intelligence in the field of dentistry, with a preference for publication in prestigious scientific journals of high impact.

1551,pub.1140667727,10.1016/j.aej.2021.08.036,,,Improving the rotary kiln-electric furnace process for ferronickel production: Data analytics-based assessment of dust insufflation into the rotary kiln flame,"Ferronickel contains 60–80 wt% Fe and 40–20 wt% Ni and is a feedstock for manufacturing stainless steel and other ferrous alloys. The primary pyrometallurgical route to produce ferronickel from laterite nickel ores is the Rotary Kiln-Electric Furnace (RKEF) process. In the RKEF process, minerals undergo calcination and partial reduction in a rotary kiln. Large amounts of mineral dust leave the kiln entrained in flue gases. Dust insufflation is a potential solution in which dust particles enter directly into the burner flame. The aim is that the insufflated dust softens, agglomerates, and finally joins the minerals stream that goes into the electric furnace. We applied data analytics techniques to a 1-year operation database to assess the operation before and after dust insufflation in an industrial rotary kiln furnace. Bootstrapping revealed statistically significant differences in the operation with and without dust insufflation. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and k-means clustering were used as exploratory techniques. PCA showed subsets of variables that significantly influence the dataset variance, and k-means allowed distinguishing operation conditions for dust insufflation with encouraging results for the calcine-to-fresh mineral and the natural gas-to-calcine ratios. These results pave the way towards successfully implementing dust insufflation in the RKEF process.",The research leading to these results has received funding from MINCIENCIAS under the project “Incremento en la Capacidad Operativa y Eficiencia de Producción de CERRO MATOSO S.A” with contract number 4684-786-66497.,,Alexandria Engineering Journal,,,,2022-04,2022,,2022-04,61,4,3215-3228,All OA; Gold,Article,"Romero, Johanna M.; Pardo, Yuleisy S.; Parra, Maricel; De J.

However, relevant discussion in the field indicates that ILTE configurations are grounded on conceptual frameworks that fail to represent the complex nature of teacher preparation.Gap in knowledge and Purpose of the study: In this systematic review we explore whether recent conceptual ILTE understandings are acknowledged in current research as this information is relevant for stakeholders in education.Method: For this reason, this systematic review aims at analysing what teacher education components are addressed in such research in nationally ranked academic journals from 2014 to 2019 and how those components were researched.Findings and value added: Findings indicate areas related to student teachers’ learning are still at the forefront in ILTE. Additionally, that area is still inquired from a disjoint and discreet perspective.

Esta mutación predispone al desarrollo de tumores benignos y malignos que afectan diferentes órganos, a causa de una ausencia de la inhibición de la vía de la tumorigénesis mediada por el factor inducible por hipoxia. La prevalencia de esta enfermedad es de 2 a 3 por 100.000 personas y las neoplasias se localizan con mayor frecuencia en retina, sistema nervioso central, cabeza y cuello, páncreas, riñón, glándula suprarrenal y órgano reproductor. Se clasifica en 2 tipos dependiendo de la presencia o ausencia de feocromocitoma. El feocromocitoma y las neoplasias pancreáticas constituyen las manifestaciones endocrinas más frecuentes. El feocromocitoma se presenta entre el 10-30% de los casos. Puede cursar desde una entidad asintomática hasta una sintomatología variable que incluye la triada clásica de cefalea, palpitaciones y diaforesis. El diagnostico se realiza mediante pruebas bioquímicas que confirman niveles elevados de catecolaminas y estudios imagenológicos. Las lesiones pancreáticas son con frecuencia asintomáticas y se detectan de forma incidental en estudios de imagen realizados en los pacientes con VHL.

Métodos: Estudio experimental in vitro, en el que se sembró la bacteria (E. faecalis) en una caja de Petri, se tomaron de 5 a 10 cepas y se disolvieron en caldo de Mueller Hinton, para luego depositar el inóculo más el cemento en diferentes concentraciones en una placa de 96 pozos y medir el nivel de absorbancia de cada muestra en un espectrofotómetro. Para el análisis estadístico se utilizaron las pruebas no paramétricas de Mann-Whitney y Kruskal Wallis. Resultados: Al comparar de dos en dos los datos obtenidos no se obtuvieron datos esta-dísticamente significativos, pero al comparar las diferentes concentraciones de ambos cementos se obtuvo que el cemento de Grossman al 2 % tiene mayor efecto antimicrobiano. Conclusión: No hay diferencia significativa en la actividad antimicrobiana del MTA Fillapex® y el cemento de Grossman contra el E. faecalis, pero al comparar el cemento de Grossman al 2 %, este tiene mayor efecto antimicrobiano en comparación con el mismo cemento a diversas concentraciones.",,,Salud Uninorte,,,,2022-01-26,2022,2022-01-26,2022-01-26,37,1,84-95,All OA; Gold,Article,"Pupo Marrugo, Stella; Alvear Pérez, Javier; Del Río Rocha, Daniel","Pupo Marrugo, Stella (); Alvear Pérez, Javier (); Del Río Rocha, Daniel ()",,"Pupo Marrugo, Stella (); Alvear Pérez, Javier (); Del Río Rocha, Daniel ()",0,0,,,https://rcientificas.uninorte.edu.co/index.php/salud/article/download/13392/214421445631/214421459115,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1140168274,,

Su tratamiento consiste en el uso de medicamentos que pueden causar efectos adversos o la intervención global de comportamiento para tics (Comprehensive Behavioral Intervention for Tics, CBIT), que es un tratamiento conductual no farmacológico diseñado para enseñar a los pacientes y sus familias un conjunto específico de habilidades para reducir la frecuencia, la intensidad y el impacto general de los tics motores y vocales. Se reporta caso clínico de paciente de 13 años de edad que asistió a la Facultad de Odontología de la Universidad de Cartagena por presentar úlcera dolorosa en cavidad bucal. Como terapéutica se decidió utilizar la placa de protección mucosa (PPM) en el maxilar, y se observó una disminución del tamaño de la úlcera y en el control a los 45 días se observó la cicatrización completa de la lesión.

Material y método: Se realizó un estudio descriptivo trasversal con alcance correlacional. Participaron 107 personas con esclerosis múltiple, mayores de 18 años, con puntuaciones entre 0 y 8 en la Escala Ampliada del Estado de Discapacidad de Kurtzke. Se evaluó la fatiga con la Escala de Gravedad de la Fatiga, las actividades básicas cotidianas con el Índice de Barthel y las instrumentales con la Escala de Lawton y Brody. Se correlacionaron estas variables y se realizaron pruebas de homogeneidad entre la severidad de la fatiga y variables sociodemográficas y clínicas. Resultados: Se encontró una relación significativa inversamente proporcional entre el grado de severidad de la fatiga y las variables de dependencia para las actividades básicas e instrumentales de la vida diaria (p<0,001). No se evidenció relación significativa entre la severidad de la fatiga con la edad, el sexo y el tiempo de evolución de la esclerosis múltiple (p>0,05). Se encontraron diferencias significativas en el nivel de fatiga respecto al uso de ayudas externas, hipertensión arterial, diabetes mellitus, compromiso motor, trastornos de la sensibilidad, alteraciones del control de esfínteres, deterioro cognitivo y depresión.

Los traumas dentoalveolares constituyen un conjunto de lesiones que comprometen los dientes o a sus estructuras periodontales (producto de impactos violentos, directos o indirectos). Constituyen un problema de salud pública a nivel mundial. Describir la tendencia de la incidencia del traumatismo dentoalveolar según grupos etarios en pacientes Fondo Nacional de Salud  reportados en Atención Primaria en Salud y Centros de Especialidades en Chile durante el periodo 2008-2018. Métodos: La investigación realizada en el presente trabajo es de tipo descriptivo transversal. Fueron calculadas las tasas de incidencia específicas por edad entre los años 2008 hasta 2014 de la Atención Primaria de Salud y estas mismas tasas en los Centros de Especialidad entre los años 2009-2018. Resultados: Los resultados obtenidos nos permiten observar que la tendencia en APS disminuyó de forma progresiva y en Centros de Especialidad aumentó en todos los años, excepto en el rango etario de 20-64 años. En este último caso, el número de años estudiados permitió la estimación de proyecciones de las tasas de incidencia hacia los años 2019-2021, que indican que habría un aumento.

El polimorfismo TLR2 Arg753Gln se determinó utilizando la técnica reacción en cadena de la polimerasa con iniciadores de secuencias específicas.  Resultados: Se observó en el grupo de pacientes con escala SOFA en el rango entre 6-9 una mayor frecuencia de fallecimientos con respecto al grupo de pacientes con escala SOFA en el rango entre 0-5 (OR: 8.5; IC 95%: 2.33-30.90, p= 0,000357). El polimorfismo Arg753Gln del gen TLR2 está ausente en los pacientes con diagnóstico de sepsis.   Conclusión: Se verificó que la escala SOFA es un sistema que permite predecir la mortalidad. La ausencia del polimorfismo Arg753Gln del gen TLR2 en el grupo de pacientes sépticos y una baja frecuencia del mismo en los individuos aparentemente sanos, sugiere la rareza de este polimorfismo en la población venezolana.

A multicase analysis was used (four developed in Colombia and one in Spain) in which 458 people participated in five studies conducted in organizational and community contexts of vulnerable urban and rural areas. The results suggest that PSoC and PE are intertwined processes whose association is accentuated in organizational contexts. However, the relationships between relational context and PSoC and PE vary notably depending on (a) the type of relationship evaluated, (b) the focus of the study (individual/egocentric vs. group/sociocentric) and the type of indicator used to assess the relational context (centrality vs. structural cohesion). Findings are discussed to understand the role that social bonds play in the development of PSoC and in the ability of subjects to empower themselves in different contexts.","This study is derived from the projects cited as follows: Working conditions, commitment to the community and organizational networks in the sector of the cultural industry of Andalusia (Spain).

Reverse logistics (RL) allows for a cost-effective treatment of residual items with environmentally friendly practices. This paper aims to design a RL network for large OTR tires discarded from scattered mining sites, which requires a substantial initial investment in tire downsizing equipment. Therefore, the on-site use of a single shared shredding resource set is proposed with a schedule of visits between mines. Our contribution is a mixed-integer linear programming model set to determine the OTR tires optimal network, including decisions regarding a tire-fuelled power plant location, tire shredding and transport amounts, and a shredding resource set schedule to maximize the profits of the RL network while considering whole waste tire stockpile limits per year. Results showed that the proposed RL network starting from mine shredding tires and supplying a power generation plant might be a profitable solution that could help mines to comply with the legal regulations and turn this waste into a positive economic value good. Environmental and social implications are the mitigation of scrap tires, an increased job demand triggered by power plants, and public health improvement in the vicinity of the mining sites.",,,Waste Management,,,"Costs and Cost Analysis; Programming, Linear",2019-09-20,2019,2019-09-20,2019-12,100,,219-229,Closed,Article,"Oyola-Cervantes, Jorge; Amaya-Mier, René","Oyola-Cervantes, Jorge (Department of Industrial Engineering, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Atlántico 081007, Colombia); Amaya-Mier, René (Department of Industrial Engineering, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Atlántico 081007, Colombia)","Amaya-Mier, René (Universidad del Norte)","Oyola-Cervantes, Jorge (Universidad del Norte); Amaya-Mier, René (Universidad del Norte)",21,8,0.82,1.94,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1121154344,40 Engineering; 4004 Chemical Engineering,

After ABI, nurses assess patients and develop an understanding of their condition by interpreting meaning from physiologic and observational or behavioral cues. These interpretations form the basis for optimizing the timing of discrete nursing interventions; the outcome of which influences the trajectory toward recovery or toward secondary brain injury. The cue-response theory applies specifically for nurses' use to determine which interventions should be used and when those interventions should be carried out. The theory recognizes the knowledge potential and knowledge produced in the context of nursing care of all patients with ABI, not just those with coma, and broadens our understanding of how the timing of nursing interventions directly impacts secondary brain injury and the brain entropy state.",,,Journal of Neuroscience Nursing,,,Adult; Brain Injuries; Cues; Female; Humans; Male; Neuroscience Nursing; Nursing Assessment; Nursing Care; Nursing Theory; Time Factors,2019-02,2019,,2019-02,51,1,43-47,Closed,Article,"Olson, DaiWai M.; Ortega-Pérez, Stefany","Olson, DaiWai M.

Previously, in May 2014, a consensus meeting was held in Barranquilla, Colombia, where the Project for Implementation and Accreditation of Centers of Excellence (CoE) in RA in LA was established, which then became an official special group of the Pan American League of Associations for Rheumatology (PANLAR).
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to define the methodological approach for the accreditation process of CoE in RA in LA.
METHODS: A meeting was held in April 2015 with participation of the members of the REAL-PANLAR Steering Committee, and representatives of several LA countries, with the support of 2 experts in accreditation processes and models in Colombia. Then, in November 2015 in San Francisco and in November 2016 in Washington, the REAL-PANLAR Steering Committee met to discuss some final aspects of the project.
RESULTS: The following steps for accreditation were defined: application for accreditation, issuance of the concept of assessment of the entity, accreditation decision, and monitoring accreditation.

Streptococcus pneumoniae and Legionella pneumophila remain the major etiological agents and are responsible for a significant proportion of CAP mortality. Among diagnostic tests for CAP, urine antigen detection of S. pneumoniae and L. pneumophila is widely accepted due to the simplicity of collection and the rapidity of the test results. Areas covered: This comprehensive review outlines the urinary antigen tests available, discusses their sensitivity and specificity, and assesses the usefulness of their results as the basis for targeted therapy. Expert commentary: There have been advances in urine antigen detection tests for patients with CAP. New methodologies show greater sensitivity, detect S. pneumoniae and L. pneumophila in a single test, and also detect pneumococcal serotypes. In addition, urine antigen detection tests have shown a high specificity, which means that a positive result practically indicates the causative pathogen of CAP. Therefore, a positive result can lead to a targeted therapy that is likely to improve patient outcomes and reduce the risk of resistance and adverse events. However, well-designed studies are needed to evaluate the usefulness of urine antigen detection tests with regard to clinical outcomes.",,This paper was not funded,Expert Review of Anti-infective Therapy,,,"Adult; Anti-Bacterial Agents; Antigens, Bacterial; Community-Acquired Infections; Drug Resistance, Bacterial; Hospitalization; Humans; Legionella pneumophila; Legionnaires' Disease; Pneumonia, Bacterial; Pneumonia, Pneumococcal; Sensitivity and Specificity; Streptococcus pneumoniae",2019-01-09,2019,2019-01-09,2019-02,17,2,107-115,Closed,Article,"Viasus, Diego; Calatayud, Laura; McBrown, María V.; Ardanuy, Carmen; Carratalà, Jordi","Viasus, Diego (Department of Medicine, Health Sciences Division, Universidad del Norte and Hospital Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); Calatayud, Laura (Department of Microbiology, Hospital Universitari de Bellvitge, Instituto de Investigación Biomédica de Bellvitge (IDIBELL), University of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain; Research Network for Respiratory Diseases (CIBERES), Instituto de Salud Carlos III (ISCIII), Madrid, Spain); McBrown, María V.

It subsequently elaborates on the combined application of GIS-based RUSLE, generalized likelihood uncertainty estimation (GLUE) principles and sediment delivery ratio functions (SDR) to quantify ERs at country scale for these countries, as they commonly have limited measurements to that purpose. The methodology, termed RUSLE-GGS (RUSLE-GIS-GLUE-SDR) herein, comprises the following sequence: (1) construction of ER samples using RUSLE-GIS based on freely available local/global geoenvironmental observations and field relations, (2) construction of area-specific sediment yield samples utilizing SDR transfer functions, and (3) assessment of the most behavioral samples by means of bias analysis and cross validation. Its application to Peru allows obtaining 5-km resolution ER and potential erosion maps for the years 1990, 2000, and 2010. RUSLE-GGS is highly replicable and could potentially be used as an initial standard and systematic method to estimate ERs in developing countries through the active participation of local scientists. Thus, it potentially can contribute to improve the capacity building in such countries and set an initial frame to compare the evolution of soil erosion in their territories towards attaining Goal 15 of the UN 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.","This project was funded by CONCYTEC within the framework of the 012-2013-FONDECYT Agreement.

Recent neuroimaging studies suggest that horizontal displacement of brain structures may be more important than vertical displacement in explaining these pupillary findings. Pupillometers allow objective and standardized evaluation of the pupillary light reflex. We hypothesized that pupillary data (Neurological Pupil index [NPi] and constriction velocity [CV]) obtained with a hand-held pupilometer, correlate with horizontal intracranial midline shift in patients with ischemic and hemorrhagic strokes.
METHODS: The ENDPANIC registry is a prospective database of pupillometer readings in neurological patients. There were 134 patients in the database with an acute ischemic stroke or intracerebral hemorrhage who had at least 2 neurologic imaging studies (CT or MRI) and pupillometer assessments performed within 6 hours of the imaging. Horizontal shift of the septum pellucidum (SPS) was measured in 293 images. We computed the correlation between SPS and the following pupillary variables: size, NPi, CV (left, right, and left-right difference), followed by a regression model to control for confounders.
RESULTS: There were 94 patients (70.1%) with an ischemic stroke and 40 patients (29.9%) had an intracerebral hemorrhage. After controlling for age, race, and gender, there was a significant correlation between the SPS and NPi (left [P < .001], right [P < .001]), CV (left [P < .005], right [P < .001]) pupillary asymmetry (absolute difference between right and left; P < .05), but not between SPS and pupillary size (left or right). There was a significant correlation between the NPi and CV for the right pupil when there was a right-to-left SPS (P < .001 and P < .05, respectively), but none between the NPi and CV for the left pupil and left-to-right SPS.

Sowing, cropping, and harvesting are usually treated independently, and waste and the sustainability of operations are generally not integrated into operational planning methodologies for agricultural production. This study shows the need to have a clear and precise methodology to minimize waste in agricultural production systems to ensure sustainability. This need is addressed with a novel methodological guide to minimizing waste in agricultural operations, crop maintenance, and harvesting. The proposed methodology is founded on the use of lean manufacturing as a waste-management tool. Lean manufacturing principles allow agricultural operations and the variables that represent wastes to be identified, mathematical models to be built, constraints to be defined, and the cost of waste to be illustrated, as well as its minimization through an objective function. To guide implementation, we propose a conceptual model to explain the construction of a mathematical model that represents the development of decision variables on agricultural operations with the elements to consider and the constraints and theoretical proposal of the necessary objective function. The proposed conceptual model and the constructed methodology constitute a novel development within agricultural production systems that could be used by decision makers and farmers. © 2019 Society of Chemical Industry.","This work was funded by Departamento del Atlántico and the Colombian Department of Science, Technology and Innovation (Colciencias) through a scholarship from the Program for High‐Level Training (Grant number 673 – 2014).",,Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture,,,"Agriculture; Models, Theoretical; Waste Products",2019-10-24,2019,2019-10-24,2020-01-30,100,2,453-464,Closed,Article,"Solano, Nestor E Caicedo; Llinás, Guisselle A García; Montoya‐Torres, Jairo R","Solano, Nestor E Caicedo (Department of Industrial Engineering, Universidad del Norte, Colombia, Barranquilla, Colombia); Llinás, Guisselle A García (Department of Industrial Engineering, Universidad del Norte, Colombia, Barranquilla, Colombia); Montoya‐Torres, Jairo R (Research Group on Logistics Systems, Faculty of Engineering, Universidad de La Sabana, Chía, Colombia)","Solano, Nestor E Caicedo (Universidad del Norte)","Solano, Nestor E Caicedo (Universidad del Norte); Llinás, Guisselle A García (Universidad del Norte); Montoya‐Torres, Jairo R (University of La Sabana)",24,13,0.36,5.62,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1120862658,40 Engineering; 4014 Manufacturing Engineering,12 Responsible Consumption and Production; 2 Zero Hunger

Perceived health status and HRQL were assessed using parent-reported Kidscreen-10 scores, with excess weight being defined on the basis of body mass index (BMI) using the WHO reference tables (z-BMI > 1 standard deviation), and abdominal obesity being defined on the basis of waist circumference (percentile ≥ 90) using the tables proposed by Fernández et al. Variation in these two parameters at age 6 years was associated with incident cases of suboptimal health by logistic regression, and with HRQL by linear regression.ResultsCompared to children without excess weight or abdominal obesity in both periods, incident cases of excess weight or abdominal obesity had odds ratios (ORs) of suboptimal health of 2.41 (95% CI 1.21 to 4.80) and 2.99 (95% CI 1.31 to 6.84) respectively. In terms of HRQL, children with remission of excess weight had a higher Kidscreen-10 score: β coefficient = 2.02 (95% CI 0.36 to 3.68), whereas new cases of abdominal obesity had a lower Kidscreen-10 score: β = − 2.22 (95% CI − 4.40 to − 0.03).ConclusionsIncident cases of excess weight and abdominal obesity had a higher risk of suboptimal health.

METHODS: Based on the Consensus Development Conference format, a panel of ACCAR rheumatologist voting members (n = 10) took part in this Pan-American League of Associations for Rheumatology initiative. Experts voted from a previous content analysis of the medical literature on CHIK, 4 subsequent topic conferences, and a workshop. Consensus represents the majority agreement (≥80%) achieved for each recommendation.
RESULTS: The experts' panel reached 4 overarching principles: (1) CHIK virus (CHIKV) is a re-emergent virus transmitted by 2 species of mosquitoes: A. aegypti and A. albopictus; (2) CHIKV caused massive outbreaks in LA; (3) chronic CHIKV infection produces an inflammatory joint disease that, in some cases, can last for several months to years, and (4) currently, there are no vaccines or antivirals licensed for CHIKV infections.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Pan-American League of Associations for Rheumatology-ACCAR achieved 13 endorsements and recommendations on CHIK categorized in 3 groups: (1) epidemiology and clinical manifestations, (2) diagnosis, and (3) treatment, representing the consensus agreement from the panel's members.",,,JCR Journal of Clinical Rheumatology,,,"Arthritis, Infectious; Chikungunya Fever; Consensus; Health Policy; Humans; Latin America; Rheumatology; Societies, Medical",2019-03,2019,,2019-03,Publish Ahead of Print,&NA;,&na;,Closed,Article,"Monge, Pablo; Vega, José Manuel; Sapag, Ana María; Moreno, Ilsa; Montúfar, Rubén; Khoury, Vianna; Camilo, Pablo; Rivera, Ruddy; Rueda, Juan C.; Jaramillo-Arroyave, Daniel; Londoño, John; del Carmen Ruiz, María; Fernández, Félix; Quintero, Maritza; Fuentes-Silva, Yurilis; Aguilar, José Luis; Vallejo-Flores, Carlos; Caballero-Uribe, Carlo V.; Sandoval, Hugo; Pineda, Carlos","Monge, Pablo (Hospital México, Caja Costarricense de Seguro Social, Universidad de Costa Rica, San José, Costa Rica;); Vega, José Manuel (Hospital México, Caja Costarricense de Seguro Social, Universidad de Costa Rica, San José, Costa Rica;); Sapag, Ana María (Hospital Universitario Japonés, Santa Cruz, Bolivia;); Moreno, Ilsa (Complejo Hospitalario Dr. Arnulfo Arias Madrid, Caja de Seguro Social, Panamá, Panamá;); Montúfar, Rubén (Instituto Salvadoreño del Seguro Social, San Salvador, El Salvador;); Khoury, Vianna (Clínica Unión Médica, Pontificia Universidad Católica Madre y Maestra, Santiago de los Caballeros, República Dominicana;); Camilo, Pablo (Clínica Corominas, Santiago, República Dominicana;); Rivera, Ruddy (Centro Médico Militar, Guatemala, Guatemala;); Rueda, Juan C.

METHODS: A longitudinal study including 1796 participants from the Madrid region (Spain) with baseline at age 4 years and a follow-up 2 years later. Blood pressure, body mass index and waist circumference were measured during a physical examination. We evaluated the association between obesity at baseline and weight changes between the ages of 4 and 6 years and high blood pressure. Data were analysed using linear and logistic regressions adjusted for covariates.
RESULTS: Obese 4 year olds (general or abdominal obesity) experienced an average 4-5 mmHg increase in systolic blood pressure and a 2.5-3 mmHg increase in diastolic blood pressure by the age of 6 years. Compared to children maintaining a non-excess weight (based on body mass index) during follow-up incident and persistent cases of excess weight (overweight or obesity) had an odds ratio (OR) for high blood pressure of 2.49 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.50-4.13) and OR 2.54 (95% CI 1.27-5.07), respectively. Regarding abdominal obesity we estimated OR 2.81 (95% CI 0.98-8.02) for incident cases and OR 3.42 (95% CI 1.38-8.49) for persistent cases. Similar estimates for the waist-height ratio were observed. Individuals who experienced remission to non-excess weight did not have an increased risk of high blood pressure.
CONCLUSIONS: We observed an increased risk for high blood pressure among 4-year-olds who presented with persistent or incident cases of excess weight (body mass index) or abdominal obesity after 2 years of follow-up. Children with excess weight or obesity at baseline who remitted to non-excess weight did not exhibit an increased risk of high blood pressure.","The authors would like to thank all participating families, the paediatricians from the Network of Sentinel Doctors of the Community of Madrid and the two companies interviewing the families: Demométrica SL and Sondaxe SL.","The author(s) received no financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.",European Journal of Preventive Cardiology,,,"Adiposity; Age Factors; Arterial Pressure; Child; Child, Preschool; Female; Humans; Hypertension; Incidence; Longitudinal Studies; Male; Obesity, Abdominal; Pediatric Obesity; Risk Assessment; Risk Factors; Spain",2019-06-12,2019,2019-06-12,2019-08,26,12,1326-1334,Closed,Article,"Ortiz-Pinto, Maira A; Ortiz-Marrón, Honorato; Ferriz-Vidal, Isabel; Martínez-Rubio, María V; Esteban-Vasallo, María; Ordobás-Gavin, María; Galán, Iñaki","Ortiz-Pinto, Maira A (Centro Nacional de Epidemiología, Instituto de Salud Carlos III, Spain; Departamento de Medicina Preventiva y Salud Pública, Universidad Autónoma de Madrid/IdiPAZ, Spain; Departamento de Salud Pública, Universidad Del Norte, Colombia); Ortiz-Marrón, Honorato (Servicio de Epidemiología, Dirección General de Salud Pública, Madrid, Spain); Ferriz-Vidal, Isabel (Centro de Salud Valdelasfuentes, Consejería de Sanidad, Madrid, Spain); Martínez-Rubio, María V (Centro de Salud los Fresnos, Consejería de Sanidad, Madrid, Spain); Esteban-Vasallo, María (Servicio de Informes de Salud y Estudios, Dirección General de Salud Pública, Madrid, Spain); Ordobás-Gavin, María (Servicio de Epidemiología, Dirección General de Salud Pública, Madrid, Spain); Galán, Iñaki (Centro Nacional de Epidemiología, Instituto de Salud Carlos III, Spain; Departamento de Medicina Preventiva y Salud Pública, Universidad Autónoma de Madrid/IdiPAZ, Spain)","Galán, Iñaki (Centro Nacional de Epidemiología; Autonomous University of Madrid)","Ortiz-Pinto, Maira A (Centro Nacional de Epidemiología; Autonomous University of Madrid; Universidad del Norte); Ortiz-Marrón, Honorato (Generalitat Valenciana); Ferriz-Vidal, Isabel (Centro de Salud Valdelasfuentes, Consejería de Sanidad, Madrid, Spain); Martínez-Rubio, María V (Centro de Salud los Fresnos, Consejería de Sanidad, Madrid, Spain); Esteban-Vasallo, María (Generalitat Valenciana); Ordobás-Gavin, María (Generalitat Valenciana); Galán, Iñaki (Centro Nacional de Epidemiología; Autonomous University of Madrid)",10,2,0.7,4.36,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1117139780,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3201 Cardiovascular Medicine and Haematology,

Sulfonamides 5 and 6 were used as precursors of two new series of chalcones 8a-f and 9a-f, which were obtained through Claisen-Schmidt condensation with aromatic aldehydes 7a-f. Compounds 5/6, 8a-d, 8f, 9a-d, and 9f were screened by the US National Cancer Institute (NCI) at 10 μM against sixty different human cancer cell lines (one-dose trial). Chalcones 8b and 9b satisfied the pre-determined threshold inhibition criteria and were selected for screening at five different concentrations (100, 10, 1.0, 0.1, and 0.01 μM). Compound 8b exhibited remarkable GI50 values ranging from 0.57 to 12.4 μM, with cytotoxic effects being observed in almost all cases, especially against the cell lines K-562 of Leukemia and LOX IMVI of Melanoma with GI50 = 0.57 and 1.28 μM, respectively. Moreover, all compounds were screened against Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv, chalcones 8a-c and 9a-c were the most active showing MIC values between 14 and 42 μM, and interestingly they were devoid of antibacterial activity against Mycobacterium smegmatis and Staphylococcus aureus. These antituberculosis hits showed however low selectivity, being equally inhibitory to M. tuberculosis and mammalian T3T cells. The chalcone-sulfonamide hybrids 8a-f and 9a-f resulted to be appealing cytotoxic agents with significant antituberculosis activity.","The authors thank The Developmental Therapeutics Program (DTP) of the National Cancer Institute of the United States for performing the anticancer screening of the compounds.

Significant differences in fish Hg concentrations were observed across fish foraging guilds and in general, higher trophic level fish (i.e., piscivores and carnivores) showed the highest mean total Hg (THg) concentrations. However, elevated THg concentrations observed in a lower trophic level, detrivorous species highlights the importance of understanding Hg concentrations across a wide range of trophic levels, and also characterizing site-specific processes that influence methylmercury (MeHg) bioavailability. A linear mixed effects model was used to evaluate the effects of length, trophic level, sampling location, and taxonomy on THg concentrations. A positive, significant relationship between THg in fish and fish size, trophic level, and latitude of the sampling site was observed. A comparison of Hg concentrations across all sites identifies biological mercury hotspots, as well as sites with reduced Hg concentrations relative to our overall sampling population mean Hg concentration. Results from this study highlight the value of rapid assessments on the availability of methylmercury in the environment using fish as bioindicators and the need for expanded biomonitoring efforts in understudied regions of the world. This study also provides insights for the future design and implementation of large-scale Hg biomonitoring efforts intended to evaluate the effectiveness of future Hg reduction strategies instituted by the Minamata Convention on Mercury.","We thank the extensive network of dedicated non-governmental organizations that participate in the International POPs Elimination Network (IPEN) around the work who participated in the sample collection for this project.

It comprises toxic gases, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and particulate matter which can reach the pulmonary parenchyma and trigger various diseases, including cancer. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the potential cytotoxic and genotoxic effects of DEE exposure on peripheral blood and buccal epithelial cells in mechanics occupationally exposed to DEE. We recruited 120 exposed mechanics and 100 non-exposed control individuals. Significant differences were observed between the two groups in terms of percentage of tail DNA and damage index (DI) in the alkaline comet assay; levels of biomarkers by cytokinesis-block micronucleus cytome (CBMN-Cyt) assay; frequency of micronucleus (MN), nucleoplasmic bridge (NPB), nuclear bud (NBUD) and apoptotic cells (APOP) and levels of biomarkers for micronucleus, karyorrhexis (KRX), karyolysis (KRL) and condensed chromatin (CC) by the buccal micronucleus cytome (BM-Cyt) assay. A significant and positive correlation was found between the frequency of MN in lymphocytes and buccal cells in the exposed group. Also, there was a significant correlation between age and percentage of tail DNA and DI in the comet assay, APOP and MN in the CBMN-Cyt assay and NBUD and MN in the BM-Cyt assay. Additionally, we found a positive and significant correlation of MN frequency in lymphocytes and buccal cells and age and MN frequency in lymphocytes with the time of service (years). Regarding lifestyle-related factors, a significant correlation was observed between meat and vitamin consumption and NBUD formation on CBMN-Cyt and between meat consumption and MN formation on CBMN-Cyt. Of the BM-Cyt biomarkers, there was a correlation between alcohol consumption and NBUD formation and between binucleated cell (BN), pyknosis (PYC), CC and KRL occurrence and family cancer history. These results are the first data in Colombia on the cytotoxic and genotoxic effects induced by continuous exposure to DEE and thus showed the usefulness of biomarkers of the comet, CBMN-Cyt and BM-Cyt assays for human biomonitoring and evaluation of cancer risk in the exposed populations.","This study was supported by Departamento Administrativo de Ciencia, Tecnología e Innovación-Colciencias, Colombia.

Distracted driving is a primary concern, as it threatens the safety of road users. However very little research has been conducted into interventions to combat such an issue. Existing interventions such as police enforcement and legislation appear to have limited effect. The use of mobile phone applications to assist in limiting driver distraction is an alternative intervention that is currently gaining traction. With a great array of potential benefits, such as reducing road toll, these applications can be readily available to all road users. Despite the positive implications, it is vital that drivers accept the use of such a technology for the intervention to be effective. Therefore, understanding driver acceptance is an important step in implanting such applications. To assess this, the present study examines the utility of two versions of the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), the Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB) and the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) for understanding the acceptance of technology designed to reduce distraction. Participants were presented with two different applications and responded to questions that indicated their attitudes towards the factors included in the TAM, TPB and UTAUT, alongside their intent to use the technology. A total of 731 participants responded to the survey, and their responses analysed. The results indicated that overall, Davis' (1985) TAM was slightly better in explaining behavioural intent for both Mobile Phone Application (MPA) 1 and MPA 2, explaining 66.1% and 68.7% of the variance, respectively. Davis' (1989) TAM and the TPB were close behind, while the UTAUT explained the least variance in behavioural intent of all the models.

Remission and LDA were defined by DAS28-ESR (< 2.6 and ≤ 3.2, respectively). Baseline predictors examined were gender, ethnicity, age at diagnosis, socioeconomic status, symptoms’ duration, DMARDs, RF, thrombocytosis, anemia, morning stiffness, DAS28-ESR (and its components), HAQ-DI, DMARDs and corticosteroid use, and Sharp-VDH score. Multivariable binary logistic regression models (excluding DAS28-ESR components to avoid over adjustment) were derived using a backward selection method (α-level set at 0.05).ResultsFour hundred ninety-eight patients were included. Remission and LDA/remission were met by 19.3% and 32.5% at the 1-year visit, respectively. For the 280 patients followed for 2 years, these outcomes were met by 24.3% and 38.9%, respectively. Predictors of remission at 1 year were a lower DAS28-ESR (OR 1.17; CI 1.07–1.27; p = 0.001) and HAQ-DI (OR 1.48; CI 1.04–2.10; p = 0.028). At 2 years, only DAS28-ESR (OR 1.40; CI 1.17–1.6; p < 0.001) was a predictor. Predictors of LDA/remission at 1 year were DAS28-ESR (OR 1.42; CI 1.26–1.61; p < 0.001), non-use of corticosteroid (OR 1.74; CI 1.11–2.44; p = 0.008), and male gender (OR 1.77; CI 1.2–2.63; p = 0.036). A lower baseline DAS28-ESR (OR 1.45; CI 1.23–1.70; p < 0.001) was the only predictor of LDA/remission at 2 years.ConclusionsA lower disease activity consistently predicted remission and LDA/remission at 1 and 2 years of follow-up in early RA patients from the GLADAR cohort.Key Points• In patients with early RA, a lower disease activity at first visit is a strong clinical predictor of achieving remission and LDA subsequently.• Other clinical predictors of remission and LDA to keep in mind in these patients are male gender, non-use of corticosteroids and low disability at baseline.• Not using corticosteroids at first visit is associated with a lower disease activity and predicts LDA/remission at 1 year in these patients.",To our patients who graciously agreed to participate in this study.,,Clinical Rheumatology,,,"Adrenal Cortex Hormones; Adult; Antirheumatic Agents; Arthritis, Rheumatoid; Female; Humans; Latin America; Longitudinal Studies; Male; Middle Aged; Regression Analysis; Remission Induction; Treatment Outcome",2019-06-03,2019,2019-06-03,2019-10,38,10,2737-2746,Closed,Article,"Gamboa-Cárdenas, Rocio V; Ugarte-Gil, Manuel F.; Loreto, Massardo; Sacnun, Mónica P.; Saurit, Verónica; Cardiel, Mario H.; Soriano, Enrique R.; Pisoni, Cecilia; Galarza-Maldonado, Claudio M.; Rios, Carlos; Radominski, Sebastião C.; Castelar-Pinheiro, Geraldo da R.; Bianchi, Washington Alves; Appenzeller, Simone; da Silveira, Inés Guimarães; de Freitas Zerbini, Cristiano A.; Caballero-Uribe, Carlo V.; Rojas-Villarraga, Adriana; Guibert-Toledano, Marlene; Ballesteros, Francisco; Montufar, Rubén; Vázquez-Mellado, Janitzia; Esquivel-Valerio, Jorge; De La Torre, Ignacio García; Barile-Fabris, Leonor A.; Palezuelos, Fedra Irazoque; Andrade-Ortega, Lilia; Monge, Pablo; Teijeiro, Raquel; Achurra-Castillo, Ángel F.; Esteva Spinetti, María H.; Alarcón, Graciela S.; Pons-Estel, Bernardo A.","Gamboa-Cárdenas, Rocio V (Servicio de Reumatología, Hospital Nacional Guillermo Almenara Irigoyen, EsSalud, Av.

The repercussions on the patients nutritional status are serious and in a pregnant woman have serious implications for the course of gestation, with high risk of intrauterine growth restriction, preterm delivery and even fetal loss; there are symptoms that can be confused with hyperemesis gravidarum delaying the diagnosis. The therapeutic options are medical treatment, endoscopic and surgical interventions; to decide what is the best treatment, we should be taken into account the severity, gestational age and patient conditions. Within the spectrum mentioned in the management include calcium antagonists and nitrates, however these have restrictions in pregnancy, another options are botulinum toxin, endoscopic pneumatic dilation, laparoscopic Heller myotomy and recently POEM. In pregnancy there is a few evidence in the literature and in this moment there are about 40 reported cases, some with complications such as fetal loss and maternal death. We present our experience at the San Ignacio University Hospital in Bogotá, Colombia, with a 26-year-old woman with a novo diagnosis of achalasia type II during the first trimester of pregnancy, with a clinical history of severe dysphagia associated with malnutrition. She was management with enteral nutrition support with nasogastric tube to achieve repletion of the body mass index (BMI) and after that, she had a endoscopic management with Rigiflex balloon dilation. It allowed to successfully carry out pregnancy without adverse effects on the mother or the fetus, with adequate evolution and oral tolerance without dysphagia. We consider that nutritional support is important prior to taking a desicion with this type of patient, in addition that endoscopic management with balloon dilation can be safe and effective for the management of achalasia in pregnancy.",,,Revista de Gastroenterología del Perú,,,"Adult; Body Mass Index; Combined Modality Therapy; Deglutition Disorders; Dilatation; Enteral Nutrition; Esophageal Achalasia; Esophagoscopy; Female; Humans; Intubation, Gastrointestinal; Malnutrition; Manometry; Pregnancy; Pregnancy Complications",2019,2019,,2019,39,1,70-73,Closed,Article,"Lora Acuña, Fabian; Parra Izquierdo, Viviana; Espinosa, Carlos; Ordoñez Blanco, Tatiana; Puentes Leal, Gerardo; Costa Barney, Valeria; Roa Ballestas, Paola; Hani de Ardila, Albis","Lora Acuña, Fabian (Unidad de Gastroenterología, Hospital Universidad del Norte.

4765,pub.1123197660,10.1093/hmg/ddz298,31875875,,Mutant huntingtin interacts with the sterol regulatory element-binding proteins and impairs their nuclear import,"Brain cholesterol homeostasis is altered in Huntington's disease (HD), a neurodegenerative disorder caused by the expansion of a CAG nucleotide repeat in the HTT gene. Genes involved in the synthesis of cholesterol and fatty acids were shown to be downregulated shortly after the expression of mutant huntingtin (mHTT) in inducible HD cells. Nuclear levels of the transcription factors that regulate lipid biogenesis, the sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBP1 and SREBP2), were found to be decreased in HD models compared to wild-type, but the underlying causes were not known. SREBPs are synthesized as inactive endoplasmic reticulum-localized precursors. Their mature forms (mSREBPs) are generated upon transport of the SREBP precursors to the Golgi and proteolytic cleavage, and are rapidly imported into the nucleus by binding to importin β. We show that, although SREBP2 processing into mSREBP2 is not affected in YAC128 HD mice, mSREBP2 is mislocalized to the cytoplasm. Chimeric mSREBP2-and mSREBP1-EGFP proteins are also mislocalized to the cytoplasm in immortalized striatal cells expressing mHTT, in YAC128 neurons and in fibroblasts from HD patients. We further show that mHTT binds to the SREBP2/importin β complex required for nuclear import and sequesters it in the cytoplasm. As a result, HD cells fail to upregulate cholesterogenic genes under sterol-depleted conditions. These findings provide mechanistic insight into the downregulation of genes involved in the synthesis of cholesterol and fatty acids in HD models, and have potential implications for other pathways modulated by SREBPs, including autophagy and excitotoxicity.","This work was supported by grants from the Canadian Institutes for Health Research (CIHR MOP 111219) and from the Huntington Society of Canada to SS.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: May Measurement Month is a cross-sectional survey that follows the directives of the International Society of Hypertension and the World Hypertension League, which gathers information on cardiovascular risk factors and blood pressure readings. Its implementation in Colombia was lead by the Santander Ophthalmological Foundation (FOSCAL) and the Latin American Society of Hypertension (LASH) with the support of the Colombian Network for the Prevention of Cardiovascular Diseases and Diabetes (RECARDI).
RESULTS: Data was collected from 11 departments on 21,797 people, 58.7% of whom were female, with an average age of 40.5±17.7 years. The overall prevalence of high blood pressure (HBP) was 20.8% (self-reported antihypertensive treatment or systolic blood pressure reading [systolic blood pressure≥140mmHg]). Of the total number of hypertensives, 46.5% had systolic blood pressure readings classified as uncontrolled (systolic blood pressure<140mmHg), and 26.4% were unaware that they were hypertensive who, in this report, we consider to be new cases of HBP.
CONCLUSION: The prevalence of (elevated) blood pressure is high in this young adult population, whose lack of awareness of HBP is also high, and HBP in those aware of their condition is poorly controlled. These results highlight the need to implement effective detection programmes for hypertensive patients and to establish standardised treatments to improve HBP control as a strategy to reduce cardiovascular events.","Queremos expresar nuestro agradecimiento al Subcomité formado por ISH y WHL por su apoyo técnico, estrategia de difusión y promoción de las actividades.

Major epidemics occurred only after ZIKV emerged in the Pacific islands and spread to the Americas. Specific biological determinants of the explosive epidemic nature of ZIKV have not been identified. Phylogenetic studies revealed incongruence in ZIKV placement in relation to Aedes-borne dengue viruses (DENV) and Culex-borne flaviviruses. We hypothesized that this incongruence reflects interspecies recombination resulting in ZIKV evasion of cross-protective T-cell immunity. We investigated ZIKV phylogenetic incongruence in relation to: DENV T-cell epitope maps experimentally identified ex vivo, published B-cell epitope loci, and CD8+ T-cell epitopes predicted in silico for mosquito-borne flaviviruses. Our findings demonstrate that the ZIKV proteome is a hybrid of Aedes-borne DENV proteins interspersed amongst Culex-borne flavivirus proteins derived through independent interspecies recombination events. These analyses infer that DENV-associated proteins in the ZIKV hybrid proteome generated immunodominant human B-cell responses, whereas ZIKV recombinant derived Culex-borne flavivirus-associated proteins generated immunodominant CD8+ and/or CD4+ T-cell responses. In silico CD8+ T-cell epitope ZIKV cross-reactive prediction analyses verified this observation. We propose that by acquiring cytotoxic T-cell epitope-rich regions from Culex-borne flaviviruses, ZIKV evaded DENV-generated T-cell immune cross-protection. Thus, Culex-borne flaviviruses, including West Nile virus and Japanese encephalitis virus, might induce cross-protective T-cell responses against ZIKV. This would explain why explosive ZIKV epidemics occurred in DENV-endemic regions of Micronesia, Polynesia and the Americas where Culex-borne flavivirus outbreaks are infrequent and why ZIKV did not cause major epidemics in Asia where Culex-borne flaviviruses are widespread.",Declaration of competing interest No potential conflict of interest was reported by the authors.,"This work was designed, initiated, conducted and financially supported through ZikaPLAN Project number 734584 by the European Commission under Horizon 2020 funding.

Studies from around the world have shown that the rates of burnout appear to be high. It is also well recognized that individuals with mental illnesses frequently avoid seeking help for fear of stigma, affecting their careers and being rejected or treated differently by their peers, or due to the perception that they will be deemed unfit for practice or rejected from their preferred specialty. Students who are open about their mental health conditions are often ostracized by their own peers and dismissed or even mistreated by teachers who consider mental 'toughness' to be a requirement for success in the medical arena. The impact of socioeconomic conditions cannot be under-estimated. We carried out a survey of mental health and wellbeing of medical students in the National University of Asuncion. A sample of 180 students across different years showed that 21% had sought help and 4% had been diagnosed with a mental condition before entering medical school; 3% had been previously diagnosed with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder or Autism Spectrum Disorders; 14% currently consult with a health professional specifically about their mental health; and 8% reported currently taking medication for their mental health. The most common medication was Escitalopram at 21%, followed by Sertraline with 11%. Various sources of stress were identified, all of which were noted to be concerning four specific domains: financial difficulties, familial issues, housing issues, and difficulties surrounding studies. Of these students, 20% were CAGE positive and 9.4% reported using substances to feel better. These findings indicate that medical students need better support to ensure that they function better.

In Colombia, of 13.871 confirmed cases of TB in 2016 (prevalence of 0,028%) 14% correspond to HIV co-infection. However, we have scarce information regarding genetic diversity of strains infecting HIV patients. In this study, we carried-out an active search of cases of TB in 356 HIV-infected individuals, who were enrolled in two Public Hospitals at Bogotá-Colombia, between 2014 and 2015. We found 49 patients with HIV-TB co-infection. Genetic characterization of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) isolates from these patients showed a predominance of three major sub-lineages: Haarlem (n = 26), LAM (n = 12) and T (n = 11). Remarkably, the most predominant pattern in the present study (SIT62/H1, n = 11) is very specific to this country. Indeed, taking in account distribution in countries with at least 3% of SIT62/H1, 36% of all such patterns collected worldwide were from Colombia. Furthermore, Colombia alone is responsible for almost all the SIT62/H1 strains in South America, suggesting a successful transmission of this genotype inside TB/HIV population from Colombia.","To the people responsible for the HIV and Tuberculosis programs of the Hospital Santa Clara and Simón Bolivar, for their love, respect and help during the process of taking samples.

The structure and morphology of the nanoparticles were characterized by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), N2 adsorption study, UV-Vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy, inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy and Raman spectroscopy. The lightly doped Zn1-xCuxO photocatalysts consisted in a novel nanorods structure of Zn0.9990Cu0.0010O nanoparticles. Taking the photocatalytic degradation of diuron under solar light as liquid phase test reaction, the lightly doped Zn0.9990Cu0.0010O nanorods photocatalysts showed strongly enhanced photocatalytic activity when compared to the bare ZnO counterpart. The apparent rate constant value of Zn0.9990Cu0.0010O was 22 times higher than that of pure ZnO. In order to study the environmental risk of Cu-ZnO, clams Ruditapes decussatus were exposed to Cu-ZnOC1 = 0.5 mg/L, Cu-ZnOC2 = 1 mg/L and Cu-ZnO C3 = 5 mg/L. Catalase (CAT) activities, malondialdehyde (MDA) content and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity were determined in gills and digestive gland of treated and untreated clams. Thus, no significant effects were detected in the gills of exposed clams after 7 days compared to control. Thus, MDA level and CAT activity showed significant differences in digestive glands of groups treated by the highest concentration of Cu-ZnO NPs compared to the control. No adverse effects on AChE activity was detected after Cu-ZnO NPs exposure. These results demonstrated that, although Cu-ZnO NPs is not acutely toxic to Ruditapes decussatus, it does exert oxidative stress on clams. These results are encouraging for the Cu-ZnO NPs use in variety of applications due to its high photocatalytic and low environmental toxicity.",,Authors gratefully acknowledge the support of the Ministry of Higher Education and Scientific Research of Tunisia.,Environmental Technology,,,Animals; Catalysis; Gills; Metal Nanoparticles; Nanotubes; X-Ray Diffraction; Zinc Oxide,2019-06-03,2019,2019-06-03,2020-12-18,41,28,3745-3755,Closed,Article,"Fkiri, Anis; Wiem, Saidani; Sellami, Badreddine; Saidani, Mohamed Ali; Khazri, Abdelhafidh; Smiri, Leila-Samia","Fkiri, Anis (Lab of Hetero-Organic Compounds and Nanostructured Materials (LR18ES11), Faculty of Sciences of Bizerte, University of Carthage, Zarzouna, Tunisia); Wiem, Saidani (Laboratoire de Biosurveillance de l’Environnement (LBE), Unité d’Ecotoxicologie et d’Ecologie Côtière (GREEC), Faculté des Sciences de Bizerte Universté de Carthage, Zarzouna-Bizerte, Tunisia); Sellami, Badreddine (Institut National des Sciences et Technologies de la Mer, Tabarka, Tunisia); Saidani, Mohamed Ali (Lab of Hetero-Organic Compounds and Nanostructured Materials (LR18ES11), Faculty of Sciences of Bizerte, University of Carthage, Zarzouna, Tunisia); Khazri, Abdelhafidh (Laboratoire de Biosurveillance de l’Environnement (LBE), Unité d’Ecotoxicologie et d’Ecologie Côtière (GREEC), Faculté des Sciences de Bizerte Universté de Carthage, Zarzouna-Bizerte, Tunisia); Smiri, Leila-Samia (Lab of Hetero-Organic Compounds and Nanostructured Materials (LR18ES11), Faculty of Sciences of Bizerte, University of Carthage, Zarzouna, Tunisia)","Khazri, Abdelhafidh (University of Carthage)","Fkiri, Anis (University of Carthage); Wiem, Saidani (University of Carthage); Sellami, Badreddine (Institut National des Sciences et Technologies de la Mer); Saidani, Mohamed Ali (University of Carthage); Khazri, Abdelhafidh (University of Carthage); Smiri, Leila-Samia (University of Carthage)",5,3,0.23,0.7,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1114226581,40 Engineering; 4018 Nanotechnology; 41 Environmental Sciences; 4103 Environmental Biotechnology,

We analyze through a recently mathematical model proposed in the literature, necessary conditions for aggregation of tumor cells and macrophages. In order to do so, we prove the possibility of having blow-up in finite time. Next, we study if the aggregation of macrophages can occur when having a low density of tumor cells, and vice versa. With this purpose, we consider the problem of analyzing the existence or not of a simultaneous blow-up. We achieve this goal thanks to a novel process that allows us to compare the entropy functional associated with the density of each population, which turns out to be also a method to find enough conditions for having a simultaneous blow-up.","The author gratefully acknowledges to Ph.D. Matthias Piesche, Facultad de Medicina, Universidad Católica del Maule, for his important comments for contextualize adequately in cancer progression the mathematical system studied in this work.

METHODS: A multi-ethnic, multi-national Latin American SLE cohort was studied. Serious infection was defined as one that required hospitalization, occurred during a hospitalization or led to death. Potential predictors included were sociodemographic factors, clinical manifestations (per organ involved, lymphopenia and leukopenia, independently) and previous infections at baseline. Disease activity (SLEDAI), damage (SLICC/ACR Damage Index), non-serious infections, glucocorticoids, antimalarials (users and non-users), and immunosuppressive drugs use; the last six variables were examined as time-dependent covariates. Cox regression models were used to evaluate the predictors of serious infections using a backward elimination procedure. Univariable and multivariable analyses were performed.
RESULTS: Of the 1243 patients included, 1116 (89.8%) were female. The median (interquartile range) age at diagnosis and follow-up time were 27 (20-37) years and 47.8 (17.9-68.6) months, respectively. The incidence rate of serious infections was 3.8 cases per 100 person-years. Antimalarial use (hazard ratio: 0.69; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.48-0.99; p = 0.0440) was protective, while doses of prednisone >15 and ≤60 mg/day (hazard ratio: 4.18; 95 %CI: 1.69-10.31; p = 0.0019) and >60 mg/day (hazard ratio: 4.71; 95% CI: 1.35-16.49; p = 0.0153), use of methylprednisolone pulses (hazard ratio: 1.53; 95% CI: 1.10-2.13; p = 0.0124), increase in disease activity (hazard ratio: 1.03; 95% CI: 1.01-1.04; p = 0.0016) and damage accrual (hazard ratio: 1.22; 95% CI: 1.11-1.34; p < 0.0001) were predictive factors of serious infections.
CONCLUSIONS: Over time, prednisone doses higher than 15 mg/day, use of methylprednisolone pulses, increase in disease activity and damage accrual were predictive of infections, whereas antimalarial use was protective against them in SLE patients.","We are grateful to Daniel Villalba and Leonardo Grasso for providing expert assistance with the ARTHROS (version 6.0) software.

METHODS: A descriptive, cross-sectional, multicenter study was conducted. The participants were female health professionals (N = 794) working within the Spanish Public Health System. The instrument used was Delgado, Aguar, Castellano, and Luna del Castillo's (2006) scale to measure ill-treatment of women.
RESULTS: Two hundred seventy women suffered IPV (34%). Of the female health professionals who suffered IPV, 25.9% had spoken with someone about the violence, most commonly talking to trusted people (24.3%), a psychologist (24.3%), health professionals (20%), and others (20%). Married female health professionals living with their current or last partner/husband, residing in an urban area, and with their own salary were least likely to speak about their problem.
CONCLUSION: Female health professionals who suffer IPV usually speak about this problem with trusted people instead of consulting a health professional, which may leave the problem in the private sphere. This can be because of victims not wanting to report the violence for fear of their intimate partner or wanting it to remain private. This may deprive the victims of the help they need. For this reason, the health services should establish screening for IPV not only for their patients but also for their workers.",,,Journal of Forensic Nursing,,,Communication; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Health Personnel; Humans; Interpersonal Relations; Intimate Partner Violence; Marital Status; Spain; Urban Population,2019-01,2019,,2019-01,15,1,9-17,Closed,Article,"Carmona-Torres, Juan Manuel; Cobo-Cuenca, Ana Isabel; Recio-Andrade, Beatriz; Dios-Guerra, Caridad; Lopez-Soto, Pablo Jesús; Hidalgo-Lopezosa, Pedro; Rodríguez-Borrego, María Aurora","Carmona-Torres, Juan Manuel (E.U.

Thus, newer educational strategies that facilitate learning while also stimulating students by allowing increased student autonomy and group discussions should be carefully considered. This study aimed to evaluate the impact of introducing team-based learning (TBL) in the traditional discipline of neuroanatomy and to measure student knowledge acquisition and perception relative to traditional lectures (TL). A quasi-experimental, nonrandomized study was performed using two consecutive TBL classes (intervention group, n = 157 students, 25% content using TBL) with a TL class (control group, n = 76). Team-based learning sessions included all stages according to the classic description of the method. Student knowledge acquisition was assessed in regularly scheduled tests during the discipline, and their perception regarding TBL was evaluated using a questionnaire (developed by the authors). The groups presented a similar sociodemographic profile (sex and age) and the same performance in another anatomy discipline before the study. Team-based learning was significantly associated with greater acceptance, higher motivation, better student perception, and feelings that the methodology was able to integrate clinical and basic sciences. Nevertheless, according to tests, knowledge acquisition was similar between the TBL and lectures. In conclusion, since TBL is comparable to TL for knowledge acquisition, TBL seems to be a promising strategy to improve the teaching of neuroanatomy in medical schools. It fosters group discussions and increases satisfaction and the perception of integration between clinical and basic sciences.","Acknowledgments The authors would like to acknowledge the faculty development program of the Foundation for Advancement of International Medical Education and Research, FAIMER Regional Institute—Brazil for supporting this study.

3330,pub.1119944835,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.133651,31756797,,Spatio-temporal analysis of leptospirosis incidence and its relationship with hydroclimatic indicators in northeastern Argentina,"Leptospirosis is considered the most globally widespread zoonotic illness; it has been classified as an emerging or reemerging infectious disease by the World Health Organization. Leptospirosis is a disease caused by a pathogenic spirochete of the genus Leptospira. The infection occurs by contacting with the urine of animal reservoirs or contaminated environments. Leptospirosis can be controlled by vaccines used mainly in animals, antibiotics given to exposed humans, and flood-affected people moved to a safe place. Northeastern Argentina accounts for the highest annual number of cases and deaths due to leptospirosis of the country. This interdisciplinary study aims to analyze the spatial and temporal distribution of leptospirosis, and assesses the hydroclimatic factors that give rise to the outbreaks in northeastern Argentina. The main goal is to detect the hydroclimatic indicators that can influence leptospirosis outbreaks occurrence in the northeastern Argentina. We perform a spatio-temporal analysis of the leptospirosis in the provinces of Santa Fe and Entre Ríos to distinguish the regions, years and seasons with the highest incidence of this disease. This study analyzes confirmed cases of leptospirosis between 2009 and 2018 years. Hydroclimatic indicators (monthly total precipitation, monthly river hydrometric level and Oceanic Niño Index) associated with outbreaks of leptospirosis vary in different spatial scales (provincial, departmental and cities). In the last outbreak of leptospirosis in 2015-2016 the number of cases was lower than expected. This could have been a consequence of increased prophylaxis in that flood event. Therefore, this is a variable that should be incorporated in future studies.","Funding for this study was provided through PIO (CONICET-UNER), Argentina code 14620140100011CO and SECTeI, Argentina “Government of Santa Fe Province” code 2010-056-14. The data of leptospirosis were granted by The Provincial Directorate for Health Promotion and Prevention, Ministry of Health of Santa Fe province, the Ministry of Health of Entre Ríos province, and data hydro-climatic by National Meteorological Service of Argentina (SMN), National Water Institute (INA) and Argentine Naval Prefecture (PNA).

ECMs derived from various organs are used to produce biological scaffolds comparable to the native microenvironment. Although placentas are often overlooked, they offer a rich ECM for tissue engineering, especially the hemochorial placentas from rodents and lagomorphs that resemble the ones from humans.
METHODS: Here we established a protocol for decellularization and investigated the ECM in native and decellularized placentas of guinea pigs, rats and rabbits by means of histology, immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence and scanning electron microscopy.
RESULTS: Effective decellularization were achieved by immersion in 0.25% Sodium Dodecyl Sulfate for 3 days, resulting in an intact ECM, while cells or nuclei were absent. All species had a high diversity of ECM components that varied between areas.
DISCUSSION: Dense fibrous networks in the junctional zone were strongly positive to collagen I, III and IV, fibronectin, and laminin ECM markers. Noticeable response were also found for the decidua, especially along the maternal vessels. The labyrinth had thin fibers strongly positive for fibronectin and laminin, but not much for collagens. In conclusion, we established an effective protocol to obtain biological scaffolds from animal models with hemochorial placentas that possessed promising values for future purposes in Regenerative Medicine.","We warmly thank Karl Klisch, University of Zürich/Switzerland for discussions and providing ECM antibodies.

METHODS: Seventy-four subjects were included, 39 with COPD (age 69±7 years; female 41%) and 35 for control group (age 69±7 years; female 43%). They were diagnosed with MetS and allocated in one of 4 subgroups: COPD and control, with and without MetS, respectively. Advanced oxidation protein products (AOPP), paraoxonase-1, catalase activity, sulfhydryl group and total lipid hydroperoxide were assayed. Pulmonary function was performed with a plethysmograph.
RESULTS: COPD severity (GOLD≥3) and pulmonary function were associated with sulfhydryl group and AOPP (P≤.03 for all). The prevalence of MetS was associated with AOPP in COPD (P=.04). Individuals with COPD and MetS showed higher AOPP compared to COPD without MetS (P<.0001).

Our objective is to carry out a comparative study of the expression of MMPs and TIMP-3 in previous negative biopsies and radical prostatectomies (RP).
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Retrospective analysis of a hospital-based cohort including 21 patients with suspicion of prostate carcinoma, whose expressions of MMP-2, 9, 11 and 13 and TIMP-3 were evaluated by immunohistochemistry in the tumor area from previous negative biopsies and RP.
RESULTS: Immunohistochemical staining values (Score) for MMPs (-11 and -13) and TIMP-3 showed no significant differences when comparing the areas of negative biopsies where tumors subsequently developed with those of the RP. However, we did observe a significant difference in the increased expression of MMP-2 (P=.002) and MMP-9 (P=.001) in the tumor area of the RP with respect to the corresponding area of the previous negative biopsy.

The WEO was injected into the aged asphalt-binder as three rejuvenators, namely A, B, and C — with Rejuvenator A being the treated WEO only. Rejuvenator B consists of treated WEO and furfural extraction oil. Rejuvenator C consists of Rejuvenator B composition plus epoxy resin. The asphalt-binder physical, ductility, rheological, and morphological properties were measured using the standard penetration, softening point, ductility, dynamic shear rheometer, bending beam rheometer, and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy tests, respectively. Overall, the laboratory test results, with Rejuvenator C exhibiting superiority, indicated that, if properly preprocessed and treated with additive modifications, WEO can be beneficially used to rejuvenate short-term aged asphalt-binders, which can be a significant milestone towards “green” asphalt and environmental conservatism.","This research work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 51508427), the Natural Science Foundation funded by Wuhan Institute of Technology (Grant No. K201721), and the Science and Technology Project of Department of Transportation of Hubei Province (Nos. 2018-422-1-14 and 2016-600-1-12).

MATERIAL AND METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted in 402 students included through non-probabilistic sampling who answered an anonymous and self-reporting questionnaire that included socio-demographic variables, academic performance (last semester overall grade), presence of IA (Young's Test) and covariates related to IA based on academic performance. Data were analysed by means of proportions, relationships between variables with the χ2 test and strength of association was estimated with odds ratios (OR) using nominal logistic regression.
RESULTS: Approximately 24.63% of the students used the Internet much less than the average population, but 75.3% had IA; 73.13% of cases were considered mild and 2.24% moderate. There were no severe cases. Around 5.2% had poor academic performance. In multivariate analysis, the model that best explained IA in relation to academic performance was: studying in lower-level courses (OR=0.54; 95% CI, 0.32-0.91); studying in a different places of the house (OR=3.38; 95% CI, 1.71-6.68); not using laptop for studying (OR=0.41; 95% CI, 0.19-0.89), chatting on mobile phone (OR=2.43; 95% CI, 1.45-3.06); and spending more than 18 minutes on mobile phone while studying (OR=3.20; 95% CI, 1.71-5.99).
CONCLUSIONS: Academic performance was not associated with AI. However, studying in lower-level courses, in a different place of the house, not using laptop to study, and spending more than 18minutes answering their mobile phone and chatting on mobile phone while studying were covariates statistically associated with IA.","A Yheila Figueroa Angulo, Iveth Orellano Badillo y Ana María Zapata por su colaboración en el estudio.",,Revista Colombiana de Psiquiatría (English ed ),,,"Academic Performance; Adolescent; Adult; Behavior, Addictive; Cell Phone; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Humans; Internet; Male; Students, Dental; Surveys and Questionnaires; Time Factors; Young Adult",2019-10,2019,,2019-10,48,4,198-207,Closed,Article,"Cárdenas, Shyrley Díaz; Vergara, Katherine Arrieta; Simancas-Pallares, Miguel","Cárdenas, Shyrley Díaz (Departamento de Odontología Preventiva y Social, Facultad de Odontología, Universidad de Cartagena, Cartagena, Colombia); Vergara, Katherine Arrieta (Departamento de Odontología Preventiva y Social, Facultad de Odontología, Universidad de Cartagena, Cartagena, Colombia); Simancas-Pallares, Miguel (Departamento de Investigaciones, Facultad de Odontología, Universidad de Cartagena, Cartagena, Colombia)","Cárdenas, Shyrley Díaz (University of Cartagena)","Cárdenas, Shyrley Díaz (University of Cartagena); Vergara, Katherine Arrieta (University of Cartagena); Simancas-Pallares, Miguel (University of Cartagena)",8,1,0.75,2.97,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1122869416,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3203 Dentistry,

Harvesting energy from roadways is one promising solution towards meeting both of these demands. Energy harvesting technology has the potential to supply sustainable electrical power for roadways, especially in remote areas. In this study, the feasibility of harvesting electrical power using electromagnetic technology was explored in the laboratory. A prototype electromagnetic speed-bump energy (ESE) harvester was developed to simultaneously function both as a speed control device and energy generator, respectively. The prototype ESE captures passing vehicles’ induced strain energy and generate power. Experimental tests were performed by simulating traffic conditions to evaluate the power generating potential of the prototype. The maximum power achieved in experiments was 16.5 W, which suggested a promising potential to generate substantial power output. A feasibility study on implementing the prototype ESE in low-volume roadways was also analytically evaluated, with approximately 22 kWh of energy generated daily. The negative impacts of the ESE on the roadway are envisioned to be outweighed by the high potential for contributing to safety improvements in terms of vehicle speed control and reducing accidents, particularly in remote and/or high-risk areas such as school zones.","The authors would like to acknowledge the financial support from CPS Energy and the Tran-SET Regional University Transportation Center for this research study.

As part of an effort towards designing optimal performing pavements, this study was undertaken to evaluate, characterize, and quantify the effects of moisture and temperature variations on UAB and subgrade materials commonly used in Minnesota. The scope included analyses of subsurface moisture and temperature measurements and characterization of moisture variation in multiple instrumented pavement sections. Key findings indicated that dense-graded aggregate base materials with high quality crushed aggregates and lower fine particles were more resistant to seasonal moisture variations. By contrast, the subbase and subgrade materials exhibited considerable sensitivity to seasonal moisture variations. The subgrade layers, in particular, were found to operate in fully saturated conditions for more than half of their service life. Overall, the study results are a valuable contribution to establishing guidelines for laboratory testing and designing optimal performing pavement structures.","The authors gratefully acknowledge Benjamin Worel, John Siekmeier, Greg Johnson, Leonard Palek, David Van Deusen, and Michael Vrtis for assisting in gathering the data used in this study, as well as for reviewing and providing valuable insight to the manuscript.

The standard HMA pass-fail screening criterion under the current HWTT protocol is 12.5 mm rutting at 50°C. However, Texas has experienced record high summer temperatures in the recent years (i.e., over 122°F), and several rutting failures have occurred in the field with some surface HMA mixes that had passed the HWTT in the laboratory. These failures occurred mostly in high shear-stress locations, in particular with slow moving (accelerating/decelerating) traffic at controlled highway intersections, stop-go sections, in areas of elevated temperatures, heavy/high traffic loading, and/or where lower performance grade (PG) of asphalt binders have been used. This laboratory hybrid study was thus initiated to explore new data analysis methods and introduce new alternative rutting parameters to supplement the traditional HWTT pass-fail screening criteria (≤ 12.5 mm rut depth at 50°C) for surface HMA mixes. Several HMA mixes commonly used in Texas were evaluated in the laboratory and new HWTT analysis parameters, such as the rutting area (ΔA), the normalized rutting area (RutΔ), and the shape factor (SF) with the potential to capture the HMA rutting path-history, were formulated. In addition, a comparison between the newly formulated and traditional rutting parameters with field performance observations was conducted and yielded plausible results in terms of predicting the early-life rutting performance of HMA mixes.","The authors thank the Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT) and the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) for their financial support of this research work and all those who helped during the course of this research work and documentation of this paper.

The scope of work included SPST sensitivity evaluation in the laboratory with respect to test temperature and HMA mix-design volumetric variables such as the asphalt-binder type and asphalt-binder content, respectively. The corresponding laboratory test results were then validated against field performance data through correlations of the measured HMA shear properties (shear strength) to actual rutting measured in the field. Based on extensive laboratory testing of commonly used Texas coarse-, dense-, and fine-graded mixes (with different mix-design characteristics/combinations), it was found that the SPST is reasonably sensitive to test temperatures and the HMA mix-design volumetric parameters that were investigated in the study. The HMA shear strength generally exhibited a decreasing trend with an increase in the test temperature and asphalt-binder content, respectively. However, as the Performance Grade (PG) of the asphalt-binder increased, so did the HMA shear strength. With respect to SPST field validation, the HMA shear strength measured from the SPST correlated well with the field HMA rutting performance, exhibiting higher rutting resistance (i.e., low rut depths) for mixes with higher HMA shear strength and vice versa. Overall, based on the study findings, the SPST was found to be a viable surrogate laboratory test method for routinely measuring and quantifying the HMA shear properties for predicting field rutting performance.","Declaration of Competing Interest None declared.

However, the overall impact of better facilities may vary with socio-demographic and attitudinal characteristics of potential cyclists. Using a sample of university students in the city of Barranquilla, Colombia, this paper examines the role that these characteristics have on prospective bicyclists’ monetary valuation of this kind of infrastructure, measured as the willingness to pay (WTP) for a dedicated bikeway. Two attitudinal factors: environmental friendliness and Pro-Car attitude were integrated into the WTP model as latent variables (LV), and address the question of whether these factors help to better explain the WTP. It was found that including the LVs did not add significant explanatory power to the WTP model. The results suggest that travel distance, expenditure, the undergraduate program and the current mode of transport are the most important variables influencing the WTP of university students for a bikeway.",The article is not based on any conference paper.,,Transportation,,,,2019-05-29,2019,2019-05-29,2020-10,47,5,2267-2286,Closed,Article,"Cantillo, Tatiana; Vargas, Andrés; Cantillo, Víctor; Ramos, José","Cantillo, Tatiana (Department of Economics, Universidad del Norte, Km 5 Vía a Puerto Colombia, Barranquilla, Colombia); Vargas, Andrés (Department of Economics, Universidad del Norte, Km 5 Vía a Puerto Colombia, Barranquilla, Colombia); Cantillo, Víctor (Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Universidad del Norte, Km 5 Vía a Puerto Colombia, Barranquilla, Colombia); Ramos, José (Department of Economics, Universidad del Norte, Km 5 Vía a Puerto Colombia, Barranquilla, Colombia)","Cantillo, Víctor (Universidad del Norte)","Cantillo, Tatiana (Universidad del Norte); Vargas, Andrés (Universidad del Norte); Cantillo, Víctor (Universidad del Norte); Ramos, José (Universidad del Norte)",5,2,,1.39,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1115976891,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3509 Transportation, Logistics and Supply Chains",

Long Range (LoRa) is one of these technologies, which is less susceptible to noise and interference. This technology operates in unlicensed bands, increasing the chances of having interfering devices in the communication link. The issue of LoRa jamming with external interference and the effect of such interference in radio range has not been addressed in the literature. Therefore, tests measured packet loss, received signal strength, and signal-to-noise ratio with one end node located kilometers away from a gateway. Data were measured with and without external interference, to establish system robustness. This article computes an empirical model of the immunity region, where the level of interference does not affect LoRa communication. Results show that LoRa devices required interference levels up to 14 dBm to have total packet losses. These results are relevant for implementing LoRa systems, motivating researches to perform site surveys of interference and to account for range reduction in network design.",,,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,,,,2019-12-30,2019,2019-12-30,2020-04-01,7,4,2806-2815,Closed,Article,"Marquez, Luz E.; Osorio, Alfonso; Calle, Maria; Velez, Juan C.; Serrano, Antonio; Candelo-Becerra, John E.","Marquez, Luz E.

Seven conformational isomers, three of them presenting intramolecular hydrogen bonds, have been located. Thermochemical functions have been computed, and relative energies and free enthalpies have been determined in gas and aqueous phases. Several molecular properties have been calculated to predict the ability of aspirin to acylate cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes. A six‐membered‐ring hydrogen‐bonded conformer was found to be the most reactive species.

The aim of this article were the (i) estimation of missing observations time-series with intervention analysis, (ii) adjustment and selection of the best model, and (iii) forecast model for the PM10 concentrations in the study area. Data was used for testing the SARIMA model (mathematical model for Seasonal Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average) in order to forecast PM10 levels considering the time-series intervention analysis. This model was used for missing data intervention, as well. Moreover, a methodology was developed based on the assignment of extreme data and missing observations. Short-term forecasts, for the year 2018, were made from the modified SARIMA model and validated with monthly data of PM10 of the same year. The overall errors, measured by means of Root of the Mean Square Error (RMSE), was found to be almost zero.

It was found that Cu x Zn(1−x)O is ferromagnetic for both the closest and farthest impurity distances, but it is more stable energetically for the closest one. For all concentrations we obtained nearly half − metallic behavior. The calculations show that two substitutional Cu atoms introduce a magnetic moment of about 2.0 μ B for all dopant concentrations. The results indicate that the magnetic ground state originates from the strong hybridization between the 3d-Cu and 2p-O states, and suggest that the ferromagnetism could be governed by interactions between cluster spins in the CuO4 tetrahedra. The U eff for Cu0.042Zn0.958O was calculated using the approach of Cococcioni and co-workers.

Using molecular dynamics simulations, in this paper, we study crack propagation under mode I. Single crystals and bicrystals aluminum (Al) with different initial edge crack lengths were loaded until failure under controlled deformation. The effect of the grain boundary on the fracture toughness was analyzed. Tearing was observed and investigated in Al bicrystals. A novel methodology is proposed to estimate the fracture toughness in terms of J for Al single crystals and bicrystals. J was computed by means of three different methods, viz., J Contour Integral, Energy Release Rate, and Crack Tip Opening Displacement. Fracture toughness ( J C ) for bicrystal was 445% higher than for single crystal. J C for the single crystal was approximately 3 J/m2 and 13 J/m2 for the bicrystal. Comparison between first tearing in Al bicrystals and failure in single crystals was performed. Finally, it was evidenced that for Al bicrystals ductile fracture occurred during final fracture and the grain boundary had a large effect on the mechanical behavior of Al bicrystals.","Acknowledgements W.

This process was studied from a theoretical approach by the survey of the generated electronic excited states, after photoexcitation of the most abundant anthocyanin of the extract, i.e. delphinidin-3,5-diglucoside. It was determinated that the adiabatic energy of the optimized T1(πH-1 → πL*) state was 1.55 eV and that the overall energy transfer releases ∼0.58 eV in an exothermic process.

The subjectivity associated with the scale can result in different PSR values for the same pavement section. In this paper, we use multivariate data analysis to identify potential groups of users sharing similar perceptions on the condition of urban roads. We conducted a survey of 137 drivers of different modalities (bus, car, taxi, truck) after they had driven over some selected road sections in Barranquilla, Colombia. The survey included socioeconomic questions and a rating questionnaire containing a list of statements related to the ride quality and the acceptance of possible pavement defects. The study included 115 urban road sections with different pavement surfaces and geometric characteristics (e.g. slopes, lane width). We used factor analysis to identify two distinct user latent preferences while driving over urban roads. Then, we applied cluster analysis on the latent preferences. Results suggest a possible classification for surveyed participants into (a) those wanting more infrastructure investment to guarantee an excellent ride quality, and (b) those who are more tolerant toward pavement surfaces in poor condition. We found significant differences in the mean rate of acceptance of urban roads within groups, suggesting that more experienced drivers tend to be more sensitive when riding over pavements in poor condition. Ignoring these differences in the preference of raters could lead to biased results when evaluating the level of pavement serviceability in urban contexts.","This research was conducted with the support of the ‘Jóvenes Investigadores e Innovadores’ Program of Colciencias through the agreement from 0739 - 2013, Universidad del Norte and the research group TRANVIA.

Methane Number (MN) measurements of these mixtures were performed by using a method analogous to the standard method for Octane Number (ON) measurement. The experimental MNs ranged from 46.0 to 139.1 according to experimental data. These results are compared with the MNs calculated by programs released for natural gas MN estimations. A comparative analysis concluded that these programs are not suitable to calculate MN of syngas. A method to isolate the effect of carbon dioxide on the autoignition tendency of binary mixtures of hydrogen and carbon monoxide is proposed. Results reveal that increments of carbon dioxide concentration in the mixtures, exponentially increase the MN of the mixtures. At low carbon dioxide concentration, the MN of the ternary mixtures can be approximated by the MN of their equivalent binary mixtures of hydrogen and carbon monoxide. Based on this observation, the MNs of coal gases reported in the literature are estimated.","The authors would like to acknowledge the support granted by the Departamento Administrativo de Ciencia, Tecnologia e Innovacion (COLCIENCIAS), the Universidad del Norte and the Engines and Energy Conversion Laboratory at Colorado State University.",,Fuel,,,,2019-01,2019,,2019-01,236,,535-543,Closed,Article,"Diaz, German J.

Such effort is relevant considering the increasing interest of national agencies in applying recycled aggregates for construction and rehabilitation (C&R) of highway infrastructures. The study used site-specific data from two different aggregate production plants, stationary and mobile, both located in the northern region of Colombia. The stationary facility produces NA, and the mobile plant processes a combination of NA and RCA from the demolition of Portland cement concrete (PCC) pavements in the city of Barranquilla. The aggregates produced in the stationary facility are generally used as road base and subbase materials, and in the production of PCC, whereas the recycled mobile plant produces aggregate for subbase and road base mainly. Two scenarios were contemplated in the study. The first scenario involved extraction, hauling, and processing of NA. The second scenario involved aggregate (limestone) extraction, hauling, and recycling of RCA, and finally processing the combination of NA with RCA. The environmental impacts related to the production process of both stationary and mobile plants were evaluated using the computer program SimaPro 8.4.0 and the impact assessment method IMPACT 2002

1778,pub.1119922545,10.1088/1361-6463/ab360a,,,Thickness dependence of anomalous Hall conductivity in L10-FePt thin film,"L10 ordered alloys are ideal models for studying the anomalous Hall effect (AHE), which can be used to distinguish the origin from intrinsic (from band structure) or from extrinsic effects (from impurity scatterings). In the bulk limit of L10 ordered FePt films, the AHE is considered to be dominated by the intrinsic contribution, which mainly comes from the strong spin–orbit interaction (SOI) of Pt atoms and exchange-splitting of Fe atoms. The study of anomalous Hall conductivity (AHC) of L10-FePt thin films is of particular interest for its application in spintronic devices. In order to reduce the effects of defects such as grain boundaries, we chose SrTiO3 as the substrate, which has a very small mismatch (0.1%) with L10-FePt films to obtain high quality continuous thin films. We show that the contribution from phonon scattering should be included to fully interpret the AHE signals. For our 6 nm FePt film, the AHE mainly originates from the contribution of phonon scattering. While for the thicker films, the origin for AHE is mainly intrinsic Berry curvature contribution. Both experimental results and calculation results show that AHC increases with thickness and reaches the saturation when the film thickness approaches a critical value.","This work is supported by the Singapore National Research Foundation under CRP Award NRF-CRP10-2012-02, Singapore Ministry of Education under MOE2018-T2-2-043, AMEIRG18-0022 and A*STAR IAF-ICP 11801E0036.",,Journal of Physics D,,,,2019-08-12,2019,2019-08-12,2019-10-23,52,43,43lt02,Closed,Article,"Yu, Jihang; González-Hernández, Rafael; Liu, Liang; Deng, Jinyu; Yoong, Herng Yau; Wang, Han; Lin, Weinan; Liu, Hongxi; Poh, Francis; Sinova, Jairo; Chen, Jingsheng","Yu, Jihang (Department of Materials Science and Engineering, National University of Singapore, Singapore 117575, Singapore; GLOBALFOUNDRIES Singapore Pte Ltd, Singapore 738406, Singapore); González-Hernández, Rafael (Institut für Physik, Johannes Gutenberg Universität Mainz, D-55099 Mainz, Germany; Departament of Physics, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia; Grupo de Investigacion en Fisica Aplicada, Departamento de Fisica, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); Liu, Liang (Department of Materials Science and Engineering, National University of Singapore, Singapore 117575, Singapore); Deng, Jinyu (Department of Materials Science and Engineering, National University of Singapore, Singapore 117575, Singapore); Yoong, Herng Yau (Department of Materials Science and Engineering, National University of Singapore, Singapore 117575, Singapore); Wang, Han (Department of Materials Science and Engineering, National University of Singapore, Singapore 117575, Singapore); Lin, Weinan (Department of Materials Science and Engineering, National University of Singapore, Singapore 117575, Singapore); Liu, Hongxi (GLOBALFOUNDRIES Singapore Pte Ltd, Singapore 738406, Singapore); Poh, Francis (GLOBALFOUNDRIES Singapore Pte Ltd, Singapore 738406, Singapore); Sinova, Jairo (); Chen, Jingsheng ()",,"Yu, Jihang (National University of Singapore; GlobalFoundries (Singapore)); González-Hernández, Rafael (Johannes Gutenberg University Mainz; Universidad del Norte; Universidad del Norte); Liu, Liang (National University of Singapore); Deng, Jinyu (National University of Singapore); Yoong, Herng Yau (National University of Singapore); Wang, Han (National University of Singapore); Lin, Weinan (National University of Singapore); Liu, Hongxi (GlobalFoundries (Singapore)); Poh, Francis (GlobalFoundries (Singapore)); Sinova, Jairo (); Chen, Jingsheng ()",5,1,,1.16,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1119922545,51 Physical Sciences; 5104 Condensed Matter Physics,

Specifically, the authors estimate the potential changes in inventory and fleet purchase decisions under a set of policies designed to improve the environmental efficiency of transport activities, through a reduction of overall transportation emissions; and requirements for a fleet mix to include zero and near-zero emission vehicle technologies, or, minimum vehicle type shares. The work introduces a constrained stochastic multi-objective joint replenishment problem (S-MJRP) to evaluate the policies while considering logistics costs and emissions as objectives. Moreover, the authors developed a solution algorithm and conducted empirical analyses. The results highlight the trade-off between capital investments in zero-emission vehicles and the logistics costs required to abide by the requirements of the mentioned regulatory policies.

Not having an adequate action plan implies high evacuation times that can put lives at risk. Usually, people do not follow the safety signs during unsafe conditions; they react unexpectedly due to the panic and the anxiety to quickly evacuate the place. The evacuation plans commonly indicate a specific exit route and do not consider the possibility of proposing alternative routes in case of blockages or high congestion. This research aims to design an evacuation plan considering aspects of pedestrian behaviour and multiple routing strategies. A combined agent-based discrete choice modelling approach was chosen to represent the heterogeneity in people’s behaviour and the interaction between them and the environment. The proposed evacuation plan incorporates specific signalling to encourage people taking alternatives routes when given paths are congested. The new plan also highlights the necessity to create new emergency exits and to modify the current structure of the building.",,,Safety Science,,,,2019-03,2019,,2019-03,113,,276-284,Closed,Article,"Rozo, Kelly Rendón; Arellana, Julian; Santander-Mercado, Alcides; Jubiz-Diaz, Maria","Rozo, Kelly Rendón (Universidad del Norte, Km 5 Via a Puerto Colombia, Barranquilla, Colombia); Arellana, Julian (Universidad del Norte, Km 5 Via a Puerto Colombia, Barranquilla, Colombia); Santander-Mercado, Alcides (Universidad del Norte, Km 5 Via a Puerto Colombia, Barranquilla, Colombia); Jubiz-Diaz, Maria (Universidad del Norte, Km 5 Via a Puerto Colombia, Barranquilla, Colombia)","Arellana, Julian (Universidad del Norte)","Rozo, Kelly Rendón (Universidad del Norte); Arellana, Julian (Universidad del Norte); Santander-Mercado, Alcides (Universidad del Norte); Jubiz-Diaz, Maria (Universidad del Norte)",90,30,,19.75,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1110509317,40 Engineering; 4005 Civil Engineering,11 Sustainable Cities and Communities

Simulation is used in the classroom as an effective way of connecting students to real-life scenarios and tasks. In foreign language teaching, simulations are used to develop students’ communicative competences through authentic tasks and activities. In content classes, simulations generally work to develop students’ professional competences related to the area of study. In Global Simulation, an entire course is transformed into a simulated world in which students take on real-life roles and responsibilities. This type of simulation makes it possible for students to develop both communicative and professional competencies simultaneously in a meaningful learning environment.
                  Aim. This article focuses on presenting a Global Simulation carried out in an English for Health Sciences course that could be adapted to any English course for the Health Sciences area, especially those with students who will have contact with the community (e.g., Nursing, Medicine, Public Health, among others).
                  Method. Immersed in a simulation of a center for disease control and health promotion, English for Health Sciences students are organized in teams of 5-6 with each student assigned a specific role within the team and center. Each team receives a total of three cases they must address through the design and implementation of an educational health campaign which is carried out within an authentic community. A survey was used at the end of the simulation to evaluate students’ perceptions and experience.
                  Results and Conclusion. Overall, students’ perceptions were positive. Responses to the survey showed students find the simulation relevant and pertinent to their field of study and authentic in terms of the tasks and activities carried out. Likewise, they highlight development of professional competences and advantages to this type of English as a Foreign Language course as compared to a more traditional, teacher-centered approach, emphasizing improvement in their communicative competences, particularly in oral skills.",,"Funding The authors received no financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.",Simulation & Gaming,,,,2019-08-27,2019,2019-08-27,2019-12,50,6,725-753,Closed,Article,"Perez, Yuddy; Poole, Paige","Perez, Yuddy (Universidad del Norte, Colombia); Poole, Paige (Universidad del Norte, Colombia)","Poole, Paige (Universidad del Norte)","Perez, Yuddy (Universidad del Norte); Poole, Paige (Universidad del Norte)",4,3,,2.82,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1120665935,"39 Education; 3901 Curriculum and Pedagogy; 42 Health Sciences; 47 Language, Communication and Culture; 4704 Linguistics",

The anthocyanin-rich extract (dye) was obtained from V. meridionale berries through percolation method using an ethanol:water mixture (1:3), in a 2:1 ratio of solvent:sample. Furthermore, the pH effect on stability of V. meridionale extract was studied. Chemical characterizations were carried out by high-performance liquid chromatography with diode array detection (HPLC-DAD), UV–vis spectrophotometry and electrochemistry impedance spectroscopy (EIS). After the anthocyanin identification, sensitization process was performed on TiO2 thin films. Finally, the electronic structure of each anthocyanin found in the extract (cyanidin-3-galactoside and cyanidin-3-arabinoside) and their interaction with a slab model of TiO2 and the UV–vis absorption spectra simulations were investigated by means of the density functional theory (DFT). Results showed that (i) cyanidin-3-galactoside and cyanidin-3-arabinoside were the main anthocyanins that constituted the hydro-ethanol extract (40% and 38%, respectively) and the total anthocyanin content equivalent to delphinidin chloride (TAEDC) per mL of extract was 48 ± 5 μg TAEDC/mL; (ii) the measurements by EIS indicated that sensitization process reduced the resistance for charge transfer from 933 Ω for TiO2 until 308 Ω for TiO2/sensitizer and (iii) the computational studies showed that delphinidin-3-pentoside had largest value of Eads (-53.62 kcal mol−1) for the bidentate mononuclear anchorage mode, besides the anchorage to TiO2 induced a red shift of the low-lying absorption band and an increase in their intensities respect to the free dyes, but the compositions of the transitions in terms of its nature and the involved molecular orbitals remained identical without involving of the glycoside motifs. All results suggested that the natural dye (anthocyanin-rich extract) from V. meridionale berries has a high potential to be used as sensitizer for TiO2.","The authors would like to thank Universidad del Atlántico (Séptima convocatoria interna para fortalecimiento a grupos de investigación de la Universidad del Atlántico – 2016).

The alternative consists of a hybrid model comprising an NLT panel connected in series with a forced-based fiber-beam–column model through a rigid elastic beam element (HyNLT-F model). The HyNLT-F approach saves computational time as compared to the default NLT model while keeping the capabilities of modeling inelastic shear response and shear–flexure interaction under static cyclic or dynamic loading. These capabilities are first validated for the default NLT model using the experimental test data of two RC-wall panels subjected to reversed cyclic loading, one whose response is flexure-dominated and another with a shear–predominant behavior. The numerically computed lateral force–displacement relationships, lateral displacement contributions, shear–flexure interaction, and vertical strain distribution at different levels of drift demand show a good agreement with the experimentally recorded responses. The hybrid alternative is then validated using three RC-wall panel experiments with high (hw/lw = 3.1), moderate (hw/lw = 2.3) and low aspect ratio (hw/lw = 1.5). The capabilities of the hybridization are evaluated at the global and local level of  response, as well as in terms of computational time needed to run the model in comparison with the default NLT model. As an application, a HyNLT-F model is implemented in a multistory non-ductile RC frame-wall structure, to evaluate the impact of the nonlinear shear response at the critical section in the global structural behavior under static and dynamic loading. The results show that the HyNLT-F can model features of the wall response such as inelastic shear and shear–flexure interaction at the critical section, which of interest for certain structural typologies.","Funding for the Universidad del Norte team was provided by CEER—Colombian Earthquake Engineering Research Network through Universidad del Norte, Universidad Militar Nueva Granada, Universidad EIA, Universidad de Medellín through research project INV-ING-2743.",,Bulletin of Earthquake Engineering,,,,2019-07-11,2019,2019-07-11,2019-12,17,12,6437-6462,Closed,Article,"Arteta, Carlos A.; Araújo, Gustavo A.; Torregroza, Andrés M.; Martínez, Andrés F.; Lu, Yuan","Arteta, Carlos A.

These parameters were estimated through an alternative method that uses the average engine indicator diagram and the first derivative concept. The tests were conducted in a 2 kW Cooperative Fuel Research Engine (CFR) wherein the effect of inlet pressure on KOCA was also studied. To evaluate these effects, a factorial design of experiment and an one-factor Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) were conducted. According to the statistical analysis the evaluated engine operating conditions significantly influence the combustion parameters; however, the analysis revealed that the inlet pressure does not influence KOCA. Moreover, validated empirical correlations to estimate KOCA, Δ θ CD and Critical Compression Ratio (CCR) as a function of engine operating conditions were proposed. It was demonstrated that actual Mass Fraction Burned (MFB) curves can be fitted with a = 2.8 and m = 2.4 which are the so-called efficiency and form factors of the Wiebe function, respectively. These values for hydrogen and methane mixtures are different from the values widely used for conventional fuels, i.e. a = 5.0 and m = 2.0. In the present study, the compression polytropic coefficients as a function of engine operating conditions were reported and were found to be ranging from 1.21 to1.25.","The authors would like to acknowledge the support granted by the Departamento Administrativo de Ciencia, Tecnologia e Innovacion (COLCIENCIAS), the Universidad del Norte and the Energy Conversion Laboratory of the Mechanical Engineering Department, Colorado State University.",,Energy Conversion and Management,,,,2019-02,2019,,2019-02,181,,414-424,Closed,Article,"Diaz, German J.

Regarding functionality, the use of modules is common to generate flexible platforms to manufacture products and product families that require functional variations. In the current globalized market, the mass individualization or personalization is the preferred production model that delivers cost-effectiveness and satisfaction at the level of the market of one. In this model, the modularity is employed as a powerful concept applied not only for the manufacture but also for the use and final disposal stages, in which the design of modules provides functionalities and features that satisfy a variety of specifications for different market segments. Despite the existence of approaches in modularity and its usefulness in product development, it is possible to identify a lack of analysis of modular and open architecture to enhance the sustainability performance of products regarding strategies to diminish adverse impacts during their lifecycle. This paper provides an analysis of the influence and potential of Modular Architecture Principles – MAPs in the sustainable design of open architecture products. Additionally, lifecycle considerations are analysed to identify and propose strategies that enforce the sustainability performance of products concerning personalization from early design stages Abbreviations: MAPs: Modular Architecture Principles; FMS: Flexible Manufacturing System; RMS: Reconfigurable Manufacturing System; EOL: End Of Life; LCA: Life Cycle Assessment; QFD: Quality Function Deployment; DFMA: Design For Manufacturing And Assembly",,This work was supported by COLCIENCIAS through the Ph.D. National Scholarship Program No 617-2.

Governments and international organizations responded by encouraging women to delay pregnancy and also by surveying their domestic spaces and water management practices. Feminist scholars and activists criticized these measures as ignoring barriers to quality reproductive health services and women’s particular vulnerabilities to climate change, as the virus was soon associated with global warming. This article critically analyzes the unequal and differentiated position of women during the 2015–2016 Zika outbreak. Through the concept of the Zika assemblage, we discuss how populationist interventions upon women’s bodies also involved particular representations of these bodies within different spaces and scales, from the household to the local and the global. We consider the geographical imaginaries and realities that shaped the identities and bodies of those women, as well as their connections with geopolitical notions of security and emergency. In this way, we expose how impoverished women from the Global South ended up bearing the responsibility to maintain an international epidemiological order. The article concludes with a reflection on the dissonance between populationist interventions and the root causes of climate change and environmental injustice.",We thank the editors of this themed section and the anonymous reviewers for their insightful comments and recommendations which greatly improved the manuscript.,,Gender Place & Culture,,,,2019-03-05,2019,2019-03-05,2020-03-03,27,3,412-428,Closed,Article,"Rivera-Amarillo, Claudia; Camargo, Alejandro","Rivera-Amarillo, Claudia (Department of Anthropology, Pontificia Universidad Javeriana, Bogotá, Colombia); Camargo, Alejandro (Department of History and Social Sciences, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia, ;)","Camargo, Alejandro (Universidad del Norte)","Rivera-Amarillo, Claudia (Pontificia Universidad Javeriana); Camargo, Alejandro (Universidad del Norte)",11,5,,3.08,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1112568236,44 Human Society; 4406 Human Geography,3 Good Health and Well Being

The level of physical workload may create stress, fatigue and injuries. Therefore, activity monitoring provides valuable information for companies in assessing and solving possible hazards in the workplace. The article presents a system using wearable technology to monitor and evaluate physical workload with in situ measurements. The system uses a smartwatch and a mobile application for Android phones. During workload monitoring, the application displays physiologic variables such as heart rate, calories, body temperature, galvanic skin response and number of steps. Additionally, the system computes absolute and relative cardiac cost, and Frimat coefficients.

The method works as follows: among iterations, samples are taken about the current solution by using, for instance, a Normal distribution; for all samples, gradients are computed (approximated) in order to build reduced-spaces onto which descent directions of cost functions are estimated. By using such directions, intermediate solutions are updated. The overall process is repeated until some stopping criterion is satisfied. The convergence of the proposed method is theoretically proven by using classic assumptions in the line search context. Experimental tests are performed by using well-known benchmark optimization problems and a non-linear data assimilation problem. The results reveal that, as the number of sample points increase, gradient norms go faster towards zero and even more, in the data assimilation context, error norms are decreased by several order of magnitudes with regard to prior errors when the assimilation step is performed by means of the proposed formulation.","This work was supported by the Applied Math and Computer Science Laboratory at Universidad del Norte in Barranquilla, Colombia.",,Applied Mathematics and Computation,,,,2019-01,2019,,2019-01,341,,15-30,Closed,Article,"Nino-Ruiz, Elias D.; Ardila, Carlos; Estrada, Jesus; Capacho, Jose","Nino-Ruiz, Elias D.

A dynamic performance characterization is performed to assess the cell transient response to input variables. The model used in the simulation considers three different phenomena: mass transfer, thermodynamics, and electrochemistry. The main sources of voltage loss are presented: activation, electrical resistance, and concentration. The model is constructed to avoid the use of fitted parameters, reducing the experimentation required for its validation. Hence, the electrochemical model is parameterized by physical variables, including material properties and geometrical characteristics. The model is demonstrated as a test-bed for PEMFC control system design and evaluation. Results demonstrate that the steady-state and dynamic behavior of the system are represented accurately. A case study is included to show the functionality of the model. In the case study, the effect of the purge valves at the fuel cell discharges is analyzed under different scenarios. Regular purges of the cathode and the anode are shown to achieve a good performance in the system avoiding reactant starvation in the cell. A closed-loop dynamic response is included as an example of the model capabilities for the design of fuel cell control strategies. Two variables were selected to be controlled: voltage and pressure difference across the membrane. A multivariate control strategy was tested and its dynamic response was analyzed. It was found that there was a strong interaction between the control loops, making the control of the system a challenge.",,,Journal of Electrochemical Energy Conversion and Storage,,,,2019-03-13,2019,2019-03-13,2019-08-01,16,3,,Closed,Article,"Fontalvo, Victor M.; Nelson, George J.; Gomez, Humberto A.; Sanjuan, Marco E.","Fontalvo, Victor M.

To prevent and strengthen preparedness for the occurrence of such situations, having available relief supplies in the short-term becomes crucial. The lack of access to life-sustaining items implies a loss in people's welfare, treated as an externality called deprivation costs which must be incorporated into decision-making processes. Since typical humanitarian applications are extensions of commercial logistic models, they usually do not account for externalities, leading to high social costs and likely to unfeasible or suboptimal solutions. This paper develops a facility location model for prepositioning supplies in preparation for disasters; the key feature of this formulation being the fact that it explicitly considers deprivation costs in the objective function. The model attempts to minimize the global social costs, as the sum of both private costs (i.e. costs of transportation, inventory costs and fixed costs of facilities) and deprivation costs, determining the amount per type of product to be prepositioned for serving the areas affected by a disaster during the initial response. The model focuses on those assistance interventions that should be carried out immediately, i.e. within the first 24 h of a humanitarian crisis. We applied the model, using real information, to the Colombian Caribbean region, which was affected by floods in 2010 and 2011. Results demonstrate that deprivation costs represent more than 50% of the total social cost.","The authors wish to thank the program PEER-NSF for supporting this research through funding the project “Integrated humanitarian logistics system for developing countries” (PGA-2000003441), and to Colciencias (Cod 1215-675-47211 and 1215-669-46846).",,Socio-Economic Planning Sciences,,,,2019-03,2019,,2019-03,65,,89-100,Closed,Article,"Cotes, Nathalie; Cantillo, Victor","Cotes, Nathalie (Universidad del Norte, Km5 Via Pto., Colombia, Barranquilla, Colombia); Cantillo, Victor (Universidad del Norte, Km5 Via Pto., Colombia, Barranquilla, Colombia)","Cantillo, Victor (Universidad del Norte)","Cotes, Nathalie (Universidad del Norte); Cantillo, Victor (Universidad del Norte)",71,26,,31.03,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1101406647,33 Built Environment and Design; 3304 Urban and Regional Planning; 44 Human Society; 4404 Development Studies; 49 Mathematical Sciences; 4901 Applied Mathematics,

The structural organization that confers the function of LBPs and BPIs is very similar, however, they are antagonistic to each other. In this work, we characterized two LBP/BPIs from the scallop Argopecten purpuratus, namely ApLBP/BPI1 and ApLBP/BPI2. The molecular and phylogenetic analyses of ApLBP/BPIs indicated that both isoforms display classic characteristics of LBP/BPIs from other invertebrates. Additionally, ApLBP/BPIs are constitutively expressed in scallop tissues and their transcript expression is upregulated in hemocytes and gills in response to an immune challenge. However, some structural characteristics of functional importance for the biological activity of these molecules, such as the net charge differ substantially between ApLBP/BPI1 and ApLBP/BPI2. Furthermore, each isoform displays a specific profile of basal expression among different tissues, as well as specific patterns of expression during the activation of the immune response. Results suggest that functional specialization of ApLBP/BPIs might happen, with potential role as LBP or BPI in this species of scallop. Further research on the biological activities of ApLBP/BPIs are necessary to elucidate their participation in the scallop immune response.",We thank German Lira for all his support with scallop maintenance and procurement.

This paper reviews the Walkability Index (WI) literature of the last decade (2009–2018) and highlights some limitations in the current approaches. Only a few studies have evaluated walkability in Latin America, mainly in big cities but not in medium and small-sized cities in the region, which present their own urbanisation dynamics, security issues, sidewalk invasion problems, and poor planning. Furthermore, most WIs in the literature use objective mesoscale variables to assess walkability in a given area. This paper contributes to filling these gaps by generating new evidence from a medium-sized city in Latin America to question if characteristics of the built environment encourage walking trips, as found in the literature, are transferable among regions. The study also proposes a novel index comprised of microscale and mesoscale built environment variables to assess walkability using virtual tools and considering users’ perceptions. The WI estimation relies on ranking probability models. The results of the case study suggest that subjective Security and Traffic Safety are the most crucial factors influencing walkability in these kind of cities, which is different from what is found in the literature from cities in developed countries where Sidewalk Condition and Attractiveness are the most important factors. Security appeared to be strongly associated with a subjective dimension, represented by the fear of crime or perceived risk for crime, instead of the actual occurrence of crimes. This result evidences the importance of the physical attributes of the real world and how they are captured, judged, and processed by pedestrians. Then, regional transferability of WIs needs to be done carefully. Finally, results in this paper highlight the importance of microscale built environment characteristics in the WI formulation in these cities. Results are in line with other research in some cities of the region, which found that microscale variables such as pavement quality and presence of obstacles on the sidewalks are relevant components to promote walkability.",,,Transport Reviews,,,,2019-12-23,2019,2019-12-23,2020-03-03,40,2,183-203,Closed,Article,"Arellana, Julian; Saltarín, María; Larrañaga, Ana Margarita; Alvarez, Vilma; Henao, César Augusto","Arellana, Julian (Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); Saltarín, María (Department of Industrial Engineering, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); Larrañaga, Ana Margarita (Industrial and Transportation Engineering Department, Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul, Porto Alegre, Brazil); Alvarez, Vilma (Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); Henao, César Augusto (Department of Industrial Engineering, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia)","Arellana, Julian (Universidad del Norte)","Arellana, Julian (Universidad del Norte); Saltarín, María (Universidad del Norte); Larrañaga, Ana Margarita (Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul); Alvarez, Vilma (Universidad del Norte); Henao, César Augusto (Universidad del Norte)",157,77,,44.98,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1123610300,33 Built Environment and Design; 3304 Urban and Regional Planning,

For highly concentrated solar tower systems, any transients in the incoming energy will be amplified and are likely to have a significant impact on its operation. This paper demonstrates the dynamic performance of a closed-loop aiming strategy to maintain the receiver’s operation when undergoing transients in solar radiation without exceeding the temperature constraints caused by thermal stresses and material corrosion considerations. A Gemasolar-like solar receiver sub-system is modelled in a detailed fashion but with simplifications to minimise computational time. The proposed aiming strategy using a modified Dynamic Matrix Control (DMC) algorithm is implemented in the model, and partially shading of heliostat field is simulated using the biomimetic approach for modelling cloud passage. The simulation performed shows the robustness of the aiming strategy to appropriately handle the incident flux transients on the solar external receiver caused by different intermittent cloud passage characteristics. The techniques implemented in this paper can be a useful tool in the design phase to anticipate consequences for the receiver when subject to regular or subtle DNI transients.","The authors wish to acknowledge the support received for this research from CSIRO and from COLCIENCIAS, Doctoral Scholarship Program 727-2015, Universidad del Norte.",,Applied Thermal Engineering,,,,2019-05,2019,,2019-05,154,,686-698,Closed,Article,"Too, Yen Chean Soo; García, Jesús; Padilla, Ricardo Vasquez; Kim, Jin-Soo; Sanjuan, Marco","Too, Yen Chean Soo (CSIRO Energy Centre, Mayfield West, NSW 2304, Australia); García, Jesús (Department of Mechanical Engineering, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); Padilla, Ricardo Vasquez (School of Environment, Science and Engineering, Southern Cross University, Lismore, NSW 2480, Australia); Kim, Jin-Soo (CSIRO Energy Centre, Mayfield West, NSW 2304, Australia); Sanjuan, Marco (Department of Mechanical Engineering, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia)","Too, Yen Chean Soo (CSIRO Energy Centre, Mayfield West, NSW 2304, Australia)","Too, Yen Chean Soo (CSIRO Energy Centre, Mayfield West, NSW 2304, Australia); García, Jesús (Universidad del Norte); Padilla, Ricardo Vasquez (Southern Cross University); Kim, Jin-Soo (CSIRO Energy Centre, Mayfield West, NSW 2304, Australia); Sanjuan, Marco (Universidad del Norte)",22,11,,3.62,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1112876552,40 Engineering; 4012 Fluid Mechanics and Thermal Engineering; 4017 Mechanical Engineering,7 Affordable and Clean Energy

The main scope of our method is to avoid the intrinsic needed of adjoint models in the four-dimensional context. As it is well known, in practice, adjoint models can be labor-intensive to develop and computationally expensive to run. We avoid the use of adjoint models by taking snapshots of an ensemble of model realizations at observation times. Then, we employ a modified Cholesky decomposition on those ensembles to build control spaces, which in turn are employed to estimate analysis increments and to mitigate the impact of sampling noise. We discuss a matrix-free implementation of our 4D-EnKF formulation via the Woodbury matrix identity. Experimental tests are performed by using the Lorenz 96 model and an atmospheric general circulation model. The numerical results reveal that the accuracy of our proposed filter implementation outperforms those of traditional 4D-EnKF formulations in terms of L-2 error norms and root-mean-square error values.","This work was supported in part by award UN 2018-38 and by the Applied Math and Computer Science Lab at Universidad del Norte, Colombia.",,Nonlinear Dynamics,,,,2019-12-11,2019,2019-12-11,2020-02,99,3,2441-2457,Closed,Article,"Nino-Ruiz, Elias D.; Guzman-Reyes, Luis G.; Beltran-Arrieta, Rolando","Nino-Ruiz, Elias D.

The specimens include one isolated but nearly complete scale from the anterior region of the body, and one isolated scale fragment. Although fragmentary, these specimens provide relevant anatomic and biogeographical information. Both specimens agree in most details with the type material of A. rancii; however, the almost complete scale differs in focus position and outline, thus suggesting topological variation. This aspect of lepidosis in A. rancii was previously unknown and could be relevant for future reassessment of the interrelationships of this taxon. The presence of A. rancii in the middle to late Miocene fossil assemblages from La Venta, Fitzcarrald, and Acre suggests a relationship between these areas during the middle Miocene. The relevance for paleodrainage evolution in northern South America is discussed in the context of these findings.","GAB was funded through a doctoral scholarship (process 2014/ 11558-5) a BEPE internship (process 2016/02253-1), and a thematic project (process 2016/19075-9) by the Fundao de Amparo Pesquisa do Estado de So Paulo (FAPESP), and the Bhlke endowment of the Academy of Natural Sciences of Drexel University.

1641,pub.1123435900,10.1111/geb.13047,,,The biotic interactions hypothesis partially explains bird species turnover along a lowland Neotropical precipitation gradient,"Abstract  Aim We evaluated the influence of climate on the structure of bird communities along precipitation gradients. We hypothesize that mechanisms responsible for community turnover along precipitation gradients are similar to mechanisms operating along temperature and latitudinal gradients. We tested the hypothesis that environmental conditions affect community composition in dry forests, whereas biotic interactions affect community composition in wet forests.   Location Low‐elevation forests along a precipitation gradient in Colombia where precipitation ranges from 700–4,000 mm annually but elevation and temperature remain constant.   Time period Present day.   Major taxa studied Neotropical forest birds.   Methods  We sampled at 291 points in nine study areas (localities) across the c.  3,000‐mm precipitation range. In each locality, we obtained climatic characteristics and phylogenetic, morphological and physiological proxy data to test predictions about the evolutionary relationships and distribution of traits.    Results Bird communities changed abruptly along the precipitation gradient and differed between dry and wet forests. Analyses of phylogenetic relationships, trait space, and observations at nests suggested that environmental filtering is more important in dry than in wet forests, especially for breeding. In contrast, we found little evidence that competition was more important in wet than in dry forests. Nest predation or competition for nest space, however, may be more critical in wetter forests.   Conclusions The two distinct bird communities we documented suggest that lowland precipitation gradients, across which temperature is constant, can be as important as temperature gradients in generating high beta diversity. We conclude that breeding in bird communities might be crucial for determining community assembly along environmental gradients. Given that recent population declines in tropical birds have been attributed to changes in precipitation, by understanding the mechanisms underlying community assembly along precipitation gradients our study may improve our ability to understand those declines and predict the effects of climate change on Neotropical avifauna.","We thank Hda.

Today, Cartagena is the fifth largest city in Colombia, with ~ 1.2 million inhabitants. Las Quintas Lagoon lies near the center of Cartagena and is connected hydrologically to the Bay of Cartagena and Las Virgenes Lagoon via channels. The sediments of Las Quintas Lagoon thus offer a unique opportunity to explore the environmental history of one of the oldest cities in South America. We analysed a 210Pb- and 14C-dated sediment core from Las Quintas Lagoon to investigate the environmental effects of long-term urban development in this tropical, estuarine setting. The sediment core from Las Quintas Lagoon displays evidence of change in the depositional environment during the last few centuries. Principal Component Analysis indicated relatively stable conditions in Las Quintas Lagoon from the begining of the record (about 1300 CE) until ca. 1900 CE, when the ongoing eutrophication began. PC1 shows statistical significance and was dominated by geochemical indicators, whereas PC2 correlated with pollen spectra. Upcore decreases in TOC/TN values, together with increases in TOC, TN and δ15N values, indicate greater autochthonous (i.e. phytoplankton) production and eutrophication. Lack of statistical significance of PC2 points to low variability among pollen spectra, and hence vegetation, through time. Diatom assemblages in the Las Quintas Lagoon sediment record display two shifts during the last 100 years, ca. 1940 and 2000, which also reflect progressive eutrophication of the system.","This research was funded partially by a grant from the Inter-American Institute for Global Change Research (IAI) CRN3038, which is supported by the US National Science Foundation (Grant GEO-1128040).

The failure of this programme and subsequent iterations is well-documented, and research has also examined some of its negative effects for different societal groups. However, a comprehensive study of the social justice implications of Colombia’s national bilingual programmes has not been carried out. Using Young’s framework ‘the five faces of oppression’, the current paper shows how different groups experience different forms of injustice as a result of the implementation of Colombia’s national bilingual programmes and their focus on language as a means to the end of economic development. It is argued that the the Colombian government’s policy approach instrumentalises foreign language learning and diminishes the importance of the other purposes of learning a foreign language. Furthermore, this study shows how a lack of consideration of contextual factors from a social justice perspective can lead to shortcomings in policy implementation and the neglect of social justice issues. The conclusion suggests that bilingual policies need not be oppressive and outlines ways to ensure socially just English-Spanish bilingual education in Colombia.",I would like to express thanks to Dr. Jan McArthur and the two anonymous reviewers for their feedback on draft versions of this paper.,,Current Issues in Language Planning,,,,2019-05-09,2019,2019-05-09,2020-03-14,21,2,117-134,Closed,Article,"Mackenzie, Lee","Mackenzie, Lee (Institute of Languages, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia)","Mackenzie, Lee (Universidad del Norte)","Mackenzie, Lee (Universidad del Norte)",11,2,,9.28,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1114013451,"47 Language, Communication and Culture; 4704 Linguistics","16 Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions; 4 Quality Education"

The present study aims to assess the scalar invariance of two dimensions of a widely used gender identity scale (Egan and Perry’s Multidimensional Gender Identity Inventory) across two cultural contexts. Fourth, sixth, and fifth graders from Barranquilla (Colombia) and Montréal (Canada) ( n = 351) completed an abbreviated, self-report revised version of Egan and Perry’s scale. A Confirmatory Factor Analysis demonstrated that typicality and pressure to conform to traditional gender roles are distinct factors and tend to be stable over time. Furthermore, a multi-group comparison analysis showed that the measurement model did not vary significantly as a function of cultural context. Our study adds evidence to support the use of a reliable and valid measurement instrument that is invariant across cultural settings, to allow comparisons that do not depend on contextual variations in the assessment of gender identity during childhood.","We thank the participants, schools, teachers, principals, and parents associated with the samples in Montréal and Barranquilla and all those who helped with the data collections—especially Gordon Rosenoff and July Brochero.",,International Journal of Behavioral Development,,,,2019-05-21,2019,2019-05-21,2019-07,43,4,305-308,Closed,Article,"Castellanos, Melisa; Saldarriaga, Lina; Lopez, Luz Stella; Bukowski, William M.","Castellanos, Melisa (Department of Psychology and Centre de Recherche en Développement Humain, Concordia University, Canada); Saldarriaga, Lina (Corporación Colombiana de Padres y Madres, Red PaPaz, Colombia); Lopez, Luz Stella (Universidad del Norte, Colombia); Bukowski, William M.

The present paper aims to develop alternative modelling approaches that can be applied when assessing the pavement serviceability of urban roads in developing countries. More than sixty (60) rigid urban pavement sections with different surface characteristics were evaluated. Performance indexes such as the International Roughness Index (IRI) and the Pavement Condition Index (PCI) were measured on each pavement section. Deterministic and probabilistic models were developed to correlate pavement performance indicators with the users’ assessment of each pavement section. Moreover, threshold limits for the acceptance of the IRI and PCI were also proposed using a probabilistic approach. In line with previous studies, Colombian users have higher tolerance than users from developed countries towards accepting pavement in poor conditions. Particularly, results suggest a higher tolerance towards urban roads with high IRI and low PCI values. Finally, the models and thresholds proposed in this research could be used to define prioritisation policies that could help road agencies in their decision-making process at the network level, saving time and money in public investment, and thus achieve an increase in the welfare of the urban population of countries with similar sociocultural characteristics. Furthermore, the methodological framework applied in this research effort may be useful for agencies and governments seeking to develop and/or improve their current PMS.",,"This work was supported by Departamento Administrativo de Ciencia, Tecnología e Innovación [Grant Number 1215-745-59105].",International Journal of Pavement Engineering,,,,2019-02-14,2019,2019-02-14,2021-01-02,22,1,77-86,Closed,Article,"Fuentes, Luis; Camargo, Rafael; Arellana, Julián; Velosa, Claudia; Martinez, Gilberto","Fuentes, Luis (Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); Camargo, Rafael (Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); Arellana, Julián (Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); Velosa, Claudia (Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); Martinez, Gilberto (Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia)","Fuentes, Luis (Universidad del Norte)","Fuentes, Luis (Universidad del Norte); Camargo, Rafael (Universidad del Norte); Arellana, Julián (Universidad del Norte); Velosa, Claudia (Universidad del Norte); Martinez, Gilberto (Universidad del Norte)",35,15,,7.68,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1112143555,40 Engineering; 4005 Civil Engineering,

Macbr. from Northern Region of Colombia,"Dalea carthagenensis L. is an American perennial sub-shrub, whose leaves/branches emit a soft pleasant odor. Due to its characteristic odor and the lacking literature reports on the chemistry of the volatile metabolites, in this work the composition by GC-MS of the volatile fractions and essential oils obtained by SDE/HS-SPME and MWHD, respectively, of the species collected in Colombia (Repelón, Atlántico), was established. As a result of the analysis, the main constituents identified in the volatile fractions were: (i.) SDE: leaves, (E)-β-ocimene/β-caryophyllene (each ∼21 %) and β-pinene (∼19 %); branches, (E)-β-ocimene (∼36 %), β-pinene (∼20 %) and trans-pinocarvyl acetate (∼14 %); (ii.) HS-SPME: branches/leaves, β-pinene (∼20-50 %) and β-caryophyllene (∼10-23 %). Likewise, the most abundant compounds found in the essential oils were: (iii.) dry season leaves (2013), trans-caryophyllene oxide (∼32 %) and β-pinene (∼13 %); (iv.) rainy season leaves (2014), β-pinene (∼16 %), (E)-β-ocimene (∼13 %) and trans-caryophyllene oxide/β-caryophyllene/myrcene (each ∼10 %); (v.) rainy season leaves (2017), (E)-β-ocimene (∼36 %), β-caryophyllene (∼21 %) and β-pinene (∼14 %); and finally, (vi.) branches (2017), trans-pinocarvyl acetate (∼29 %) and trans-caryophyllene oxide (∼22 %). From these results, it could be concluded that: i.) the complete profile of the volatile metabolites from leaves/branches of the plant was achieved, which is reported for the first time; and, ii.) the compositional variation of the essential oils was dependent on the collection time and the weather (dry/rainy season).",,,Journal of Essential Oil Bearing Plants,,,,2019-05-04,2019,2019-08-04,2019-05-04,22,3,774-788,Closed,Article,"Muñoz-Acevedo, Amner; del Carmen González, María; Stashenko, Elena E.","Muñoz-Acevedo, Amner (Research Group in Chemistry and Biology, Universidad del Norte, Km 5 vía Puerto Colombia, Barranquilla, Colombia); del Carmen González, María (Research Group in Chemistry and Biology, Universidad del Norte, Km 5 vía Puerto Colombia, Barranquilla, Colombia); Stashenko, Elena E.

While presenting diverse morphologies, all are lowland species of Amazonia and the Guianas, with the exception of D. sudyungasensis from montane forests on the eastern slopes of the Andes in Bolivia. The descriptions of most of these species are based on few collections. The decision to proceed with the publication of a long-accumulating backlog of novel taxa is based on two factors making it doubtful that additional material of these species will be seen in the near future. First, Dacryodes species are usually rare where they occur, moreover they are usually large trees whose flowers and fruits are difficult to see and access. Second, there has been an alarming decrease in botanical exploration, while the urgency of documenting flora – especially undescribed diversity – has only increased.","We thank Bobbi Angell for the fine illustrations; Lucija Klebieko for providing data about incoming material for determination at NY; Carlos Parra for his insights about COL; Oscar Rojas for his assistance with the maps; and Monielle Machado for her assistance with georeferencing a number of the collections and preparing the exsiccatae.

Four local search methods are proposed for nonlinear data assimilation in this paper. The methods work as follows: At each iteration, the observation operator is linearized around the current solution, and a gradient approximation of the three dimensional variational (3D-Var) cost function is obtained. Then, samples along potential steepest descent directions of the 3D-Var cost function are generated, and the acceptance/rejection criteria for such samples are similar to those proposed by the Tabu Search and the Simulated Annealing framework. In addition, such samples can be drawn within certain sub-spaces so as to reduce the computational effort of computing search directions. Once a posterior mode is estimated, matrix-free ensemble Kalman filter approaches can be implemented to estimate posterior members. Furthermore, the convergence of the proposed methods is theoretically proven based on the necessary assumptions and conditions. Numerical experiments have been performed by using the Lorenz-96 model. The numerical results show that the cost function values on average can be reduced by several orders of magnitudes by using the proposed methods. Even more, the proposed methods can converge faster to posterior modes when sub-space approximations are employed to reduce the computational efforts among iterations.","This work was supported in part by award UN, Colombia 2018-38, and by the Applied Math and Computer Science Lab at Universidad del Norte, Colombia .",,Applied Soft Computing,,,,2019-10,2019,,2019-10,83,,105624,Closed,Article,"Nino-Ruiz, Elias D.; Yang, Xin-She","Nino-Ruiz, Elias D.

1595,pub.1121128317,10.1108/mrjiam-12-2018-0892,,,Orchestrating absorptive capacity: organizational catalysts of TMT’s influence,"Purpose This study aims to tackle the influence of top management team (TMT), socialization capabilities and their interactions on absorptive capacity (ACAP). Specifically, this paper examines a TMT’s diversity and coordination as an “enabler” with the potential to trigger the processes involved in the generation of ACAP.   Design/methodology/approach The authors relied on a database comprising 96 manufacturing firms in a developing country. Due to the model suggested as well as the sample size, they opted for a PLS-SEM methodology.   Findings The empirical results show that TMT diversity is not significantly related to firm’s ACAP. Additionally, they provide evidence for a mediation of the relationship between a TMT coordination and ACAP through socialization capabilities.   Research limitations/implications This paper presents a theoretical framework that underscores the influence of TMT on different dimensions of ACAP. Based on the upper echelon theory, the authors suggest that this is of utmost importance given that the extent to which knowledge is acquired, integrated and exploited within the firm can be contingent on the configuration and collaborative structure of the TMT. The results show that TMT coordination influences firm’s ACAP when it is complemented effectively by structural mechanisms for fostering greater communication, collaboration and cohesiveness between the members of an organization.   Practical implications To configure a TMT merely to have diversity or guarantee the coordination between the team members is not enough to foster firm’s ACAP. An alignment of a coordinated TMT with the possibility for employees to freely communicate across functional areas and hierarchical limits is a prerequisite for the acquisition, assimilation, transformation and exploitation of external knowledge.   Originality/value The authors consider that this study raises areas for further consideration in efforts to understand how individual-based resources (e.g. TMT configuration) can be transformed into systemic knowledge-based capability (e.g. ACAP).

In this study we evaluated the effects of past and future land cover changes in ES, ecosystem disservices (EdS) and biodiversity, in a case study in the Barranquilla Metropolitan Area (BMA), Colombia. First, we estimated ES supply and demand and EdS associated to different land covers. Then, we evaluated land cover changes across time and their impacts on ES and EdS. Finally, we reviewed the Territorial Ordering Plans (POT) to evaluate where urbanization is planned for the year 2027, and assessed the potential impacts of such POT on biodiversity and ES. We found that natural areas have diminished, resulting in the decrease of provisioning and regulating services and the increase in EdS. Urban expansion is contributing to the degradation of ES. We argue that this study contributes to understand the effects of land cover changes on biodiversity, ES and EdS around a Latin American metropolitan area, where this kind of studies are still scarce. We present broader lessons on how ES science can improve land use planning instruments.","Acknowledgements We wish to thank all the people who were interviewed and participated in the workshop.

The Mw 7.1 earthquake damaged more than 500 buildings where most of them are classified as mid-rise RC frames with infill walls. A multinational team from Colombia, Mexico, and the United States was rapidly deployed within a week of the occurrence of the event to investigate the structural and nonstructural damage levels of over 60 RC buildings with 2–12 stories. The results of the study confirmed that older mid-rise structures with limited ductility capacity may have been shaken past their capacity. To elucidate the widespread damage in mid-rise RC framed structures, the post-earthquake reconnaissance effort is complemented with inelastic modeling and simulation of several representative RC framing systems with and without masonry infill walls. It was confirmed that the addition of non-isolated masonry infills significantly impacts the ductility capacity and increases the potential for a soft-story mechanism formation in RC frames originally analyzed and designed to be bare systems.","Funding for the CEER team was provided by Universidad del Norte, Universidad Militar Nueva Granada, Escuela de Ingeniería de Antioquia, Universidad de Medellín, and Asocia-ción Colombiana de Ingeniería Sísmica (AIS).

The solution methodology develops, in an innovative way, a hybrid strategy of labor flexibility that combines the following two flexibility strategies: (i) flexible contracts, which allow to relax the duration of the shifts and the number of weekly hours employees must work; and (ii) multiskilled staff, employees trained to work on multiple task types. A mixed integer linear programming model is proposed to determine how many employees are required in each type of contract, and how many of them will be multiskilled employees and in which task types. Results using real data from a Chilean retail firm show the potential benefits of the proposed hybrid flexibility strategy in relation to experiments where flexibility is not considered (i.e., without flexible contracts and multiskilling), or even, when scenarios consider only one of the two flexibility strategies. The increases in the number of multiskilled employees are mainly produced by demand variability than by their respective size. Regarding the staff composition, empirical results show that on average the proportion of full-time employees with respect to part-time employees is approximately 1:3. It is also shown that the most attractive contracts are those that have short workdays.","This research was supported by “Fundación para la Promoción de la Investigación y la Tecnología (FPIT)” under Grant 4.254 and Universidad del Norte under Grant 2017-13.

Peer groups (i.e., the boys or girls within in a school classroom) in which participation rates exceeded 90% were randomly assigned to either a “complete” or a “missing” group. In separate procedures, children whose scores placed them above the 20th percentile for their group were excluded from the “missing” groups on measures of passive withdrawal, popularity, and aggression. When the correlations observed with the “complete” groups were compared with the correlations observed with the “missing” groups, few differences were observed.

There lies the importance of providing quality instruments. The aim of the study was to evaluate the invariance of the life satisfaction scale (SWLS) in two samples of older adults in Spain and Peru.
METHOD: The participants were 857 older adults in Spain (mean age=68.23 years, SD=5.93) and 336 older adults in Peru (average age=72.42, SD=7.07). All multi-group confirmatory factor analyzes were estimated in Mplus 8.0.
RESULTS: The results indicate the presence of a strict invariance of the one-dimensional structure of the SWLS in samples of older adults in Spain and Peru, which allows for meaningful comparisons of latent means and covariances. Comparison of latent means showed small differences in the construct between the cultural groups.
CONCLUSIONS: The SWLS is a valid instrument for intercultural comparisons between Spanish and Peruvian population.

However, the net extractable SGE potential—or site-specific potential (SSP)—is determined not only by the available natural resources but also by the energy consumption required for operating the power plant. Particularly, the required inputs for water pretreatment prior to energy generation to preserve the proper functioning of the membranes and other components within the systems, have been identified as a major drawback for SGE generation from natural waters. In this paper, the required energy consumed during water pretreatment was estimated, comparing conventional and membrane-based methods. This energy input was included in the formulations of the SSP, as a function of the design flow of the power plant and was used to assess the extractable SGE potential at the Magdalena River mouth, a top-ten system for SGE generation worldwide. The results showed that water pretreatment produced an important reduction of the SSP in the case study, while high potentials were still found for appropriate design flows.","This work was funded by COLCIENCIAS—Department of Science, Technology and Innovation of Colombia—by the projects: 111870048985, resolution 1020-2014 and 121571451074, resolution 881-2015.

In this article, we continue in this tradition by considering the context of transnational research where researchers need to actively negotiate the effects of colonialist discourses in both interpersonal relationships and discourse production. We argue that empathy through imaginative reconstruction provides an opportunity for an emotional understanding to be approached in the absence of shared experience. Drawing on our own fieldwork experiences, we address moments where we worked to create relationships of empathy through imagination to highlight ways that imaginative reconstruction and empathy can be used to negotiate difference in the process of fieldwork. Relatedly, we address the need to take a third position and the role of the shame in this process. We also consider the dangers posed when using imaginative reconstruction, particularly over-identification and appropriation. We conclude by discussing the challenges and potential of using imaginative reconstruction to enrich transnational research.","We would like to express our gratitude to the anonymous reviewers of the paper whose suggestions helped us shape the arguments presented here.

This paper explores the case of an Entrepreneurial Ecosystem in a developing country. We argue that in the context of lagging industrial development and weak institutions, a lead actor needs to step in to aid the emergence of an Entrepreneurial Ecosystem. We argue that only a locally embedded actor who has the resource endowment and the legitimacy to do so can assume such a role.

To complement the description of sand-pile interface provided by DIC, a study is conducted at a smaller scale for the analysis of intergranular contacts. After loading, resin-cemented specimens are recovered from the vicinity of the pile and investigated at the grain scale by means of X-ray computed tomography. Novel qualitative results show the spatial evolution of contacts orientations for both tests. The two advanced image-based techniques used in this study give access to valuable micro-scale information and could be combined to better understand the deformation mechanisms driving the macroscopic response of non-displacement piles.",,,Géotechnique Letters,,,,2019-12,2019,,2019-12,9,1,1-24,Closed,Article,"Doreau-Malioche, J.; Galvis-Castro, A.; Tovar-Valencia, R.; Viggiani, G.; Combe, G.; Prezzi, M.; Salgado, R.","Doreau-Malioche, J.

To date, there are no known studies in Colombia that investigate risk factors related to suicidal behaviour in a male homosexual population. Objective The objective of the present study is to investigate the risk factors for suicidal ideation in young men living in Bogota (Colombia) who self-identify as homosexuals. Methods 175 males between 14 and 27 (19.02±2.0) years completed two tests, one for suicidal thoughts and one for internalised homophobia (IH). The snowball non-probability sampling technique was used. Results 18.4% reported low suicidal ideation, 24.6% a moderate level and 24% declared a high level of suicidal thoughts. IH scores ranged between the expected minimum and maximum (9–45) (21.54±7). Being sexually abused was the main factor associated with suicidal ideation (OR=4.02; 95%CI, 1.51–10.67; p =0.005). Adolescents were 3 times more at risk of suicidal thoughts than young adults (OR=3.63; 95%CI, 1.35–9.76; p =0.010). High IH scores were twice as likely to experience suicidal thoughts as those with low IH (OR=2.11; 95%CI, 1.22–3.67; p =0.008). Conclusions These findings are consistent with previous research and suggest the need for early preventive interventions in pursuit of non-coercive sexual health, seeking the re-examination of IH through affirmative sexual diversity therapies.",,"Thanks to Colciencias, the Colombian Administrative Department of Science, Technology and Innovation, for funding the Doctorate in Psychology, call 727, 2015.",Revista Colombiana de Psiquiatría (English ed ),,,,2019-01,2019,,2019-01,48,1,2-9,Closed,Article,"Pineda-Roa, Carlos Alejandro","Pineda-Roa, Carlos Alejandro (Doctorado en Psicología, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia)",,"Pineda-Roa, Carlos Alejandro (Universidad del Norte)",2,1,,0.64,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1111407240,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3202 Clinical Sciences; 52 Psychology,3 Good Health and Well Being

This study evaluated the accumulation and translocation of Cd and Hg in a soil-plant system in four tomato plantations and assessed the risk associated with ingestion of these metals. Ten soil samples (rhizosphere) and 10 samples of plant tissues (leaf, ripe fruit, green fruit, and roots) were collected in each plantation. Spatial variation in Cd and Hg concentrations was negligible. The Cd level in rhizosphere was lower in comparison with that of plant tissues. Hg levels in rhizosphere were similar to roots and higher than the value observed in aerial parts of plants. The Cd bioconcentration factor was approximately five times higher compared to that of Hg. Approximately 93% and 48.6% of Cd and Hg accumulated in roots reached aerial parts, respectively. Our results indicate that tomato readily absorbs Cd accumulated in soil, translocating it to aerial parts. Comparatively, the absorption of Hg is not efficient. Levels of Cd in tomatoes were over 17 times higher than the maximum residual levels in 57.5% of ripe fruits and in 27.5% of green tomatoes.","The authors thank the Laboratory of Environmental Sciences of the State University of the North of Rio de Janeiro (Laboratório de Ciências Ambientais, LCA, da Universidade Estadual Norte Fluminense, UENF) for metal determinations.","C.M.M.

1442,pub.1123189867,10.1007/s12144-019-00552-y,,,Humor styles across 28 countries,"Responses to a measure of the four humor styles of affiliative, aggressive, self-enhancing, and self-defeating from the Humor Styles Questionnaire (HSQ; Martin et al. Journal of Research in Personality, 37(1), 48–75, 2003) were collected from individuals (N = 8361) in 28 countries encompassing 21 different languages. The purpose of this global collaboration was to examine both differences and similarities of humor styles across nations at the descriptive level. Across the countries, typically the highest scores were for the affiliative humor style. When each humor style was examined, some country samples demonstrated differences in mean scores. For example, the samples from Hungary, Indonesia, South Africa, and Serbia had high self-enhancing scores and Japan scored the lowest. In contrast to mean differences, almost all of the countries demonstrated positive inter-scale correlations, similar sex differences, and similar correlations with age, suggesting more similarities than differences. As discussed, some of the samples had low internal consistency values and poorly fitting factor structures for the humor style scales, suggesting that those results should be interpreted with caution.","Henrietta Bolló, Eötvös Loránd University, Hungary: ÚNKP-17-3 New National Excellence Program of the Ministry of Human Capacities.

The authors hereby differentiate the degree of novelty, distinguishing between innovation based on invention (new products for the international market) and those based on imitation or adoption processes (new products for the company or new products in the national market).   Design/methodology/approach Placing this study in the context of a developing country, the authors apply an ordered probit model inflated in zeros (ZIOP). This methodology enables one to not only provide results not biased by the excess of zeros but also take into account the unobserved heterogeneity with respect to the sources of zeros (that is those firms which do not innovate). The empirical analysis is based on three Colombian innovation surveys carried out between 2003 and 2008 by the Colombian National Statistics Department.   Findings The results provide empirical evidence that two elements are essential for both types of innovation persistence: accessing external financial resources and learning through interaction. Furthermore, the sunk R&D cost approach and technological learning explain persistence in innovation of new products for the international market.   Research limitations/implications The limitations of this study are directly related to the methodological choice. The authors were unable to take into consideration two sources of heterogeneity: the one related to initial conditions and the one related to the source of the many non-innovators. They opted to focus on the latter due the research question and setting of this study. Additionally, macroeconomic instability did not allow to consider a long panel; instead the authors had to rely on a short panel.   Practical implications The results provide important insights to managers. Continuous investments in innovation activities are important bot to become an innovative firm as well as to improve the odds of persistently innovating. Particularly, R&D investments are a pre-requisite for new-to-the-world innovations. Finally, it is not one specific set of capabilities which is a prerequisite for the generation of innovation; rather it is a strategic combination of various skills that increase the probability to (persistently) innovate.   Social implications With innovation persistence being especially relevant for long-run dynamics behind economic growth, the results of this study provide insights into potential public policies. Governments are in a position to at least lower barriers, which might enable more firms to persistently innovate. Continuous access – less than the actual amount – to financial resources aimed at innovation activities and learning through interaction with external agents is fundamental for both kinds of innovation persistence. Both are market characteristics where governments can – at least indirectly – intervene.   Originality/value Despite the existence of various theoretical approaches, the bulk of empirical research focuses on the verification of true state innovation persistence. Thus, while innovation persistency has been widely confirmed to exist to a certain degree, knowledge regarding which theoretical approach is likely to drive a firm to persistently innovation is still scarce. Additionally, this study is placed in the context of a developing country, which by most empirical research has been overlooked but is characterized by one element which is decisive for the empirical methodology: many firms do not innovate, let alone persistently innovate. 
 Objetivo El objetivo de este artículo es analizar el impacto diferencial que cada una de las explicaciones teóricas dominantes tiene sobre la persistencia de la innovación. Para esto, diferenciamos el grado de novedad, distinguiendo entre la innovación basada en la invención (nuevos productos para el mercado internacional) y aquellas basadas en procesos de imitación o adopción (nuevos productos para el mercado nacional).   Diseño/metodología/aproximación Este estudio se lleva a cabo en el contexto de un país en desarrollo, en el cual la mayoría de empresas no innovan. Consecuentemente, aplicamos un modelo probit ordenado inflado en ceros (ZIOP). Esta metodología no sólo proporciona resultados no sesgados por el exceso de ceros, sino que también tiene en cuenta la heterogeneidad no observada con respecto a las fuentes de ceros (es decir, aquellas empresas que no innovan). El análisis empírico se basa en tres Encuestas de Innovación en Colombia realizadas entre 2003 y 2008 por el Departamento Nacional de Estadísticas de Colombia.   Resultados Nuestros resultados proporcionan evidencia empírica de que tanto el enfoque de éxito genera éxito con el de capacidades son importantes. Sin embargo, se encontró que todas las variables que se desprenden de estos enfoques teóricos no están relacionadas en forma significativa con los dos tipos de persistencia estudiados. Además, el enfoque de costos hundidos de I + D se relaciona en forma robusta con la persistencia en la innovación de nuevos productos para el mercado internacional.   Limitaciones/implicaciones Las limitaciones de este estudio están directamente relacionadas con la elección metodológica. No pudimos tomar en consideración simultáneamente dos fuentes de heterogeneidad: la relacionada con las condiciones iniciales y la relacionada con el exceso de empresas no innovadoras. Optamos por centrarnos en lo último debido a la pregunta de investigación y el contexto país en el que se desarrolla esta investigación. Adicionalmente, la inestabilidad macroeconómica no permitió considerar un panel largo; por el contrario, se usó un panel corto que cubre un periodo de tiempo de estabilidad económica.   Implicaciones prácticas Nuestros resultados proporcionan información importante para los gerentes. Las inversiones continuas en actividades de innovación son importantes tanto para aumentar la probabilidad de convertirse en una empresa innovadora como para mejorar las posibilidades de innovación persistente. En particular, las inversiones en I + D son un requisito para lograr innovaciones nuevas en el mundo. Finalmente, no se identificaron un conjunto único de capacidades necesarias para la generación de cualquier tipo de innovación; más bien se debe adoptar un enfoque estratégico diferenciado.   Implicaciones sociales Dado que la persistencia de la innovación es especialmente relevante para las dinámicas de crecimiento económico de largo plazo, los resultados de nuestro estudio proporcionan información útil para el diseño de políticas públicas. Los gobiernos están en posición de al menos reducir las barreras que impiden que las empresas innoven persistentemente. El acceso continuo a los recursos financieros destinados a actividades de innovación y el aprendizaje a través de la interacción con agentes externos son fundamentales para ambos tipos de persistencia de innovación. Ambas son condiciones del mercado que pueden ser intervenidas, al menos indirectamente, por el gobierno.   Originalidad/valor A pesar de la existencia de tres enfoques principales sobre la persistencia en la innovación, la mayor parte de las investigaciones se han centrado en la verificación de la existencia de verdadera persistencia en innovación. Por lo tanto, aunque se ha confirmado ampliamente que la persistencia de la innovación existe hasta cierto punto, el conocimiento sobre qué enfoque teórico es probable que impulse a una empresa a innovar de manera persistente es aún escaso. Además, este estudio se ubica en el contexto de un país en desarrollo, contexto que ha sido pasado por alto en la mayoría de las investigaciones empíricas, aspecto que decisivo para la selección de la metodología empírica: muchas empresas no innovan, y mucho menos innovan persistentemente. 
 Objetivo O objetivo deste artigo é analisar o impacto diferencial que têm sobre a persistência da inovação cada uma das explicações teóricas dominantes. Para isso diferenciamos o grau de novidade, distinguindo entre inovação baseada em invenção (novos produtos para o mercado internacional) e aqueles baseados em processos de imitação ou adoção (novos produtos para o mercado nacional).   Design/metodologia/abordagem Esta pesquisa ocorre no contexto de um país em desenvolvimento, no qual a maioria das empresas não inovam. Assim sendo, temos aplicado o modelo Probit ordenado inflado-zero (ZIOP). Essa metodologia permite não só que os resultados da pesquisa não sejam influenciados por excesso de zeros, mas também a inclusão da heterogeneidade não observada em relação às fontes de zeros (isto é, aquelas empresas que não inovam). A análise empírica baseia-se em três pesquisas sobre Inovação na Colômbia realizadas entre 2003 e 2008 pelo Departamento Nacional de Estatísticas da Colômbia.   Resultados Nossos resultados fornecem evidências empíricas que indicam que tanto a abordagem de sucesso gera sucesso quanto a abordagem de capacidade é importante. No entanto, não se encontrou que todas as variáveis que emergiram dessas abordagens teóricas foram significativamente relacionadas aos dois tipos de persistência pesquisados. Além disso, a abordagem dos custos irrecuperáveis de P and D está relacionada de forma robusta à persistência na inovação de novos produtos para o mercado internacional.   Limitações de pesquisa/implicações As limitações desta pesquisa estão diretamente relacionadas à escolha metodológica. Não temos podido considerar duas fontes de heterogeneidade: a relacionada às condições iniciais e a relacionada ao excesso de empresas não inovadoras. Optou-se por centrar-se nesse último devido à questão de pesquisa e ao contexto do país em que foi realizada. Além disso, a instabilidade macroeconômica não permitiu um painel longo; pelo contrário, foi utilizado um painel curto que cobre um período de estabilidade econômica.   Implicações práticas Nossos resultados provêem informação importante para os gerentes. Investimentos contínuos em atividades de inovação são importantes tanto para aumentar a probabilidade de se tornar numa empresa inovadora quanto para melhorar as possibilidades de inovação persistente. Em particular, os investimentos em P and D são um requisito para alcançar inovações no mundo. Finalmente, um conjunto único de capacidades necessárias para a geração de qualquer tipo de inovação não foi identificado; ao contrário, uma abordagem estratégica diferenciada deve ser adotada.   Implicações sociais Dado que a persistência da inovação é especialmente relevante para as dinâmicas de longo prazo por trás do crescimento econômico, os resultados obtidos provêem informação útil para o desenho de políticas públicas. Os governos estão em posição de, pelo menos, reduzir as barreiras que impedem as empresas de inovar persistentemente. O acesso contínuo a recursos financeiros para atividades de inovação e a aprendizagem por meio da interação com agentes externos são fundamentais para os dois tipos de persistência de inovação. Ambas são condições do mercado que podem ser intervencionadas, pelo menos indiretamente, pelo governo.   Originalidade/valor Embora da existência de três abordagens principais sobre persistência na inovação, a maior parte das pesquisas concentraram-se em verificar a existência de verdadeira persistência na inovação. Portanto, ainda quando tem sido amplamente confirmado que a persistência da inovação existe até certo ponto, o conhecimento sobre qual abordagem teórico provavelmente alavanca uma empresa a inovar persistentemente ainda é escasso. Além disso, esta pesquisa está localizada num contexto de um país em desenvolvimento, que tem sido negligenciado na maioria das pesquisas empíricas, aspecto decisivo para a seleção da metodologia empírica: muitas empresas não inovam e muito menos inovam persistentemente.","The authors are grateful for the financial support for this research received from Colciencias, Universidad del Norte and Universidad de La Salle through the project Dinámicas de Innovación en Contextos Poco Intensivos en I + D: el caso de la Industria Manufacturera Colombiana (121577657885).",,Management Research The Journal of the Iberoamerican Academy of Management,,,,2019-09-05,2019,,2019-09-05,18,2,125-151,Closed,Article,"Juliao-Rossi, Jorge; Schmutzler, Jana; Forero-Pineda, Clemente","Juliao-Rossi, Jorge (Facultad de Ciencias Administrativas y Contables, Universidad de La Salle, Bogota, Colombia); Schmutzler, Jana (Universidad del Norte, Bogotá, Colombia); Forero-Pineda, Clemente (Facultad de Administración, Universidad de los Andes, Bogota, Colombia)","Juliao-Rossi, Jorge (University of La Salle)","Juliao-Rossi, Jorge (University of La Salle); Schmutzler, Jana (Universidad del Norte); Forero-Pineda, Clemente (Universidad de Los Andes)",6,0,,2.56,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1121128316,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3505 Human Resources and Industrial Relations; 3507 Strategy, Management and Organisational Behaviour",

We used a bibliometric method to analyse the body of research reported in 21 articles on start-up accelerators indexed in the Web of Science database for the period 2010-2019. Such articles display theoretical voids, fragmented approaches and coincidental views and findings on core aspects and focus on corporate accelerators. We hypothesise that the reason for such little research reported in this field may be due to the novelty of the start-up accelerator phenomenon and its overlapping with business incubators. Consequently, organising and presenting some of the most recent and indexed work will hopefully guide future research and decision-making in this field.",,,International Journal of Intellectual Property Management,,,,2019-10-11,2019,2019-10-11,2019,9,3-4,230-246,Closed,Article,"Guijarro-García, María; Carrilero-Castillo, Agustín; Gallego-Nicholls, José Fernando","Guijarro-García, María (ESIC Business and Marketing School, Avenida Blasco Ibañez 55, 46021, Valencia, Comunitat Valenciana, Spain); Carrilero-Castillo, Agustín (ESIC Business and Marketing School, Avenida Blasco Ibañez 55, 46021, Valencia, Comunitat Valenciana, Spain); Gallego-Nicholls, José Fernando (ESIC Business and Marketing School, Avenida Blasco Ibañez 55, 46021, Valencia, Comunitat Valenciana, Spain)",,"Guijarro-García, María (ESIC University); Carrilero-Castillo, Agustín (ESIC University); Gallego-Nicholls, José Fernando (ESIC University)",12,3,,4.46,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1121790673,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3507 Strategy, Management and Organisational Behaviour",

Several numerical models have been proposed to represent the effects of people on the structure, showing that there is not yet a consensus between the different approaches. Most of the models use masses, springs, and dampers to model the human in a standing position. Arguably, the human model could be more complex. The motor system of the human body is a complex interaction of systems (musculoskeletal, nervous, proprioceptive, etc.), all responding at distinct levels of excitation, a phenomenon that is difficult to model with a spring-mass-damper (SMD) system. This paper proposes the use of a closed-loop controller system to model the interaction of a standing human on a structure. The model is updated in a probabilistic sense using experimental data collected in a laboratory setting. The probabilistic approach allows exploration of dependencies between parameters, as well as a probabilistic estimation of the model parameters. The proposed model obtained is validated by predicting the dynamic characteristics of the combined human–structure interaction system after the mass of the structure has been modified. The closed loop controller model is able to predict the dynamic behavior of the human–structure system for a specific individual more closely than traditional SMD models found in the literature.",This material is based upon work supported by the National Science Foundation under Grant No. CMMI-0846258.,,Journal of Engineering Mechanics,,,,2019-02-23,2019,2019-02-23,2019-05,145,5,04019025,Closed,Article,"Ortiz, Albert R.; Caicedo, Juan M.","Ortiz, Albert R.

It has also been shown that something similar occurs during the response to metabolic stress, cell injury, and the colonisation by pathogenic microorganisms. This fact could have some relevance in the pre-admission condition of the critically ill to the intensive care unit, and therefore have an impact on mortality, independently of other factors, such as genetics and the medical treatment of their disease.

The Department of Córdoba, which is part of the Colombian Caribbean region, was a setting of territorial disputes between illegal armed groups. Recently, peace agreements have been reached, thereby leading to a post-conflict period in which conflict-driven socioeconomic and environmental conditions need to be addressed. We used geoenvironmental satellite information and census data to describe land-use evolution in the Department of Córdoba. Our results explain relationships between socioeconomic and geographic variables by using two factors, namely: (1) natural land cover and armed conflict, and (2) pastures and livestock. Five clusters comprised of smaller Colombian territorial units were obtained, exhibiting challenges of environmental governance, conservation of protected areas, and sustainable livestock and agricultural practices. This information provides critical input for institutional decisions during the current post-conflict period.",We thank Colciencias (2014 N0 6172) for their financial support to this research.

When the waiting time increases, the patient perceives the loss of well-being associated with the lack of primary care. Considering the willingness to pay (WTP) for avoiding human suffering in the context of emergency medical services (EMS) within the impact assessment of prehospital care is a relatively new research topic. This paper evaluates, through discrete choice models, the WTP for avoiding the externality associated with the human suffering experienced by the patient who does not receive immediate attention in a medical emergency.

A content analysis of smartphone applications to prevent mobile phone distracted driving,"Mobile phone use while driving is a pervasive problem that continues to increase, notwithstanding the large crash risk this behaviour constitutes. A number of phone applications have been developed with the intention of utilising the technology to prevent dangerous phone behaviours while driving. Despite the potential these applications have in preventing crashes associated with distracted driving, research is yet to explore these emergent applications. Therefore, this study provided a review of the current smartphone applications developed to prevent distracted driving. A content analysis was conducted to identify the smartphone applications targeted at stopping, preventing or reducing phone use behaviour while driving. Their functionality was determined based on the ecosystem of smartphone applications: application-mobile phone interaction, application-driver interaction, and application-context interaction. A total of 29 relevant applications in English language were identified. Most of these applications focused on blocking specific phone functions (e.g. texting or calling) while allowing more desirable driving phone functions to be accessed (e.g. music applications and GPS functions). The specific functions which are blocked or allowed varied greatly between applications. Out of the different application interactions, the function which sends an automatic text message to a contact who texts the driver (associated with external communicator interactions) was the most common feature. A major limitation of the applications was their reliance on blocking specific phone functions as opposed to managing workload while driving or simplifying specific phone tasks to be more compatible with driving. Simply blocking phone functions may not be attractive to drivers who view their phone as a necessity. As such, these drivers are unlikely to use these voluntary applications at all while driving. Smartphone applications designed to prevent phone use while driving show potential for playing a large role in a systemic intervention to prevent mobile phone distracted driving, yet there is a substantial need for further development of these applications.",,,Transportation Research Part F Traffic Psychology and Behaviour,,,,2019-01,2019,,2019-01,60,,657-668,Closed,Article,"Oviedo-Trespalacios, Oscar; King, Mark; Vaezipour, Atiyeh; Truelove, Verity","Oviedo-Trespalacios, Oscar (Centre for Accident Research and Road Safety-Queensland (CARRS-Q), Institute of Health and Biomedical Innovation (IHBI), Queensland University of Technology (QUT), Kelvin Grove, 4059, Australia; Department of Industrial Engineering, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); King, Mark (Centre for Accident Research and Road Safety-Queensland (CARRS-Q), Institute of Health and Biomedical Innovation (IHBI), Queensland University of Technology (QUT), Kelvin Grove, 4059, Australia); Vaezipour, Atiyeh (RECOVER Injury Research Centre, Faculty of Health and Behavioural Sciences, University of Queensland, Herston, Brisbane 4006, Australia); Truelove, Verity (Centre for Accident Research and Road Safety-Queensland (CARRS-Q), Institute of Health and Biomedical Innovation (IHBI), Queensland University of Technology (QUT), Kelvin Grove, 4059, Australia)","Oviedo-Trespalacios, Oscar (Queensland University of Technology; Universidad del Norte)","Oviedo-Trespalacios, Oscar (Queensland University of Technology; Universidad del Norte); King, Mark (Queensland University of Technology); Vaezipour, Atiyeh (University of Queensland); Truelove, Verity (Queensland University of Technology)",56,13,,13.65,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1110639952,"33 Built Environment and Design; 3304 Urban and Regional Planning; 35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3509 Transportation, Logistics and Supply Chains; 52 Psychology; 5205 Social and Personality Psychology",

However, assigning rates of occurrence to such EDPs is difficult because the input ground motions are inconsistent with those that go into the hazard estimation. The Conditional Scenario Spectra (CSS) are a set of realistic ground-motion spectra with assigned rates of occurrence that reproduce the hazard at a site over various hazard levels and over a period range. The CSS methodology is an improvement over the CS method in that it includes the additional step of adjusting the rates to ensure the consistency of the target hazard. In this article, a step-by-step procedure for estimating the CSS is presented. The analysis of a structural system illustrates the uses of the CSS set for assessing EDPs over a wide range of demand intensity so that the estimation of the risk of these EDPs can be accomplished with ease.",,,Earthquake Spectra,,,,2019-05,2019,2019-11-28,2019-05,35,2,737-757,Closed,Article,"Arteta, Carlos A.; Abrahamson, Norman A.","Arteta, Carlos A.

The oils were characterized by gas chromatography and mass spectrometry (GC/MS), and the major compounds identified were: dillapiole (80.7 %) for P. aduncum; safrole (67.0 %), methyl-eugenol (7.2 %) and β-pinene (6.6 %) for P. callosum; safrole (89.3 %) for P. hispidinervum; γ-terpinene (27.3 %), p-cymene (14.0 %) and α-terpinene (12.0 %) for P. hispidum; δ-3-carene (13.1 %), propiopiperone (8.0 %) and (E)-caryophyllene (6.8 %) for P. marginatum. The Brazilian Piper species evaluated in this study were able to inhibit the growth of the ten strains of A. hydrophila, with minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values ranging from 234.37 to 30,000 μg mL-1. The antimicrobial activity of Piper essential oils was considered strong for P. callosum, P. hispidinervum, P. hispidum and P. marginatum, with the exception of P. aduncum that presented weak activity for all strains.

A thermal dynamic model is developed based in simplified semi empirical correlations and includes heat transfer by conduction, convection and radiation in each part of the device. Melting process of the PCM is described with energy balances for a set of discrete spatial layers to calculate temperature and liquid fraction. The model is validated with experimental data gathered under outdoor conditions from a real flat plate solar collector prototype modified to incorporate PCM containers between the absorber plate and the insulation. As result of the validation process, the model shows the capability to estimate the global thermal performance of the device with good accuracy compared with the experimental measurements and using minimal computational resources. Comparisons between estimations of the model and test data are presented for 20 days, real conditions include days with both high and low incident radiation and two different PCMs. Predicted temperature of glass cover, absorber plate, water outlet and PCM are obtained with a maximum error of 4.62%. The model was employed to analyze the collector thermal performance. Temperatures, heat transfer, stored energy of collector main components and liquid fraction of PCM are estimated and analyzed in two cases: under clear sky condition without strong changes of solar radiation and under scattered weather with solar radiation variation. Two PCMs with different melting points (45 °C and 60 °C) are analyzed and compared with results without PCM by using the model to evaluate their performance.","This investigation has been partially funded by the Colombian Administrative Department of Science, Technology and Innovation-COLCIENCIAS, through the program “es tiempo de volver”.

CHIRP data collected in 2015 from this large, high-elevation lake in the Eastern Cordillera of the northern hemisphere Colombian Andes reveal a series of off-lap and on-lap sequences in the upper ~ 20 m of the lake’s sediment column that indicate large amplitude changes in lake level. Because 14C dated sediment cores are only available for the upper 3 m of the sediment column, known Holocene sedimentation rates were extrapolated in order to assign preliminary ages to the off-lap and on-lap sequence boundaries below 3 m depth. These data suggest that lake levels at Tota were lower than present during marine isotope stage (MIS) 4 between 60 and 57 ka, relatively high during MIS 3 between 57 and 29 ka, fell to their lowest levels during MIS 2 between 29 and 14 ka, and gradually rose to the modern high stand through a series of transgressions during MIS 1 and the Holocene from ~ 14 ka to the present. These fluctuations are broadly consistent with trends observed in other lake-level reconstructions from the northern (in phase) and southern (out of phase) hemisphere Andes, possibly supporting the idea that millennial-to-orbital-scale South American hydroclimate variability is linked to shifts in the mean latitude of the intertropical convergence zone due to the influence of insolation- and ocean circulation-driven hemispheric temperature gradients during glacial/stadial and interglacial/interstadial events. Although additional geochronological data will be needed to better resolve the timing of the Tota lake-level changes and their relationships with other records, these preliminary results from Tota, as well as the presence of a thick (> 300 m) sedimentary archive, indicate that this site has significant potential to produce high-resolution, quantitative, paleo-hydroclimate data spanning much of the last 1 million years. Because geophysical surveys and long paleoclimate records from northern hemisphere South America are exceedingly rare, these data provide critical insight into regional hydroclimate trends through the Late Quaternary. Additional work, such as the collection of sediment cores spanning the depth interval represented in the CHIRP data, is required, however, in order to place firmer chronological constraints on the hypothesized timing of lake-level fluctuations at Tota and to investigate their paleo-hydroclimatic implications.","This research was partially supported by grants from the US National Science Foundation (EAR 1445649) and Indiana University-Purdue University, Indianapolis, IN (RSFG &amp; IDF).

Time-stamped spatially varying solar radiation records resulting from that dynamic model are successively fed into an instantaneous flow distribution model of the same solar field. Two different flow control strategies are simulated to evaluate and compare their impact on plant performance. One strategy employs manual balancing valves resulting in an uneven exit temperature from each loop during cloud cover periods. The other strategy employs motorized balancing valves that constantly adjust to achieve a common desired exit temperature from each loop during cloud cover periods. Model output of both strategies under four different cloud shading conditions are compared. Simulation results showed that employing motorized balancing valves will result in a more efficient operation involving less pressure drop, higher outlet temperature and less pumping load; however, the rate of power generation was almost the same in both strategies.",,,Renewable Energy,,,,2019-11,2019,,2019-11,142,,330-344,Closed,Article,"Abutayeh, Mohammad; Padilla, Ricardo Vasquez; Lake, Maree; Lim, Yee Yan; Garcia, Jesus; Sedighi, Mohammadreza; Too, Yen Chean Soo; Jeong, Kwangkook","Abutayeh, Mohammad (Department of Mechanical Engineering, Arkansas State University, Jonesboro, AR 72401, USA); Padilla, Ricardo Vasquez (School of Environment, Science and Engineering.

1232,pub.1122696067,10.1111/btp.12715,,,Climate severity and land‐cover transformation determine plant community attributes in Colombian dry forests,"Abstract  Tropical dry forests ( TDF ) are known to be resource‐limited due to a marked seasonality in precipitation. However, TDF are also shaped by factors such as solar radiation, wind speed, soil fertility, and land‐cover transformation. Together, these factors may determine different gradients of environmental harshness that are likely to drive changes in plant community attributes. Here, we evaluated the effects of environmental harshness on plant community diversity and structure of Colombian TDF , based on floristic and environmental data from 15 1‐ha permanent plots. We also analyzed these effects on legumes species only (including both deciduous and non‐deciduous species), deciduous species only (including both legumes and non‐legumes species), and on the whole community excluding either legumes or deciduous separately. Drier conditions and higher land‐cover transformation had the strongest negative effects on species diversity, basal area (BA), and canopy height. Soil fertility, on the contrary, did not have a significant effect on any of the evaluated response variables. Interestingly, legumes maintained their diversity and BA along the climatic gradient, while deciduous species were negatively affected by drier conditions and by an increase in secondary vegetation at the landscape level. Our results suggest that although TDF are limited by water availability, land‐cover transformation strongly increases environmental harshness. Yet, both legumes and deciduous species were differentially impacted by climatic and land transformation variables. Thus, to better understand TDF plant community attributes, it is necessary to consider these gradients and to disentangle their effects on different plant functional groups.  Abstract in Spanish is available with online material.
Resumen  Es ampliamente conocido que los bosques secos tropicales ( BST ) tienen fuertes limitaciones de recursos derivadas de estacionalidad de la precipitación. Sin embargo, otros factores como la radiación solar, la velocidad del viento, la fertilidad de los suelos y la transformación de las coberturas también dan forma a las condiciones ambientales restrictivas de este ecosistema. En conjunto, estos factores determinan la dureza ambiental que rige el BST y probablemente explican los cambios en los atributos comunitarios de las plantas a lo largo de gradientes. Evaluamos los efectos de la dureza ambiental sobre la diversidad de plantas y atributos estructurales del BST con base en datos florísticos y ambientales para 15 parcelas permanentes de 1 ha, para toda la comunidad de plantas, y subgrupos de plantas que incluyeron solo especies de leguminas y solo caducifolias por separado. Las condiciones secas y coberturas altamente transformadas tuvieron los efectos negativos sobre la diversidad de especies, el área basal y la altura del dosel a nivel comunitario, mientras que la fertilidad del suelo no afectó a ninguno de los atributos evaluados. Interesantemente, el grupo de especies leguminosas mantuvieron su diversidad y área basal a lo largo del gradiente de severidad climática, mientras que el grupo de especies de hoja caduca se vio negativamente afectado por las condiciones más secas y el aumento en el área de coberturas secundarias. Nuestros resultados sugieren que, aunque el BST esta claramente limitado por la disponibilidad del agua, la transformación de las coberturas naturales impulsa el aumento de la dureza ambiental en este ecosistema. Donde, las especies de leguminosas y caducifolias se ven afectadas de manera diferente a toda la comunidad de plantas. De tal forma, para un mejor entendimiento de como cambian los atributos comunitarios de las plantas en los BST es necesario tener en cuenta todas las fuentes de variación ambiental, así como, desagregar los efectos particulares para determinados grupos funcionales de plantas.","We gratefully acknowledge the owners and administrators of the natural areas for their hospitality and logistical support.

Then, predictive capabilities of a finite element model in reproducing the dynamic response of a saturated sand deposit are investigated by drawing samples from the estimated posterior probability distributions of the constitutive model parameters. Variability of the predicted responses due to estimation uncertainty is evaluated.

Although several organizations such as AIChE—through CCPS and SAChE—, IChemE and ABET are trying to seek suitable learning environments, there is still lack of courses or programs aimed at making students conscious about accident causes and prevention. This paper presents a strategy to raise awareness in undergraduate engineering students about this topic. Our strategy consists of four educating modules that can be taught as part of core courses. We have implemented our strategy in 14 Colombian universities in five undergraduate engineering programs: Chemical, Industrial, Mechanical, Environmental, and Process Engineering. This pedagogical material was validated by experts in process safety from the Colombian Oil Company (ECOPETROL), faculty from various universities, and the Process Design group at Los Andes University. This proposed open education approach, which is a shared initiative between industry-academia, has been well received by all stakeholders. During 2016, it has incorporated 28 faculty and the enrollment of more than 1732 students. This process needs long-term sustainability to fulfill the primary purpose of including process safety in the engineer's education.","The work carried out in this paper was developed under the framework of the Cooperation Agreement No. 1 (Arrangement 5221221) between Los Andes University and ECOPETROL.

In the northernmost region of Chile, the most frequent archaeological indicators of these caravan systems are trails and rock art images. Cruces de Molinos (LL-43), a rock art site in the Lluta valley, 1100 masl, 40 km from the Pacific littoral, expands the ceremonial role of rock art sites, materialized, not only as regards the iconography portrayed and alluding to these practices, but also in terms of articulated carcass remains and detached anatomical units of camelids, intentionally deposited in a cache beneath one of the engraved blocks. This paper analyzes the site considering the visual imagery, spatial location, archaeological deposits and features associated with rock art. Based on the predominance of camelid and caravan motifs in rock art images, the extraordinary setting and location of the site on the valley's upper slopes, which is far removed from local settlements, but closely connected with a llama caravan trade network linking the chaupiyunga ecozone with the highlands (sierra and Altiplano ecozones), we suggest that Cruces de Molinos was not a rest stop for caravanners, but a ceremonial place, and not for local farmers, but for highland herders.

Here we present a palynological analysis carried out in the El Cedral archaeological region, Western Venezuelan Llanos. The 145 cm sedimentary record obtained comprises the last ca. 4,200 cal bp (2245 cal bc). Between 4,200–3,800 cal bp (2250–1850 cal bc), wet savannas interspersed with gallery forests dominated in the study area. A wet climate, similar to the present, is suggested by pollen of aquatics and by non-pollen palynomorphs (NPP). Frequent/intense local fires were inferred from charcoal concentrations. Between 3,800–2,100 cal bp (1850–150 cal bc), rapid alternation between forest and savanna-dominated phases occurred. The low diversity of NPP and the low values of pollen from aquatics suggest drier climate conditions than the present. Low charcoal concentrations point to low fire frequencies. Two events of forest expansion at 3,400–3,200 and 2,800–2,100 cal bp were recorded, alternating with savanna-dominated phases (at 3,800–3,600 and 3,200–3,000 cal bp). From 2,100 cal bp (150 cal bc) to the present the expansion of savannas is recorded. Zea mays occurred at 1,880 cal bp (ca. ad 70), accompanied by the increase in charcoal concentration, supporting the hypothesis of intensification of human activities and anthropogenic forest clearance. Different climatic phases recorded in El Cedral match with those described from the Cariaco Basin, indicating that El Niño Southern Oscillation variability was the main climatic forcing. However, the intensification of anthropogenic activities limited the forest expansion expected during the last two millennia, yielding evidence of landscape domestication in this region.","The authors would like to thank the National Fund for Science and Technology of Venezuela (FONACIT) for the financial support given through Grant 2011000404 to the project “Impacto del cambio climático y de la ocupación humana en los mosaicos sabana-bosque de la Cuenca del Orinoco: un enfoque transdisciplinario”.

However, in urban environments it can become challenging to drive at 80 km/h as vehicle operating speeds are much lower, among other limitations associated with the use of IRI as an indicator of ride quality in the urban context. This study was conducted to formulate an alternative pavement serviceability evaluation criteria for low-speed roads (30–60 km/h) in urban settings. Deterministic and probabilistic models were developed to predict the PSI based on the whole-body vibration (WBV) concepts, and thereafter, the results were compared with the ISO 2631 standard that addresses human exposure to multiple mechanical shocks. The ISO 2631 standard uses a WBV-based frequency-weighted root-mean-square acceleration parameter (aw ) for evaluating discomfort in a multi-axis environment. Based on the estimated models, an awz criterion of 0.98 m/s2 at a probability acceptance of 85%, for a vehicle operating speed of 50 km/h, was proposed for urban roads in this study. Overall, the study demonstrated that for accurate estimation of ride quality and comfort (i.e. PSI) of low-speed urban roads, the evaluation criteria should be based on low vehicle speeds that are more representative of urban field conditions.","The authors gratefully acknowledge and thank all those who helped with field measurements, pavement profile data collection, and documentation.

Throughout conjunctures of guerrilla and paramilitary domination, the moral economies that sustained hierarchical land orders became a terrain of tensions and negotiations. Through an ethnographic approach to participatory mapping in the agrarian region of Montes de María in Colombia's Caribbean, this article analyzes the links between armed conflict, shifting land orders, and the moral economies that informed peasant politics. It exposes the incomplete and complex processes of space-making produced by armed conflict, as well as the ambivalent and shifting character of peasant political strategies in the context of violence.",I am grateful to the community members who participated in my research project and guided its questions.

Present in these seeds are compounds that have been described as selective antiproliferative agents for cancer cells. The aim of this study was to evaluate the antiproliferative activity of ethanol macerate extract (EMCHS) obtained from A. cherimola seeds against the human stomach gastric adenocarcinoma (AGS) cell line and the normal human gastric epithelial cell line (GES-1). The EMCHS extract presented an IC50 of 80.43 μg/mL in AGS cells, and a selectivity index (SI) of 3.5-fold higher than that of cisplatin. In addition, the EMCHS extract showed apoptotic activity in AGS cells since 50 μg/mL. Overxpression of PUMA gene in both cells demonstrate that EMCHS activate the apoptotic route. Future studies should be carried out to elucidate anticancer activity of EMCHS in vivo.

1191,pub.1112233582,10.1017/qua.2018.143,,,Ecology and paleoenvironmental application of testate amoebae in peatlands of the high-elevation Colombian páramo,"Abstract We investigated the ecology and paleoecology of testate amoebae in peatlands of the Colombian páramo to assess the use of testate amoebae as paleoenvironmental indicators. Objectives were to (1) identify environmental controls on testate amoebae, (2) develop transfer functions for paleoenvironmental inference, and (3) examine testate amoebae in a Holocene peat core and compare our findings with other proxy records. Results from 96 modern samples indicate that testate amoebae are sensitive to pH and surface moisture, and cross-validation of transfer functions indicates potential for paleoenvironmental applications. Testate amoebae from the Triunfo Peatland in the Central Cordillera provided a proxy record of pH and water-table depth for the late Holocene, and inferred changes were correlated with peat C/N measurements during most of the record. Comparison with a lake-level reconstruction suggests that at least the major testate amoeba–inferred changes were driven by climate. Our work indicates that testate amoebae are useful paleoenvironmental indicators in high-elevation tropical peatlands.","Fieldwork and sample collection costs were supported by a Lehigh University Faculty Grant for International Connections to RKB.

Then, identifying the most influential attributes considered by exporters and importers when choosing a port is crucial when planning major infrastructure projects. This paper evaluates the port choice decision when competition between ports exists by using several data sources, including the official records of imports and exports in Colombia. Results show that the cost of port access, the frequency of maritime lines, maritime freight rates, maritime travel time, origin or destination and the type of cargo, play a key role in the port selection process. Major infrastructure projects influence port choice mainly through their impact on perceived costs. Policies and strategies aimed to improve the efficiency of a port’s operation and their levels of service, such as increasing the frequencies of lines or decreasing maritime freight and transit times, could have a substantial impact on demand.","We want to acknowledge Findeter and the General Royalties System, for having partially financed this work through the project Diamante Caribe y Santanderes (Cod. 2014000100012).

A corpus of 1,882 texts, corresponding to the genres used to teach in the school textbooks of Science, Language, Mathematics, and History, was analyzed. The analysis was performed manually using a taxonomy that incorporates and adapts criteria developed in the Cognitive approach to Coherence Relations and in the Connectivity Model. Results show that while some relations are used across school subjects (Conjunction, Concept Description), others are used almost exclusively in certain school subjects (Condition-Event in Science, Basic Contrast in History, Deictic in Language, and Condition-Question in Mathematics). Considering that types of coherence relations are different in terms of internal complexity, these results may represent relevant information for classroom instruction, primary school textbook design, and text comprehension research.",,This research was supported by grant FONDECYT 1160094 from the National Commission for Scientific and Technological Research (CONICYT).,Discourse Processes,,,,2019-01-23,2019,2019-01-23,2019-11-17,56,8,764-785,Closed,Article,"Ibáñez, Romualdo; Moncada, Fernando; Cárcamo, Benjamín","Ibáñez, Romualdo (Instituto de Literatura y Ciencias del Lenguaje Pontificia Universidad Católica de Valparaíso, Viña del Mar, Chile); Moncada, Fernando (Instituto de Literatura y Ciencias del Lenguaje, Pontificia Universidad Católica de Valparaíso, Viña del Mar, Chile); Cárcamo, Benjamín (Instituto de Literatura y Ciencias del Lenguaje, Pontificia Universidad Católica de Valparaíso, Viña del Mar, Chile)","Ibáñez, Romualdo (Pontificial Catholic University of Valparaiso)","Ibáñez, Romualdo (Pontificial Catholic University of Valparaiso); Moncada, Fernando (Pontificial Catholic University of Valparaiso); Cárcamo, Benjamín (Pontificial Catholic University of Valparaiso)",10,2,,8.43,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1111644919,"47 Language, Communication and Culture; 4704 Linguistics",

The educational context has been no exception. Examining the way peace and violence are enacted or reproduced through discourse in school settings can help to inform processes of positive social transformation. In this paper, I present a critical microethnographic study on the potential of classroom discourse for peacebuilding in a fifth grade classroom of a public school on the north coast of Colombia. By focusing on an episode of classroom life, which samples a peacebuilding pedagogy but, at the same time, raises issues about discourse patterns that may perpetuate symbolic violence, I draw attention to the relationships between the grammar of interactions and the social structures that are invoked through discourse choices. This analysis can provide theoretical and practical inspiration for reconstructing interactions that more solidly contribute to peacebuilding.",,,Linguistics and Education,,,,2019-12,2019,,2019-12,54,,100762,Closed,Article,"Calle-Díaz, Luzkarime","Calle-Díaz, Luzkarime (Universidad del Norte, Km. 5 Via Puerto Colombia, Barranquilla, Colombia)","Calle-Díaz, Luzkarime (Universidad del Norte)","Calle-Díaz, Luzkarime (Universidad del Norte)",5,5,,2.98,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1122473438,39 Education; 3901 Curriculum and Pedagogy,"16 Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions"

Although no historical eruptions have occurred, the potential thread is inferred from the predominance of dacitic pyroclastic units and lava domes since the Holocene. This paper presents new stratigraphical and compositional data of the uppermost and thickest proximal pyroclastic deposits exposed on the current inner and outer SE crater rim. The studied eruption units correspond to parallel and low-angle cross-bedded vitric-crystalline to lithic-crystalline tuffs. The absence of interbedded paleosols or epiclastic deposits indicates continuous eruptive activity throughout the studied succession. Criteria for stratigraphic package division at proximal sites includes erosive contacts, marked changes in grain sizes, and ballistic-bearing horizons. Each package comprises several bedsets consisting of two to three beds of distinctive lithofacies associations suggesting deposition from diluted pyroclastic density currents. Temporary partial or total conduit obstruction conditions could also be inferred from the presence of ballistic horizons. Petrographical and geochemical analyses from a type-bedset with fresh, poorly to moderately vesicular rhyolitic glassy particles and the mineral association Pl + Amp + Bt + Fe-Ti oxides ± Qz microcrysts suggest the presence of juvenile material. Textures and mineralogy of glassy ash particles are the same as those in large ballistic blocks, which are dacitic in whole-rock composition. Geochemical analyses suggest that magma evolution was mainly controlled by Pl + Amp + Bt + Py + Fe-Ti oxides fractionation and magma recharge events. All Pl and Amp microcrysts in the studied juvenile ash and ballistics can be grouped into two populations: (i) unzoned microcrysts and (ii) zoned microcrysts. Zoned microcrysts have evolved and partially corroded cores, coated by a more Mg-rich (Amp) or An-rich (Pl) mantle, and followed by an outermost Fe-rich (Amp) or Ab-rich (Pl) rim that broadly overlaps with the composition of the unzoned microcrysts. Textures, mineral composition, and pre-eruptive conditions obtained from similar-sized Amp, Pl and Fe-Ti oxide microcrysts within the juvenile ash and a juvenile ballistic provide evidence of complex crystallization paths before final decompression and eruption.","This study was funded by the University of Los Andes FAPA-inner grant allocated to N.

Styrofoam items suggest fishing or aquaculture activities as potential sea-based sources of FMD.

We examined modern and fossil benthic foraminiferal assemblages, isotopic values in tests of Ammonia tepida (δ18O-foram and δ13C-foram), δ13C in organic matter (δ13C-org), and sediment elemental ratios (Fe/Ca, Ca/Ti, and K/Rb) to reconstruct salinity variations, coastal processes, and the morphologic evolution of a partially closed coastal lagoon. We identified four main periods of environmental change: (1) From ~7800 to 6500 cal. yr. BP, the core site was an open lagoon with higher oceanic influence than today, through the presence of a southern mouth, as evidenced by the euryhaline assemblage Ammonia-Quinqueloculina-Bolivina-Nonionella. Low δ18O-foram and high δ13C values on foraminifera shells indicate greater inputs of seawater, and δ13C-org values reflect a lagoon environment. Elemental ratios of lower Fe/Ca, moderate Ca/Ti, and higher K/Rb suggest increased coastal weathering and reduced detrital deposits than today. (2) From ~6500 to 4600 cal. yr. BP., the lagoon experienced the progressive closure of the southern mouth, to the point that sedimentation restricted seawater entrance, as evidenced by variable δ13C-org values, a lowering trend in δ18O-foram and δ13C-foram values, low Fe/Ca, higher Ca/Ti but moderate K/Rb values. At this time, benthic foraminifera were dominated by the opportunistic Ammonia-Elphidium polyhaline assemblage. (3) From ~4600 to 1400 cal. yr. BP, the northern mouth was the only source of seawater to the lagoon, establishing the optimal environment for calcareous foraminifera of the polyhaline assemblage Ammonia-Elphidium. Lowest δ13C-org values indicate greater organic input by terrestrial plants. (4) At 1400 cal. yr. BP, modern conditions of a partially closed lagoon were established, while increased terrigenous inputs and freshwater runoff favored the growth of agglutinated foraminifera species. At millennial time scales, in addition to the sea level rise effects, the lagoon evolution fits in the paleoclimatic context that links insolation, the latitudinal change of ITCZ, ocean currents, longshore drift and moisture transport, as driving factors of morphological change in the western coast of the Gulf of Mexico.","We are grateful to Gerardo Martínez Jardines, Inés Ramos, and Astrid Vázquez Salgado for their valuable help at the Laboratorio Nacional de Geoquímica y Mineralogía, where some of the analyses were carried out.

The incorporation of CuNPs slightly affected the physical and chemical properties of the films. Microscopic surface structure (SEM), energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis confirmed the presence of elemental copper and the crystalline structure of the CuNPs in the hybrid matrix. The surface properties of CuNPs were studied by XPS analyses. The antimicrobial activity of CuNPs coated with chitosan (QO)/gelatine (GE) compared to the QO/GE matrix alone was investigated, using the agar diffusion and culture medium methods in Mueller-Hinton. The evaluation was performed using the Gram-negative bacterium E. coli and the Gram positive bacterium E. faecalis. The investigated microspheres showed antimicrobial activity. Hybrid microspheres with 40 mg of Cu, evaluated in liquid medium, inhibited the growth of E. coli by 56% and of E. faecalis by 40% compared to the matrix hybridised alone; in solid medium, the inhibition was 2.5-fold and 2.6-fold, respectively.

Since the Miocene, a number of species radiations across different Neotropical lineages coincided with the rise of the Andes and the formation of the Isthmus of Panama. The species-rich genus Philodendron Schott (Araceae) is widely distributed across Neotropical rainforests, originating in the Late Oligocene and diversifying more intensely from the Miocene onward. It is likely that its diversification process and distribution patterns are associated with recent geological changes in the Americas. To test this hypothesis, we sampled the species diversity of Philodendron across its entire geographic range and used a combination of three non-coding plastid regions (petD, rpl16, and trnK/matK) to obtain a comprehensive time-calibrated phylogeny. We then inferred geographic range evolution and explored the impact of the Andean orogeny on speciation, extinction, and dispersal. The genus Philodendron originated 29 million years ago (mya) and experienced the earliest diversification events 25 mya in the Pan-Amazonian rainforests. From the Middle Miocene onward, multiple geographic range expansion events occurred from Amazonia to southeast Brazil and to the area which would become the Choc and the northern Andes. From the Pliocene onward, Philodendron reached Central America and the Caribbean islands, and Andean lineages recolonized and diversified in Amazonia. In Philodendron, higher diversification rates are found in the adjacent lowland rainforests of the northern Andes compared with other regions in the Neotropics, demonstrating a potential indirect impact of the Andean uplift on species radiations in lowland regions.",,,Annals of the Missouri Botanical Garden,,,,2019-03-07,2019,2019-03-07,,104,1,49-68,Closed,Article,"Canal, Dubn; Kster, Nils; Celis, Marcela; Croat, Thomas B.; Borsch, Thomas; Jones, Katy E.","Canal, Dubn (Botanischer Garten und Botanisches Museum Berlin, Freie Universit, t Berlin, K, nigin-Luise-Stra, e 6-8, D-14195 Berlin, Germany.); Kster, Nils (Botanischer Garten und Botanisches Museum Berlin, Freie Universit, t Berlin, K, nigin-Luise-Stra, e 6-8, D-14195 Berlin, Germany.); Celis, Marcela (Departamento de Qu, mica y Biolog, a, Universidad del Norte, Km. 5 V, a Puerto Colombia, Barranquilla, Colombia.; Jard, n Bot, nico Jos, Celestino Mutis, Av.

The influence of B-doping and annealing treatment on properties of BGZO films was investigated. The results indicate that all samples have hexagonal wurtzite structure with (002) preferential orientation and the film crystallinity is improved with increasing annealing temperature.

This pilot experience aims to acquire an incipient understanding of the potential of this practice as a training mechanism for teaching staff. A qualitative method was used to record the mindfulness meditation practice experiences of teachers and instructors being trained; the trainees comprise the teaching staff that coordinates a learning environment called Context and region: Introduction to systemic thinking at Ibague University. A qualitative record and analysis process of the narratives of the practice experience were conducted based on the voices of the participants. Categories demonstrating aspects perceived as favorable or annoying with regard to the practice of mindfulness emerged. Benefits are perceived by participants in the following order: awareness, well-being, gratitude, and attention toward the other and oneself in the relationship. The annoyances are referred to as perceptions of physical discomfort present at the time of practicing mindfulness. The experience allowed a practical pilot that was shared with the team supporting the incorporation of attitudes related to the teaching role, personal experience, and the composition of teaching staff.","The authors would like to thank Ibagué University for the time, subjects, and in kind resources to develop the research and the Systemic Thinking Unit from Ibagué University, unit which researchers belong.",,Human Arenas,,,,2019-11-11,2019,2019-11-11,2020-09,3,3,360-367,Closed,Article,"Mazorco Salas, Julio Eduardo; Cuenca Botero, Andrea Carolina","Mazorco Salas, Julio Eduardo (System Thinking Research Group MYSCO, Universidad de Ibagué, Ibagué, Tolima, Colombia); Cuenca Botero, Andrea Carolina (Pontificia Bolivariana University, Medellín, Antioquia, Colombia)","Mazorco Salas, Julio Eduardo (Universidad de Ibagué)","Mazorco Salas, Julio Eduardo (Universidad de Ibagué); Cuenca Botero, Andrea Carolina (Pontifical Bolivarian University)",2,1,,1.75,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1122485221,"44 Human Society; 4410 Sociology; 47 Language, Communication and Culture; 4702 Cultural Studies; 50 Philosophy and Religious Studies; 5004 Religious Studies",

The objective of this study was to determine which stigma dimensions were associated with QoL in a sample of community-dwelling SZ subjects of three Latin-American countries. Stabilized outpatients with SZ were recruited in three Mental Health Services in three Latin-American countries: Bolivia (N = 83), Chile (N = 85) and Peru (N = 85). Stigma and Qol-SZ were evaluated by self-administered questionnaires, the Internalized Stigma of Mental Illness scale (ISMI-12) and the SQoL-18. 253 participants were included. In multivariate analyses, QoL has been associated with each stigma dimension (social stigma, stigma experience and self-stigma), independently of age, gender, education level, ethnicity, age at illness onset, illness symptomatology and mental health treatment. More specifically, social stigma was significantly associated with impaired psychological and physical well-being, self-esteem and friendship. Self-stigma was significantly associated with impaired psychological well-being, self-esteem and autonomy. The present results confirm the importance of stigma in QoL of SZ subjects and identify new targets to develop stigma-orientated programs. Most of the previous programs have focused on self-stigma while social stigma has shown to be associated with a wide range of impaired QoL areas. Stigma and QoL may have a bidirectional relationship and targeting some specific QoL areas (like autonomy through self-empowerment approaches) may also improve the effectiveness of these programs to reduce stigma impact on the quality of life of subjects with schizophrenia. Future studies should also explore differences across countries as subjects from Bolivia were more frequently Aymara and reported higher stigma and lower QoL than SZ subjects from other countries.",,,European Archives of Psychiatry and Clinical Neuroscience,,,Adult; Bolivia; Chile; Female; Humans; Male; Mental Health Services; Middle Aged; Outpatients; Peru; Quality of Life; Schizophrenia; Schizophrenic Psychology; Self Concept; Social Stigma,2019-06-25,2019,2019-06-25,2020-08,270,5,513-520,Closed,Article,"Caqueo-Urízar, Alejandra; Urzúa, Alfonso; Habib, Julia; Loundou, Anderson; Boucekine, Mohamed; Boyer, Laurent; Fond, Guillaume","Caqueo-Urízar, Alejandra (Instituto de Alta Investigación, Universidad de Tarapacá, Arica, Chile); Urzúa, Alfonso (Universidad Católica del Norte, Avda.

In particular, it addresses a gap in the financial portfolio optimization literature concerning the non-trivial correlation between stock return variance and the intensity of price jumps. The model permits closed-form representations for the optimal strategy and value functions in an expected utility theory setting. It also produces analytical expressions for the value function associated with relevant suboptimal strategies. Such an analytical setting allows for the first wealth-equivalent utility loss (WEL) analysis of the pitfalls of ignoring the aforementioned dependence. The model and results can be easily extended to the pair intensity-covariance in multi-assets. The WEL analysis is carried out for three different suboptimal classes: tailor-made incomplete markets, misspecifications in the parameters of the model, and time-independent (myopic) strategies. For the numerical section, we focus on the correlation between jump intensity and stock variance, which is assumed to be either zero or one in the existing literature. We demonstrate that simplistic assumptions like perfect dependence or independence could lead to wealth-equivalent losses of up to 61%. Similarly, a failure to hedge these variances and intensity drivers could cause losses of up to 95% (in particular, up to 60% due to the factors driving the dependence).",Harold A.

Assuming stochastic demand under continuous modeling of the workforce, the methodology decomposes the multiskilling problem into three stages that are then solved sequentially. The first stage delivers a novel analytic expression for estimating the number of multiskilled employees required by each store department, the second stage applies constructive heuristics to these estimates to generate a feasible set of closed chaining structures, and the third stage uses Monte Carlo simulation and a linear programming model to evaluate the chains so generated. The results show that in unbalanced systems, the solutions involve closed long chains and closed short chains of different lengths, which are robust to demand variability, minimize the expected total cost of staff shortages, and exhibit the best cost-effective performance. The methodology provides a tool for company decision makers to address the three fundamental multiskilling issues in unbalanced systems, namely, where to add multiskilling, how much to add and how it should be added.",This research was supported by CONICYT under Grant 499/17-03-2009 and 2012 MISTI global seed funds (MIT-Chile Seed Funds for the 2012-2013 grant cycle: Grant Recipient Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile; Name project – Assessing the impact of Labor Flexibility in Shift Scheduling).

Images of the model pile and the surrounding soil were captured during axial loading through the observation windows using digital cameras and were subsequently analyzed using the digital image correlation (DIC) technique to generate the displacement and strain fields in the sand domain. The shaft resistances mobilized during the experiments were obtained using load cells placed at the head and the base of the model piles. The results obtained from the load tests revealed that reversal of loading direction substantially reduces the unit shaft resistance. This response was attributed to a drop in the radial strain exhibited by the soil elements surrounding the model pile shaft, which could be explained by a misalignment of the principal axes of the stress and fabric tensors resulting from load reversal. The results also indicated that the tensile-to-compressive shaft resistance ratio of fresh preinstalled piles is always nearly one.","The authors would like to acknowledge the support from the Instituto para el Desarrollo de la Ciencia y Tecnología en Colombia, Colciencias.",,Journal of Geotechnical and Geoenvironmental Engineering,,,,2019-06-27,2019,2019-06-27,2019-09,145,9,04019041,Closed,Article,"Galvis-Castro, Ayda C.; Tovar-Valencia, Ruben D.; Salgado, Rodrigo; Prezzi, Monica","Galvis-Castro, Ayda C.

                    activities by both groups has subsided, their conflicting ideologies are visible in several contexts in
                    today’s polarized Colombia. We tend to think about conflict in terms of bullets and people in military
                    uniforms, but discourses of conflict are also evident in popular culture, such as music. In this paper, we

                    with sexist ideas as the representation of manliness. Moreover, there is an almost total absence of peaceful
                    actions in the lyrics, and an exaltation of brutality and terrorism. In a political context which cries out

This is the largest member of the Ommastrephidae family and grows to 2 m in length, making it one of the largest luminescent animals ever observed. Humboldt squid have small photophores all over their body that emit a brilliant blue luminescence. Using lyophilized photophores from squid caught off the coast of Chile, experiments were conducted to isolate the luciferin and protein involved in its bioluminescence. Methanolic extracts of the photophores were shown to contain dehydrocoelenterazine, and a membrane-bound photoprotein was shown to be involved. This photoprotein was purified using ion exchange chromatography, and SDS-PAGE showed a clean band of approximately 60 kDa. The excised band was analyzed by LC/MS, and the obtained data were compared against the transcriptome data of D. gigas, allowing us to find two gene products which displayed high coverage (>80%), the enzymes symplectin and vanin-2, which potentially associate with light emission process in this organism. Finally, the purified photoprotein was shown to emit a blue light (470 nm) in the presence of dehydrocoelenterazine.","Acknowledgements We wish to thank Héctor Pujado from Pesquera Orizon, Chile, for providing the squids for this study.

However, despite all of the recent efforts aimed at producing new test methods and better road materials, HMA rutting is still prevalent, particularly in hot regions and/or on highways with heavy truck-traffic loading. Laboratory testing to screen HMA mixes against rutting during the HMA mix-design stage thus constitute a vital step towards optimizing field performance. In this Texas case study, five laboratory test methods were comparatively evaluated for quantifying and screening four HMA mixes’ rutting resistance potential relative to their field performance on in-service highway test sections under conventional traffic loading and climatic conditions. The five test methods included the dynamic modulus (DM), flow number (FN), repeated load permanent deformation (RLPD), simple punching shear test (SPST), and Hamburg wheel tracking tester (HWTT), respectively. The four HMA mixes evaluated included commonly used Texas fine-, coarse-, and porous-graded mixes. The data for the study, both laboratory and field performance including climate (temperatures) and traffic loading, were all extracted from Texas flexible pavements and overlays database, namely the Texas Data Storage System denoted as the DSS. Overall, all the laboratory test predictions correlated well with the actual measured field performance data, with the HWTT and SPST tests exhibiting superiority over the other test methods. As theoretically expected, the coarse-graded HMA mix out-performed the other mixes, with the fine- and porous-graded mixes being at the lower end of the spectrum.","Acknowledgement and disclaimer The authors thank the Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT) and the FHWA for their support, in particular to the Texas flexible pavements and overlays database (the DSS) project that valuably served as the data source for the work presented in this paper.

The activated sawdust shows very irregular shapes and pores, and a high capacity to remove ammonium (87.0%), iron (70.2%) and copper (61.1%). As well, it has the capacity to remove humic acid (18.3%), COD (33.7%) and colour (19.5%). Also, a removal of organic matter was obtained in terms of COD (76.4%), colour (74.9%), nitrate (50.0%), ammonium (12.8%) and humic acid (73.3%) due to the joint action of ozone and solar photo-Fenton process. The overall treatment (filtration, adsorption, photo-Fenton and photo-Fenton + ozone) carried out showed a very high removal of pollutants, with a reduction of COD, colour, ammonium and humic acid of 95.1%, 95.0%, 94.5% and 97.9%, respectively. With this enhancement in the landfill leachate (LL) quality, there is a reduction of toxicity, obtaining with the LL 50% diluted, a germination index for Lactuca sativa of 20% GI. This shows that the incorporation of sawdust is a useful pretreatment of photo-Fenton in the treatment of landfill leachate.","The authors thank to the Chilean Ministry of Education and its FONDECYT-Postdoctoral project (n° 3180297) for the financial support, the FONDEQUIP project (n° 150109) for the equipment support and the Central Laboratory for Marine Aquaculture of the Marine Sciences Department of the Universidad Católica del Norte for equipment support.",,Journal of Environmental Management,,,"Hydrogen Peroxide; Iron; Oxidation-Reduction; Ozone; Water Pollutants, Chemical",2019-10-18,2019,2019-10-18,2020-01,253,,109697,Closed,Article,"Poblete, Rodrigo; Pérez, Norma","Poblete, Rodrigo (Universidad Católica del Norte, Facultad de Ciencias del Mar, Escuela de Prevención de Riesgos y Medioambiente, Chile); Pérez, Norma (Universidad Católica del Norte, Facultad de Ciencias del Mar, Departamento de Acuicultura, Chile)","Poblete, Rodrigo (Catholic University of the North)","Poblete, Rodrigo (Catholic University of the North); Pérez, Norma (Catholic University of the North)",38,20,2.53,4.11,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1121886774,40 Engineering; 4004 Chemical Engineering; 4011 Environmental Engineering; 41 Environmental Sciences; 4104 Environmental Management,

Nevertheless, in many situations TURFs are not able to meet all their goals, jeopardizing their continuity. Here we explore one of several innovations on TURFs, mixed TURF-aquaculture systems, which can help overcome the challenges of maintaining sustainable socio-ecological systems. We analyzed the history of mixed TURF and small-scale aquaculture systems in Chile, particularly 8 recent learning platforms in the Coquimbo region. Additionally, we assessed the impact of 6 variables, from multiple spheres, on the implementation of mixed TURF-aquaculture systems. Despite low values in several variables, 75% of the learning platforms managed to implement aquaculture systems and 38% have been successful in developing monitoring efforts. Social capital was key in the implementation of the mixed systems. By investing in social capital policy makers can contribute to the successful implementation of mixed TURF-aquaculture systems, thus promoting a livelihood diversification strategy for fishing communities that encompasses the economic benefits of aquaculture with the socio-ecological benefits of TURFs. However, their development and enabling conditions must be monitored to embrace their synergies.","The authors are grateful to all the fishers&#x27; associations and the members of the Aquaculture in TURFs Program working group within the Coquimbo region who collaborated with this study.

Recently, quantitative tools based on multi-criteria decision-making methods (MCDM) have received more attention; however, studies still have limitations. Such is the case of Fuzzy DEMATEL, which has been proposed in the literature, but not integrated within the whole process of strategy formulation. In addition, studies have presented weaknesses by not considering, for instance, the logical structure of a strategy map. Hence, the main objective of this study is to propose the development of a method that supports the overall process of planning, structuring and validating a business unit strategy while overcoming the limitations of previous works, considering the subjectivity of decision-making in the construction of strategy maps. To fulfil these purposes, this study proposes an extension of the work of Lopez-Ospina et al. (2017) entitled “A method for designing strategy maps using DEMATEL and linear programming”, by integrating fuzzy logic and traditional, conceptual and qualitative tools to support the diagnosis and strategy design. The significant contributions of this work is that it overcomes limitations of previous methods by providing: (1) a logic structure of strategy maps; (2) integration of subjectivity within the overall formulation process of the strategy; (3) selection of the most important relationships between strategy objectives to explain efficiently, functionally, and easily the route map of a strategy; and (4) integration of traditional qualitative tools with quantitative tools, making the process robust and holistic.

This article explores students’ explanations in the context of computational science and engineering, an important interdisciplinary field that enables scientists and engineers to solve complex problems. Specifically, this study explores: (a) students’ approaches to create written explanations of programing code and (b) the relationship between students’ explanations and their ability to do computer programing. Students wrote in-code comments for 3 MATLAB® worked-examples, which were qualitatively analyzed using a coding scheme. Different approaches to self-explain were identified using hierarchical cluster analysis, and differences in students’ ability to do computer programing were identified using analysis of variance. The resulting approaches to self-explain were: original solution, mechanistic, principle-based, limited, and goal-based. The findings suggest that experienced students wrote simple in-code comments to self-explain, but students with lower ability to do computer programing wrote more comprehensive explanations, as they may take this as a learning opportunity.",,The research reported in this article was supported in part by the US National Science Foundation under the awards EEC 1449238 and EEC 1329262.

Indeed, it can be argued that it served as a node for systems of inter-regional exchange. Archaeological evidence indicates that this frontier function may have its origins as early as the Formative Period (1000 B.C.-A.D. 400), a crucial era of regional cultural change. Scholarship from across the social sciences suggests that frontier/border spaces can be dynamic zones of cultural innovation and that prolonged inter-group contact at such spaces can change perception and behavior, notions that we test through isotopic analysis and multi-source mixture modeling of individuals from two distinct precincts of Formative Period Quillagua. Ultimately, based on our paleodietary reconstructions, we find that some individuals from Quillagua were not simply engaged in systems of inter-regional economic exchange, but that their involvement likely fomented the creation of novel cultural forms.","The authors would like to acknowledge the financial support of CONICYT, FONDAP 15110006 and FONDECYT 1160045.

In many cases, such transitions are associated with the evolution of flattened limbs that are used to swim via dorsoventral flapping. Such changes in shape may have been facilitated by changes in limb bone loading in novel aquatic environments. Studies on limb bone loading in turtles found that torsion is high relative to bending loads on land, but reduced compared to bending during aquatic rowing. Release from torsion among rowers could have facilitated the evolution of hydrodynamically advantageous flattened limbs among aquatic species. Because rowing is regarded as an intermediate locomotor stage between walking and flapping, rowing species might show limb bone flattening intermediate between the tubular shapes of walkers and the flattened shapes of flappers. We collected measurements of humeri and femora from specimens representing four functionally divergent turtle clades: sea turtles (marine flappers), softshells (specialized freshwater rowers), emydids (generalist semiaquatic rowers), and tortoises (terrestrial walkers). Patterns of limb bone scaling with size were compared across lineages using phylogenetic comparative methods. Although rowing taxa did not show the intermediate scaling patterns we predicted, our data provide other functional insights. For example, flattening of sea turtle humeri was associated with positive allometry (relative to body mass) for the limb bone diameter perpendicular to the flexion-extension plane of the elbow. Moreover, softshell limb bones exhibit positive allometry of femoral diameters relative to body mass, potentially helping them maintain their typical benthic position in water by providing additional weight to compensate for shell reduction. Tortoise limb bones showed positive allometry of diameters, as well as long humeri, relative to body mass, potentially reflecting specializations for resisting loads associated with digging. Overall, scaling patterns of many turtle lineages appear to correlate with distinctive behaviors or locomotor habits.","The authors wish to thank the following for access to museum specimens: Kenneth Tighe and Addison Wynn (Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History); David Kizirian and Lauren Vonnahme (American Museum of Natural History); Max Alan Nickerson (Florida Museum of Natural History); Steve Rogers (Carnegie Museum of Natural History), and Peter and Sybille Pritchard (Chelonian Research Institute).

In the present study, we examined the encrusting assemblage on different types of stranded debris (wood, plastic, glass, and metal cans) along the Iranian coast of the Persian Gulf. In total, 21 taxa were identified on 132 items. The average frequency of occurrence (±SE) across all sites and stranded debris showed that the barnacle Amphibalanus amphitrite (68.9 ± 1.1%), the oyster Saccostrea cucullata (40.9 ± 0.7%), the polychaete Spirobranchus kraussii (27.3 ± 0.5%), green algae (22 ± 0.5%) and the coral Paracyathus stokesii (14.4 ± 0.7%) occurred most frequently. Relative substratum coverage was highest for A. amphitrite (44.3 ± 2.7%), followed by green algae (14.4 ± 1.5%), Spirobranchus kraussii (9.3 ± 1.3%), Saccostrea cucullata (7.6 ± 1.3%) and the barnacle Microeuraphia permitini (5.8 ± 0.9%). Despite the significant difference in coverage of rafting species on plastic items among different sites, there was no clear and consistent trend of species richness and coverage from the eastern (Strait of Hormuz) to the western part of the Persian Gulf. Some rafting species (bryozoans and likely barnacles) were found to be non-indigenous species in the area. As floating marine debris can transport non-indigenous species and increase the risk of bio-invasions to this already naturally- and anthropogenically-stressed water body, comprehensive monitoring efforts should be made to elucidate the vectors and arrival of new invasive species to the region.","We would like to thank Mahtab Azari and Majid Afkhami for their help in collecting the samples.

They catalyze the hydrolysis of the guanidino group and produce urea. In their active sites six highly conserved amino acid residues form a binding pocket for two catalytically essential metal ions that are needed to activate a water molecule to initiate the hydrolysis of the guanidino group in a nucleophilic attack. Focus in this review is on two members of the ureohydrolase family, the Mn2+-dependent arginase and agmatinase, which play important roles in functions related to replication and cell survival. We will focus in particular on Mn2+ binding interactions, and on how this metal ion contributes to the reaction catalyzed by these enzymes. We also include the agmatinase-like protein (ALP) because it is functionally closely related to agmatinase, also requires at least one Mn2+ ion for catalytic activity, but may possess an active site that differs significantly from all other known ureohydrolases.","This research was supported by a grant from VRID-Enlace (no. 217.037.022-1) of the University of Concepción, Chile.",,Journal of Inorganic Biochemistry,,,Arginase; Catalysis; Manganese; Ureohydrolases,2019-08-26,2019,2019-08-26,2020-01,202,,110812,Closed,Article,"Uribe, Elena; Reyes, María-Belen; Martínez, Ignacio; Mella, Kelly; Salas, Mónica; Tarifeño-Saldivia, Estefanía; López, Vasthi; García-Robles, María; Martínez-Oyanedel, José; Figueroa, Maximiliano; Carvajal, Nelson; Schenk, Gerhard","Uribe, Elena (Departamento de Bioquímica y Biología Molecular, Facultad de Ciencias Biológicas, Universidad de Concepción, Casilla 160-C, Concepción, Chile.

The consumption pattern of large amounts of alcohol on the weekends is rapidly increasing in young adults between 18 and 29 years. Despite various studies that have focused on the noxious effect of alcohol in immunity, the changes in the immunoprofiles of peripheral blood cells have not been completely described. Natural killer cells (NKCs) are lymphoid-origin cells of the immune system that are responsible for defense against tumors, among other functions. In homeostatic conditions, they are found to be in a state of ""dynamic balance"" between activation and inhibition stimuli, which, if broken, may lead to immunosuppression or activation of cytotoxic mechanisms. In this study, we evaluated the immunoprofile of peripheral NKCs of 54 young adults, 29 of whom were binge drinkers and 25 of whom were low risk (LR), as classified by validated tools. Drinking habits were assessed. Blood samples were collected to perform hematic biometry and liver enzyme tests. Peripheral NKCs were identified by FACS, and stained for CCR2, CCR4, CCR5, CXCR4, CD69, CD127, CD137, TLR4, and Granzyme B. The data were analyzed using the t test and Mann-Whitney's U test for contrasts, and the effect size was obtained in order to evaluate the impact of each immunoprofile. The binge group showed increased expression of CCR5 and PD-1 in NKCs, respective to the LR group, and decreased expression of TLR4, along with fewer CCR4+ cells. Moreover, the increase found in CCR5 and PD-1 expression was correlated with the number of drinks in the last drinking session. Our findings show that young binge drinkers have different immunoprofiles that could suggest an early status of immunosuppression and trafficking of NKCs to the liver, which could be related to the onset of early liver damage, early in a subject's lifespan.",,"This research was funded by the Secretaría de Ciencia, Tecnología e Innovación de la Ciudad de México.

From each nest, a set of c. 100 randomly selected eggs were hand-collected and transported in seawater to the laboratory. Subsets of c. 30 eggs per nest were maintained in 50 ml glass containers at a constant ambient temperature of c. 12°C (range 11.5-12.9°C). Egg length (L) and width (W) and larval notochordal length (LN ) were measured from photographs. Geometric morphometric analyses were performed in newly hatched and 1 week old larvae to quantify shape changes. Ellipsoid eggs had an average (mean ± SE) size of 1.12 ± 0.05 mm L and 0.67 ± 0.02 mm W, with volume being similar throughout 15 developmental stages (i.e., ellipsoid-shaped; 0.27 mm3 ). Planktonic larvae hatched between 5 and 11 days at 12°C and had a mean LN of 3.13 ± 0.25 mm, a yolk sack volume of 0.03 mm3 and an oil droplet volume of 0.005 mm3 . Morphological traits at hatching included: (a) lack of paired fins and jaws; (b) single medial fin fold; (c) lack of eye pigmentation; (d) yolk sac present near anterior tip; (e) melanophores distributed along ventral surface with one pair over the forehead. In order to generate an up-to-date summary of developmental traits within Pomacentridae, we reviewed literature on egg development (e.g., shape and number of oil droplets), hatching and larval traits (e.g., morphology, pigmentation patterns). Thirty-two publications accounting for 35 species were selected, where eggs, embryonic development, hatching and larval traits were found for 26, 21, 24 and 34 species, respectively. In order to evaluate potential phylogenetic and environmental relationships within the early stages of Pomacentridae, cluster analyses (Bray Curtis similarity, group average) were also performed on egg and larval traits of 22 species divided by subfamily (Stegastinae, Chrominae, Abudefdufinae, Pomacentrinae) and thermal ranges (i.e., low: 16.5°C (range: 12-21°C), medium: 24.5°C (range:21-28°C) and high: 27°C (range: 26-28°C)), suggesting that early developmental patterns can be segregated by both temperature and phylogenetic relationships.","We thank V.

Furthermore, several studies support a fundamental role of the microbiota on the host health and homeostasis. In this context, the aim of this work was to determine the structure and diversity of the microbiota associated with the scallop Argopecten purpuratus, and to assess changes in community composition and diversity during the host immune response. To do this, adult scallops were immune challenged and sampled after 24 and 48 h. Activation of the immune response was established by transcript overexpression of several scallop immune response genes in hemocytes and gills, and confirmed by protein detection of the antimicrobial peptide big defensin in gills of Vibrio-injected scallops at 24 h post-challenge. Then, the major bacterial community profile present in individual scallops was assessed by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) of 16S rDNA genes and dendrogram analyses, which indicated a clear clade differentiation of the bacterial communities noticeable at 48 h post-challenge. Finally, the microbiota structure and diversity from pools of scallops were characterized using 16S deep amplicon sequencing. The results revealed an overall modulation of the microbiota abundance and diversity according to scallop immune status, allowing for prediction of some changes in the functional potential of the microbial community. Overall, the present study showed that changes in the structure and diversity of bacterial communities associated with the scallop A. purpuratus are detected after the activation of the host immune response. Now, the relevance of microbial balance disruption in the immune capacity of the scallop remains to be elucidated.","We gratefully acknowledge Germán Lira from Laboratorio Central de Cultivos Marinos from UCN for scallop procurement and maintenance, and Rodrigo Rojas for bacteria procurement.

Aquaculture production of this species has had problems associated with intensive fish farming, such as disease outbreaks or nutritional deficiencies causing high mortality. Intestinal microbiota are involved in many processes that benefit a host, such as disease control, stimulation of the immune response, and the promotion of nutrient metabolism. The aim of this study is to evaluate the in vitro probiotic properties of bacteria isolated from the intestinal content of wild Seriola lalandi. The probiotic potential was evaluated in terms of (i) the antimicrobial activity against vibrios causing outbreaks in farmed fish; (ii) the ability to stimulate genes related to an innate immune response in fish; and (iii) antibiotic resistance. Nineteen isolates identified as Pseudomonas, Shewanella, Psychrobacter, and Acinetobacter showed antimicrobial activity and significant relative expression of cytokines, serum amyloid A protein (SAA), hepcidin, and lysozyme. A positive correlation was observed between the levels of expression and the bacterial load after 24 h of exposure. Pseudomonas isolates showed a level of antibiotic resistance. In conclusion, isolates of the genera Shewanella, Psychrobacter, and Acinetobacter could serve as potential probiotics in S. lalandi culture.",CR would like to acknowledge the National Commission of Scientific and Technologic Research (CONICYT) for the funding through the National PhD funding program.,"This project was funded by a research grant from FONDECYT 1140734 and 1171129 (Fondo Nacional de Desarrollo Científico y Tecnológico, Chile) and supported by project Aquapacifico 15PCTI-46284 from Corfo.",Probiotics and Antimicrobial Proteins,,,"Animals; Aquaculture; Bacteria; Drug Resistance, Bacterial; Fishes; Gastrointestinal Microbiome; Probiotics",2019-05-10,2019,2019-05-10,2020-06,12,2,672-682,Closed,Article,"Ramírez, Carolina; Rojas, Rodrigo; Romero, Jaime","Ramírez, Carolina (Laboratorio de Biotecnología de los Alimentos, Instituto de Nutrición y Tecnología de los Alimentos, Universidad de Chile, Santiago, Chile; Doctorado en Acuicultura, Programa Cooperativo Universidad de Chile, Universidad Católica del Norte, Pontificia Universidad Católica de Valparaíso, Santiago, Chile); Rojas, Rodrigo (Laboratorio de Patobiología Acuática, Departamento de Acuicultura, Universidad Católica del Norte, Coquimbo, Chile); Romero, Jaime (Laboratorio de Biotecnología de los Alimentos, Instituto de Nutrición y Tecnología de los Alimentos, Universidad de Chile, Santiago, Chile)","Romero, Jaime (University of Chile)","Ramírez, Carolina (University of Chile; Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile); Rojas, Rodrigo (Catholic University of the North); Romero, Jaime (University of Chile)",16,9,0.84,2.53,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1114054605,31 Biological Sciences; 3107 Microbiology; 3109 Zoology,14 Life Below Water

Driven by this scenario, increasing progress has been made in recent years in the comprehension of immune response mechanisms in this species. However, it is still not entirely understood how different mucosal interfaces participate and cooperate with the immune competent cells, the hemocytes, in the immune defense. Thus, in this work we aimed to characterize the transcriptome of three tissues with immune relevance from A. purpuratus by next-generation sequencing and de novo transcriptome assembly. For this, 18 cDNA libraries were constructed from digestive gland, gills and hemocytes tissues of scallops from different immune conditions and sequenced by the Illumina HiSeq4000 platform. A total of 967.964.884 raw reads were obtained and 967.432.652 clean reads were generated. The clean reads were de novo assembled into 46.601 high quality contigs and 32.299 (69.31%) contigs were subsequently annotated. In addition, three de novo specific assemblies were performed from clean reads obtained from each tissue cDNA libraries for their comparison. Gene ontology (GO) and KEGG analyses revealed that annotated sequences from digestive gland, gills and hemocytes could be classified into both general and specific subcategory terms and known biological pathways, respectively, according to the tissue nature. Finally, several immune related candidate genes were identified, and the differential expression of tissue-specific genes was established, suggesting they could display specific roles in the host defense. The data presented in this study provide the first insight into the tissue specific transcriptome profiles of A. purpuratus, which should be considered for further research on the interplay between the hemocytes and mucosal immune responses.","We gratefully acknowledge Germán Lira from Laboratorio Central de Cultivos from UCN for scallop procurement and maintenance, and Dr. Rodrigo Rojas for bacteria procurement.

943,pub.1111503747,10.1016/j.rcpeng.2017.07.002,,,Depression in pregnancy,"Introduction Depression is the most common psychiatric morbidity in pregnancy, affecting more than 13% of pregnant women. Its diagnosis is based on the criteria established by the DSM-5 and the application of validated scales such as the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale. However, there are still errors and shortcomings among healthcare professionals in the recognition, diagnosis and treatment of depression during pregnancy, with the resulting consequences and repercussions on the gestation itself or the foetus. Objective To present a review of depression in pregnancy, its risk factors, clinical characteristics, complications and treatment. Methods The PubMed and LILACS databases were used to search for manuscripts. Of the 223 articles found, 55 fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Results The prevalence of depression in pregnancy in South America is approximately 29% and the most significant risk factors are sexual abuse, pregnancy at an early age and intrafamily violence. Therefore, early diagnosis favours a reduction in risk behaviour, foetal neurodevelopmental disorders and obstetric outcomes. Conclusions Depression in pregnancy is common condition but is underreported as its symptoms are often attributed to the pregnancy itself. The use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor antidepressants, particularly fluoxetine, which has not been associated with teratogenicity, is recommended, in addition to the implementation of non-pharmacological treatment such as psychotherapy, mindfulness and aerobic exercise.

The objective is to identify the psychological inertia that hinders a change in the behaviour patterns of young people who discriminate against women. We explore the presence of significant differences in the variables under study according to gender; we analyze the relationship between sexist attitudes and cognitive and social strategies; and we explore whether the variable, “gender”, can predict cognitive and social strategies and attitudes that impede the shift towards a more egalitarian treatment of women. We analyze sexist attitudes and cognitive and social strategies that encourage the inertia of psychological inaction in 1034 high school students. Two instruments were used to evaluate the variables under study: 1. ISA-Adolescents. Inventory of Ambivalent Sexism for Adolescents; 2. AECS. Questionnaire on Social Cognitive Strategies and Attitudes. The results show that these young people do not present cognitive and social strategies that make such change difficult. We verify that men do have sexist attitudes to a greater extent than women, and we show that gender can predict the psychological inertia that makes the change in sexist behaviour patterns more difficult. In the same way, we have observed significant correlations between the variables under study. This work stresses the need to incorporate educational measures that favour an egalitarian, cognitive and socio-emotional development in both regulated education and alternative educational programmes.",,,Current Psychology,,,,2019-06-12,2019,2019-06-12,2021-08,40,8,3671-3681,Closed,Article,"Blázquez-Alonso, Macarena; Moreno-Manso, Juan Manuel; Fernández de la Cruz, Marta; García-Baamonde, Ma.

Objective To describe the actions of Physiotherapy in Primary Health Care (PHC), in two institutions of low level of complexity in the city of Popayán, Colombia. Materials and methods A descriptive, observational, non-probabilistic, cross-sectional study conducted in two institutions of low complexity of health care, located in the city of Popayán. Two survey-type questionnaires were used: the first one was for patients attended by physiotherapy (n=139); the second, for the health team of the institutions (n=20), to determine the participation of physiotherapy in PHC, in the first semester of 2017. Results The majority of patients seen were women (63.3%). They had arterial hypertension (22.3%), and consulted for skeletomuscular diseases (44.6%). A large majority (73.1%) had access to the physiotherapy service on their own initiative or by recommendation of another person, although 75% preferred to consult the general practitioner before going to the physiotherapist From the health team, 100% of the physiotherapists state that they have the capacity and knowledge to treat pathologies of low complexity in health, without having to make a medical referral. Most (95%) of the professionals considered it essential for PHC to use physiotherapy, and all (100%) of them considered it necessary to participate in physiotherapy in health promotion actions, and 95% in actions to prevent disease.

Self‐medication rates are high, and prescription‐only medicines are often available without a prescription. Patients rely more on pharmacists’ advice than clinicians’, but conflicts of interest are rampant: companies may offer discounts, extra drugs, or a higher profit margin to pharmacy owners; pharmacy staff recommendations may be compromised by lack of education or financial incentives, including bonuses and commissions for recommending specific drugs. Pharmacists and staff rely on pharmaceutical company education on drugs. Pharmacy chains, which tend to provide poorer service, are replacing family owned pharmacies in most Latin American countries.

The harmful effects of both processes are reflected in climate change. This article examines the equilibrium and causality relationship among urban concentration, non-renewable energy consumption, and the real per capita output in 110 countries during 1971–2017. Using data from the World Bank’s World Development Indicators (2018), we classify countries into four groups according to their level of development. Our evidence suggests that urban concentration has a negative effect on real per capita output in high-income countries, while non-renewable energy consumption has a positive effect on all groups of countries. The cointegration tests show that there is short- and long-term equilibrium in all groups of countries. The results of the DOLS and PDOLS models indicate that the strength of the cointegration vector is weak in most of the countries and groups analyzed. The Granger-type causality tests show that there is bidirectional causality from the real per capita output to the urban concentration in high and middle-low-income countries. There is unidirectional causality from the population concentration towards the real per capita output in the low-income countries; from the non-renewable energy consumption to the real per capita output in high-income countries; from the real per capita output to the non-renewable energy consumption in the countries of medium-high and medium-low income; and from urban concentration to non-renewable energy consumption in high- and medium-high-income countries. Our results highlight the importance of promoting policies of urban planning and generation and consumption of renewable energy without limiting the expansion of the output.","The authors express their gratitude to the Club de Investigación de Economía (CIE), Loja Ecuador.",,Environmental Science and Pollution Research,,,Carbon Dioxide; Cities; Economic Development; Energy-Generating Resources; Income; Renewable Energy; Urbanization,2019-12-13,2019,2019-12-13,2020-01,27,3,2760-2772,Closed,Article,"Alvarado, Rafael; Ortiz, Cristian; Bravo, Diana; Chamba, José","Alvarado, Rafael (Carrera de Economía, Universidad Nacional de Loja, Loja, Ecuador); Ortiz, Cristian (Carrera de Economía, Universidad Nacional de Loja, Loja, Ecuador; Departamento de Economía, Universidad Católica del Norte, Antofagasta, Chile); Bravo, Diana (Departamento de Economía, Universidad Técnica Particular de Loja, Loja, Ecuador); Chamba, José (Carrera de Economía, Universidad Nacional de Loja, Loja, Ecuador)","Alvarado, Rafael (Universidad Nacional de Loja)","Alvarado, Rafael (Universidad Nacional de Loja); Ortiz, Cristian (Universidad Nacional de Loja; Catholic University of the North); Bravo, Diana (Universidad Técnica Particular de Loja); Chamba, José (Universidad Nacional de Loja)",26,6,0.64,11.55,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1123348628,38 Economics; 3801 Applied Economics; 3802 Econometrics; 44 Human Society; 4404 Development Studies,13 Climate Action; 7 Affordable and Clean Energy

This study aimed to investigate whether there is value in adding TMJ treatments to routine physiotherapy in patients with non-specific chronic neck pain compared with a control group.
METHODS: A randomized, single-blind, clinical study desined including two groups of patients. Group A (20 people) received routine physiotherapy for neck pain and group B (20 people) received TMJ manual therapy plus exercise therapy in addition to routine physiotherapy for neck pain. The Treatment program included six sessions for two days a week over a period of 21 days. Assessments were performed during the first session, in the last session and one month after treatment as a follow-up. Outcome measures included neck range of motion (ROM), neck disability index (NDI) and visual analogue scale (VAS). Before starting the study, the reliability of methods for measuring neck ROM was evaluated.
RESULTS: Participants were 21 women and 19 men. Initially, a pilot study was carried out on the 40 volunteers to assess the reliability of the measurement methods, and the results were acceptable. With both the control group and the intervention group, the indexes showed significant improvement (p < 0.001), although the intervention group showed more improvement (p < 0.001).
CONCLUSION: This result means adding treatments of TMJ to routine neck physiotherapy can magnify the effect of the intervention, a significant change still in evidence at follow up. Moreover, given the clinically important differences, our results for VAS and NDI were acceptable.","This research was supported by the University of Social Welfare and Rehabilitation Sciences, Tehran, Iran.",,Journal of Bodywork and Movement Therapies,,,"Chronic Pain; Disability Evaluation; Female; Humans; Male; Neck Pain; Physical Therapy Modalities; Pilot Projects; Range of Motion, Articular; Reproducibility of Results; Single-Blind Method; Temporomandibular Joint; Treatment Outcome",2019-11-22,2019,2019-11-22,2020-04,24,2,202-212,Closed,Article,"Ghodrati, Maryam; Mosallanezhad, Zahra; Shati, Mohsen; Noroozi, Mehdi; Moghadam, Afsun Nodehi; Rostami, Mohamad; Nourbakhsh, Mohammad Reza","Ghodrati, Maryam (Health and Rehabilitation Sciences Program, University of Western Ontario, London, Canada.); Mosallanezhad, Zahra (Department of Physical Therapy and Research Center of Aging, University of Social Welfare and Rehabilitation Sciences (USWR), Tehran, Iran.

Design/methodology/approach Semi-structured interviews were conducted for 30 staff of the state-owned Abu Dhabi National Oil Company in the UAE. The interviewees were purposively selected which included both those in leadership and non-leadership roles.   Findings The findings revealed that the interviewees viewed HSE culture as a descriptive term, a causal phenomenon, a systemic approach or a legal requirement/obligation. Interviewees in the production and maintenance units mentioned safety most often. Employees and managers exhibited negligible differences in their usage of the HSE culture concept. Managers predominantly featured in the narratives as important drivers of HSE culture. Physical conditions, behavior and procedures, management, competence and collaboration emerged as important components of a sound HSE culture.   Originality/value To enable better communication and subsequent improvement of the HSE culture, an analogical HSE culture “vehicle” was developed in the study. The vehicle is a novel illustration based on the key roles of managers and employees, as well as the main components of a sound HSE culture.",,,Journal of Engineering Design and Technology,,,,2019-10-03,2019,,2019-10-03,18,2,495-512,Closed,Article,"Almazrouei, Mohmaed; Khalid, Khalizani; Abdallah, Salam; Davidson, Ross","Almazrouei, Mohmaed (Abu Dhabi University, Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates); Khalid, Khalizani (Abu Dhabi University, Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates); Abdallah, Salam (Abu Dhabi University, Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates); Davidson, Ross (Abu Dhabi University, Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates)","Almazrouei, Mohmaed (Abu Dhabi University)","Almazrouei, Mohmaed (Abu Dhabi University); Khalid, Khalizani (Abu Dhabi University); Abdallah, Salam (Abu Dhabi University); Davidson, Ross (Abu Dhabi University)",5,3,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1121483599,33 Built Environment and Design; 40 Engineering,

A narrative review,"The prescribing of Lithium is common in psychiatric clinical practice. The aim of this study was to identify the most common endocrine side effects associated with this drug and to clarify the pathophysiological basis. A systematic review was conducted in Psycinfo, Embase, PubMed, and Scopus. A computerised search for information was performed using a PICO (patient, intervention, comparative, outcomes) strategy. The main neuroendocrine alterations were reported in kidneys, thyroid and parathyroid glands, pancreas, and the communication pathways between the pituitary and adrenal glands. The pathophysiological mechanisms are diverse, and include the inhibition of the thyroid adenylate cyclase sensitive to the thyroid stimulant hormone (TSH) sensitive adenylate cyclase, which causes hypothyroidism. It also reduces the expression of aquaporin type 2, which is associated with nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, and the loss of the ionic balance of calcium that induces hyperparathyroidism and hypercalcaemia. Other considerations are related to alterations in the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and a decrease in the production of catecholamines. Finally, another side-effect is the glycaemic dysregulation caused by the insulin resistance. Periodical clinical and para-clinical evaluations are necessary. The author proposes an evaluation scheme.","To Dr Ricardo Salas Flores, Endocrinologist at the Hospital Regional No. 6 of the Mexican Social Security Institute in Ciudad Madero, Tamaulipas, Mexico, for his suggestions and opinions in this work.",,Revista Colombiana de Psiquiatría (English ed ),,,,2019-01,2019,,2019-01,48,1,35-43,Closed,Article,"García-Maldonado, Gerardo; de Jesús Castro-García, Rubén","García-Maldonado, Gerardo (Hospital Psiquiátrico de Tampico, Secretaría de Salud, Tamaulipas, Mexico; Facultad de Medicina Dr. Alberto Romo Caballero, Universidad Autónoma de Tamaulipas, Tamaulipas, Mexico); de Jesús Castro-García, Rubén (Hospital Psiquiátrico de Tampico, Secretaría de Salud, Tamaulipas, Mexico)","García-Maldonado, Gerardo (Secretaria de Salud; Autonomous University of Tamaulipas)","García-Maldonado, Gerardo (Secretaria de Salud; Autonomous University of Tamaulipas); de Jesús Castro-García, Rubén (Secretaria de Salud)",2,1,,0.64,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1111502097,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3202 Clinical Sciences,

La Tirana is the main Marian sanctuary in the north of Chile. Van Kessel could clearly identify the importance of the religious manda as the main reason of devotion associated with complementary beliefs concerning the Virgin’s miraculous efficacy for those who strictly fulfill her. After nearly fifty years, this study finds out that the manda has tended to disappear and that religious attitudes toward the Virgin have changed; especially those related to the specifications of the fulfillment of the religious promise.

Material and methods A cross-sectional study was conducted in 402 students included through non-probabilistic sampling who answered an anonymous and self-reporting questionnaire that included socio-demographic variables, academic performance (last semester overall grade), presence of IA (Young's Test) and covariates related to IA based on academic performance. Data were analysed by means of proportions, relationships between variables with the χ 2 test and strength of association was estimated with odds ratios (OR) using nominal logistic regression. Results Approximately 24.63% of the students used the Internet much less than the average population, but 75.3% had IA; 73.13% of cases were considered mild and 2.24% moderate. There were no severe cases. Around 5.2% had poor academic performance. In multivariate analysis, the model that best explained IA in relation to academic performance was: studying in lower-level courses (OR=0.54; 95% CI, 0.32–0.91); studying in a different places of the house (OR=3.38; 95% CI, 1.71–6.68); not using laptop for studying (OR=0.41; 95% CI, 0.19–0.89), chatting on mobile phone (OR=2.43; 95% CI, 1.45–3.06); and spending more than 18min on mobile phone while studying (OR=3.20; 95% CI, 1.71–5.99). Conclusions Academic performance was not associated with AI. However, studying in lower-level courses, in a different place of the house, not using laptop to study, and spending more than 18min answering their mobile phone and chatting on mobile phone while studying were covariates statistically associated with IA.","We would like to thank Yheila Figueroa Angulo, Iveth Orellano Badillo and Ana María Zapata for their collaboration in the study.",,Revista Colombiana de Psiquiatría (English ed ),,,,2019-10,2019,,2019-10,48,4,198-207,Closed,Article,"Cárdenas, Shyrley Díaz; Vergara, Katherine Arrieta; Simancas-Pallares, Miguel","Cárdenas, Shyrley Díaz (Departamento de Odontología Preventiva y Social, Facultad de Odontología, Universidad de Cartagena, Cartagena, Colombia); Vergara, Katherine Arrieta (Departamento de Odontología Preventiva y Social, Facultad de Odontología, Universidad de Cartagena, Cartagena, Colombia); Simancas-Pallares, Miguel (Departamento de Investigaciones, Facultad de Odontología, Universidad de Cartagena, Cartagena, Colombia)","Cárdenas, Shyrley Díaz (University of Cartagena)","Cárdenas, Shyrley Díaz (University of Cartagena); Vergara, Katherine Arrieta (University of Cartagena); Simancas-Pallares, Miguel (University of Cartagena)",6,2,,2.23,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1122814750,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3203 Dentistry,

Materials and Methods: Twenty healthy male workers were recruited and assigned to either a moderate-altitude first (MAF group, Test 1: 2900 m and Test 2: 5050 m) or to a high-altitude first (HAF group, Test 1: 5050 m and Test 2: 2900 m). Test 1 was conducted at the beginning and Test 2 at the end of the shift-work week. Processing speed (RTI, reaction time), attention (AST, attention-switching task, and RVP, rapid visual processing), and executive function (OTS, One Touch Stockings of Cambridge) were assessed. Results: Of the three cognitive domains assessed, only processing speed showed altitude-at-test group interaction (RTI median five choice reaction time: F1, 17 = 6.980, [Formula: see text] = 0.291, p = 0.017). With acclimatization, there was a decrease in AST reaction latency mean (t17 = -2.155, dz = 1.086, p = 0.046), an increase in RVP accuracy (t17 = 2.733, dz = 1.398, p = 0.014), and a decrease in OTS mean latency first choice (t17 = -2.375, dz = 1.211, p = 0.03). Decreased variability in cognitive function was observed in AST reaction latency standard deviation (t17 = -2.524, dz = 1.282, p = 0.022) and in RVP response latency standard deviation (t17 = -2.35, dz = 1.177, p = 0.03) with acclimatization. At 5050 m of elevation, SpO2 was positively correlated with executive function in the MAF group (OTS problems solved on first choice: r(5) = 0.839, p = 0.018) and negatively correlated with executive function latency standard deviations in the HAF group (OTS latency to first choice standard deviation: r(10) = -0.618, p = 0.032). Conclusions: Our findings highlight the importance of acclimatization and improvement of blood oxygen level, even among high altitude-experienced workers, to optimize performance of cognitively demanding work and reduce high altitude-associated health risks.","We express our sincere thanks to the ALMA workers who took part in our study during their work-shift cycle at the ALMA Observatory, Chile.

Individuals with PTSD are more likely to develop alcohol and substance abuse related disorders. We assessed if prenatal and early postnatal alcohol exposure (PAE) increased the susceptibility to retain aversive memories and if this was associated with subsequent heightened alcohol consumption. Pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats were exposed for 22 hr/day, throughout pregnancy and until postnatal Day 7 to a single bottle of sucralose - sweetened 10% alcohol solution (PAE Group), or to a single bottle of tap water and sucralose (Control Group). Auditory fear conditioning (AFC) was performed in the adolescent offspring at postnatal Day 40. Freezing was measured during acquisition, retention and extinction phases, followed by 3 weeks of free choice alcohol intake. Female, but not male, PAE rats exhibited impaired extinction of the aversive memory, a finding associated with higher levels of 3-4 Dihidroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC) in the nucleus accumbens and heightened alcohol intake, respect to controls. These findings suggest that PAE makes females more vulnerable to long-term retention of aversive memories, which coexist with heightened alcohol intake. These findings are reminiscent of those of PTSD.","We thank Dr. Cecilia Hidalgo to kindly provide the fear conditioning equipment; Daniel Rojas and Jorge Carrizo for their technical help.

In pure, homogeneous polymer membranes, water permeability is known to be controlled by the size of the free volume elements. However, there is very limited evidence concerning the extent to which this theory applies to practical, commercial IEMs, which frequently have more complex structures. We recently reported water and salt transport characteristics (i.e., permeability, partition, and diffusion coefficients) of 20 commercial IEMs, and demonstrated that water and salt transport were governed primarily by the microstructure of the membrane rather than the polymer chemistry. To further investigate the factors that determine water and salt transport in commercial IEMs, in this study we adopted a statistical approach informed by free volume theory and other literature to examine relationships between transport characteristics and water uptake (i.e., swelling) in addition to fixed charge concentration, ion exchange capacity (IEC), Manning parameter, and contact angle. Our analysis shows that water uptake had the strongest correlation with water and salt transport in commercial IEMs, which is consistent with the predictions of free volume theory for homogeneous polymers; however, the relationship observed between water uptake and permeability in commercial membranes was not as straightforward as that reported in the literature for homogeneous polymers. Membrane charge (IEC) was also correlated with permeability and diffusion coefficients, but to a more limited extent than water uptake, while the Manning parameter and contact angle did not appear to be correlated to any transport properties. Furthermore, there are indications that microstructural differences among membranes may significantly affect permeability. Therefore, further study of IEM microstructure, e.g., phase separation, is an important strategy for advancing the development of commercial IEMs.","The authors wish to acknowledge Yue Jiang and Lauren Zalla at the Odum Institute for Research in Social Science for helpful discussion regarding the statistical methods employed herein.

The FS occurs alongside the standard pseudo-cleft construction and it has been reported in only a few Spanish dialects. We discuss data collected from 371 participants living in five Colombian cities (Barranquilla, Bogotá, Bucaramanga, Cali, and Medellín). The results of two acceptability judgment tests (128 sentences tested in both audio and written formats) confirm that FS is an acceptable structure and indicate similar acceptability tendencies across the country: Prepositional Phrases, Complementizer/Inflectional Phrases, and Complex Verbal Phrases are the most accepted FS-focused sentence types, whereas Sentence-Final FS is the least accepted.

The empirical process comprised three qualitative procedures involving 37 experts from different regions of Spain. In order to guarantee the rigor of the data, a social worker discussion group was set up to create an interview script. Interviews were then carried out with 22 professionals who take care of people with mental illness in various public facilities throughout the country. A second focal group met three times to validate the categorizations analyzed in the interviews. The results of the empirical process indicate a need to remodel the mental health care system, which can be described with reference to five critical characteristics: 1) a lack of financial and human resources for mental health, 2) a lack of effective coordination among all the institutions and authorities involved, 3) a lack of quality resources aimed at rehabilitation and social reintegration as alternatives to institutionalization, 4) a lack of integrated care, and 5) a lack of a common healthcare framework for all professional workers in all the regions. A remodeling of the system is necessary to enable the rehabilitation, recovery, empowerment and development of people with SMD and thus ease the burden and improve the quality of life of family caregivers.",We thank all the professional participants for giving their time and energy to this study.,This work was supported by the Generalitat Valenciana and European Social Fund (ESF) [ACIF/2017/284].,Social Work in Mental Health,,,,2019-09-22,2019,2019-09-22,2019-11-02,17,6,743-760,Closed,Article,"Marqués, Ángela Carbonell; Navarro-Pérez, José Javier","Marqués, Ángela Carbonell (Social Work and Social Services Department, University of Valencia (Spain), Valencia, Spain); Navarro-Pérez, José Javier (Social Work and Social Services Department, University of Valencia (Spain), Valencia, Spain)","Marqués, Ángela Carbonell (University of Valencia)","Marqués, Ángela Carbonell (University of Valencia); Navarro-Pérez, José Javier (University of Valencia)",8,4,,2.98,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1121185810,44 Human Society; 4409 Social Work; 52 Psychology; 5203 Clinical and Health Psychology,3 Good Health and Well Being
839,pub.1120214910,10.1017/laq.2019.48,,,Displays of Violence and Power at the Edge of the Empire: Provincial Trophy Heads during Inca Times,"The Inca expansion to the southern Andes catalyzed important political and symbolic changes in local communities. In addition to economic changes in mining production and the installation of logistical and administrative infrastructure, new forms of ideological violence emerged in the Copiapó Valley, Chile. One new form was the display and discarding of human heads, a burial pattern unprecedented in the region. In this article, we present evidence of perforated heads buried without grave goods next to a local cemetery in a Late Horizon village. We argue that the performative use of modified severed heads from young individuals at the Iglesia Colorada site was part of Inca ritual practices. Their use represented an effort to ideologically rule over newly incorporated subjects by demonstrating power and ensuring their compliance.
La expansión Inca en el sur de los Andes catalizó importantes cambios políticos y simbólicos en las comunidades locales. Además de los cambios económicos en la producción minera y la instalación de infraestructura logística y administrativa, surgieron nuevas formas de violencia ideológica en el valle de Copiapó (Chile). Éstas incluyeron la exhibición y descarte de cabezas humanas cercenadas, siendo un patrón funerario sin precedentes en la región. En este artículo presentamos evidencia de cráneos con perforaciones, los cuales fueron enterrados sin ofrendas mortuorias, en asociación a un cementerio de una aldea local del horizonte Tardío. Argumentamos que la utilización y exhibición de cabezas cercenadas de individuos jóvenes en el sitio Iglesia Colorada, fue parte de prácticas rituales.

To greatly extend the communication channels between humans and external devices in a natural way, here we report an intuitive, self-powered, low-cost, and glove-based HMI towards diversified applications. A minimalist design based on the triboelectric nanogenerators (TENG) in two configurations is proposed to balance the requirement on the full functionality and the simplified signal processing capacity of the HMIs. Each TENG sensor is composed of a PEDOT:PSS coated textile strip stitched onto the glove and a layer of silicone rubber thin film coated on the glove. The glove-based interface has been successfully demonstrated for wireless car control, wireless drone control, minigame control, VR game control, and cursor control for online shopping as well as alphabet writing with a simple and intuitive operation technique. This glove-based interface provides a novel minimalist design concept distinct from the present rigid and bulky HMIs to open up a new direction of the further development of the HMIs with advantages of flexibility/wearability, low cost, easy operation, simplified signal processing, and low power consumption.","This work was supported by HiFES Seed Funding-2017-01 grant (R-263-501-012-133) “Hybrid Integration of Flexible Power Source and Pressure Sensors” at the National University of Singapore; Faculty Research Committee (FRC) grant (R-263-000-B56-112) “Thermoelectric power generator (TEG) based selfpowered ECG plaster-System integration (Part 3)” at the National University of Singapore, Singapore.

However, the relationship between benthic populations and stranded seaweeds has received little attention. After detachment, a fraction of floating specimens returns to the shore, resulting in strandings that fluctuate in space and time. It has been hypothesized that the availability of stranded seaweeds is related to their benthic abundance on adjacent coasts. Using the large fucoid Durvillaea antarctica, we tested whether stranded biomasses are higher at sites with dense adjacent benthic populations. Benthic abundance of D. antarctica along the continental coast of Chile was estimated using three approximations: (i) availability of potentially suitable habitat (PSH), (ii) categorical visual abundance estimates in the field, and (iii) abundance measurements in the intertidal zone. Higher PSH for D. antarctica was observed between 31° S-32° S and 40° S-42° S than between 33° S and 39° S. Lowest benthic biomasses were estimated for the northern latitudes (31° S-32° S). Regression models showed that the association between stranded biomass and PSH was highest when only the extent of rocky shore 10 km to the south of each beach was included, suggesting relatively short-distance dispersal and asymmetrical transport of floating kelps, which is further supported by low proportions of rafts with Lepas spp. (indicator of rafting). The results indicate that stranded biomasses are mostly subsidized by nearby benthic populations, which can partly explain the low genetic connectivity among populations in the study region. Future studies should also incorporate other local factors (e.g., winds, currents, wave-exposure) that influence stranding dynamics.",,,Journal of Phycology,,,Animals; Cattle; Chile; Ecosystem; Kelp; Male; Phaeophyceae; Population Dynamics,2019-11-06,2019,2019-11-06,2020-02,56,1,185-197,Closed,Article,"Schreiber, Lennart; López, Boris A.; Rivadeneira, Marcelo M.; Thiel, Martin","Schreiber, Lennart (Facultad de Ciencias del Mar, Universidad Católica del Norte, Larrondo 1281, Coquimbo, Chile; Faculty of Life Sciences, Biological Institute, Humboldt‐Universität zu Berlin, Berlin, Germany); López, Boris A.

METHOD: The Spanish translation of the Cancer Worry Chart was done with the back-translation procedure. The participants were 165 healthy people with a family history of cancer who responded to the Cancer Worry Chart and the Cancer Worry Scale (CWS).
RESULTS: Translation back-translation allows a Spanish version of the Cancer Worry Chart whose content is clear, coherent and relevant (V˃.70). Evidence of construct validity is reported based on 3 criteria: a) an adequate adjustment of the one-dimensional model formed by the Cancer Worry Chart and the items of the CWS performed with the structural equations method (χ2S-B=23.38; df=14; χ2S-B/df=1.67; CFI=.988; RMSEA=.064); b) a significant correlation between the Cancer Worry Chart and the CWS (r= .76 [IC95%: .68-.90]); c) ascending averages in the CWS score as the groups formed by each response option of the Cancer Worry Chart express a greater degree of worry (F=55.72; P=.000; ω2=.57). The reliability of the Cancer Worry Chart is above what is recommended (αsingle item=.84).

During the research, five focus groups were formed, allowing the description of significant aspects of the center between 2010 and 2015. This, as a part of a systematization of experiences. Qualitative descriptive research, which defines the focus groups as the research technique. The DOFA tool was used around seven routing instructions. The work was developed in five phases: design, field work, reflection, discussion of information and the final report. The materials used were: recording of speeches, booklets to write non-verbal perceptions, and the implementation of four grids to process the information (literal categorization, macro-categories and impact of the perceptions) As a result of the data triangulation, eight categories emerged, that allowed us to understand the perception of the actors who were part of the research. The categories show elements that contribute to the strengthening of the phonoaudiological care model of the center which generates services in an inclusive university. It recognizes diversity and develops proposals which are consistent with the served population.

Self-backhauling allows the operators to provide fiber connectivity only to a small subset of base stations (Fiber-BSs), whereas the rest of the base stations reach the core network via a (multi-hop) wireless link towards the Fiber-BS. Although a very attractive architecture, self-backhauling is proven to be an NP-hard route selection and resource allocation problem. The existing self-backhauling solutions lack practicality because: $(i)$ they require solving a fairly complex combinatorial problem every time there is a change in the network (e.g., channel fluctuations), or $(ii)$ they ignore the impact of network dynamics which are inherent to mobile networks. In this article, we propose SCAROS which is a semi-distributed learning algorithm that aims at minimizing the end-to-end latency as well as enhancing the robustness against network dynamics including load imbalance, channel variations, and link failures. We benchmark SCAROS against state-of-the-art approaches under a real-world deployment scenario in Manhattan and using realistic beam patterns obtained from off-the-shelf mmWave devices. The evaluation demonstrates that SCAROS achieves the lowest latency, at least $1.8\times $ higher throughput, and the highest flexibility against variability or link failures in the system.","This work was supported in part by the Context of the DFG Collaborative Research Center (CRC) 1053 MAKI under Project C1, Project A3, and Project B3, and the Center emergenCITY of the LOEWE initiative, Hessen, Germany.

Furthermore, the combinatorial nature of MS&RA has forced the majority of existing proposals to focus on constrained scenarios or offline solutions to contain the size of the problem. Given the real-time constraints in actual deployments, a reduction in computational complexity is necessary. Adaptability is another key requirement for mobile networks that are exposed to constant changes such as channel quality fluctuations and mobility. In this article, we propose an online learning technique (i.e., CBMoS) which leverages combinatorial multi-armed bandits (CMAB) to tackle the combinatorial nature of MS&RA. Furthermore, our two-stage CMAB design results in a tight model, which eliminates the theoretically feasible but practicality invalid options from the solution space. We prototype the first SDR-based D2D testbed to verify the performance of CBMoS under real-world conditions. The simulations confirm that the fast learning speed of CBMoS leads to outperforming the benchmark schemes by up to 132%. In experiments, CBMoS exhibits even higher performance (up to 142%) than in the simulations. This stems from the adaptability/fast learning speed of CBMoS in presence of high channel dynamics which cannot be captured via statistical channel models used in the simulators.","This work has been performed in the context of the DFG Collaborative Research Center (CRC) 1053 MAKI–sub-projects A3, B3, and C1.

Although in-vehicle crowding has usually been studied as a tangible attribute, previous research has shown that the standing passenger density cannot fully explain the experience of crowding. In the present work, we used the hybrid discrete choice modeling approach in order to provide a richer explanation of in-vehicle crowding in a choice context between Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) and Metro, using Bogotá as a case of study. Modeling results showed that perceived discomfort, perceived insecurity, waiting time, fare, travel time, and its interaction with the positive attitude towards crowding, are the main variables in explaining the choice process. We found that the positive attitude towards crowding affects the perception of the standing passengers’ density level. We demonstrated that this attitude depends on non-transportation information since people who live in larger spaces, as well as people who live in apartments, have a greater positive attitude towards crowding. We obtained crowding multipliers in regarding the users’ attitude for different levels of overcrowding and analyze several policies related to latent variables.",,,Transportation Research Part A Policy and Practice,,,,2019-12,2019,,2019-12,130,,452-465,Closed,Article,"Márquez, Luis; A, Julieth V.

In the Southern Ocean, macaroni penguins (Eudyptes chrysolophus) are distributed over a circumpolar range including populations in Antarctic and sub-Antarctic areas. Macquarie Island, in its relative isolation, is home to a closely related endemic taxon - the royal penguin (Eudyptes schlegeli), which is distinguishable from E. chrysolophus mainly by facial coloration. Although these sister taxa are widely accepted as representing distinct species based on morphological grounds, the extent of their genome-wide differentiation remains uncertain. In this study, we use genome-wide Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms to test genetic differentiation between these geographically isolated taxa and evaluate the main drivers of population structure among breeding colonies of macaroni/royal penguins. Genetic similarity observed between macaroni and royal penguins suggests they constitute a single evolutionary unit. Nevertheless, royal penguins exhibited a tendency to cluster only with macaroni individuals from Kerguelen Island, suggesting that dispersal occurs mainly between these neighboring colonies. A stepping stone model of differentiation of macaroni/royal populations was further supported by a strong pattern of isolation by distance detected across its whole distribution range, possibly driven by large geographic distances between colonies as well as natal philopatry. However, we also detected intraspecific genomic differentiation between Antarctic and sub-Antarctic populations of macaroni penguins, highlighting the role of environmental factors together with geographic distance in the processes of genetic differentiation between Antarctic and sub-Antarctic waters.","This study received funding support from several institutions.

To test this hypothesis, long-term field experiments with floating southern bull kelp Durvillaea antarctica were conducted along a latitudinal gradient (30°S, 37°S and 54°S) in austral winter and summer. Floating time exceeded 200d in winter at the high latitudes but in summer it dropped to 90d, being still higher than at low latitudes (<45d). Biomass variations were due to loss of buoyant fronds. Reproductive activity diminished during long floating times. Physiological changes included mainly a reduction in photosynthetic (Fv/Fm and pigments) rather than in defence variables (phlorotannins and antioxidant activity). The observed long floating persistence and long-term acclimation responses at 54°S support the hypothesis of LDD by kelp rafts at high latitudes.","We gratefully thank Vieia Villalobos and Alvaro Villena, for their invaluable help and assistance in the field and laboratory procedures.

                    Technology business incubators (TBIs) form an indispensable part of an entrepreneurial ecosystem for the promotion of tech start-ups across the global economy. However, they have evolved in varied forms over a period of time, in terms of typologies, sponsors and stakeholders, goals and objectives, functions and services offered, process of incubation support provided through hard and soft infrastructure, outcomes and achievements and even in terms of theoretical bases. The purpose of this paper, therefore, is to review the extant literature on TBIs to arrive at a framework that explains how TBIs contribute to start-up generation.
                  
                  
                    Design/methodology/approach
                    This paper reviews extant empirical literature for a systematic evaluation to throw light on the various dimensions of TBIs: typology, goals and objectives, functions and services, process and provision of incubation support, outcomes and achievements. Further, after critically reviewing some of the theoretical propositions, it develops a conceptual framework combining pre-incubation, incubation and post-incubation processes of TBIs.
                  
                  
                    Findings
                    Based on literature understanding and some of the key theoretical constructs, a conceptual framework is developed comprising pre-incubation, incubation and post-incubation stages of start-up formation and graduation. The paper also identifies some prospective areas for future research.
                  
                  
                    Research limitations/implications
                    Any empirical research on technology business incubation must focus on pre-incubation and post-incubation processes as much as on the incubation process, to derive meaningful implications and enhance the productivity of TBIs.

Yet, the relationship of the structure-property performance strongly depends on their chemical composition, which is currently not fully resolved. Herein, we present a physical vapor deposition methodology for developing PdxAu1-x alloys with fine control over the chemical composition. We establish direct correlations between the composition and these materials' structural and electronic properties with its catalytic activity in an ethanol (EtOH) oxidation reaction. By combining X-ray diffraction (XRD) and X-ray photelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements, we validate that the Pd content within both bulk and surface compositions can be finely controlled in an ultrathin-film regime. Catalytic oxidation of EtOH on the PdxAu1-x electrodes presents the largest forward-sweeping current density for x = 0.73 at ∼135 mA cm-2, with the lowest onset potential and largest peak activity of 639 A gPd-1 observed for x = 0.58. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations and XPS measurements demonstrate that the valence band of the alloys is completely dominated by Pd particularly near the Fermi level, regardless of its chemical composition. Moreover, DFT provides key insights into the PdxAu1-x ligand effect, with relevant chemisorption activity descriptors probed for a large number of surface arrangements. These results demonstrate that alloys can outperform pure metals in catalytic processes, with fine control of the chemical composition being a powerful tuning knob for the electronic properties and, therefore, the catalytic activity of ultrathin PdxAu1-x catalysts. Our high-throughput experimental methodology, in connection with DFT calculations, provides a unique foundation for further materials' discovery, including machine-learning predictions for novel alloys, the development of Pd-alloyed membranes for the purification of reformate gases, binder-free ultrathin electrocatalysts for fuel cells, and room temperature lithography-based development of nanostructures for optically driven processes.","The authors thank several colleagues at the U.S. Army Research Laboratory, Electrochemistry Branch, specifically, Dr. Robert Dillon and Greg Forcherio for discussions related to alloy catalyst development, Drs.

On the coast, iconography depicting violence and fertility legitimized elite power. In Tiwanaku (A.D. 400–1100), such iconography is considered to have been absent. We re-examine the theme of the Sacrificer in Tiwanaku iconography that originated during the Formative period in the south-central Andes. This figure, which we term Tiwanaku Camelid Sacrificer (TCS), takes on a new appearance: a human-camelid body carrying a a trophy head or axe. The TCS imagery is often depicted on portable prestige objects, many of them found in the Tiwanaku hinterlands that relied economically and socially on caravans. We propose that the TCS represents aspects of Tiwanaku ritual and ontology, by which camelids and humans shared acts, essence, and form. The states of being (camay) and becoming (tucoy) embodied by the TCS testify to the unique positions of power camelids held over life in Tiwanaku’s agropastoralist society.","We would like to thank the Ministerio de Cultura Peru, Patricia Palacios and Museo Contisuyo Moquegua, Clemente Ticona, Maria de Los Angeles Muñoz (Instituto de Investigaciones Arqueologicas and Museo Arqueologico de la Universidad Mayor de San Simon de Cochabamba), Velia Mendoza (Laboratorio de Arqueozoologia de la Carrera de Arqueologia de la Universidad Mayor de San Andres de La Paz), Adriana Muñoz at the World Cultures Museum in Goteborg, Sweden, Sergio Chavez (Michigan University), Antti Korpisaari, the Centro de Investigaciones Arqueologicas, Antropologicas y Administracion de Tiwanaku (CIAAAT), and the many scholars and institutions who granted us permission to reproduce their art and images in this article.

715,pub.1112142301,10.1016/j.erss.2019.01.015,,,"Are energy efficiency policies for household context dependent? A comparative study of Brazil, Chile, Colombia and Uruguay","In the last decades, the relevance of household energy-efficiency measures has increased, not only as mitigation policy, but also as key energy policies that may improve socioeconomic development. Despite their cost-effectivity, some of the most important household energy efficiency measures are often not implemented. There are different barriers that energy policy has to overcome to support their delivery. Nonetheless, specific situations may result in a bad performance of energy efficiency policies. It is crucial to understand which are the main characteristics, or enabling conditions, that affect the policy in order to consider them in the process of policy design. In this context, the aim of the paper is to contribute to the literature on energy efficiency in the household sector, by discussing the relevance of enabling conditions for the performance of the policies, and proposing a methodology framework to analyze these enabling frameworks. An approach to transform qualitative information into quantitative data also represents a contribution to the literature. The methodology consists of an adaptation of the broadly used multicriteria analysis (MCA). As an initial empirical study, a set of Latin American countries have been chosen, namely Brazil, Chile, Colombia and Uruguay, to study these conditions in 2016. Findings show that Uruguay and Chile have the best boundary conditions to promote energy efficiency, followed by Brazil and Colombia which has presented difficulties in different boundary conditions. Results also highlight that the implementation of household energy efficiency policies is highly dependent on country context. In order to develop an enabling framework, it is relevant to count with a strong commitment, awareness raising, as well as price policies, financing access and favorable macroeconomic conditions.","The authors would like to thank the Instituto de Investigaciones Económicas y Sociales del Sur (IIESS), Departamento de Economía of the Universidad Nacional del Sur and the Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Científicas y Técnicas (CONICET), for the financial support for developing their doctoral studies and research activities.

We evaluated the effects of projected end of the century ocean acidification (OA) and warming (OW) on the thermal tolerance of an important living marine resource, the sea urchin Loxechinus albus, a benthic shallow water coastal herbivore inhabiting part of the Pacific coast of South America. After exposing young juveniles for a 1-month period to contrasting pCO2 (~500 and 1400 μatm) and temperature (~15 °C and 20 °C) levels, critical thermal maximum (CTmax) and minimum (CTmin) as well as thermal tolerance polygons were assessed based on self-righting success as an end point. Transcription of heat shock protein 70 (HSP70), a chaperone protecting cellular proteins from environmental stress, was also measured. Exposure to elevated pCO2 significantly reduced thermal tolerance by increasing CTmin at both experimental temperatures and decreasing CTmax at 20 °C. There was also a strong synergistic effect of OA × OW on HSP70 transcription levels which were 75 times higher than in control conditions. If this species is unable to adapt to elevated pCO2 in the future, the reduction in thermal tolerance and HSP response suggests that near-future warming and OA will disrupt their performance and reduce their distribution with ecological and economic consequences. Given the wider latitudinal range (6 to 56°S) and environmental tolerance of L. albus compared to other members of this region's benthic invertebrate community, OW and OA may cause substantial changes to the coastal fauna along this geographical range.","This study was financed by the Project ‘Climate driven Changes in the Habitat Suitability of Marine Organisms’ (CLIMAR, ELAC2015/T01-0495) funded by the Network of the European Union, Latin America and the Caribbean Countries on Joint Innovation and Research Activities.

Thus, it is considered a key factor for the subsistence of prehistoric societies (including mixed-economy groups), that inhabited its coastal ecosystems as well as the neighboring inland areas. This study assesses the Arica Culture groups' diet (Late Intermediate Period; 1000–1530 CE), through stable isotope (on bone-collagen; δ13C and δ15N) and dental pathology data. Seventy-seven (n = 77) individuals from two inland (LLU54 and AZ8) and one coastal (CAM8) archaeological sites were studied. Results show an important, but lower than predicted by earlier studies, contribution of marine resources in the diet of all three groups. Dental pathologies and stable isotopes indicate that these groups' diet varied in correlation with their distance to the Pacific Ocean as well as group and individual preferences. The results challenge the idea that Arica Culture groups depended heavily on marine resources for their subsistence. In contrast, this study shows both that the Arica Culture groups’ diet was diverse, and that the terrestrial resources consumed were mostly contributed by C3/CAM plants instead of maize.","FONDECYT #1151046 and #11150210, Chile (Universidad de Tarapacá).

The results demonstrated that in both country samples, bullies and bully-victims had higher levels of SSCD. Both Spanish and Dutch students who were directly involved in traditional bullying situations showed more negative perceptions of the school moral climate. In cyberbullying situations, bystanders scored higher on school moral climate perception than bullies and bully-victims. Furthermore, school moral climate perception was negatively associated with traditional bullying observation in the group of victims, and with cyberbullying observation in the case of victims and bystanders. The present findings suggest that future research should focus on the cause-effect relations of these factors, which could include measuring the effects on bullying prevalence of an intervention aimed at SSCD reduction in bullies and bystanders and the improvement of the school moral climate.","The authors wish to thank Dr. Paco Abad, Dr. Carmen Ximénez, Dr. Julio Olea, Dr. Antonio Pardo, Dr. David Poveda, Henrike Ilre Msc., John Bernal Bs., Lidia Romero Bs. and Sandra Valega Msc. for their contribution to the research. / Los autores quieren expresar su agradecimiento a las siguientes personas por su contribución al presente estudio: Dr. Paco Abad, Dra.

This research aims to evaluate and quantify rainfall and snowfall contribution to aquifer recharge while assessing the factors that control the hydrodynamics in such areas, based in the knowledge of the better documented Tuyajto Lake in the Tuyajto catchment/basin. The modeling framework involves an energy balance of the snow cover, a soil water balance and a groundwater flow and chloride transport model. The basin average annual recharge is about 23% of average precipitation. Snowmelt contribution to recharge is important at altitudes above 4700 m a.s.l. during September, while rainfall is more important in February and March, during short intense precipitation events. The hydraulic conductivity of ignimbrites and other volcanic formations are the most important hydrogeological parameters controlling lake level and spring flow rates, while albedo and snowpack surface roughness length on the energy balance causes the greatest variation of lake level. Evaporation is the process controlling the variability of the lake level, as aquifer contribution remains relatively constant and springs flow variability is not enough to cause the observed variations, except during November. Possible buried salts deposits on the eastern edges of Pampa Colorada and Tuyajto Lake, together with volcanic HCl contribution, justify the high measured groundwater chloride concentrations. A recharge 2-3 higher than the current one is necessary to justify a lake level 40 m above its modern value during the Last Glacial period, giving insight into past hydrological changes in the basin due to climate variability. The knowledge gained can be applied to other high altitude volcanic basins with seasonal snow cover.","This research was funded by the Anillo project ACT 1203 of the CONICYT of Chile government and CONICYT-PCHA/Doctorado Nacional/2015-21150951 PhD grant to J.U.

The study area is between the Cordillera de Domeyko and the Central Depression, at latitudes 24-25°S, and is characterized by near-zero air moisture conditions, rare precipitation and very limited runoff. Groundwater composition varies from Ca-HCO3 to Ca, Na-SO4 type below elevations of 3400 m a.s.l. The rCl/rBr ratio of meteoric waters and groundwater overlap, but significantly increase in the aquifer as salinity goes up due to evapoconcentration far from the Domeyko Cordillera. The wind-displaced dust originating in the Central Depression (87Sr/86Sr: 0.706558-0.710645; δ34S(SO4): 0 to +4‰) affects the precipitation composition in the highest parts of the Domeyko Cordillera (87Sr/86Sr: 0.706746-0.709511; δ34S(SO4): +1 to +6‰), whose δ34S(SO4) and δ11B values are greatly different from marine aerosols, discarding its contribution to dust at this distance inland. Sr and S isotopic values in groundwater indicate a strong relation with three main geological units: i) Paleozoic rocks contribute high radiogenic strontium isotope ratios to groundwater (0.707011-0.714862), while sulphate isotopic composition is probably acquired from atmospheric dust (>- 1.4‰), ii) Jurassic marine limestones contribute low-radiogenic strontium isotopic ratios to groundwater (<0.70784), while sulphate can be related to oxidized sulphides that change the isotopic signatures of sulphur (<-1.2‰), and iii) mixed salts in the Atacama Gravels contribute lower radiogenic strontium isotopic ratios and sulphate to groundwater (87Sr/86Sr: <0.707324; δ34S(SO4): +0.1 to +7.7). These three processes reflect water-rock interactions. The δ11B of groundwater generally up to +13‰, does not increase along the regional groundwater flow path, discarding fractionation by interaction with clays. These results improve the understanding of the groundwater evolution in hyper-arid systems through a new conceptual model.","This research was supported by the Anillo Project ACT1203 of the CONICYT of Chile and funded by a Ph.D. grant CONICYT-PCHA/Doctorado Nacional/2016-21160152 of Carolina Gamboa.

593,pub.1116838087,10.1002/jee.20264,,,Characterizing the interplay of cognitive and metacognitive knowledge in computational modeling and simulation practices,"Abstract  Background Modeling and simulation practices have become commonplace in modern engineering, but in‐depth research on the development of modeling and simulation expertise is needed to identify the learning processes involved in successfully acquiring these skills.   Purpose This study investigated student dimensions of expertise when engaged in modeling and simulation practices. The guiding research question was “How do students use cognitive and metacognitive knowledge when engaged with computational modeling and simulation practices?”   Design/Method This study included 11 undergraduate engineering students enrolled in a course on computational materials science. Data were collected from one of five computational challenges administered during the course. Students' cognitive and metacognitive knowledge use was first analyzed using thematic analysis and then through a phenomenographic approach. Findings were interpreted using the lens of adaptive expertise.   Results Results describe how students used their cognitive and metacognitive knowledge to approach the computational challenge. Two categories in the cognitive dimension were identified: implementation‐oriented and knowledge‐oriented. Two categories identified in the metacognitive dimension were plan‐oriented and action‐oriented approaches. These categories are further presented as an outcome space by aligning them with the dimensions of adaptive expertise.   Conclusions Results indicated that students in the action/implementation‐oriented category exhibited many of the qualities expected of inexperienced novices, while students in the plan/knowledge‐oriented category demonstrated more of the qualities expected of adaptive experts. However, results were less conclusive for students in the two intermediate thematic categories, who often exhibited some but not all of the qualities of both novices and experts.",This work was supported in part by the U.S. National Science Foundation under the award number EEC #1449238.

560,pub.1122784960,10.1002/ptr.6546,31755173,,Mangiferin: Possible uses in the prevention and treatment of mixed osteoarthritic pain,"Osteoarthritis (OA) pain has been proposed to be a mixed pain state, because in some patients, central nervous system factors are superimposed upon the more traditional peripheral factors. In addition, a considerable amount of preclinical and clinical evidence has shown that, accompanying the central neuroplasticity changes and partially driven by a peripheral nociceptive input, a real neuropathic component occurs that are particularly linked to disease severity and progression. Hence, innovative strategies targeting neuroprotection and particularly neuroinflammation to prevent and treat OA pain could be introduced. Mangiferin (MG) is a glucosylxanthone that is broadly distributed in higher plants, such as Mangifera indica L. Previous studies have documented its analgesic, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, neuroprotective, and immunomodulatory properties. In this paper, we propose its potential utility as a multitargeted compound for mixed OA pain, even in the context of multimodal pharmacotherapy. This hypothesis is supported by three main aspects: the cumulus of preclinical evidence around this xanthone, some preliminary clinical results using formulations containing MG in clinical musculoskeletal or neuropathic pain, and by speculations regarding its possible mechanism of action according to recent advances in OA pain knowledge.","ACKNOWLEDGMENTS Special thanks to Jorge Conde Garrido for the advice on the correct use of the English language.

Methods This systematic review of literature employed a synthetic approach using best evidence to address the question: ""Does fatigue and postural comfort contribute to the development of musculoskeletal conditions and disorders presented by motorcyclists?"" The initial search identified 9,024 academic articles published from 1970 to date, in 13 databases. After screening, a total of 35 articles met the criteria and were included. twelve were found to be of high quality, eighteen of medium quality, and five of low quality. Results In this systematic review, postural and anthropometric factors, as well as techniques and tools for the muscular analysis of motorcyclists were identified. The tools identified were classified into direct assessment techniques (anthropometry, electromyography, dynamometry, vibration evaluation, seat pressure analysis, heart rate and blood pressure, and fatigue of the pupillary muscles) and observational or indirect assessment techniques (self-reports and questionnaires). Most of the reviewed studies (83%) included evidence that physical fatigue and postural discomfort affect the performance and are related to musculoskeletal conditions; 17% (six) of the studies evaluated provided neutral evidence. The lower back was the area of the body most affected by discomfort and fatigue in motorcyclists (63% of the studies), followed by the shoulder and forearm (51% of studies). Other affected areas were the neck, and the buttocks reported by 34 to 43% of the included studies. Conclusion Our review shows that the different muscles affected due to motorcycle driving and the techniques used for assessment need to be comprehensively evaluated. Thus, proper selection and design of motorcycles is imperative for improving the comfort of motorcyclists.",,Funding for Holman Ospina-Mateus (doctoral student) was covered by Fundación Centro de Estudios Interdisciplinarios Básicos y Aplicados (CEIBA)—Gobernación de Bolívar (Colombia).,Journal of Transport & Health,,,,2019-03,2019,,2019-03,12,,290-318,Closed,Article,"Ospina-Mateus, Holman; Jiménez, Leonardo Augusto Quintana","Ospina-Mateus, Holman (Universidad Tecnológica de Bolívar, Department of Industrial Engineering, Cartagena, Colombia; Pontificia Universidad Javeriana, Department of Industrial Engineering, Carrera 7 # 40-62, Bogotá, Colombia); Jiménez, Leonardo Augusto Quintana (Pontificia Universidad Javeriana, Department of Industrial Engineering, Carrera 7 # 40-62, Bogotá, Colombia)","Ospina-Mateus, Holman (Universidad Tecnológica de Bolívar; Pontificia Universidad Javeriana)","Ospina-Mateus, Holman (Universidad Tecnológica de Bolívar; Pontificia Universidad Javeriana); Jiménez, Leonardo Augusto Quintana (Pontificia Universidad Javeriana)",21,9,,7.78,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1112398243,42 Health Sciences; 4201 Allied Health and Rehabilitation Science,

Johnson) in South Africa during the early and late season,"The assemblage structure of heteropterans affecting macadamia nuts changed considerably during the previous ±30 years, prompting a relook at the economic status of commonly occurring pest species. The five most abundant species were confined in sleeve cages on bearing branches of macadamia trees containing early or late season nuts and feeding damage was subsequently monitored. All species except Coenomorpha nervosa were able to damage nuts during the early season before hardening of the seed coat (shell/testa). During the late season after hardening of the seed coat, Chinavia pallidoconspersa with relative short mouthparts was able to inflict significant damage. This is the second most abundant species on macadamias in South Africa and normally occurs in high numbers during the autumn and winter when most nuts are mature. Mouthpart length appear to be only partially responsible for the ability of heteropterans to feed on the kernels of mature nuts and the possible effect of strong digestive enzymes is discussed. C. pallidoconspersa will require some form of control if sufficient numbers are present in the orchards, especially towards the end of the normal production season.",,,International Journal of Tropical Insect Science,,,,2019-08-28,2019,2019-08-28,2020-03,40,1,217-219,Closed,Article,"Schoeman, P.

                    The purpose of this paper is to conduct an analysis of the relationships existing among three basic constructs in the visitor’s decision-making process (motivation and satisfaction) in a tourist destination that is a World Heritage Site, such as the city of Lima (Peru). Bearing in mind the perception of heritage by the foreign visitors, four types of tourists were determined: alternative tourists, cultural tourists, emotional tourists and heritage tourists.
                  
                  
                    Design/methodology/approach
                    This research uses the multivariate technique of grouping cases (K-means clusters) to analyse the similarity existing among the surveyed persons. From the groups or segments obtained, statistics and measurements of association were applied, which provide the information necessary to study the possible trends of association existing between variables from a table of bidimensional contingencies. In the same way, nonparametric statistical procedures were used (Kruskal–Wallis H test and the Mann–Whitney U test) with the aim of analysing significant differences among groups of the sample.
                  
                  
                    Findings
                    The results show the existence of four diverse motivational dimensions among the foreign tourists to visit Lima: hedonic, cultural, convenience and circumstantial. Of the four dimensions, the cultural aspect is the most relevant. The results show the existence of a specific Ibero-American heritage and cultural identity.

One theme directing recent research is the link between metallurgy and political organization, including the origins of metal production, its relationship to sociopolitical complexity, and how shifts in the organization of metal production reflect and shape diachronic political transformations. A second theme is the use of metals to identify and interrogate interregional connections. Patterns in the circulation of different alloys and metal isotopes, as well as the transfer of technology, provide insight into the shifting constellations of economic and political connections maintained by prehispanic Andean populations. A final theme is ritual and meaning in Andean metallurgy, where I explore how the stages of mining, extractive metallurgy, and the production of metal objects added multivalent layers of meaning and value to metal artifacts. Operating in distinct ways across time and space, metallurgy in the ancient Andes could stimulate political complexity, drive geopolitical expansion and the integration of new subject populations, differentiate individuals and groups, connect people to one another and to the landscape, and harness the power of the numinous.","My gratitude to Gary Feinman for the invitation to prepare this article and guidance along the long road to completion.

The data in the V band of the Johnson filter revealed signs of irregular variability in the convectively inactive white dwarf WD 2047+372 at times from hours to 1–3 days with characteristic amplitudes of about 0m. 005. This variability can be due to both irregular proper pulsations of the star or even the debris disk and reasons of unidentified instrumental nature. We have not found the brightness variability of WD 2047+372 at the level of greater than 0m. 005. As distinct from WD 2047+372, the convectively active magnetic white dwarf WD 0009+501 shows stable photometric variability associated with the proper rotation of the object and correlating with the variability of its magnetic properties. The variability amplitude is about 0m. 01. Based on comparison of the observations of these two targets, we concluded on the photometric variability of magnetic dwarfs located in the thermal convection zone. We noticed the stable variability on long-term timescales (years, decades, and over).",,,Astrophysical Bulletin,,,,2019-04,2019,2019-06-06,2019-04,74,2,172-178,Closed,Article,"Antonyuk, K.

Excess zeroes in the data results in over-dispersion, which we address by fitting Poisson, negative binomial (NB), zero inflated Poisson (ZIP) and zero inflated negative binomial (ZINB). The proposed zero inflated models explicitly isolate unexposed animals within an infected group, making them ideal for selection purposes. Distributions of parasite egg count data in both sheep and goats were zero inflated for all the species except for strongyle egg counts in goats, which fitted negative binomial distribution. Rainfall, season and site were found to be predominantly significant in determining the distribution of parasites among their host. The findings on how the covariance structure relates to the distributional assumptions assist in the formulation of the necessary interventions. For instance in setting strategies to control gastrointestinal parasite infections or in identifying animals with the desired traits. Subsequently improving the livelihood of the rural communities.",The authors would like to express sincere gratitude to the University of the North (Qwa-Qwa campus) for the data and partial funding of the research by the University of South Africa.

In this paper, we present a comprehensive analysis of co-inventor networks in a small but thriving OECD economy in Latin America: Chile. Using a dataset for patents granted in the country between 1989 and 2018, we study a variety of statistical properties for five different co-inventor networks. We show that these networks exhibit power-law, small-world, and preferential attachment properties, all of which have been used to describe networks in more advanced economies. We also highlight some apparent differences in collaboration patterns between networks (and inventors) and we reveal the precarious nature of the network of local inventors by confirming the community structure property. Evidence for strong positive autocorrelation between highly and lowly productive inventors is presented via methods used in spatial econometrics. Our results show that the inventor system in Chile is highly fragmented, which emphasizes the need for strong government intervention in steering research funding, and for more collaboration between inventors, especially local ones.",,,Journal of Informetrics,,,,2019-11,2019,,2019-11,13,4,100984,Closed,Article,"Pinto, Pablo E.; Vallone, Andres; Honores, Guillermo","Pinto, Pablo E.

It is presented through the personalised experiences and reflexive-narrative style (i.e. story-within-the-story) of the author’s own point of view, which makes it an auto- (personal experience), ethno- (rich cultural and historical context) -graphic (descriptive and visual) piece. Using the autoethnographic method of narrating observations in the field, at the event of the 23 October 2015 “Fees-must-fall” gathering at the Union Buildings in Pretoria, the paper offers a reflexive comparison of the experiences of the author present at two distinct (but historically related, i.e. past related to present and vice versa) political junctures of student mobilisation for higher education in South Africa—first as a student in the late 1980s and then as a passive observer-cum-social science researcher at the 2015 student protests at the Union Buildings, in Pretoria. In adopting this novel qualitative method of interrogating student mobilisation from a personal experiential point of view, this paper offers a different approach to reporting qualitative field research that conventionally presents the ideas and opinions of its participants as the main interrogation point, not that of the author’s. The main narrative is therefore premised on the author’s own experiences with student mobilisation for educational reform during the height of apartheid and under this current democratic social context of the “hashtag fees-must-fall” (#FMF) movement.",,,South African Review of Sociology,,,,2019-10-02,2019,2020-02-03,2019-10-02,50,3-4,57-74,Closed,Article,"Jansen, Zanetta","Jansen, Zanetta (Department of Sociology, University of South Africa, Pretoria, South Africa)","Jansen, Zanetta (University of South Africa)","Jansen, Zanetta (University of South Africa)",2,2,,1.03,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1124547883,44 Human Society; 4404 Development Studies; 4405 Gender Studies; 4410 Sociology,

However, a growing pressure turned for sustainability in farming, promotes a line of utilization of waste with agricultural potential, such as the use of urban waste compost and tannery sludge, which, when available, can be used as sources of compost and alternative organic matter. The objective of this study was to evaluate the potential of tannery sludge associated with the urban waste compost in the substrate composition of sweet pepper seedlings, especially regarding emergence, development, and quality of seedlings. The experimental design was a randomized block design with six replications and eight treatments. The treatments consisted of mixtures of the residue of dehydrated tannery sludge and urban waste compost, varying in the proportions of 10%, 30%, 50%, 70%, 90% and 100% of each, as well as the use of a commercial substrate as a conventional treatment for the comparisons. Graphs were performed through linear regression analysis for the treatment of statistical data. The percentage of emergence, development, and quality of seedlings were evaluated 54 days after planting. The alternative substrates showed high potential in the production of seedlings, in which all the combinations used in the study were superior to the conventional treatment, except the germination, which did not present difference. The range for the use of tannery sludge in the preparation of substrates for sweet pepper seedlings is between 32.7 and 48.2% in a mixture with urban waste compost. The plants presented better quality with the use of 46.0% of tannery sludge and 54.0% of urban compost in the preparation of the substrate.",,,Journal of Experimental Agriculture International,,,,2019-04-18,2019,2019-04-18,,,,1-9,Closed,Article,"da Silva Berilli, Sávio; Valadares, Fernanda Vargas; de Sales, Ramon Amaro; de Fatima Ulisses, Alessandra; Pereira, Rodrigo Martins; Dutra, Geraldo José Alves; da Silva, Matheus Wandermurem; Berilli, Ana Paula Cândido Gabriel; de Salles, Rodrigo Amaro; de Almeida, Rafael Nunes","da Silva Berilli, Sávio (Federal Institute of Espírito Santo - Unit Itapina, Highway BR-259, Km 70 – Countryside, Post Office Box 256, CEP: 29709-910 – Colatina, ES, Brazil); Valadares, Fernanda Vargas (Center of Agricultural Sciences and Technologies, State University of the North of Rio de Janeiro Darcy Ribeiro, CEP: 28013-602 – Campos dos Goytacazes, RJ, Brazil); de Sales, Ramon Amaro (Departament of Plant Science, Federal University of Viçosa, CEP: 36570-900 – Viçosa, MG, Brazil); de Fatima Ulisses, Alessandra (Federal Institute of Espírito Santo - Unit Alegre, Highway BR- 482, Km 47 – Countryside, Post Office Box 727, CEP: 29520-000 – Alegre, ES, Brazil); Pereira, Rodrigo Martins (Federal Institute of Espírito Santo - Unit Alegre, Highway BR- 482, Km 47 – Countryside, Post Office Box 727, CEP: 29520-000 – Alegre, ES, Brazil); Dutra, Geraldo José Alves (Federal Institute of Espírito Santo - Unit Alegre, Highway BR- 482, Km 47 – Countryside, Post Office Box 727, CEP: 29520-000 – Alegre, ES, Brazil); da Silva, Matheus Wandermurem (Federal Institute of Espírito Santo - Unit Alegre, Highway BR- 482, Km 47 – Countryside, Post Office Box 727, CEP: 29520-000 – Alegre, ES, Brazil); Berilli, Ana Paula Cândido Gabriel (Federal Institute of Espírito Santo - Unit Itapina, Highway BR-259, Km 70 – Countryside, Post Office Box 256, CEP: 29709-910 – Colatina, ES, Brazil); de Salles, Rodrigo Amaro (Center for Agrarian Sciences and Engineering, Federal University of Espírito Santo, CEP: 29500-000 – Alegre, ES, Brazil); de Almeida, Rafael Nunes (Center of Agricultural Sciences and Technologies, State University of the North of Rio de Janeiro Darcy Ribeiro, CEP: 28013-602 – Campos dos Goytacazes, RJ, Brazil)",,"da Silva Berilli, Sávio (Federal Institute of Espírito Santo - Unit Itapina, Highway BR-259, Km 70 – Countryside, Post Office Box 256, CEP: 29709-910 – Colatina, ES, Brazil); Valadares, Fernanda Vargas (Center of Agricultural Sciences and Technologies, State University of the North of Rio de Janeiro Darcy Ribeiro, CEP: 28013-602 – Campos dos Goytacazes, RJ, Brazil); de Sales, Ramon Amaro (Universidade Federal de Viçosa); de Fatima Ulisses, Alessandra (Federal Institute of Espírito Santo - Unit Alegre, Highway BR- 482, Km 47 – Countryside, Post Office Box 727, CEP: 29520-000 – Alegre, ES, Brazil); Pereira, Rodrigo Martins (Federal Institute of Espírito Santo - Unit Alegre, Highway BR- 482, Km 47 – Countryside, Post Office Box 727, CEP: 29520-000 – Alegre, ES, Brazil); Dutra, Geraldo José Alves (Federal Institute of Espírito Santo - Unit Alegre, Highway BR- 482, Km 47 – Countryside, Post Office Box 727, CEP: 29520-000 – Alegre, ES, Brazil); da Silva, Matheus Wandermurem (Federal Institute of Espírito Santo - Unit Alegre, Highway BR- 482, Km 47 – Countryside, Post Office Box 727, CEP: 29520-000 – Alegre, ES, Brazil); Berilli, Ana Paula Cândido Gabriel (Federal Institute of Espírito Santo - Unit Itapina, Highway BR-259, Km 70 – Countryside, Post Office Box 256, CEP: 29709-910 – Colatina, ES, Brazil); de Salles, Rodrigo Amaro (Universidade Federal do Espírito Santo); de Almeida, Rafael Nunes (Center of Agricultural Sciences and Technologies, State University of the North of Rio de Janeiro Darcy Ribeiro, CEP: 28013-602 – Campos dos Goytacazes, RJ, Brazil)",4,2,,0.37,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1113595683,"30 Agricultural, Veterinary and Food Sciences; 40 Engineering; 4011 Environmental Engineering",

There has not been sufficient analysis of how questions of decolonisation are shaped by other factors, such as the very spatial location of universities. This article argues that the colonial nature of the university in South Africa is directly linked spatially to the historic land question of dispossession in South Africa. Historically, South African universities came to be fixed as physical and cultural elements of towns and cities based on the broader trajectory of settler-colonialism and apartheid urban development, segregation and the Group Areas logic of the apartheid state. We therefore argue that in order to grapple with transforming the tertiary sector as a whole, we must conceptualise universities not only as spaces of learning but also as spatial entities in themselves that are directly related to the demography and economies of towns and cities. This paper critically explores the spatial locatedness of the university through the crisis of student accommodation encountered by working-class students in the system. We propose that inasmuch as the university is an “epistemic entity” entangled within colonial and imperial circuits of knowledge-making and power, it is also a “spatial entity” located in social geographies of inequality that were produced through racialised spatial relations of colonisation and apartheid.",,We acknowledge the funding support of the National Institute for the Humanities and Social Sciences and Nelson Mandela University in the production of this research.,South African Review of Sociology,,,,2019-10-02,2019,2020-03-26,2019-10-02,50,3-4,104-115,Closed,Article,"Mzileni, Pedro; Mkhize, Nomalanga","Mzileni, Pedro (Department of Sociology and Anthropology, Nelson Mandela University); Mkhize, Nomalanga (History Department, Rhodes University)","Mkhize, Nomalanga (Rhodes University)","Mzileni, Pedro (Nelson Mandela University); Mkhize, Nomalanga (Rhodes University)",10,6,,2.8,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1125923539,44 Human Society; 4406 Human Geography,10 Reduced Inequalities

Unlike other Black Consciousness (BC) organisations at the time, the APLF embraced armed struggle and acquired training in exile. This turn to armed struggle was motivated by the inability of the banned nationalist movements, the African National Congress (ANC) of South Africa and Pan Africanist Congress (PAC), to achieve their stated objectives of bringing down apartheid through force of arms. While the APLF disbanded in July/August 1976 without having fully established itself as an armed wing of the BCM, and having conducting no armed operations as far as we know, this article argues that it succeeded as a political project in two ways. Firstly, the attempt to form an armed wing in exile expanded the ways the growing BCM could mobilise against the repression of the apartheid state. With the older liberation movements beleaguered, the APLF temporarily provided an alternative for activists seeking ways to overthrow apartheid beyond non-violent protest and consciousness-raising projects. Secondly, the process of building global support for the APLF enhanced the radical internationalist politics and presence of BC outside South Africa’s borders. Unearthing this hidden topography of struggle demonstrates the dogged determination of black South Africans to fight for freedom independent of the leadership of the ANC/Umkhonto We Sizwe (MK) or PAC/Azanian People’s Liberation Army (APLA). Indeed, for a brief time, the APLF offered a viable alternative for how the struggle against apartheid would or should be fought and who would or should lead it.","I would like to thank Dr Michael West and Dr William Martin for their caring cultivation of me as a graduate student at Binghamton University.

It is shown that all samples of the obtained nanocomposites have multiferroic properties at room temperature. At the same time, there is a clearly demonstrated effect of the layering order on the values of remnant polarization and magnetization of these samples. This influence originates from the much smaller size of the crystallites in the BiFeO3 layers for the samples deposited in order (BFO/CFO) at various annealing temperatures (700, 725, and 750 °C).",Nikita A.

Method An instrumental study that involved the translation to Spanish of the items of the short version of the MAAS-5 scale, using the back-translation procedure. We analyzed the evidence of validity based on the test content, with the participation of a total of 14 expert judges. The degree of clarity, coherence and relevance of the items was quantified using the Aiken V coefficient and their 95% confidence intervals using an ad hoc template developed in the MS Excel program. Results The items of the MAAS-5 show favorable evaluations of their clarity, coherence and relevance, where all the values of V were statistically significant and greater than 0.70. On the other hand, the lower limit of 95% confidence intervals of all the items satisfies the criterion at population level (Li>0.59). Conclusion The empirical evidence of validity based on the test content of the MAAS-5 reports that all are sufficiently relevant, coherent and clear to adequately represent the construct mindfulness, both at sample and population level. This suggests that the MAAS-5 can be a brief and useful measure to assess mindfulness. On the other hand we suggest carrying out further studies that analyze other sources of evidence of validity of the MAAS-5.",,,Enfermería Clínica (English Edition),,,,2019-09,2019,,2019-09,29,5,308-312,Closed,Article,"Caycho-Rodríguez, Tomás; Ventura-León, José; Martinez-Munive, Renzo; Barboza-Palomino, Miguel","Caycho-Rodríguez, Tomás (Carrera de Psicología, Facultad de Ciencias de la Salud, Universidad Privada del Norte, Lima, Peru); Ventura-León, José (Carrera de Psicología, Facultad de Ciencias de la Salud, Universidad Privada del Norte, Lima, Peru); Martinez-Munive, Renzo (Carrera de Psicología, Facultad de Ciencias de la Salud, Universidad Privada del Norte, Lima, Peru); Barboza-Palomino, Miguel (Carrera de Psicología, Facultad de Ciencias de la Salud, Universidad Privada del Norte, Lima, Peru)","Caycho-Rodríguez, Tomás (Private University of the North)","Caycho-Rodríguez, Tomás (Private University of the North); Ventura-León, José (Private University of the North); Martinez-Munive, Renzo (Private University of the North); Barboza-Palomino, Miguel (Private University of the North)",1,1,,0.27,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1112609888,52 Psychology; 5203 Clinical and Health Psychology,

The RCTT was used instead of the travel time to capture the relative effect (say) due to a vehicle accident when compared with the no incident condition. Two types of RCTT were considered: travel time/expected travel time and travel time/minimum travel time. Databases were developed using data for 135 “Vehicle Accident” affected days and 128 days when there were no incidents, on a freeway corridor. The expected travel time was computed through averaging of all the travel time samples for a specific time period. The percent difference between the expected travel time and the observed travel time is less than 15% for 90% of the samples, indicating that the computed expected travel time represents the travel time during no incident condition. Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model was then applied to model RCTT. The Mean Absolute Percent Error (MAPE) of the fitted models, as well as for the validated models, was less than 15% for most of the segments, indicating the effectiveness of ARIMA in forecasting short-term spatiotemporal RCTT due to a vehicle accident.","Acknowledgements This paper is prepared based on information collected for a research project funded by the United States Department of Transportation – Office of the Assistant Secretary for Research and Technology (USDOT/OST-R) under Cooperative Agreement Number RITARS-12-H-UNCC.

322,pub.1122655706,10.1007/s11467-019-0939-7,,,Recovering information in probabilistic quantum teleportation,"In this paper we redesign the probabilistic teleportation scheme considered in Phys. Rev. A61, 034301 (2000) by Wan-Li Li et al., where the optimal state extraction protocol complements the basic teleportation process with a partially entangled pure state channel, in order to transfer the unknown state with fidelity 1. Unlike that scheme, where the information of the unknown state is lost if the state extraction fails, our proposal teleports exactly and optimally an unknown state, and allows to recover faithfully that state when the process has not succeeded. In order to study the resilience of the scheme, we apply it to the teleportation problem through a quantum channel in a mixed state with pure dephasing. We find that a successful process transfers an unfaithful state, namely, the outcome state acquires the decoherence of the channel, but the unknown state is recovered by the sender with fidelity 1 if the teleportation fails. In addition, in this case, the fidelity of the teleported state has quantum features only if the channel has an amount of entanglement different from zero.",This work was supported by FONDECyT under grant No. 1161631.

Six concrete mixes were manufactured by using three types of aggregate with different particle size distributions and consequently, diverse porosity in the matrix. Acoustic characteristics and mechanical properties of concrete were determined. In a complementary study, an X-ray computed tomography analysis has been carried out in order to establish a connection between the pore structure and its corresponding acoustic and mechanical behavior. Mixes composed of 80% wt of slag with particle sizes between 5 and 10 mm having higher porosity and a better acoustic absorption than those using natural coarse aggregate of the same particle size, although their mechanical properties are lower. A combination of three layers each 4 cm thick containing the larger slag particle sizes in the noise incident face of the concrete, followed by the medium slag particle size and finally, the finest material, presented excellent sound absorption properties, which allowed all the slag to be recycled.",Authors would like to acknowledge the partial financial support provided by the Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness through the project BIA2016-75431-R.,,Acoustics Australia,,,,2019-07-04,2019,2019-07-04,2019-12,47,3,271-276,Closed,Article,"Rios, J.

The storage of this material in dams is associated not only to environmental problems, but also with the risks related to the safety of the population. The aim of this research was to study a new alternative for reusing high-silicon iron ore tailings, applying them in the red clay ceramic industry. For this, a mixture design of experiments was developed, using three components - the iron ore tailings and two clayey materials – with the respective incorporation ranges: 0%–40% and 30%–70% (by mass). The raw materials were characterized physically, chemically, mineralogically and morphologically. Subsequently, ten mixtures obtained from the experimental design were prepared, and cylindrical specimens were formed by uniaxial pressing. After the firing at 850 °C, 950 °C and 1050 °C, the properties of firing linear shrinkage, bulk density, apparent porosity, water absorption, compressive strength and microstructure behavior of the specimens were assessed. Both the mixture design of experiments and desirability function enabled the determination of an optimal composition which contains 29.1% (by mass) of tailings and which meets the international standards. Next, small-scale construction bricks were produced based on this ideal mixture. The specimens were characterized physically, mechanically and environmentally. The brick has presented 20.94% of water absorption and compressive strength equal to 4.27 MPa, proving its potential to be used in sealing masonry. Besides, its environmental behavior has indicated that the material can be classified as non-hazardous and non-inert, and it is not aggressive to the environment or human health both during and after the useful life. This study has shown that the proposed brick presents advantages from an environmental, economic and technical points of view, contributing to sustainability in the industrial sector and civil construction.",This study was financed in part by the Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento Pessoal de Nível Superior – Brasil (CAPES) – Finance Code 001.

The dry beans were irradiated with different doses (1, 5 and 10 kGy) of γ-radiation using 60Co as source. The composition and nutritional properties (protein, fat, ash, tannin, phytic acid content and protein in vitro digestibility) of the cooked beans were analyzed, with and without previously soaking process. In addition, the technological properties (hydration index, cooking time and color) of the beans were also evaluated. The results showed that protein, fat, ash and tannin content, as well as color, were not affected by irradiation, while the phytic acid was significantly reduced by the irradiation. Further, hydration index was slightly reduced only by using 10 kGy suggesting probable structure changes. Irradiation reduced the cooking time of the beans, as higher irradiation doses were used, which was related with the reduction on the phytic acid content. Moreover, protein in vitro digestibility was enhanced by irradiation. In conclusion, irradiation up to 10 kGy can be safely used to improve the shelf life of common beans without degradation of nutritional components, reducing some antinutrients content, improving protein digestibility and reducing the cooking time.","The authors are grateful to the National Nuclear Energy Commission (CNEN, Brazil) for the financial assistance and D.C.

The hydration process was conducted conventionally and also assisted by ultrasound technology (ultrasonic water bath, 25 kHz, 41 W/L). Further than the hydration kinetics, the alkaloid content was evaluated. As results, the hydration kinetics of this grain showed a sigmoidal behavior, which was accelerated almost 40% using ultrasound. The lag phase was reduced about 13%, and the equilibrium moisture content was increased about 14%. Finally, by using ultrasound during hydration process, the alkaloid extraction was also improved, extracting 21% more compared to the conventional process. It was concluded that ultrasound technology accelerates not only the hydration process but also the extraction of alkaloids.    Practical Applications Andean lupin is a pulse with potential importance for human and animal alimentation due to its high quantity of proteins. However, this pulse has a considerable quantity of undesirable alkaloids that are bitter and toxic. Therefore, a debittering process is required. Further, before debittering, hydration of the grains is required, which is a long and batch process. This work demonstrated that both the hydration and the debittering processes can be enhanced by ultrasound. Consequently, ultrasound technology would have a double application during hydration process of Andean lupin grains.","The authors are grateful to the São Paulo Research Foundation (FAPESP, Brazil) for funding the projects n° 2014/16998‐3 and 2016/18052‐5; the National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq, Brazil) for funding the project n° 401004/2014‐7 and the productivity grant of P.E.D.

The state paid teachers’ salaries and in return it expected obedience and conformity from its employees. It was a tight-fisted, authoritarian education system, which stifled aspiration and human creativity. Yet, I want to argue in this paper, it unintentionally opened spaces which could nurture human ambition. I am not talking here about ambition merely for upward social mobility but for an assertion of humanity in the midst of a dehumanising social order. Morris Isaacson High School in Soweto was one of those spaces. I will show that Morris Isaacson, from the 1960s to the early 1990s, was a place where young people from mostly very poor backgrounds could aspire to be something more than an economic unit, where they could become creative and rounded human beings.

                    As island ecosystems are among the most critical breeding habitats for seabirds, their protection should enhance population viability for many species. The Peruvian Diving-petrel
                    Pelecanoides garnotii
                    breeds only in Chile and Perú, is an endangered seabird with historically large populations of over 100,000 breeding pairs, but fewer than 1,000 remained in the 1980s and it became the first endangered seabird of the Humboldt Current System. In Chile, they breed on five islands, three of which are legally protected, but only two have a management plan. Between 2010 and 2014, we evaluated the density of nests, burrow occupancy, and colony patch sizes on the islands to estimate the breeding population. The population trend was assessed by compiling historical data available in the literature and several unpublished technical reports. The current breeding population size in Chile was ∼12,500 breeding pairs (95% CI: 10,613–14,676 pairs) that is ∼34% of the breeding pairs reported for Peru (∼36,450 pairs). Choros Island, the only island with adequate protection, accounted for ∼95% of the total breeding population of the Peruvian Diving-petrel in Chile.

It seems that the adequate legal protection of Choros Island is leading to the recovery of Peruvian Diving-petrels, demonstrating that protection of breeding colonies remains an essential strategy for the conservation of endemic seabirds.","We thank CONAF for permission to conduct fieldwork and all volunteers for its participation.

Scanning and transmission electron microscopy showed that carbon films deposited at 510 °C are nanostructured polycrystalline carbon nanowalls with crystals of about 3 nm inside the flakes. The hydrogen flow induces the growth of nanowalls oriented perpendicularly to the substrate, and the density (amount) of these nanowalls decrease as the hydrogen flow increases. Field emission measurements showed that carbon nanowalls grown in hydrogen have a turn-on voltage of 2.0 V/µm, lower than those grown in pure argon with 4.5 V/µm.",This work was supported for Postdoctoral Fondecyt Project N°3140565 and Fondecyt N°1150652.

The objective of this research was to analyze the effect of positive social interaction on the psychological well-being of immigrants. Participants in this study were 684 Colombians and Peruvians, over 18 years old, living in Chile. They had to complete scales that evaluate their psychological well-being (Ryff) and others that evaluate their interaction with the environment (social role and social well-being). It is found that the positive social interaction had a significant and positive association with all dimensions of psychological well-being, except for autonomy. In this sense, the processes through which the individual interacts with society are related to their well-being.

Unlike the usual scalar field theory where a single scalar field is considered, the multi-scalar field cosmologies allow more than one scalar field and exhibits interetsing consequences, such as quintom, hybrid inflation etc. The current work study the existence of exact solutions and integrable dynamical systems in multi-scalar field cosmology and more specifically in the so-called Chiral cosmology where nonlinear terms exists in the kinetic term of the scalar fields. We present the exact analytic solutions for a system of N-scalar fields. In particular, we consider a multi scalar field cosmological scenario comprised of N-scalar fields that are minimally coupled to the Einstein gravity. The geometry of the universe is described by the spatially flat homogeneous and isotropic line element and the scalar fields may interact in their kinetic or/and potential terms. Within this set up, we show that for a specific geometry in the kinetic part of the scalar fields and specific potential form, the gravitational field equations for the class of N-scalar field models can be exactly solved. More specifically, we show that the Einstein field equations in N-scalar field cosmology can be reduced to that of a N+1$$\left( N+1\right) $$-linear system.","The authors thank Prof. S.V Chervon for useful comments and suggestions.

Then, the rheological properties were associated with zeta potential and particle aggregation/dispersion phenomena. Seawater raised the rheological properties compared to distilled water, generating an evident non-Newtonian behaviour, characterised by the appearance of yield stress, followed by a shear-thinning behaviour. This occurred because the high concentration of electrolytes compresses the ionic cloud that surrounds the particles' surfaces, overcoming the electrostatic repulsions, but besides, the seawater counterions (like Mg and Na) contribute to forming cationic bridges between the anionic particles. The addition of sodium polyacrylate did not induce significant alterations on the zeta potential; however, this formed a steric stabilisation where chord length measurements showed a greater presence of fine particles and fewer kaolin aggregates. The yield stress significantly diminished after polymer addition, while the viscoelastic modules and complex viscosity indicate that sodium polyacrylate reduces the strength of the particle networks that make up the slurry, but in turn, the phase angle indicates increase in its solid-like character.",Acknowledgement Pedro Robles thanks the Pontificia Universidad Católica de Valparaíso for the support provided.

This factor greatly affects crucial biological process such as feeding rates, energy balance, physiological stress status, and consequently, growth and survival of farmed abalone. Most of these effects have been studied in the economically valuable abalone Haliotis discus hannai. The use of specific photoperiods, and/or light qualities and intensities, have been proposed as managing strategies to increase its production; however, for extensive off-shore or in intensive land-based farming systems, lighting conditions are not likely to be easily managed. Despite the great importance of the biological responses to the light/dark stimuli for abalone farming production, to the best of our knowledge the genetic control upon the variation associated behavioral traits have not been studied. Therefore, the aim of this study was to estimate the heritable variation and potential responses to selection for the phototaxis [i.e., displacement towards (positive) or against (negative) the light source] and locomotion behaviors associated to the intensity of the response (i.e., crawling speed and displacement distance) to the light/dark stimuli in juvenile H. discus hannai. Genetic and phenotypic correlations between these traits were also estimated. Results showed moderate but significant heritable variations for phototaxis (h 2 = 0.15) and locomotion responses (h 2 = 0.18–0.37); and significant positive genetic correlations among them. Expected gain responses to selection per generation (with a selection intensity of 2.06, i.e., selecting 5% of the individuals from a population) were moderate for phototaxis variation (16%) and high for locomotion responses variation (33–67 or 36–73%, depending on the model used for the estimations). As a consequence, the potential for reducing (or incrementing, depending on the breeding goal) the reactivity or the sensibility to the light stimulus by selective breeding is good, and can be an attractive way of indirectly improving growth, survival and general welfare of farmed H. discus hannai.",We are grateful to the Centro de Producción de Abalón de la Universidad Católica del Norte (CPA-UCN) for their invaluable contribution in providing the abalone brooders and all the necessary facilities required to undertake this study under controlled conditions.,"This work was supported by the Fund for the Promotion of Scientific and Technological Development (FONDEF) of Chile [grant number D02I-1129], to FW; and the National Fund for Scientific and Technological Development (FONDECYT) of Chile [grant number 1110890] to KB and FW.",Aquaculture,,,,2019-02,2019,,2019-02,500,,645-650,Closed,Article,"Defranchi, Yohana D.; Winkler, Federico M.; Farías, William J.; Herbinger, Christophe; Brokordt, Katherina B.","Defranchi, Yohana D.

Firstly, glass substrates were coated with iron oxide (IO) films using a spraying method. Subsequently, the sputtering technique was employed for the formation of graphene films on the IO layers (G/IO films). According to XPS spectra, the IO films offered anchorage sites for the growth of G that improved the adherence to the substrate. Additionally, the sheet resistance of the films was in the range of 16–19.5 kΩ/□. Also, the optical measurements revealed that the G/IO films subjected to a post-deposition heat treatment presented a transmittance ~ 11% higher than those as-deposited. In fact, those heat-treated films presented a transparency above 80% for wavelengths above 850 nm and a high elasticity modulus of 0.188 ± 0.039 TPa, which make them good candidates to be used as transparent conductive electrodes in thin film transistors, surface plasmon biosensors or surface enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) substrates.","The authors gratefully acknowledge Conacyt, Sener, and IER-UNAM for funding through the Mexican Center for Innovation in Solar Energy (CeMIE-Sol), Project P-35.

An Agent-Based Model Approach,"Social network sites such as Twitter have madeeasier the exchange of information about products amongconsumers that are users of these networks. Thereby, marketersare using word of mouth marketing campaigns to engage users ofthese social networks in spreading the word about their products.The choice of consumers who participate in these campaigns is keyin their success. However, it is not clear which type of consumersand its combination are the most effective in reaching this aim.Unfortunately, the difficulty in getting useful data due to its noiseor non-public availability do not allow researchers toappropriately apply traditional methodologies like statistics.Hence, this paper proposes an agent-based model to simulate theinformation diffusion through Twitter when some types ofconsumers participate in word of mouth marketing campaigns.This model was implemented in Java and its results show that,although hubs (users with many contacts) are better connectedthan opinion leaders, the latter ones reach higher informationdiffusion because of its influence; in addition, the use of both typesof consumers in the same campaign achieves as diffusion as usingjust opinion leaders.

The samples were characterized by powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD), Raman spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy. PXRD and Raman spectroscopy showed that the samples crystallized with the orthorhombic perovskite crystal structure, which density functional theory (DFT) calculations suggest is the most energetically stable modification. In addition, Rietveld refinements and XPS analysis indicate that the Eu3+ ion replaces Sr2+ (noncentrosymmetric site) for samples with 1% and 3% Eu3+, while at higher concentrations of dopant, the Eu3+ ions replace both Sr2+ and Sn4+ (centrosymmetric site). Photoluminescence measurements show the characteristic emission spectra of Eu3+, in which the ratio of the intensities of the red/orange PL peaks is a maximum at 3% Eu3+ and then decreases continuously with concentration.

The samples were characterized by powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD), Raman spectroscopy and scanning electronic microscopy (SEM). Upconversion (UC) and second harmonic generation (SHG) were monitored by photoluminescence. The UC mechanism was studied by time-resolved spectroscopy. Through PXRD, it was possible to determine that all synthesized phases crystallized in a cubic perovskite-type structure. Raman spectra corroborated the coexistence of both cubic and tetragonal phases. For the BaTiO3:Ho3+ samples excited at 1200 and 1150 nm, the emission spectra exhibited only one peak corresponding to the second harmonic of the emission wavelength. On the other hand, for the BaTiO3:Ho3+/Yb3+ samples excited at 975 nm, the emission spectra exhibited an intense green band at 554 nm, a medium intensity red band at 665 nm and a weak band at 760 nm. The study of the dependence of UC emission intensity on the pump power of the incident laser and the decay curves of red and green emissions were used to elucidate the UC mechanism, which corresponded to the process known as ground state absorption/energy transfer upconversion.",The authors acknowledge Conicyt-Chile and Fondecyt (Grant 1181302) for their financial support.

Sustainability in oil industry is a crucial environmental issue, from the extraction to the delivery levels. As a result of the rapidly increasing population and industrialization, there would not only be the energy demand but also an increase in oil production in next decades affecting SD. Unfortunately, some industries including oil production are directly related to the CO2 and other harmful emissions making it an important issue in terms of sustainability. Therefore, assessment of sustainability performance of OPEC countries is of vital importance affecting the global energy sectors hierarchies. Along this line, via using a multiple attribute decision making (MADM) approach namely Combined Compromise Solution (CoCoSo), the OPEC countries are analysed according to 41 SD indicators in 10 dimensions in this study. Twelve selected main members of OPEC are evaluated based on the official real data and the outputs are tested through sensitivity analyses compared to other extensively known robust MADM methods. Based on the findings, United Arab Emirates is the most sustainable OPEC country with 71.9% performance score as well as Qatar, Kuwait, and Iran are positioned next with 69.3%, 66.6, and 56.2% performance scores, respectively.

Chile has made considerable progress in the designation of large‐scale marine protected areas in its oceanic islands with varying degrees of top‐down and bottom‐up processes, scientific knowledge and interplay among institutions.   The process of designating the multiple‐uses marine protected area in Rapa Nui (Easter Island) involved interplay among scientific research, capacity building, local knowledge and collaboration between sectors, which contributed to the community transformation toward marine conservation in Rapa Nui.   A recent increase in scientific research on the marine ecosystems was transmitted to stakeholders and the local community via capacity‐building actions. The knowledge‐based empowerment of the Rapanui population (inhabitants of Rapa Nui) involved the definition not only of the objectives, the extension and the conservation goals of the Rapa Nui multiple‐uses marine protected area, but also of the implications beyond the designation, such as issues of governance, management and financing.   The implementation of the Rapa Nui multiple‐uses marine protected area will test local and Rapanui government relationships. The continuous science‐knowledge‐based dialogue in a strengthened relationship between the government and the local community in a ‘process of relating’ might be the pathway to future effective conservation efforts and successes.","We are grateful to the Rapanui people and particularly CODEIPA for leading the process for creating the Rapa Nui MUMPA.

Different from previous literature efforts, the present work aims to seamlessly fuse a powerful machine learning strategy based on the active learning paradigm, in order to obtain greater efficacy regarding similarity queries in medical CBIR systems. To do so, we propose a new approach, named as Medical Active leaRning and Retrieval (MARRow) to aid the breast cancer diagnosis. It enables to deal with more feasible strategies, specifically for the medical context and its inherent constraints. We also proposed an active learning strategy to select a small set of more informative images, considering selection criteria based on not only similarity, but also on certain degrees of diversity and uncertainty. To validate our proposed approach, we performed experiments using public medical image datasets, different descriptors for each one and compared our approach against four widely applied and well-known literature approaches, such as: Traditional CBIR without relevance feedback strategies, Query Point Movement Strategy (QPM), Query Expansion (QEX) and SVM Active Learning (SVM-AL). From the experiments, we can observe that our approach presents a strong performance over state-of-the-art ones reaching a precision gain of up to 87.3%. MARRow also presented a well-suited and consistent increasing rate along the learning iterations. Moreover, our approach can significantly minimize the expert’s involvement in the analysis and annotation process (reducing up to 88%). The results testify that MARRow improves the precision of the similarity queries. It is capable to explore at the maximum the experts’ intentions, which are captured during the relevance feedback process, incrementally improving the learning model. Therefore, our approach can be suitable and applied in challenging processes, such as real and medical contexts, enhancing medical decision support systems (e.g. breast cancer diagnosis).","This work has been supported by National Council for Scientific and Technological Development - CNPq (grants #431668/2016-7, #422811/2016-5); Coordination for the Improvement of Higher Education Personnel - CAPES; Fundação Araucária; SETI; and UTFPR.",,Neurocomputing,,,,2019-09,2019,,2019-09,357,,1-10,Closed,Article,"Bressan, Rafael S.; Bugatti, Pedro H.; Saito, Priscila T.M.","Bressan, Rafael S.

Implications in the mining of copper,"The interactions between particles in the processed ore are a key feature in copper hydrometallurgical beneficiation. The formation of aggregates reduces the performance of some of the stages of the hydrometallurgical trains, in particular solvent extraction. In the case of copper hydrometallurgy, the most abundant colloids are silica and some clays, mostly kaolinite, which are difficult to separate under the typical conditions of low pH and 300 mM ionic strength. In this work a thorough electrokinetic investigation of concentrated suspensions of the two kinds of particles is presented, both individually and in mixtures, in conditions of pH and copper sulfate concentrations typical of the hydrometallurgical processes. The technique used was ESA (Electrokinetic Sonic Amplitude), whereby an alternating field is applied to the suspension and the generated pressure wave is analyzed. In the case of silica, it is found that the (dynamic or ac) electrophoretic mobility is quite low, and so is the best-fit zeta potential of the particles, as the pH gets close to the isoelectric point while the ionic strength is very high (80 mM copper sulfate). Our experiments also reveal that there are no specific interactions between silica and either copper or sulfate ions, which appear to have no other influence than compressing the double layers of the silica/solution interface. In the case of kaolinite, the dynamic mobility results indicate a large effect of the complex structures which are possible in suspensions of this clay (through face-to-face and face-to-edge interactions). Finally, a study was carried out of realistic mixtures of silica and kaolinite, with the aim of possibly predicting mixed structures, which were also ascertained by electron microscope observations. The results at low pH cannot be justified by a simple averaging between the mobility of silica and kaolinite alone, but by a non-trivial association between kaolinite and silica particles, being the latter attached to the former. At pH 5, the silica spheres do not show any preference for edges, and we can expect a predominant attraction towards positive alumina faces. Sedimentation experiments indicate that the conditions described at low pH slow down the sedimentation rate of kaolinite-silica as compared to silica alone, contrary to findings at pH 5.","Financial support by Junta de Andalucía, Spain (PE2012-FQM 694) and University of Granada (Incorporación de Jóvenes Doctores, Plan Propio de Investigación) is gratefully acknowledged.",,Minerals Engineering,,,,2019-04,2019,,2019-04,134,,193-201,Closed,Article,"Valenzuela-Elgueta, J.; Jimenez, Y.P.; Delgado, A.V.; Ahualli, S.","Valenzuela-Elgueta, J.

                  In reptiles, polyploidy is an unusual phenomenon that can originate from interspecific hybridization. In Chile, the lizard Liolaemus chiliensis provides a unique model with which to study the origin of polyploidy because it occurs in populations of diploid individuals and a few populations that also contain triploid and diploid–triploid mosaic lizards. To test whether L. chiliensis polyploids were hybrids between lineages within the species, we analysed the karyotype, the mitochondrial gene Cytb, seven microsatellite loci, and the linear and geometric morphometry of individuals throughout the species distribution. We found polyploidy at different localities throughout the distribution. Hybrids were detected with the microsatellite loci and morphological data. A clear relationship between hybridization and polyploidy could not be established because triploid and mosaic lizards were hybrids and purebreds. However, our results support the occurrence of both phenomena, and further research is needed to clarify how hybridization could be involved in the origin of polyploidy.","Procedures with animals agreed with the ethical guidelines of the University of Chile and to Chilean law (Servicio Agrícola y Ganadero, Gobierno de Chile collecting permits 688–3095).

A two-stage approach is first used for simulating the intrusive porphyry and the copper grade in it, while the other two rock type domains and their copper grade are jointly simulated in the space not occupied by porphyry. Such a mixed approach is shown to reproduce the nature of the rock type boundaries and is validated by split-sample validation.","The authors acknowledge the funding of the Chilean Commission for Scientific and Technological Research, through grants AMTC AFB180004 PIA CONICYT (XE) and CONICYT/FONDECYT/POSTDOCTORADO/N°3180655 (MM).

The observations were made at the ESO and Sierra Armazones (Chile) observatories over 3 seasons: in March 1998, in 2007-2009, and in May 2013. A total of 41 spectra of the object were obtained. An analysis of the radial velocities of the lines from both system component yielded the orbital elements and an orbital period of P = 2.3650804 ± 0.0000034 days was found. Using a model of stellar atmospheres we separated the spectra of the two components and found their parameters to be Teff = 25700 ± 400 K, logg = 4.27 ± 0.05, and Teff = 19200 ± 600 K, logg = 4.03 ± 0.20 for components A and B, respectively. We confirmed the presence of moving local features in the profiles of the SiIII lines in the spectrum of component A which may be associated either with pulsation activity of the star or with the rotation of spot-like inhomogeneities on its surface. We found that the lines in the spectrum of component B have another type of variability in which the width and depth of almost all the atmospheric lines change in opposite phase on individual dates. It was found that the system is substantially asynchronous. We assume that the desynchronization of the system may arise from gravitational interactions of the system with a third body, since the density of stars within the OB association must be much higher than usual.",,,Astrophysics,,,,2019-05-10,2019,2019-05-10,2019-06,62,2,183-201,Closed,Article,"Pogodin, M.

At the present time, the life cycle of this species in captivity has been closed at experimental level; however, high mortalities at the early paralarvae stage are a limiting factor for attaining sustainable production. Cannibalism has been identified as one of the main mortality causes at the early paralarvae rearing. Stress has been proposed as an important cause of cannibalism in cephalopods. Likewise, nutritional deficiency has been suggested as a potential cause to onset cannibalism. However, neither of both factors has been directly assessed in cephalopod paralarvae. In the present study, we aimed to elucidate if physiological stress due to a food shortage and/or to a high rearing density of paralarvae trigger cannibalism in E. megalocyathus. An experiment was carried out with newly hatched paralarvae, under conditions that trigger cannibalism with densities of 10 and 15 paralarvae L−1 combined with two measures of prey availability: 0 and 2 prey paralarva−1 day−1. Paralarvae alone in the aquarium fed ad libitum was used as a control to avoid cannibalism. Nutritional status was assessed as the total protein and energy content per paralarvae; and the 70 kD heat shock protein (HSP70) transcript level was used as a bioindicator of physiological stress, documented as a suitable stress biomarker for cephalopods. No differences were observed between the treatments and control in the absolute protein levels and energy content. There was a strong induction in HSP70 transcriptional level when high density and prey availability where combined, proving that there are only a few paralarvae rearing combinations that cause critical stress and trigger HSP70 transcription. In experimental conditions, nutritional status indicators showed that early paralarvae, with similar reserves of protein and energy, exhibited cannibalism. Results suggest that mortality as well as cannibalism is associated with competition for prey and with nutritional and energy imbalance due to food shortage that determines the expression of the related stress gene.","We are very grateful for the technical support of Pablo Garcés, Matías Vega and Augusto Vargas.

These foams were prepared with different starch/fiber ratios and then were characterized according to their microstructure and physical and mechanical properties. The starch/fiber ratio of 95/5 showed the lowest values of thickness and density (2.58 mm and 367 kg m

                    , respectively). There was a good distribution of the pineapple shell fiber throughout the polymeric matrix. All FTs showed a semicrystalline structure and 95/5 ratio showed the highest crystallinity index (CI) value (39%). In addition, this ratio improved the tensile strength of the FTs, obtaining similar values to expanded polystyrene (EPS) samples, used as the reference material. Nevertheless, all FTs reinforced with pineapple shell fiber showed high water absorption capacity (WAC); therefore, future studies should focus on to improve the physicochemical and structural properties of the cassava starch-based foams, considering the promising potential of this novel biodegradable material for dry food packaging, such as a viable alternative to reduce the use of petroleum-based materials such as commercial EPS trays.",,,Polymers and Polymer Composites,,,,2019-05-22,2019,2019-05-22,2019-10,27,8,496-506,Closed,Article,"Cabanillas, Arnold; Nuñez, Julio; Cruz-Tirado, JP; Vejarano, R; Tapia-Blácido, Delia R; Arteaga, Hubert; Siche, Raúl","Cabanillas, Arnold (Escuela de Ingeniería Agroindustrial, Universidad Nacional de Trujillo, Trujillo, Peru); Nuñez, Julio (Escuela de Ingeniería Agroindustrial, Universidad Nacional de Trujillo, Trujillo, Peru); Cruz-Tirado, JP (Escuela de Ingeniería Agroindustrial, Universidad Nacional de Trujillo, Trujillo, Peru); Vejarano, R (Facultad de Ingeniería, Universidad Privada del Norte (UPN).

Among the metal clusters, the Cu13 cluster produced the highest electrical conductivity on graphene and the lowest values of binding energies, which in turn, favored the chemical reactivity of the graphene QDs.

Considering that these effects depend on the distance to the hard bottoms, we expected that the infaunal structure and recolonization would change accordingly. We assessed whether the distance from a rocky shore alters infaunal recolonization in a subtropical tidal flat. Sediment was defaunated on sites near and far from a rocky shore and the subsequent faunal recolonization was followed for 40 days. The sites near and far from the rocky shore displayed different assemblage structures, which we attributed to local variation in hydrodynamic conditions. Both the total infaunal abundance and the abundance of the dominant species recovered faster at the near site. We indicate that changes in infaunal recolonization at varying distances from natural rocky shores are primarily driven by the availability of adults. Infaunal recovery took less than 2 weeks, but recolonization rates increased near the rocky shore, as a function of its naturally variable assemblage structure and relatively lower species richness and abundances. We suggest that models of infaunal distribution and recolonization should incorporate landscape features such as the presence and distance from rocky bottoms.","This study was funded by the Federal University of Paraná (UFPR) and the Coordination for the Improvement of Higher Education Personnel (CAPES).

For that, three varieties of quinoa: “Negra Collana”, “Passankalla Roja” and “INIA Salcedo” were studied. Malting process consisted of hydration (4 h - 25 °C), germination (48 h −25 °C), drying (24 h–55 °C) and deculming (radicle removing) steps. In both, malted and unmalted grains, the following determinations were carried out: total phenolic compounds, flavonoids, antioxidant capacity, ascorbic acid, reducing sugars, protein, total fat and ash content. As main results, malting process significantly affected the nutritional properties, increasing phenolic compounds, flavonoids, antioxidant capacity, ascorbic acid and reducing sugars in all varieties. However, ash, protein and fat content were reduced due to germination metabolism, excepting in Negra Collana variety, whose protein content was increased by malting. In conclusion, only Negra Collana and Pasankalla Roja varieties received advantages from malting: Malted Negra Collana quinoa would contribute with proteins and minerals, while Pasankalla Roja would contribute with ascorbic acid, reducing sugars and bioactive compounds, being useful as ingredients for the formulation of new products.",The authors thank the Universidad Nacional de Trujillo for the funding received through “Canon Minero” funds (PIC05-2014-III).,,Journal of Cereal Science,,,,2019-11,2019,,2019-11,90,,102858,Closed,Article,"Aguilar, Julio; Miano, Alberto Claudio; Obregón, Jesús; Soriano-Colchado, José; Barraza-Jáuregui, Gabriela","Aguilar, Julio (Escuela de Ingeniería Agroindustrial, Facultad de Ciencias Agropecuarias, Universidad Nacional de Trujillo, Trujillo, Peru); Miano, Alberto Claudio (Facultad de Ingeniería, Universidad Privada del Norte, Trujillo, Peru); Obregón, Jesús (Data Engineering, Trujillo, Peru); Soriano-Colchado, José (Escuela de Ingeniería en Industrias Alimentarias, Facultad de Ciencias Agrarias, Universidad Privada Antenor Orrego, Trujillo, Peru); Barraza-Jáuregui, Gabriela (Escuela de Ingeniería Agroindustrial, Facultad de Ciencias Agropecuarias, Universidad Nacional de Trujillo, Trujillo, Peru)","Barraza-Jáuregui, Gabriela (National University of Trujillo)","Aguilar, Julio (National University of Trujillo); Miano, Alberto Claudio (Private University of the North); Obregón, Jesús (Data Engineering, Trujillo, Peru); Soriano-Colchado, José (Antenor Orrego Private University); Barraza-Jáuregui, Gabriela (National University of Trujillo)",50,25,,7.41,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1121964716,"30 Agricultural, Veterinary and Food Sciences; 3006 Food Sciences",

A bilinear control is applied on the flow domain, while Dirichlet and Navier boundary conditions for the velocity are assumed on the boundary. As a first step, we enunciate a result on the existence of weak solutions of the dynamical equation; this is done by firstly expressing the fluid density in terms of the stream-function. Then, the bilinear optimal control problem is analyzed, and the existence of optimal solutions are proved; their corresponding characterization regarding the first-order optimality conditions are obtained. Such optimality conditions are rigorously derived by using a penalty argument since the weak solutions are not necessarily unique neither isolated, and so standard methods cannot be applied.","E.

This will be achieved with a dedicated robotic telescope with one of the world's largest CCDs with the smallest pixels, enabling a field of view of 52.5 square degrees with a sampling of 2.5″/pix. Auxiliary science is also foreseen and will focus on the period–mass relation of Ptolemy's cluster (M7). In this paper, we describe the entire telescope system and show initial commissioning data.","We most warmly thank the Geodetic Observatory Wettzell (GOW) in Bad Kötzting, particularly Dr Thomas Klügel (Bundesamt für Kartographie und Geodäsie) and Prof. Urs Hugentobler (Technical University of Munich), for their support with the BMK and its relocation to Potsdam.

245,pub.1112955714,10.1093/mnras/stz848,,,On the structure of the Pleiades cluster,"The data available on the distances (both from Gaia DR2 and those determined from interstellar Ca ii lines) to the brightest stars in the Pleiades (‘Seven Sisters’ and their ‘parents’) suggest that these stars highly likely do not form a compact cluster but are localized in front of the main (Pleiades) cluster – at a distance close to that given by Hipparcos. Spectrophotometric distances agree with those from Gaia and Ca ii for the brighter stars, but exhibit a large scatter for the stars at the cluster core. According to our study, this effect can be explained by additional (‘grey’) interstellar extinction due to the presence of larger dust grains within the Pleiades cluster core. Also, we confirm the suggestion that the spatial association of the Pleiades stars and interstellar gas is a result of a chance encounter between the cluster and one or more (at least two) approaching clouds. Indeed, we found that the relatively strong CH+ lines observed in the spectra of the Pleiades stars can be divided into two sets: one with very strong lines of the radical and another with relatively faint ones. Both groups also differ in radial velocities.","JK acknowledges the financial support of the Polish National Science Centre during the period 2015–2019 (grant 2015/17/B/ST9/03397) and the grant UMO-2017/25/B/ST9/01524 for the period 2018–2021.

Empirical observations were undertaken under the Circumpolar Active Layer Monitoring (CALM) program at a range of sites across the permafrost landscapes of the Yana-Indigirka and Kolyma lowlands and the Chukotka Peninsula, and supplemented with 10 years of observations from volcanic mountainous areas of the Kamchatka Peninsula. Thaw depth observations, taken using mechanical probing at the end of the thawing season, and ground temperature measurements, were analyzed with respect to air temperatures trends. The data from 24 sites (16 in the Indigirka-Kolyma region, 5 in Chukotka and 3 in Kamchatka) reveal different reactions of the active layer thickness (ALT) to recent changes in atmospheric climate. In general, there is a positive relation between ALT and summer air temperatures. Since the early 2000s positive ALT anomalies (compared with mean data from all sites) prevail in the Kolyma and Chukotka area, with only one alas site showing a negative ALT trend. The only active site in the Kamchatka Mountains shows no significant thaw depth changes over the period of observation. Two other Kamchatka sites were affected during a volcanic eruption in 2012.","We are especially grateful to Dmitry Fyodorov-Davydov, who organized and controlled the measurement program in the Kolyma area.

Although positive plant–plant interactions have been shown to contribute to plant performance and establishment, little is known about how microorganisms might modulate those interactions, particularly in stressful environmental conditions. Several reports have focused on the possible ecological roles of microorganisms on vascular plants, but if rhizospheric microorganisms can impact positive interactions among Antarctic plants has been seldom studied. Here, we assessed the physical–chemical characteristics of rhizospheric soils from Cq growing alone or associated with Da (Cq + Da). In addition, we compared the rhizosphere microbiomes associated with Cq, either growing alone or associated with Da (Cq + Da), using a shotgun metagenomic DNA sequencing approach and using eggNOG for comparative and functional metagenomics. Overall, there were no differences among rhizospheric soils in terms of physical–chemical characteristics. On the other hand, our results show significant differences in terms of taxonomic diversity between rhizospheric soils. Functional annotation and pathway analysis showed that microorganisms from rhizospheric soil samples also have significant differences in gene abundance associated with several functional categories related to environmental tolerance and in metabolic pathways linked to osmotic stress, among others. Overall, this study provides foundational information which will allow to explore the biological impact of the rhizobiome and its functional mechanisms and molecular pathways on plant performance and help explain the concerted strategy deployed by Cq to inhabit and cope with the harsh conditions prevailing in Antarctica.","We thank Instituto Antártico Chileno (INACH) and the Chilean Navy for logistics and field support.

Starch/SB and starch/AP trays containing different concentrations of SB and AP (0%‐40%, w /w) were prepared, and their microstructure and physical, thermal, and mechanical properties were characterized. The addition of fibers wastes allowed obtaining a yellowish foam tray with lower luminosity and higher porosity, mechanical resistance, deformability, and better ability to absorb water as compared with the sweet potato starch foam trays without fibers. The addition of SB yielded foam trays less porous, with lower water absorption capacity and greater tensile strength than the addition of AP. Higher concentrations of AP fibers (greater than 30%) generate more extendible foam trays. The addition of fibrous wastes improved the thermal stability of the sweet potato starch foam trays. The composite foam trays produced in this work could be used as substitutes for expanded polystyrene in dry food packaging.",Raúl Siche thanks the following institutions for funding: Programa Nacional de Innovación para la Competitividad y Productividad (INNÓVATE PERÚ) ‐ Contract 407 PNICP‐PIAP‐2014 and Universidad Nacional de Trujillo ‐ UNT (PIC2‐2013/UNT).,,Packaging Technology and Science,,,,2019-02-11,2019,2019-02-11,2019-05,32,5,227-237,Closed,Article,"Cruz‐Tirado, Jam Pier; Vejarano, Ricardo; Tapia‐Blácido, Delia R.; Angelats‐Silva, Luis M.; Siche, Raúl","Cruz‐Tirado, Jam Pier (Facultad de Ciencias Agropecuarias, Universidad Nacional de Trujillo, Trujillo, Peru); Vejarano, Ricardo (Facultad de Ingeniería, Universidad Privada del Norte (UPN), Trujillo, Peru); Tapia‐Blácido, Delia R.

The results show that consumer confidence indicators are positively related to later consumption growth, suggesting that consumption increases after periods of high consumer confidence. This result contradicts the theoretical predictions of consumption expenditures (for instance, the Precautionary Saving Hypothesis). Furthermore, the results show that consumer confidence measures can be good predictors of consumption, even after controlling for the information contained in other economic fundamentals. This evidence suggests that consumer confidence in Chile also reflect a component of consumer sentiment that is unrelated to macroeconomic conditions. Finally, additional results show that predictive models that include consumer confidence produce more accurate predictions for positive, rather than for negative, changes in consumption over the next month.","We would like to offer thanks to the participants of the 2016 Chilean Economic Society Meetings, Viña del Mar, Chile for their valuable comments.",,International Review of Applied Economics,,,,2019-08-19,2019,2019-08-19,2020-01-02,34,1,75-93,Closed,Article,"Acuña, Guillermo; Echeverría, Cristián; Pinto-Gutiérrez, Cristian","Acuña, Guillermo (School of Business and Economics, Centro de Estudios en Economía y Negocios, Universidad del Desarrollo, Santiago, Chile); Echeverría, Cristián (School of Business and Economics, Centro de Estudios en Economía y Negocios, Universidad del Desarrollo, Santiago, Chile); Pinto-Gutiérrez, Cristian (Department of Management, Universidad Católica del Norte, Antofagasta, Chile)","Acuña, Guillermo (Universidad del Desarrollo)","Acuña, Guillermo (Universidad del Desarrollo); Echeverría, Cristián (Universidad del Desarrollo); Pinto-Gutiérrez, Cristian (Catholic University of the North)",14,6,,5.62,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1120403731,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3502 Banking, Finance and Investment; 38 Economics; 3801 Applied Economics; 3802 Econometrics",

We evaluated to which degree the distribution of soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks depends on aridity. We questioned that these OM traces of life preferentially accumulate in topsoil and investigated whether there was also an enrichment of OM in deeper subsoil. We sampled four west-east directed transects with increasing distance to the coast, spanning the Atacama Desert from north to south, plus a hyperarid site at Yungay in the centre of the desert. With a nested sampling design we addressed topsoil heterogeneity at each sampling site (n ≤ 18). For 12 of these sites soil profiles were dug to 0.6–2.0 m depth. The SOC concentrations were determined for each sample by temperature-dependent differentiation of total carbon. We found that with increasing distance to the coast (2.3 to 86.8 km) and thus aridity, SOC stocks decreased from 53.91 ± 53.90 to 4.11 ± 1.46 t SOC ha−1 in the topsoil. Hence, traces of life were ubiquitously preserved in both, arid and hyperarid desert areas, whereas a local hyperarid minimum of 1.02 ± 0.18 t SOC ha−1 at 49.2 km distance, right in between the Andes and the coast, was found. Intriguingly, relatively large amounts of OM were found at depth below 15 cm, adding 74.0 to 94.3 % of subsoil SOC to the topsoil SOC stock. Furthermore, the subsoil SOC concentrations peaked between 40 and 150 cm depth in the soil, irrespectively of the presence or absence of visible vegetation. We conclude that carbon accrual in this arid to hyperarid system shifts from preferential carbon enrichment in topsoil to subsoil, therewith providing the potential for deep(er) biosphere food-webs and demonstrating the future need to dig into soil for discovering traces of life in comparable environments, including other planets such as Mars.","This project was funded by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG, German Research Foundation) - Projektnummer 268236062 – SFB 1211.

We found the problem to be significantly different from that of routing regular students. The principle differences include the need to pick up special education student from their home, the need to configure buses appropriately for special education students, and the need to provide a higher level of service. Building upon prior work we developed a greedy heuristic coupled with a column generation approach to obtain approximate solutions for benchmark instances. Our findings demonstrated a 10 ∼ 20% cost reduction, which is particularly significant since special education transportation account for 40% of the transportation budget.",The authors wish to thank two anonymous reviewers whose comments on an earlier version of this paper helped significantly highlight its contribution.,,Socio-Economic Planning Sciences,,,,2019-03,2019,,2019-03,65,,10-19,Closed,Article,"Caceres, Hernan; Batta, Rajan; He, Qing","Caceres, Hernan (Departamento de Ingeniería Industrial, Universidad Católica del Norte, Antofagasta, Chile; Department of Industrial and Systems Engineering, University at Buffalo, Buffalo, NY, USA); Batta, Rajan (Department of Industrial and Systems Engineering, University at Buffalo, Buffalo, NY, USA); He, Qing (Department of Industrial and Systems Engineering, University at Buffalo, Buffalo, NY, USA; Department of Civil, Structural and Environmental Engineering, University at Buffalo, Buffalo, NY, USA)","Caceres, Hernan (Catholic University of the North; University at Buffalo, State University of New York)","Caceres, Hernan (Catholic University of the North; University at Buffalo, State University of New York); Batta, Rajan (University at Buffalo, State University of New York); He, Qing (University at Buffalo, State University of New York; University at Buffalo, State University of New York)",22,5,,9.61,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1101317306,33 Built Environment and Design; 3304 Urban and Regional Planning; 44 Human Society; 4404 Development Studies; 49 Mathematical Sciences; 4901 Applied Mathematics,4 Quality Education

Hence, the aim of the study was to examine the mediating role forgiveness of the former partner in this association.MethodThe sample was composed of 1008 divorced or separated individuals (55.5% women; M = 38.71, SD = 12.25) from Chile. Participants completed the Experiences in Close Relationships Scale to measure romantic attachment, the Questionnaire of Forgiveness in Divorce and Separation to evaluate forgiveness of the former partner, and the Psychological Adjustment to Separation Test to measure the adjustment to divorce and separation.ResultsUsing structural equation modeling, mediational analyses revealed that attachment anxiety was both directly and indirectly associated to ADS through forgiveness (indirect effects: loneliness = 0.08, p < 0.001, 95% CI [0.029, 0.107]; attachment to the former partner = 0.06, p < 0.001, 95% CI [0.018, 0.104]), whereas attachment avoidance had only a direct effect on ADS. Multigroup analysis revealed that this pattern of relationships was invariant across gender.ConclusionsThese results highlight the role that attachment and forgiveness play in the process of adjusting to a relationship dissolution that may be useful for clinical work with separated individuals or parents.",,,Journal of Child and Family Studies,,,,2019-05-28,2019,2019-05-28,2019-11,28,11,3011-3021,Closed,Article,"Guzmán-González, Mónica; Wlodarczyk, Anna; Contreras, Paula; Rivera-Ottenberger, Diana; Garrido, Lusmenia","Guzmán-González, Mónica (School of Psychology, Universidad Católica del Norte, Antofagasta, Chile); Wlodarczyk, Anna (School of Psychology, Universidad Católica del Norte, Antofagasta, Chile); Contreras, Paula (School of Psychology, Universidad Católica del Norte, Antofagasta, Chile); Rivera-Ottenberger, Diana (School of Psychology, Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile, Santiago, Chile); Garrido, Lusmenia (Department of Psychology, Universidad Católica del Maule, Talca, Chile)","Guzmán-González, Mónica (Catholic University of the North)","Guzmán-González, Mónica (Catholic University of the North); Wlodarczyk, Anna (Catholic University of the North); Contreras, Paula (Catholic University of the North); Rivera-Ottenberger, Diana (Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile); Garrido, Lusmenia (Catholic University of the Maule)",7,3,,1.56,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1115953914,52 Psychology; 5202 Biological Psychology; 5203 Clinical and Health Psychology; 5205 Social and Personality Psychology,

The data analysed correspond to a sample of online players through mobile devices in Spain. A structural equation approach based on Partial Least Squares was used to assess the acceptance model. The result of the analysis indicates that UTAUT 2 explains 71% of the use of online games in mobile devices. The main conclusion of the study highlights the importance of habit in the use of online games. Specifically, the intention to play online is explained, in order of importance, by the variables habit, hedonic motivation and social identity. In addition, the use of an online game is determined by habit and intention to play.

This article presents the current situation in the field of desalination in Chile aiming to identify the current and future desalination capacity, the major technical difficulties, environmental issues, and economic aspects faced by the desalination industry in the country. The current situation is presented by making an inventory of the industrial scale and by reviewing the scientific literature on the subject published until 2018. It was identified that eleven desalination plants at the industrial scale are operating in Chile, producing a total of 5,868 l/s of desalinated water. Also, there are ten desalination projects in different stages of evaluation, which will increase the desalination capacity by 116.5% to reach a total of 12,706 l/s in the coming years. Moreover, the major challenges identified were the harmful algal bloom events, the disposal of desali-nation concentrate, and the high energy consumption by water supply systems.

Lysmata boggessi was predicted to engage in APC given that the egg masses spawned by hermaphrodites are > 1 mm thick, the theoretical limit that allows sufficient oxygen supply by diffusion in living tissue. Furthermore, APC was predicted to increase in intensity with embryo development. Lastly, the ultrastructure of appendages used for APC was examined and it was predicted that these appendages will bear specialized structures to aid in this function. Hermaphrodites brooding early and late embryos were collected August–November 2017 from near Tavernier, Florida, USA (25.0115°N, 80.5151°W), transported to the laboratory, and maintained in aquaria to describe and quantify APC during day and night. The morphology of an appendage involved in APC was compared with two other appendages not associated with APC using scanning electron microscopy. Lysmata boggessi engaged in APC likely using some behaviors to clean (e.g., grooming using second pereiopods) and provide oxygen to the eggs (e.g., pleopod fanning). Pleopod fanning was performed more frequently by hermaphrodites carrying late compared to early embryos, likely permitting hermaphrodites to minimize problems related to oxygen limitation in older more metabolically active embryos. Lysmata boggessi also engaged in APC both day and night. The 2nd pereiopods have setae that may be well suited for aiding in APC. This study supports evidence that small brooding marine invertebrates that produce small but compact embryo masses engage in APC.","This study was supported by Creative Inquiry, a program at Clemson University that engages undergraduates in research, learning and cross-disciplinary interactions.

237,pub.1120482705,10.1016/j.envsci.2019.08.005,,,National trends in the biodiversity interest in digital media,"During the last two decades, online media have played an increasing role in modeling modern societies. However, their role to shape public perception of biodiversity conservation and their alignment with conservation policies have received little attention so far. We conducted an extensive qualitative assessment of the interest in biodiversity in online media in the case-study of Chile in order to identify the main topics that are covered and how they vary across time and geographic scale. We also compared national trends of biodiversity interest in Chile and other countries as a first assessment of the international situation. Regarding Chilean digital media, our results highlight that there is a diversification of the biodiversity-related topics in news articles when reducing geographic scale. Overall, regardless of the considered scale, conservation policies, biodiversity loss, environmental education and citizen participation represented over 60% of the topics covered by digital news articles. Regarding the 8 selected countries, biodiversity interest in digital media followed two contrasting inter-annual trends equally: on the one side, a growing coverage of biodiversity topics (Brazil, Colombia, France and Spain), and on the other side, a constant or decreasing interest in the other countries (Australia, Chile, Costa Rica and South Africa). Our analysis also indicates that national media interest in biodiversity is multifactorial and may strongly depend on the link a country has between its economy and natural resources, its political influence on the media and the holding of major environmental summits coupled with concrete political actions. Apparent disconnection of media and public interest observed on a continuous scale may indicate that other factors are prone to shape the public interest in biodiversity. This first assessment calls for further research, especially about the underlying processes driving changes in biodiversity interest, in order to implement effective conservation actions. It also invites conservation managers to diversify their conservation targets, taking into consideration biodiversity interest transmitted by media to wide audiences.","This manuscript was prepared within the course of Socioecology and Conservation Biology of the PhD program in Applied Biology and Ecology (cooperative program between the Universidad Católica del Norte, Coquimbo, and the University of La Serena).

Material and methods Two studies were performed: 1) a cross-sectional study (n =120) on the association of IL-6 and TNFα with the caries index, anthropometric measures, physical tests, and experience in volleyball practice; 2) longitudinal study (n =63) on the effects of 8 weeks of training on salivary IL-6 and TNFα in girls with intermediate experience in volleyball and competitive girls. Results The median levels of IL-6 were 1.98 [1.55–3.11]pg/ml and TNFα, 0.46 [0.28–0.59]pg/ml and these did not correlate with the caries index, BMI, training volume, training practice, or cardiovascular risk. A correlation was observed between IL-6 and TNFα (r =0.34; p <0.001), IL-6 and vertical jump height (r =−0.28, p <0.005), and TNFα and age (r =0.33; p <0.001). After 8 weeks of training, TNFα levels increased in the intermediate and competitive groups (p <0.05), while IL-6 levels decreased only in the intermediate level group (p <0.05). Conclusion the median levels of IL-6 and TNFα did not correlate with the caries index, BMI, training volume, experience practice, or cardiovascular risk. Salivary levels of IL-6 were downmodulated in the group with intermediate experience and TNFα was upmodulated by training.","The authors would like to thank the Coordination for the Improvement of Higher Education Personnel (CAPES) for granting a scholarship to C.P.S.

Several computer vision approaches have been proposed for tackling food analysis problems, but very little effort has been done in developing methodologies that could take profit of the existent correlation between tasks. In this paper, we propose a new multi-task model that is able to simultaneously predict different food-related tasks, e.g. dish, cuisine and food categories. Here, we extend the homoscedastic uncertainty modeling to allow single-label and multi-label classification and propose a regularization term, which jointly weighs the tasks as well as their correlations. Furthermore, we propose a new Multi-Attribute Food dataset and a new metric, Multi-Task Accuracy. We prove that using both our uncertainty-based loss and the class regularization term, we are able to improve the coherence of outputs between different tasks. Moreover, we outperform the use of task-specific models on classical measures like accuracy or F 1 .","This work was partially funded by TIN2015-66951-C2-1-R, 2017 SGR 1742, Nestore, 20141510 (La MaratoTV3) and CERCA Programme/Generalitat de Catalunya.

These modes provide an integrated response to changes in feed mineralogy, and other operational conditions within the mineral value chain. The decision to alternate between modes depends on current and forecasted stockpile levels. Moreover, the optimization of stockpile thresholds that would trigger a mode change is related to the classical RQ problem from inventory theory. Particularly for concentrators that are designed for blended feeds, there may be production intervals in which a particular ore class is at risk of stockout. Indeed, geological uncertainty causes stockout risk, which should be balanced with other key performance indicators, including throughput and recovery, and is a context for multiobjective optimization. Computations are presented in which a concentrator that had originally been designed for a certain ore blend, after years of successful operation, now requires alternate modes to realign its operations with geological forecasts.",,,Minerals Engineering,,,,2019-04,2019,,2019-04,134,,356-364,Closed,Article,"Navarra, A.; Alvarez, M.; Rojas, K.; Menzies, A.; Pax, R.; Waters, K.","Navarra, A.

236,pub.1121052653,10.1515/multi-2019-0054,,,A local discursive dimension in a specific historical context: Students’ narratives of police experiences during South Africa’s #FeesMustFall protests,"Most studies on campus and private policing take on political, anthropological, sociological, and criminological perspectives. Although there were investigations on policing in South Africa during apartheid, scant research has focused on how students in South African higher education (SAHE) relate their experiences of campus policing. Due to recent unrest on SAHE campuses and radical changes that include the militarization of police forces, examining how students perceive the legitimacy and integrity of campus policing is vital. As such, this paper presents a discourse analysis focused on descriptions of students’ campus experiences in the aftermath of the #FeesMustFall (#FMF) protests. Combining critical discourse analysis (CDA) with systemic functional linguistics, through transitivity, it offers insight into the ideological power struggles between students and police. It shows the types of voices students reveal as an aggrieved group in the hope of identifying non-aggressive approaches to address emotionally charged events (such as protests).

The main focus is on the boundary controllability property, which corresponds to the question of whether the solutions can be driven to a given state at a given final time by means of controls acting at one endpoint of the interval. We first show that the system is not spectrally controllable. This means that no finite linear combination of eigenfunctions associated with the state equations, other than zero, can be steered to zero. Although the system is not spectrally controllable, it can be shown that it is approximately controllable, i.e., any state can be steered arbitrarily close to another state.",The authors thank the anonymous referees for their very valuable comments and suggestions.

The chemical composition of the soil is essential to define cleaning strategies of photovoltaic companies. This paper reports the characterization of the chemical and physical properties of the soiling deposited on photovoltaic modules located in the Atacama Desert. The particle size, shape and chemical composition of dust were studied at 4 different locations (denoted as L1 to L4) with samples taken from the ground and the module surface. It was found that, most deposited material exhibits a diameter between 1 µm and 60 µm. The determination of the particle shape factor shows that smaller particles tend to have a circular appearance, while larger particles exhibit a prismatic form. These small particles show a shape factor close to 1 and occur at the 4 locations with the greatest frequency, 40–70%. The mineral species in both the deposited and ground dust, which were identified by means of X-ray diffraction, were albite, anorthite, calcite, cristobalite, gypsum, halite, quartz, muscovite and orthoclase. The compounds occurring with the highest frequency in both the module and ground dust at all locations were quartz and anorthite. Differences between the locations were found. Calcite was found only at L3. Gypsum was not detected at L1 and L3 but was present in L2 and L4. Similarly, cristobalite was found only at L1 and L3, halite was found at L2 and L3, and muscovite was found at L1 and L2.","The authors acknowledge MINEDUC-UA project codes ANT 1755, CONICYT/FONDAP/15110019 “Solar Energy Research Center” SERC-Chile, the Chilean Economic Development Agency (CORFO) with contract No 17PTECES-75830 under the framework of the project “AtaMoS TeC” and the Unidad de Equipamiento Científico “MAINI” of the Universidad Católica del Norte for the support in the preparation of samples, analysis and generation of data through the XRD team, and FIC-Regional Project EQU-25 Conicyt 2009-2010.

In this study, the structure of bacterial communities on the giant kelp Macrocystis pyrifera from two different genetic populations was analyzed in localities with contrasting environmental factors. A northern population subjected to permanent and seasonal upwelling with contrasting nutrient and temperature fluctuations; and a southern population located in the interior sea of Chiloe near salmon farms, characterized by temperature variations between spring and summer and nutrients concentrations modified by salmon excretion of inorganic nitrogen to coastal waters. Bacterial diversity was estimated based on the V1-V3 regions of the 16S rRNA gene. Differences between the epiphytic bacterial communities of macroalgae and the seawater were encountered in terms of α-diversity, with the 27.5% of the genera present in both seawater and the surface of the kelp. The genus Citromicrobium dominated the epiphytic communities associated with M. pyrifera, but was almost absent in seawater. There were seasonal differences (spring-summer) in the structure of epiphytic bacterial communities associated with M. pyrifera, which was more evidenced in northern compared to southern populations, mainly by changes in the relative abundances of some bacteria taxa. The main environmental driver modulating the community structure of epiphytic bacterial communities was temperature, which was evidenced in both macroalgal populations. During the summer season the relative abundances of some genera such as Cyanobacterium and Ralstonia increased in the bacterial communities only in the northern population, and Marinomonas and Pseudomonas in the southern population. We concluded that seasonal variation in temperature explains the epiphytic bacterial community structure; and in northern populations, nutrient availability is negatively correlated with significant changes in bacterial composition.","We thank those who participated in the fieldwork and treatment of samples, J.L.

In this article, I demonstrate how dichotomic representation of the geopolitical entities involved in international research collaboration fails to acknowledge the existence and marginalizes a large and extremely talented academic community of Eurasian scholars, which has the potential to enrich and transform the global knowledge system if it becomes more actively and authoritatively involved in the international system of ideas exchange and knowledge generation. I argue that this invisibilization of post-Soviet research community is part of the logic of postcolonial governmentality, which creates the demand and draws the post-Soviet world into international trade in knowledge-related expert services, whereby profits and benefits from the trade are reaped by the countries, which self-categorize as the North, while undermining the potential of the former Soviet scholarly community to contribute to global knowledge production on equal terms.",,"Funding The author(s) received no financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.",Journal of Studies in International Education,,,,2019-11-18,2019,2019-11-18,2020-02,24,1,113-130,Closed,Article,"Kuzhabekova, Aliya","Kuzhabekova, Aliya (Nazarbayev University, Astana, Kazakhstan; Carleton University, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada)","Kuzhabekova, Aliya (Nazarbayev University; Carleton University)","Kuzhabekova, Aliya (Nazarbayev University; Carleton University)",19,14,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1122683404,39 Education,17 Partnerships for the Goals

In crustaceans, OSR is primarily dependent upon reproductive rhythms. Herein, we model different conditions of reproductive rhythms to investigate the potential link between OSR and the strength of sexual selection, focusing on sexual traits commonly found in crustacean males. OSR can vary widely over a reproductive season as a result of reproductive rhythms, which limits the accuracy of its estimation based on a small sample. Overall, OSR was still predicted to correlate positively with sexual selection strength across different reproductive rhythms, yet only when males were assumed to experience a reproductive time-out. A review of experimental and field studies focusing on the link between OSR and sexual selection strength in crustaceans generally confirms our predictions. For the few studies failing to find the predicted pattern, we discuss potential causes for that discrepancy and urge future experimental research to specifically test for the effect of male time-out on the strength of sexual selection for male mating traits. Our model provides new predictions about the link between OSR and sexual selection and revives the long-lasting debate about OSR as an accurate estimate of sexual selection strength.","We would like to thank Christine Ewers-Saucedo for inviting us to submit a manuscript to this issue of the journal.

225,pub.1110065723,10.1016/j.mineng.2018.11.020,,,Improving milling operation using uncertainty and global sensitivity analyses,"In general, semi-autogenous grinding (SAG) mills are difficult to operate due to several factors, including the uncertainty of the process. The uncertainty can be epistemic or stochastic, the first is related to the geological factors and the second with operating factors. Changes in these factors could generate an increase in the power consumption, which must be avoided because the energy consumption in comminution represents between 56% and 70% of the costs in the mining industry. Usually, the simulation is used to help adjust the operating conditions of the SAG mill, however, in the literature, there are few publications that propose how to consider these uncertainties in milling operations. This work shows that the uncertainty analysis (UA) and the global sensitivity analysis (GSA) can provide useful tools for the identification of operational conditions for mill systems under uncertainties, considering a SAG as case study UA allows the study of the effect of the distribution and the magnitude of the uncertainties of the input variables in the responses of the grinding process. The GSA method of Sobol'-Jansen (Jansen, 1999; Saltelli et al., 2010) is utilized to identify influential input variables. Then, the regionalization of the input variables is applied to identify the operational regions. It is shown that the control of the uncertainty of the significant input variables allows the control of the uncertainty in the output variables. Therefore, the systematic method proposed in this work allows to evaluate the uncertainties in the processes as a valuable tool for any practitioner in the field of mineral processing. The novelty of this method is that allows to quantify results that have been exposed in the literature only from an experimental approach.",The financial support from CONICYT-Chile (Fondecyt 1171341) is gratefully acknowledged.

This is also the case for South Africa, which has a mature mining industry, dating back to the 1860's. Its mineral wealth has largely facilitated the development of the country. However, the legacy of past mining practices has not always been positive and South Africa is faced with addressing the impacts of almost 6000 recorded abandoned mines. A national strategy for the management of abandoned mines in South Africa has been developed and several government-funded programmes are underway which aim to address the myriad legacies of past mining and the resultant pollution problems that persist in many communities around the county. Due largely to its known impact on health, asbestos mines are a priority for rehabilitation and all of the known asbestos mines in the country have been recorded and prioritised for rehabilitation. To date, around 40 of the 249 asbestos mines on record have been rehabilitated by the government at a cost of around ZAR 800 million (US$65 million), in addition to which a number have also been rehabilitated by the previous mine owners. Using the experiences of the asbestos mine rehabilitation programme, the aim of this paper is to present the challenges and strategies employed to rehabilitate abandoned mines in South Africa. Given that legacy mining issues are a well-recorded problem in many mining jurisdictions worldwide, the study of these mines and their attendant problems and solutions may have wider applicability outside South Africa. Three broad challenges are discussed, namely i) legislative challenges, centring around the lack of a legal definition for derelict and ownerless mines; ii) process challenges relating to various administrative processes that make rehabilitation by government not as straight forward as it could be; and iii) technical challenges associated with meeting the aim of rehabilitation on asbestos mines which is to permanently eliminate the dispersion of asbestos fibres and return the disturbed area to an ecologically stable state. This paper concludes that, in the case of South Africa, the presence of a government- led strategy to address the issues associated with abandoned mines has shown the political will to address these sites. In spite of the noted challenges, the continued, diligent efforts of the role-players, even in imperfect operating conditions, has made a significant impact on the overall levels of asbestos pollution from primary point sources in the country.","Acknowledgements Funding was gratefully received from the UNESCO-Sida project on &quot;Mapping and Assessing the Environmental and Health Impacts of Abandoned Mines in Sub-Saharan African Countries&quot;, Project No. 4500268885.",,Journal of Geochemical Exploration,,,,2019-10,2019,,2019-10,205,,106354,Closed,Article,"Cornelissen, H.; Watson, I.; Adam, E.; Malefetse, T.","Cornelissen, H.

For temperate species, warm waters can represent oceanographic barriers limiting the gene flow between adjacent populations. The mtDNA control region was used to infer the phylogeography and historical demography of the Smooth Hammerhead in the eastern Pacific. An AMOVA comparing locations grouped into northern and southern eastern Pacific equatorial areas indicated significant genetic differentiation. Each population had a common haplotype separated by two mutational differences suggesting that divergence occurred very recently. The pattern of genetic differences matches with the anti-tropical distribution of S. zygaena in the eastern Pacific. Gene diversity was lower in the northern population when compared to the southern area, a pattern indicative of a recent founder event. Broadly, this pattern suggests a recent population expansion occurring 25,000–10,000 years. bp, during the last glacial cycle, when the drop of surface sea temperatures created favorable conditions at equatorial latitudes to cross the thermal barrier imposed by warm waters at equatorial latitudes.

225,pub.1111078220,10.1111/jbi.13492,,,Coastal biophysical processes and the biogeography of rocky intertidal species along the south‐eastern Pacific,"Abstract  Aim We assess the spatial distribution of a suite of coastal biophysical characteristics and how their variability is related to the distribution and geographic range of a diverse assemblage of coastal benthic species with different larval dispersal strategies.   Location  South‐eastern Pacific ( SEP ) coast between 18°20′S and 42°35′S.    Methods  Biophysical variability was assessed using chlorophyll‐a concentration, sea surface temperature and the signal of turbid river plumes derived from MODIS onboard the Aqua satellite. We established the dominant spatial components using wavelet and coherence analysis, and evaluated the biogeographic structure of 51 rocky intertidal species sampled over ~2,600 km along the SEP using multivariate classification and regression trees.    Results Biogeographic breaks detected here were consistent with recent biogeographic classification schemes. Distribution breakpoints for species with lecithotrophic larvae clustered around 30°S. We observed a previously unreported break in the distribution of species with planktotrophic larval dispersal strategies around 35°S. These breaks are related to coherence in the spatial structure of sea surface temperature, chlorophyll‐a and river outflow over different temporal scales. Regions with similar biophysical characteristics, and the breaks the separate them, are in striking agreement with the biogeographic patterns revealed by the multivariate classification trees.   Main conclusions  Our results reconcile patterns of biogeographic structure reported for other groups of species along the SEP coast. We suggest that river outflow, a poorly studied coastal environmental forcing, may play an important role in determining the geographic distribution of rocky shore species, probably through its effects on larval dispersal patterns.","C.L., G.S.S. and B.R.B. were partially supported by the Millennium Nucleus Center for the Study of Multiple‐Drivers on Marine Socio‐Ecological Systems‐MUSELS funded by MINECON NC120086.

225,pub.1120499950,10.1007/s11590-019-01458-1,,,A dynamic integer programming approach for free flight air traffic management (ATM) scenario with 4D-trajectories and energy efficiency aspects,"The growth in demand for air transport has generated new challenges for capacity and safety. In response, manufacturers develop new types of aircraft while airlines open new routes and adapt their fleet. This excessive demand for air transport also leads to the need for further investments in airport expansion and ATM modernization. The current work was focused on the ATM problem with respect to new procedures, such as free flight, for addressing the air capacity issues in an environmental approach. The study was triggered by and aligned with the following performance objectives set by EUROCONTROL and the European Commission: (1) to improve ATM safety whilst accommodating air traffic growth; (2) to increase the ATM network efficiency; (3) to strengthen ATM’s contribution to aviation security and to environmental objectives; (4) to match capacity and air transport growth. The proposed mathematical model covers the aforementioned objectives by focusing on energy losses and costs of flights under the scenario of a controlled free flight and a unified airspace. The factors enhanced in the model were chosen based on their impact on the ATM energy efficiency, such as the airborne delays and flight duration, the delays due to ground holding, the flight cancellation, the flight speed deviations and the flight level alterations. Therefore, the presented mathematical model minimizes the energy costs due to the above terms under certain assumptions and constraints. Finally, simulation case studies, used as proof tests, have been conducted under different ATM scenarios to examine the complexity and the efficiency of the developed model.",We thank the Papakyriakopoulos Institution for granting Dr. Charis Ntakolia and supporting her Ph.D. work from June 2015 to June 2017.,,Optimization Letters,,,,2019-08-22,2019,2019-08-22,2020-10,14,7,1659-1680,Closed,Article,"Ntakolia, Charis; Caceres, Hernan; Coletsos, John","Ntakolia, Charis (Department of Computer Science and Biomedical Informatics, University of Thessaly, Lamia, Greece); Caceres, Hernan (Department of Industrial Engineering, Universidad Católica del Norte Chile, Antofagasta, Chile); Coletsos, John (Department of Mathematics, School of Applied Mathematics and Natural Sciences, National Technical University of Athens, Athens, Greece)","Ntakolia, Charis (University of Thessaly)","Ntakolia, Charis (University of Thessaly); Caceres, Hernan (Catholic University of the North); Coletsos, John (National Technical University of Athens)",13,6,,6.39,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1120499950,49 Mathematical Sciences; 4901 Applied Mathematics,7 Affordable and Clean Energy

Within the framework of the descriptive theory of translation, this paper offers a critical consideration of the people and processes at the heart of one such project at the University of the Western Cape, South Africa: the mediators who must either translate lecture material or lend their voices to the aural versions of such materials. The paper shows the processes involved in translating part of a lecture in English into varieties of Afrikaans and isiXhosa, and making these available in both reading and listening format. In addition, the paper examines interview responses of five of the mediators involved in the project, as well as some student responses to the material. Apart from showing the interdependence between the different stages of mediation in this project, we concluded that discipline-specific mediation is best done by subject specialists themselves.

However, little attention has been paid to estimate how urban amenities are capitalized in housing prices under this new scenario. In this paper, we explore this relationship through a hedonic pricing model and 27 urban amenities for the Chilean main urban agglomeration, the Metropolitan Region of Santiago (MR). We recognize that the capitalization of urban amenities into housing prices is spatially heterogeneous, therefore we study this relationship by using the geographically weighted regression (GWR). The main results suggest that urban amenities play an important role in determining housing prices with a significant spatial heterogeneity, where notably differences between public and private local services are found. Particularly, private services such as schools, shopping centers, healthcare centers or restaurants have positive capitalizations on housing prices. In contrast, public schools, public hospitals and public kindergartens have negative valuations in housing prices, suggesting that living closer to these services reduces housing values. Our results provide policy makers with valuable elements when designing urban policies in terms of the importance of heterogeneous valuations of urban amenities across neighborhoods, how to allocate resources more efficiently to foster the quality of life on new urban residents and the need of considering the economic segregation triggered by heterogeneous preferences to amenities across space.",,,Cities,,,,2019-06,2019,,2019-06,89,,92-104,Closed,Article,"Cortés, Yasna; Iturra, Victor","Cortés, Yasna (Department of Economics, Universidad Católica del Norte, Antofagasta 0610, Chile); Iturra, Victor (Department of Economics, Universidad Católica del Norte, Antofagasta 0610, Chile)","Cortés, Yasna (Catholic University of the North)","Cortés, Yasna (Catholic University of the North); Iturra, Victor (Catholic University of the North)",21,5,,6.98,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1111659289,33 Built Environment and Design; 3304 Urban and Regional Planning; 44 Human Society; 4406 Human Geography; 4407 Policy and Administration,11 Sustainable Cities and Communities

The genesis of the El Laco Kiruna-type iron deposit—i.e., whether it is magmatic or hydrothermal in origin—is a long-standing controversy. The interstitial Fe-P phase lined by early formed magnetite crystals observed in massive ores at El Laco is morphologically and geochemically consistent with that produced by recent immiscible experiments, confirming that the massive magnetite ores were products of complete solidification of an iron-rich mush comprising early crystallized magnetite and an interstitial immiscible Fe-P melt. The hydrothermal features in geochemistry of massive magnetite are similar to the features of magnetite in altered andesites, implying a superimposed hydrothermal process. The occurrence of melt inclusions with high homogenization temperatures (>700°C) hosted by the apatite in Cristales Grandes ores indicates that the veined ores formed shortly after the massive ores genetically related to the magmatic system. Some vesicles in the massive ores and the magnetite scoriae, previously interpreted as compelling evidence of volcanic structures, are demonstrated to be the residual pore spaces formed after interstitial phases between magnetite grains were removed by postmagmatic hydrothermal fluids and the accumulated debris eroded from massive ores with minor altered andesites, respectively. Thus, we propose a two-step genetic model in which massive ores resulted from magmatic processes and then were modified by subsequent magmatic-hydrothermal alteration. This model could be applied to the metallogenesis of most Kiruna-type iron deposits.","We thank Prof. Larry Meinert (editor), Prof. Adam Simon (associate editor), and two anonymous referees for their constructive comments and suggestions, which helped to improve this paper.

However, the factors associated with depression have been little explored in this particular context. The aim of the present study was to assess the degree to which difficulties in emotional regulation are associated with depressive symptomatology in divorced and separated individuals. A sample of 1189 Chilean individuals, separated or divorced, completed self-reported measures of difficulties in emotional regulation and depression. The results obtained allow us to conclude that difficulties in emotional regulation, over other individual factors, such as early risk situations or circumstances of separation, are associated with higher rates of depression in men and women, explaining 41% of the variance of the depressive symptomatology. Emotional regulation difficulties are associated with greater depressive symptomatology in divorced/separated individuals.

Therefore, the present article aims to develop a holistic theoretical framework, studying the human, financial, technological and social resources of an RBSO and highlighting whether the EO influences an RBSO during its generation and development phases. A case study from the information and communication technology sector was selected, and data were collected through a structured questionnaire complemented with in-depth and on-site interviews. The holistic framework adopted allowed to highlight the peculiarities of the RBSO: the marked vocation for scientific research, the EO of the founding team and the important role of the parent organization, mostly in supplying intangible assets.

In addition, modeling of the solid particle sedimentation process based on Kynch’s theory has been successfully used and validated in mineral processing and wastewater treatment. In this work, we present a model that merges the coalescence process with hindered polydisperse sedimentation. The PBE model is projected onto a partial differential equation (PDE) system by discretizing the droplet volume. Because there is loss of mass in the system when the daughter droplets are greater than the larger species considered for the numerical solution, two terms that produce the conservation of the mass or total volume of the dispersed phase are incorporated into the PDE system. The resulting PDE system is split into two systems: homogeneous PDEs and ordinary differential equations (ODEs). The homogeneous PDEs and the ODEs are discretized using a first-order central differencing scheme and the second-order, two-stage Runge-Kutta method, respectively. The model predicts the vertical variation of the composition of the dispersed phase layer that forms at the top or bottom of the gravity settler. The proposed model was calibrated and validated through an experiment with an oil and water system. In particular, simulations illustrate the effects of: the continuity of the dispersion (oil-in-water and water-in-oil) and the standard deviation of the initial droplet volumes on phase separation quality, as well as the influence of the coalescence frequency on the average droplet volume.",Declaration of Competing Interest The authors declared that there is no conflict of interest.

Nowadays the use of internet-enabled databases, obtained by either primary data online surveys or secondary official and non-official registers, is common. However, information disposal varies depending on data category and country and specifically, the collection of microdata at low geographical level for urban analysis can be a challenge. The most common difficulties when working with secondary web-enabled data can be grouped into two categories: accessibility and availability problems. Accessibility problems are present when the data publication in the servers blocks or delays the download process, which becomes a tedious reiterative task that can produce errors in the construction of big databases. Availability problems usually arise when official agencies restrict access to the information for statistical confidentiality reasons. In order to overcome some of these problems, this paper presents different strategies based on URL parsing, PDF text extraction, and web scraping.

Automated mineralogical analysis describes a suite of porphyritic mafic samples, comprising olivine- and pyroxene-bearing rocks. Well-defined major element compositional trends, as well as trace and rare earth element characteristics (e.g. Sr/Y < 47; Sm/Yb < 4), likely reflect magmatic differentiation at middle-upper crustal levels. Additionally, magma mixing and assimilation and fractional crystallization processes act on these La Poruña magmas within the thickened continental crust, which is typical in Andean volcanic systems. A remarkable compositional feature is the unusual reversed isotopic behaviour of increasing silica with decreasing 87Sr/86Sr compositions. In a process of crustal assimilation during turbulent magma ascent (ATA), the least differentiated rocks are the most contaminated ones since the turbulent hottest magmas effectively assimilate the crustal material. We relate the inverse Sr isotope trend to latter magmatic evolution involving ATA at shallow crustal levels prior to eruption, therefore differing from the broadly accepted Central Andean magmatic model. The older volcanics (>96 ka) from San Pedro volcano exhibit similar isotopic characteristics, therefore evidence of similar magmatic processes. This new dataset clearly defines magma compositional changes during the La Poruña eruption (ca. 100 ka), revealing an increase in crustal contamination at shallow crustal levels for the younger San Pedro lavas (<96 ka), likely controlled by increasing amounts of deep-sourced basaltic input over time.","Authors thank María Monserrat Barraza, Carolina Ossandón and Camila Riera-Soto for their assistance during sample preparation and execution of automated mineralogical analyses at MAINI-UCN.

Proposed in 1990 by Nielsen and Molich, it consists in having a small group of evaluators performing a systematic revision of a system under a set of guiding principles known as usability heuristics. Although Nielsen’s 10 usability heuristics are used as the de facto standard in the process of heuristic evaluation, recent research has provided evidence not only for the need of custom domain specific heuristics, but also for the development of methodological processes to create such sets of heuristics. In this work we apply the PROMETHEUS methodology, recently proposed by the authors, to develop the VLEs heuristics: a novel set of usability heuristics for the domain of virtual learning environments. In addition to the development of these heuristics, our research serves as further empirical validation of PROMETHEUS. To validate our results we performed an heuristic evaluation using both VLEs and Nielsen’s heuristics. Our design explicitly controls the effect of evaluator variability by using a large number of evaluators. Indeed, for both sets of heuristics the evaluation was performed independently by 7 groups of 5 evaluators each. That is, there were 70 evaluators in total, 35 using VLEs and 35 using Nielsen’s heuristics. In addition, we perform rigorous statistical analyses to establish the validity of the novel VLEs heuristics. The results show that VLEs perform better than Nielsen’s heuristics, finding more problems, which are also more relevant to the domain, as well as satisfying other quantitative and qualitative criteria. Finally, in contrast to evaluators using Nielsen’s heuristics, evaluators using VLEs heuristics reported greater satisfaction regarding utility, clarity, ease of use, and need of additional elements.","We thank the anonymous reviewers for their comments, which have helped to greatly improve the quality of this paper.

Herein, we examined whether two limpet species, Scurria viridula (Lamarck, 1819) and Fissurella latimarginata (Sowerby, 1835), show species- and size-specific similarities or differences in their reaction to predatory seastars and crabs. Both S. viridula and F. latimarginata reacted to their main seastar predators with escape responses. In contrast, both limpets did not flee from common crab predators, but, instead, fastened to the rock. All tested size classes of both limpet species reacted in a similar way, escaping from seastars, but clamping onto the rock in response to crabs. Limpets could reach velocities sufficient to outrun their specific seastar predators, but they were not fast enough to escape crabs. Experiments with limpets of different shell conditions (with and without shell damage) indicated that F. latimarginata with a damaged shell showed “accommodation movements” (slow movements away from stimulus) in response to predatory crabs. In contrast, intact F. latimarginata and all S. viridula (intact and damaged) clamped the shell down to the substratum. The response details suggest that the keyhole limpet F. latimarginata is more sensitive to predators (faster reaction time, longer escape distances, and higher proportion of reacting individuals) than S. viridula, possibly because the morphology of F. latimarginata (the relationship of its shell size and structure to its total body size) makes this species more vulnerable to predation. Our study suggests that chemically mediated effects of seastar and crab predators result in contrasting behavioral responses of both limpet species, independent of their habitat and morphology. Despite the different characteristics of the limpet species and the identity of predators, the limpets react in comparable ways to similar predator types.","We are most grateful to S. Boltaña and I.

To examine spatial differences in the reef fish assemblage structure around Easter Island, eight sites were sampled during autumn and summer 2016–2017 with baited remote underwater video systems.    To determine seasonal changes, quarterly (seasonal) sampling was conducted at five of those eight sites. Fifteen pelagic species of fishes were recorded during this study, some of which have not previously been recorded in scuba surveys, including the Galapagos shark (  Carcharhinus galapagensis  , Snodgrass & Heller, 1905) and tunas (Scrombidae).    Significant spatial and seasonal differences were found in the fish assemblage. Fish assemblages from the south coast differed significantly from those along the west and east coasts, mainly due to the occurrence of top predators. Winter differed from other seasons, especially along the south coast where the island is more exposed to large oceanic swells and winds from Antarctica.   Owing to the variety and high relative abundance of species recorded during this survey, baited remote underwater video systems seemed to be an effective method for studying top predators at Easter Island. The identification of priority zones for the protection of top predator species represents an important contribution of this study, in order to develop management and conservation strategies to be implemented in the newly created Rapa Nui multiple uses coastal marine protected areas.","We dedicate this paper to Michel Garcia (in memoriam), who dedicated his life to the protection of the ocean and encouraged the curiosity of an entire generation for Easter Island biodiversity.

213,pub.1114042457,10.1111/jbi.13588,,,Zoogeographic patterns of pelagic oceanic cephalopods along the eastern Pacific Ocean,"Abstract  Aim To analyse the diversity and distribution of oceanic pelagic cephalopods along the eastern Pacific Ocean assessing the existence of biogeographic structuring, and the role of physical variables in generating geographical patterns. We hypothesized that the control by environmental factors, and the effect of geometric constraints, determine the range size and limits of distribution of oceanic cephalopods along the eastern Pacific Ocean, generating a latitudinal gradient in species richness.   Location Eastern Pacific Ocean (60°N – 60°S), from the Gulf of Alaska to the Southern Ocean.   Methods Based on a literature review and >5,000 records obtained from collections, we constructed a presence–absence matrix including 61 latitudinal bands (2° each) along the Eastern Pacific, and estimated species richness and range endpoints at each band. Biogeographic units were determined by means of multivariate analyses. Species richness was compared with null model predictions in order to test for the existence of geometric constraints using the Mid‐Domain Null model. The effects on species richness of environmental variables (temperature, salinity and oxygen) were evaluated separately for surface and depth (0–1,000 m) data, by means of ordinary least squares regression and simultaneous autoregressive models. Rapoport's pattern was assessed by applying the Stevens’ method and the range midpoint method.   Results  Species richness was high across the tropics and decreased towards the both poles. We identified five biogeographic units, highlighting two major distribution breaks at 40°N and 42°S. Species richness was strongly related with environmental variables, although the combined variables accounted for a large fraction of the variance between 0 and 1,000 m ( R 2  = 0.99), while temperature was the best single predictor at the surface ( R 2  = 0.98). Species richness curves showed a mid‐domain effect (MDE), and the mean latitudinal range was higher in the tropics and at warm latitudes, generating an inverse Rapoport's pattern.    Main conclusions Along the eastern Pacific Ocean oceanic cephalopods exhibit both a clear biogeographic patterning and an interhemispheric (poleward decreasing) diversity gradient, which appear strongly related with physical factors and external forcing, as well as with a MDE as a seemingly consequence of the naturally bounded domain of the Eastern Pacific.","ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS We thank Cristobal Galbán‐Malagón and Moisés Valladares, for their comments on our biogeographic analyses.

Both literature on the subjects and the results that emerged from numerous specific investigations into the dropouts of the university system, showed the crucial importance of this junction between the first and the second year. Reasons for dropping out can be quite varied, ranging from incorrect and/or insufficient prospective student orientation, the willingness or need to find a job as quickly as possible, to a lack of awareness of not being able to cope with a particular course of study rather than another. In this paper we focus specifically on the problem of dropouts in Italy, addressing it from a dual point of view. At an aggregate level, the analysis deals with dropout rates in Italy between the first and second year, in order to identify the main trends and dynamics at the national level. Subsequently, we analyze individual-level data from the University of Bari Aldo Moro, aiming to identify the most important contributing factors. This individual-level approach has emerged over recent years, and is generally known as ‘Educational Data Mining’, focused on the development of ad hoc methods that can be used to discover regularities and new information within databases from contexts related to education. Using supervised classification methods, we are able to identify retrospectively the profile of students who are most likely to dropout.","We would like to thank the Rector of the University of Bari for authorizing the consultation, in an anonymous form and for scientific research purposes, of the data relating to the UniBA student population of the MIUR-Cineca Student-Didactic Observatory.",,Social Indicators Research,,,,2019-12-19,2019,2019-12-19,2021-08,156,2-3,341-362,Closed,Article,"Perchinunno, Paola; Bilancia, Massimo; Vitale, Domenico","Perchinunno, Paola (Department of Business and Law Studies (DEMDI), University of Bari Aldo Moro, Largo Abbazia di Santa Scolastica n.53, 70124, Bari, Italy); Bilancia, Massimo (Ionian Department of Law, Economics and Environment, University of Bari Aldo Moro, Via Lago Maggiore angolo Via Ancona, 74121, Taranto, Italy); Vitale, Domenico (Department for Innovation in Biological, Agro-food and Forest Systems, University of Tuscia, Via San Camillo de Lellis, 01100, Viterbo, Italy)","Bilancia, Massimo (University of Bari Aldo Moro)","Perchinunno, Paola (University of Bari Aldo Moro); Bilancia, Massimo (University of Bari Aldo Moro); Vitale, Domenico (Tuscia University)",24,17,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1123564410,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 38 Economics; 44 Human Society",4 Quality Education

Design/methodology/approach The authors use the panel regression techniques to examine the influence of business regulation and rule of law on formal entrepreneurship. In particular, they implement together two alternative views of formal entrepreneurship suggested in the literature: the “dual” and “legalistic” view. At the empirical level, the “dual” definition corresponds to the business owners’ rate. As for the “legal” definition, it corresponds to the business registration rate. The evidence presented is based on two panels. The first panel covers the period 2004–2015, and the data set contains 180 observations in 18 countries. The second panel covers the period 2006–2015, and the data set contains 134 observations in 14 countries.   Findings The impact of institutional variables on formal entrepreneurship depends on the definition employed: “dual” or “legal.” Thus, the results suggest that business owners’ rate is more substantial in Latin American countries that have weak property rights. Conversely, from a legal definition, the business registration rate is more significant in Latin American countries that have most secure property rights and fewer labor regulations. These contradictory results suggest that the legal definition of formal entrepreneurship, but not the dual definition, seems to be associated with the type of entrepreneurial activity that promotes economic growth and development.   Research limitations/implications The results support the importance of conducting analyzes that take into account the different types of entrepreneurial activities that are present in an economy, and in addition the relevance of understanding what each measure is capturing of the heterogeneous phenomenon of entrepreneurship.   Practical implications The results suggest that the entrepreneurship policy should focus on the quality of entrepreneurship, rather than merely seeking to increase the number of new businesses. Additionally, the results suggest that the legalistic definition of formal entrepreneurship is probably the most relevant for many policy issues.   Originality/value The paper analyzes together two alternative views of formal entrepreneurship suggested in the literature: the “dual” and “legalistic” views. Also, the paper has used the Latinobarómetro data set, which has not been extensively used by scholars in the field of entrepreneurship and which could be useful for longitudinal research on entrepreneurial activity in Latin American countries.",,,Journal of Entrepreneurship and Public Policy,,,,2019-07-08,2019,,2019-07-08,8,2,254-271,Closed,Article,"Salinas, Aldo; Ortiz, Cristian; Muffatto, Moreno","Salinas, Aldo (ESAI Business School, Universidad de Especialidades Espiritu Santo, Guayas, Ecuador); Ortiz, Cristian (Department of Economics, Universidad Católica del Norte, Antofagasta, Chile; Department of Economics, Universidad Nacional de Loja, Loja, Ecuador); Muffatto, Moreno (Department of Industrial Engineering, University of Padua, Padova, Italy)","Ortiz, Cristian (Catholic University of the North; Universidad Nacional de Loja)","Salinas, Aldo (Universidad de Especialidades Espíritu Santo); Ortiz, Cristian (Catholic University of the North; Universidad Nacional de Loja); Muffatto, Moreno (University of Padua)",15,5,,5.57,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1120772499,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3507 Strategy, Management and Organisational Behaviour",

Physical interaction between mafic and acid magmas for this arc are therefore difficult to recognize due to the differentiation of mantle-derived magma during ascent through the thickened crust and a corresponding lack of erupted primitive lavas. However, a rare concentration of less evolved rocks is located marginal to the partially molten Altiplano-Puna Magma Body (APMB) in the Altiplano-Puna Volcanic Complex of northern Chile, between 21°10′S and 22°50′S. To unravel the relationship between this less evolved magmatism and the APMB, we present major and trace element data, and Sr and Nd isotope ratios of fourteen volcanoes. Whole-rock compositional and Sr and Nd isotope data reveal a large degree for compositional heterogeneity, e.g., SiO2 = 53.2 to 63.2 wt%, MgO = 1.74 to 6.08 wt%, Cr = 2 to 382 ppm, Sr = 304 to 885 ppm, 87Sr/86Sr = 0.7055 to 0.7088, and 143Nd/144Nd = 0.5122 to 0.5125. The combined dataset points to magma spatial compositional changes resulting from magma mixing, fractional crystallization and crustal assimilation. The least evolved products erupted along the periphery of the APMB and are likely equivalent to the replenishing magmas that thermally sustain the large APMB system. We suggest that the mafic to intermediate eruptives we have investigated reflect mafic melt injections that underplate the APMB and escape along the side of the large felsic body to avoid significant compositional modifications during ascent, which helps to assess the evolution of the APMB through space and time.","We thank Kerryn Gray and Fayrooza Rawoot for their assistance during sample preparation and execution of XRF,ICP-MS and MC-ICP-MS procedures at UCT.

Here, we assess the variability of torrential rainfall during the Late Holocene and its projection into the 21st century at the southern edge of the hyperarid Atacama Desert. The analysis of historical data since the beginning of the 20th century reveals that most (76.5%) alluvial disasters in the southern Atacama Desert (26–30°S) have resulted from extreme rainfall events occurring between March and September under El Niño conditions, and more frequently during the warm phase of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation. Particular rainfall events under these ocean-climate conditions are associated with the convective phase of the Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO) near the central-equatorial Pacific, resulting in warmer sea surface temperature (SST) there and in the triggering of persistent/intense Pacific South America (PSA) tropical-extratropical teleconnection patterns which result in blocking of the westerly flow at high latitudes and the subsequent deviation of storm tracks towards central-northern Chile. On a longer timescale, marine sediments from Tongoy Bay (30°S) reveal an increasing trend of stronger runoff by torrential coastal rain since ca. 3500 cal yr BP and even stronger heavy rainfall since ca. 1700 cal yr BP. Highly variable coastal sea surface temperatures in the same time span deduced from the sedimentary record can be explained by intensified southerly winds in connection with stronger alongshore pressure gradients and reduced coastal low-cloud cover. Both storm intensification and increased intensity of upwelling-favorable winds point to a variable climate conditioned by strengthened interannual ENSO and interdecadal ENSO-like variability during the Late Holocene. Climate projections from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) indicate a reduction in annual precipitation of 15–30% during the current century, together with an intensification of the storms, such as the alluvial disaster on March 25, 2015 in Atacama.","This work was funded by FONDECYT #11060484 (GV), CONICYT doctoral grant and FONDECYT #3150706 (CO), FONDECYT #1171773 (MR), NC120066 and FONDAP-CONICYT 15110009 (MR), FONDAP-CONICYT 15010007 and COPAS Sur-Austral CONICYT PIA APOYO CCTE AFB170006 (SP and CBL).

Evaluating Individual Heterogeneity in the Preferences for Amenities,"It is widely recognized by scholars that amenities affect the individual well-being. Ample empirical evidence has been provided for developed countries, although this analysis for developing economies is scant. The aim of this paper is to study the association between locational specific characteristics and self-reported measures of subjective well-being. We focus our analysis in Chile, a developing country located in South America endowed with a rather heterogeneous set of amenities across cities. Using data from several sources to account for both natural and urban city amenities along with individual traits, our first results suggest that natural and urban amenities do affect the level of subjective well-being across Chilean cities. Afterwards, we allow for the estimated parameters associated to amenities vary to characterize the whole distribution rather than a single average parameter. This analysis uncovers the existence of unobserved individual heterogeneity, that is, individuals display different tastes for amenities not captured by observed traits, and consequently compensating variations associated to amenities differ across the sample. These results provide valuable elements to policy makers and city planners to the design of policies that enhance the population well-being and to the understanding of the development of cities in developing economies.",The authors acknowledge and appreciate the wise comments of two anonymous referees and the financial support of CONICYT/Chilean Fondecyt 11170018 “City differences in the return to schooling”.,,Journal of Happiness Studies,,,,2019-01-22,2019,2019-01-22,2020-01,21,1,53-74,Closed,Article,"Ahumada, Gustavo; Iturra, Victor; Sarrias, Mauricio","Ahumada, Gustavo (IDEAR, Department of Economics, Universidad Católica del Norte, Avenida Angamos, 0610, Antofagasta, Chile); Iturra, Victor (IDEAR, Department of Economics, Universidad Católica del Norte, Avenida Angamos, 0610, Antofagasta, Chile); Sarrias, Mauricio (IDEAR, Department of Economics, Universidad Católica del Norte, Avenida Angamos, 0610, Antofagasta, Chile)","Ahumada, Gustavo (Catholic University of the North)","Ahumada, Gustavo (Catholic University of the North); Iturra, Victor (Catholic University of the North); Sarrias, Mauricio (Catholic University of the North)",11,4,,2.41,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1111600287,52 Psychology; 5201 Applied and Developmental Psychology; 5203 Clinical and Health Psychology; 5205 Social and Personality Psychology,

Presently, encouragement and support for collaborative research and training is a cornerstone of many innovation policies and programs. Concurrently, the study of complex systems has produced tools and techniques that can be applied to the study of innovation systems. They have been shown to be complex systems with scale-invariant properties that can be measured and modeled providing novel insights to decision makers. An important factor contributing to the emergence of scale-invariant properties is the inseparable tension between competitive and cooperative activities among actors within a complex system. Peer-reviewed papers index in the 1990–2010 Web of Science and citations to these papers are used as a partial measure of size and impact, respectively. Documents are classified into 14 natural, health and applied sciences fields. Numbers of authors and country information from each paper are used to classify documents into various types of cooperation. Scale-invariant correlations between impact and sizes where prepared to provide measures and models used to explore the effects of cooperation types. It is shown that collaborative research tends to have greater impact and for a longer period of time that non-collaborative research. Cooperation in the more applied fields show higher growth of impact when compared to the growth of their sizes than cooperation in fields closer to the basic or ‘blue sky’ end of the R&D spectrum. Cooperation in a complex innovation system can have significant effects on the relative growth of impact with respect to growth of size and it enhances the sustainability of the Matthew Effect over time. Cooperative activities appear to sustain self-organization in a complex innovation system.",,,Scientometrics,,,,2019-08-30,2019,2019-08-30,2019-11,121,2,1045-1065,Closed,Article,"Katz, J.

For this purpose, we analyse the Bibliographic Coupling network of journals in four periods to identify groups of strongly interlinked journals that could represent research communities within the field of economic geography; and we also study the betweenness measure of centrality to identify those journals that have played the role of bridges between disciplines and estimate the level of interdisciplinarity of these journals.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the total substitution of traditional natural coarse aggregates with alternative, renewable resources, such as mollusk shell waste from the aquaculture industry, to manufacture a recycled porous concrete and its possible use in sound-absorbing barriers for road traffic. Two different shells, separately or as a mix, were used in this research work: Peruvian scallop and Mediterranean mussel. In addition, two different particle size distributions, smaller than 2 mm and between 2 and 7 mm, were used. Acoustic absorption, open porosity, density, mechanical resistance to compression and bending, and resistance to freeze-thaw cycles, along with leaching properties, were studied. The results revealed that specimens formed using any kind of mollusk shell waste with a particle size between 2 and 7 mm exhibited a 40% increase weighted acoustic absorption coefficient over porous concrete specimens made with river gravel. For particles of the same size, the acoustic absorption assessment index showed absorption over 4 dB in 12-cm thickness. In addition, the mechanical properties analyzed showed better values in all specimens made with shell waste than in conventional porous concrete specimens. In the specimens manufactured of mollusk shell waste with a particle size between 2 and 7 mm, compression strength was twice that of conventional porous concrete.",,,Journal of Materials in Civil Engineering,,,,2019-03-28,2019,2019-03-28,2019-06,31,6,04019077,Closed,Article,"Peceño, Begoña; Arenas, Celia; Alonso-Fariñas, Bernabé; Leiva, Carlos","Peceño, Begoña (Assistant Professor, Escuela de Prevención de Riesgos y Medioambiente, Facultad de Ciencias del Mar, Universidad Católica del Norte, 1281 Larrondo, Coquimbo, Chile, (corresponding author).

The study takes advantage of the presence of the Cerro Brillador Mine (CBM), currently part of the Universidad de La Serena mining research center. Six factors—slope, solar exposure, drainage density, lineament density, geology and vegetation were characterized in a 12 km × 12 km area around the mine to identify the zones of greatest and least potential for groundwater recharge. The analysis indicates that approximately 66% of the total area presents favorable conditions for recharge. At a more local scale, the work focused on the CBM itself, an experimental facility where structural measurements in the interior and exterior of the mine, monitoring of the water level in the shaft, and sampling of mine water for chemical and isotopic composition were carried out. The chemical analysis highlighted the lack of acid drainage, despite the existence of pyrite (FeS2) and copper-sulfate mineralization in the mine. The isotopic analysis showed that the groundwater has a similar signature to local precipitation. From this information, a simple conceptual model for the hydrogeology is proposed, in which precipitation rapidly recharges the mine along faults and joints with a preferential N-S strike, but is impounded by the Urrutia fault, which facilitates the storage of groundwater in the underground workings by acting as a flow barrier. A simple analysis suggests a recharge rate on the order of 5% of the average annual precipitation for the CBM area.","This work was developed within the framework of the Conicyt/Programa Fondecyt Project 1150587 and the Water Resources and Environment Program (PRHIMA, for its acronym in Spanish) of the Department of Mining Engineering of the Universidad de La Serena, and Conicyt/Fondap/15130015 Center CRHIAM.

In January 2014 and March 2016, a remotely operated vehicle was used to explore a subsurface peak off Easter Island (27.23°S, 109.48°W) and a seamount (26.92°S, 110.26°W), respectively located 10 km southwest and 98 km west of the island. More than 950 echinoderms were observed in the 5 h of video recorded during the seven dives conducted at depths between ~ 160 and 280 m. The communities of echinoderms observed at these depths markedly differed from those reported for shallower waters near Easter Island. Of the 20 morphospecies reported in the present study, only 5 were previously reported in the EIE. One species, six genera, and three families were reported for the first time in this area, and two new genera were discovered and described. A preliminary biogeographic analysis suggests affinities between the observed echinoderms and those of the West Pacific. These findings highlight the uniqueness of these assemblages and, therefore, the importance of considering them in the establishment of effective management strategies for these communities, which are within the Rapa Nui marine-protected area created in 2017.","We would like to thank the Chilean Navy, pilot and crew of the LSG Tokerau.

The drying-out of the San Pedro de Inacaliri river basin is a paradigmatic case of this situation. Indigenous communities that used to graze their livestock in the area have seen the utter degradation of the ecosystems which have sustained their activities since time immemorial. In this article, we aim to contribute to the growing literature on the effects of extractive industries in northern Chile, based on an archaeological analysis of the remnants of the material culture in the basin. This analysis will complement historical and qualitative data to present a diachronic approach to the history of human use, occupation and abandonment of the basin and its transformations in time and space. The work analyses human occupation of the basin over thousands of years down to the present, concluding that while there was increasing use of the territory since pre-Hispanic times, the intense human occupation has practically disappeared since industrial extraction began in the 1950s, and indigenous families have been forced to emigrate. Results show one of the most radical cases of water resource dispossession in the recent history of Chile.","We would like to thank Gino Sandoval who helped us with the maps.

We combined field data and W-E 2D seismic profiles along parts of the basin where stratigraphic units are well constrained. The seismic data show the occurrence of thick-skinned triangle zones under the basin with along-strike variation. These are composed of west and east-verging, basement-involved faults and thrust ramps, or partially inverted normal faults. The plan-view structural configuration of the basin usually coincides with the sub-surface position of the triangle zones. The interplay between purely reverse and inverted faults in the region indicates that the thick-skinned triangle zones could be kinematically related to the superposition of two contractional episodes, consisting of: i) partial tectonic inversion of half-graben structures; and ii) basement deformation dominated by reverse faults and thrust and anticline ramps. The post-extensional tectono-sequences interpreted on the seismic profiles generally correlate with the Upper Cretaceous to Paleocene synorogenic successions exposed on surface, which allow us propose an age of deformation correlated with the “Peruvian” and “K-T” Andean Orogeny. The triangle zone could still be an active structure.","The authors would like to thank Enap-Sipetrol for providing the seismic data used in this work.

The result of these eruptions is an extensive ignimbritic plateau which covers an area >50,000 km2. Major eruptions (i.e. flare-up events) of these magmas occurred with a cyclic periodicity, on which each cycle last 2–3 Ma, and steady-state and/or waning periods occurred between each cycle. After the last flare-up cycle of evolution of the Altiplano-Puna Volcanic Complex (ended at ca.1 Ma), low to intermediate silica (<59 wt % SiO2; commonly referred as “mafic”) extrusive products have erupted in a scattered way throughout the magmatic province. This mafic volcanism is exposed mainly as monogenetic centers (scoria cones or maar-like structures), isolated flows, or as part of more differentiated stratovolcano complexes (e.g., San Pedro, Sairecabur, Licancabur, and Lascar). The origin of these mafic products has been related to partial melting of the mantle wedge and an evolution affected by the presence of different MASH-type zones at lower (>40 km depth) and upper (<40 km depth) crustal levels, with limited low-pressure fractional crystallization. Nevertheless, dacitic magma chambers (4–8 km depth) may have benefited from mafic magma inputs to be remobilized and erupted as silicic domes <0.2 Ma (e.g. Chao Dacite). In fact, widespread enclaves hosted in these young domes represent a snapshot of the pre-eruptive magma mingling-mixing processes at the dacite-mafic interface. We are going to deal with the mafic magmas erupted after the last major flare-up ignimbritic phase - i.e. during the last 1 Ma - when the Altiplano-Puna Volcanic Complex entered in a steady-state stage. Such mafic products, mainly erupted near the border or outside of the well detected Altiplano-Puna Magma Body located in the upper crust, can help to unravel the evolution of the present-day Arc Magmatic Stage of this large volcanic silicic province.","We thank CONICYT-FONDAP project 15090013 “Centro de Excelencia en Geotermia de los Andes (CEGA)”, and FONDECYT Postdoctoral Project 3160432 (B.G.) for funding.

Italy's success may be attributed to condom vending machines (CVMs), which contribute to minimizing embarrassment in contraceptive purchases. This study examined consumer perceptions toward CVMs and their impact on condom purchasing attitudes and behaviors among Italian women. Semi‐structured interviews were conducted among participants living in Florence, Italy, a popular region for these machines. Grounded theory and a constant comparative method were used for qualitative theme development. Data suggest participants feel positively toward machines, considering them a convenient purchase outlet. Participants noted barriers and facilitators to machine use, offering improvement opportunities for consumer behavior researchers, marketers, and machine retailers (i.e., alternate CVM placement, diversified product offerings, product quality guarantees), potentially contributing to their efficacy as viable condom purchasing alternatives. Findings expand consumer behavior and embarrassment literature and offer insight for future CVM implementation.",,,Journal of Consumer Affairs,,,,2019-07-11,2019,2019-07-11,2020-03,54,1,286-310,Closed,Article,"DeMaria, Andrea L.; Ramos‐Ortiz, Jaziel; Faria, Amy A.; Wise, Gabrielle M.","DeMaria, Andrea L.

211,pub.1116872978,10.1016/j.erss.2019.05.018,,,Destabilization of Energy Regimes and Liminal Transition through Collective Action in Chile,"The transition of energy policy towards fairer and more sustainable paths has centered on the dynamics of destabilization processes in energy regimes. Much has been written about the complex nature of transitions in the sector in 30-40 year cycles, but less work has been done on disruptive destabilizations over shorter periods, especially focussing on how they are produced and intensified. Through a qualitative examination of two failed large electricity projects in Chile, we investigate how collective action can influence the destabilization of an electricity regime through interaction between the day-to-day dramaturgical actions of the so-called communitas and media actors. Both projects, a hydro-dam plant and a coal-fired power plant (CFPP), offer unprecedented examples of how two transnational energy consortium projects were halted, mainly by effective collective actions that occurred within Chile’s neoliberal landscape to combat these energy initiatives. We propose an interpretation of the dynamics of regime destabilization from a dramaturgical-materialistic perspective that allows a new conception of how energy transitions occur. Through this perspective, we shed light on new entanglements, actors and new questions that arise regarding how transitions become real. We propose the mechanisms of i) pressure, ii) obstruction and iii) public overflow to trace the activities that bring a liminal energy transition into view.","I greatly appreciate the members of MODEMA and CDP, the regional and local public officials for the delivery of their time in the field work of this research in Choros, Punta Choros, La Serena, Coquimbo, Coyhaique, Cochrane, Caleta Tortel and Villa O&#x27;higgins.

Here, plants such as Deschampsia antarctica could generate more suitable micro-environmental conditions for the establishment of other plants (facilitation). We examined the co-occurrence of vascular plant species in the Antarctic Peninsula and assessed the potential nurse effect by D. antarctica on the native Colobanthus quitensis and the invasive Poa annua. We also measured the ecophysiological performance and survival of C. quitensis within and outside the canopy of D. antarctica in two study sites differing in stress levels. In addition, a survival experiment was conducted with the invasive Poa annua individuals within and outside D. antarctica individuals. In sites where present, target species co-occurred with D. antarctica in both Shetland Islands and Antarctic Peninsula. In agreement with the stress gradient hypothesis, we found evidence of facilitation between vascular Antarctic plant species. Specifically, we found that D. antarctica facilitates the native C. quitensis and the invasive P. annua and that the effect is stronger in more stressful sites. Additionally, C. quitensis distribution is compatible with an influence of either direct or indirect facilitation from D. antarctica. Facilitation between vascular plants may play a role structuring Antarctic plant communities. Thus, distribution of native species should be considered when assessing the introduction and spread of invasive species. Also, our results together with those from previous studies showed that the type and magnitude of biotic interactions may change with time and can depend on the plant traits considered.","We thank INACH, the Chilean Navy and the Arctowski Polish Antarctic Station for their logistical support and measurements of field data.

With a landing of 302,642 tons in year 2016, Chile is the second mytilid producer after China, and the first exporter worldwide. To be better prepared to protect this industry, the health status of a total number of 478 mussels (M. chilensis) from the Los Lagos Region, in the south of Chile, was assessed. Baseline information on symbionts, parasites and pathological conditions of both cultivated and natural mussels was collected using histology. Organisms detected included: intracellular microcolonies of bacteria (IMC), located in the epithelium of the gill and of digestive gland tubules; a microsporidian resembling Steinhausia mytilovum hosted by oocytes; two gill ciliates; a copepod; and a digenean trematode. Pathological conditions included neoplasia, hemocyte aggregates within digestive epithelia, lipofuscin-like pigments in various tissues, and gill epithelium desquamation. The prevalence of each finding was assessed and compared statistically between sites and between cultured and natural populations. The infection intensity of them was low, and no OIE listed parasite was detected. Of all the findings of this study, those that could be of concern are the IMC, neoplasia, and the Steinhausia mytilovum-like microsporidian. This study provided baseline data necessary for the design of a larger, seasonal sampling, which will allow to assess the feasibility of a permanent monitoring program to protect the huge mussel cultivating industry of the Los Lagos Region in Chile.","This work was funded by CONICYT FONDEF PROJECT 15I10365, Chile.

203,pub.1122255955,10.1029/2019jc015206,,,Tsunami Resonance and Spatial Pattern of Natural Oscillation Modes With Multiple Resonators,"Abstract Tsunami resonance and coupled oscillation of shelf and bays modes has been reported to be important in tsunami wave amplification. The main objective of this work is to study the spatial pattern of natural oscillation modes and to analyze the influence of several resonators on the coast of the central Chile, which has a complex morphology with several bays, submarine canyons, and a wide continental shelf. First, natural oscillation modes were computed by means of modal analysis of local and regional domains. Second, a dense network of tide gauges and pressure sensors was analyzed to obtain background spectra inside bays. Third, tsunami spectra were computed from both tsunami records and numerical simulations. The results show that the use of modal analysis and background and tsunami spectra is effective for identifying natural oscillation modes. In addition, a dense network of tide gauges is useful to validate the spatial pattern of these natural modes. It was observed that larger resonators and the shelf are important in coupling oscillation with local bays, such that large amplification can be observed. Finally, this analysis allowed the diverse effects of 2010 and 2011 tsunamis in the bays of central Chile to be explained, making it possible to better address tsunami mitigation measures and the preparedness of coastal communities.
Key Points    The use of a dense network of tide gauges allows validation of the spatial pattern of natural oscillation modes of both shelves and bays   Continental shelf and larger resonators have a significant effect on coupled oscillations with local bays   Coliumo and Concepcion bays are strongly influenced by shelf modes such that tsunami amplification was observed during 2010 and 2011 events","Authors would like to thank CONICYT through its Grants FONDECYT 11140424 and FONDAP 15110017 (CIGIDEN).

203,pub.1122145158,10.1016/j.resourpol.2019.101523,,,Revisiting the link between resource windfalls and subnational crowding out for local mining economies in Chile,"Literature on the resource curse argues that resource windfalls, such as those resulting from a commodity price boom, crowd out several determinants of long-term fiscal income (Papyrakis and Gerlagh, 2006). Although empirical literature tests this theory at an intercountry context, similar attention has not been paid to that of subnational governments. This different type of spatial scope would reveal how low-tier governments strategically behave in regard to resource windfalls and covering local costs. Any strategic behavior will directly impact the local community's well-being due to the role played by subnational governments in providing local public goods. We contribute to this gap in the literature by analyzing how the resource windfalls from mining taxes in Chile crowd out local collected revenue such as a residential and a commercial property tax. Using panel data for 345 Chilean municipalities between 2008 and 2017, we pursue the causal effect derived from a subnational crowding out hypothesis, measured as the cross substitution between an additional monetary unit received from windfalls. We also take advantage of the exogenous allocation rule for the distribution of mining taxes in mining municipalities via the Chilean National Mining Code. Our results are robust and do not reject the hypothesis: mining taxes crowd out property tax collection. Tax laziness is maintained after considering for potential endogeneity and heteroskedasticity imposed by spatial autocorrelation. Our results call for local policies that focus on discouraging undesirable behavior in the collection of local property taxes in mining municipalities.",Declaration of competing interest None.,,Resources Policy,,,,2019-12,2019,,2019-12,64,,101523,Closed,Article,"Oyarzo, Mauricio; Paredes, Dusan","Oyarzo, Mauricio (School of Business Administration, Universidad de Concepción Campus Chillán, Avenida Vicente Méndez 595, Chillán, Chile); Paredes, Dusan (Department of Economics, Universidad Católica del Norte, Avenida Angamos 0610, Antofagasta, Chile)","Oyarzo, Mauricio (University of Concepción)","Oyarzo, Mauricio (University of Concepción); Paredes, Dusan (Catholic University of the North)",12,6,,6.06,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1122145158,38 Economics; 3801 Applied Economics; 44 Human Society; 4404 Development Studies,

Brittle deformation in RT was initiated with the formation of veins, disrupting low-strain crystal-plastic deformation. Following cooling, shear fractures propagated along these veins with associated fluid influx, leading to phyllic alteration. Hydrolysis converted all plagioclase to kaolinite within the damage zones and all orthoclase to illite within fault cores and the less deformed rocks surrounded by faults. In turn, precipitation of quartz and pyrite locally cemented gouge in the fault cores. Concentration of clays around faults and veins weakened the rocks and promoted shear strain along them. These processes are expected to occur in any porphyry-related hydrothermal system and can combine during the development of the system. Although cementation tends to strengthen fault cores, the overall strength of the faults is expected to be reduced by hydrolysis of plagioclase, reducing the friction of the faults and their capacity to accumulate stress. These findings may have strong implications for understanding the evolution of ore deposit, the rheology of the crust, earthquake generation, and natural hazard assessment.","We thank CONICYT, Chile, for financial support with grants 24091112 and 21090074.

202,pub.1121963923,10.1002/aqc.3095,,,Marine protected areas invaded by floating anthropogenic litter: An example from the South Pacific,"Abstract    Oceanic marine protected areas (MPAs) that are close to the litter accumulation zones in the subtropical gyres receive large amounts of plastic litter, both as micro‐ and as macroplastics.   The macro‐litter accumulating on the islands in the Easter Island Ecoregion (Rapa Nui and Salas y Gómez) can be traced back to the high seas industrial fishery operating in the South Pacific.   Seabirds nesting in the MPAs in the South Pacific are affected by both microplastic ingestion and macroplastic in their nests, but there was no evidence of entangled birds.   Conservation of seabirds (and other species) in these oceanic MPAs requires efficient measures to reduce plastic contamination in the ocean.   Observations made in the South Pacific coincide with those from other oceanic MPAs, calling for global actions.","This study received support from the Chilean Millennium Initiative through Millennium Nucleus Ecology and Sustainable Management of Oceanic Islands ESMOI.

To test the potential paleoclimatic-environmental significance of the magnetic record of coarse-grained sediments deposited in a region with a mean annual precipitation (MAP) <200 mm yr−1, we selected three previously studied sedimentary sequences from the Atacama Desert (Centinela area) and explored their magnetic properties, paedogenic features, salt chemistry and mineralogy. These sequences were deposited under different climate-environmental conditions from the Eocene to the Miocene, and correspond, from oldest to youngest, to the Atravesados II gravels (AtII), the Arrieros gravels (Arr) and the Ratones sediments (Rat). The magnetic susceptibility values (k) obtained in the stratigraphic record of the gravels are mainly controlled by the concentration of detrital (titano)magnetite, which is concentrated in the finest fraction (<0.5 mm) of sediments. The values decrease in the coarse sediments from AtII to Arr following a climatic transition from arid to hyperarid conditions, an interpretation that is supported by the transition from carbonate-rich (MAP ~ 40 mm yr−1) to sulfate-rich paleosols (MAP < 10 mm yr−1), and changes in the tectonic conditions and/or sedimentary source. In contrast, the Rat fine-grained sediments record changes in paleo-wetland dynamics. The high frequency-dependent magnetic susceptibility (kfd%) values obtained from these layers are mainly controlled by the concentration of authigenic magnetite-maghemite and/or hematite crystals of superparamagnetic/single magnetic size. The increase in kfd% is linked to an increase in the authigenic degree, which is related to variations in the depth of the local water table. These results demonstrate the potential of magnetic proxies to reveal climatic/environmental signals in coarse-grained sediments deposited under desert climate conditions.","This work was funded by CONICYT (the Chilean Commission on Science and Technology), by means of a Doctorados Nacionales scholarship No. 21150393 and FONDECYT Project No. 1170992, and by the IRD (Institut de Recherche pour le Développement, France) by means of grant ARTS-IRD No. 862271K and the Laboratoire Mixte International (LMI) Cuivre et Pediments (COPEDIM).

201,pub.1121579428,10.1007/s11069-019-03809-8,,,"A hybrid deterministic and stochastic approach for tsunami hazard assessment in Iquique, Chile","The southern Peru and northern Chile coastal region is an active subduction zone that contains one of the most significant seismic gaps in the eastern Pacific basin (~ 17°S–~ 24°S). Although the gap was partially filled by the 2014 Mw 8.1 Iquique earthquake, there is still a high seismogenic potential to release a Mw ~ 9 earthquake in the near future; therefore, all the near-field coastal cities in the region face a latent tsunami threat. In this article, we propose a hybrid deterministic–stochastic multi-scenario approach to assess the current tsunami hazard level in the city of Iquique, an important commercial and industrial center of northern Chile that is home to 184,000 inhabitants. In our approach, we defined 400 stochastic, 10 deterministic and 10 homogeneous tsunamigenic earthquake scenarios, covering the entire area of the seismic gap. Based on the regional distribution of gravity anomalies and published interseismic coupling distributions, we interpreted the occurrence of four major asperities in the subduction interface of the seismic gap. The asperity pattern was used to construct a group of deterministic slip-deficit earthquake sources with seismic magnitudes ranging between Mw 8.4 and Mw 8.9. Additionally, we constructed 10 homogeneous slip scenarios to generate an inundation baseline for the tsunami hazard. Subsequently, following a stochastic scheme, we implemented a Karhunen–Loève expansion to generate 400 stochastic earthquake scenarios within the same magnitude range as the deterministic slip-deficit sources. All sources were used as earthquake scenarios to simulate the tsunami propagation and inundation by means of a non-hydrostatic model (Neowave 2D) with a classical nesting scheme for the city of Iquique. We obtained high-resolution data for flow depth, coastal surface currents and sea level elevation. The results suggest that the peak slip location and shelf resonance play an important role in the calculated coastal flow depths. The analysis of the entire set of simulated stochastic earthquake scenarios indicates that the worst-case scenario for Iquique is a Mw 8.9 earthquake. This scenario presented a tsunami arrival time of ~ 12 min, which is critical for the evacuation process. In addition, the maximum wave height and tsunami flow depth were found to be ~ 10 m and ~ 24 m, respectively. The observed coastal resonance processes exhibit at least three destructive tsunami wave trains. Based on historical and instrumental catalog statistics, the recurrence time of the credible worst-case earthquake scenario for Iquique (Mw 8.9) is 395 years, with a probability of occurrence of ~ 11.86% in the next 50 years.","This research has been funded by a Ph.D. scholarship awarded by Universidad Católica del Norte, Antofagasta, and the CONICYT FONDAP Program through Grant No. 1511017.

For these purpose, we use two unusually rich micro-level datasets that allow us to follow around 3500 services supplier during the period of analysis, describe their evolution, and conduct a series of variance-decomposition exercises to assess the differences in the MSS sector along the cycle and according to the firms´ location.

This eruption is constrained in age to ≥11,728 cal years BP by radiocarbon dating of organic matter from the MET sediment core and is termed the ∼11.7 ka MEN event. The two tephra deposits are identical and based on their petrology, bulk tephra, glass, and amphibole geochemical characteristics, are attributed to an eruption of Mentolat volcano. Both contain pumice lapilli with glass compositions that ranges from 59 to 76 wt. % SiO2, with medium to low-K2O calc-alkaline composition and trace element abundances similar to both lavas and other tephras derived from Mentolat. They have abundant amphibole, plagioclase, orthopyroxene, and clinopyroxene phenocrysts, with a smaller proportion of olivine and Fe-Ti oxides, and a minor amount of distinctive crustal xenoliths with both unfoliated and foliated textures. Amphiboles have low K2O (0.20–0.37 wt. %) and TiO2 (1.5–3.8 wt. %) and are similar geochemically to amphiboles from other Mentolat-derived tephra (K2O = 0.14–0.43 wt. % and TiO2 = 1.9–2.4 wt. %), but distinct from amphiboles in lavas and tephra derived from other volcanoes in the southernmost SSVZ including Cay (K2O = 0.47–0.55 wt. % and TiO2 = 2.4–3.1 wt. %) and Melimoyu (K2O = 0.39–0.52 wt. % and TiO2 = 2.8–4.5 wt. %). Amphiboles from the ∼11.7 ka MEN tephra formed over a broad range of pressures (154–406 MPa), temperatures (834-969 °C), and magma water contents (4.9–7.0 wt. %), which overlap with the physical-chemical conditions for the formation of amphiboles from other Mentolat-derived tephra. The two correlated tephra deposits, which are located ∼95 km southeast of Mentolat, are correlative with tephra of similar age identified in 12 other lacustrine sediment cores from the region, for which, based on their petrology and the geochemistry of their tephra glass and amphiboles, Mentolat is also the likely source volcano. This eruption produced approximately 1.8 km3 of bulk material with an estimated magnitude of 5.2. Mentolat has produced numerous (>18) explosive eruptions since glacial retreat from the region and future explosive eruptions from this center could potentially impact local population centers and the agricultural industry in southern Chile and Argentina.","This research was supported by FONDECYT-Chile grant #1130128, Regional Fondecyt Program R17A10002, and the National Science Foundation (EAR1427626).

We focus on the archaeological practices within institutional structures—the universities, heritage agencies, and museums. We examine the roles these institutions played in either perpetuating or challenging the disconnection between archaeological heritage and descendent communities prior to 1994, and whether the political changes that occurred since the end of apartheid have succeeded in creating an inclusive archaeological practice in South Africa. The Transformation Charter, adopted in 2008 by the Association of Southern African Professional Archaeologists (ASAPA), requires that all those working in the field of archaeology in South Africa practice a form of archaeology that is “rooted in social awareness and social engagement” and aims to be “socially responsible.” We examine the extent to which progress has been made towards achieving those objectives.","We are grateful for the institutional support that we received from the Department of Anthropology and Archaeology at the University of Pretoria and the Centre for Rock Art Research + Management in the School of Social Sciences at the University of Western Australia.

Durvillaea spp. have a diplontic life cycle, lack a free-living gametophyte and have oogamous reproduction. All Durvillaea species require rocky substrate for attachment and wave-exposed environments. These “southern bull kelps” occur exclusively in the Southern Hemisphere and are important foundation species, in most cases controlling local community structure, influencing biodiversity, and providing food and habitat for other culturally and economically important species. Most species are non-buoyant and these have restricted geographic ranges, in some cases endemic to small oceanic islands. Buoyant members of the genus are more widespread, with one species (Durvillaea antarctica) found throughout the subantarctic, Chile, and New Zealand. This chapter summarizes the taxonomy, biology, and economic importance of Durvillaea species, with a focus on aspects relevant to their availability and productivity as crop plants.

The six-step method based on a set of statistical methods can be computed with a new R package: estdaR. The first step consists of the usual characterization of the cross-sectional distribution of the urban areas by means of nonparametric estimations of density functions for a set of significant years. In the second and third steps, the growth process is modeled as a first-order stationary Markov chain to evaluate the effect of global and local spatial autocorrelation on the transition probabilities with a set of indices based on the spatial version of the standard Markov chain. The fourth, fifth, and sixth steps perform in-depth analysis to detect the existence and interaction of spatial regimes in the movement direction and ranking mobility of urban distribution. We apply this novel strategy for the period 1930–2002 to analyze the entire Chilean urban system—not only the Central Zone, in which most of the population and economic activities are concentrated, but also other urban zones in the country.",,"The funding was provided by Ministerio de Economía, Industria y Competitividad, Gobierno de España (Grand No. ECO2015-65758-P).",The Annals of Regional Science,,,,2019-12-10,2019,2019-12-10,2020-04,64,2,421-454,Closed,Article,"Vallone, Andrés; Chasco, Coro","Vallone, Andrés (Dpto.

Due to this, the scientific interest in studying the effect and mechanisms of action of clay minerals in the flotation process has increased, which has resulted in a better understanding of the physicochemical foundations behind. This paper reports a comprehensive bibliographic review in which the mechanisms through which clay minerals cause harmful effects in the flotation process are explained. The main studies reported to date are systematised and classified in five topics in this paper: i) rheology of clayey pulps; ii) specific reagents for dispersing clays; iii) interactions between clays and valuable minerals in saline media; iv) mechanical entrainment and v) copper oxidation on clay coating. The strategies currently used to improve the processing of clayey mineral pulps have been insufficient to achieve optimal operational results, so the following work is intended to promote the development of new technologies that allow improving the performance of these processes.

To understand large-scale variation in biotic interactions, we quantify consumption (predation and herbivory) along 2500 km of the Chilean coast (19°S–42°S). We deployed tethering assays at ten sites with three different baits: the crab Petrolisthes laevigatus as living prey for predators, dried squid as dead prey for predators/scavengers, and the kelp Lessonia spp. for herbivores. Underwater videos were used to characterize the consumer community and identify those species consuming baits. The species composition of consumers, frequency of occurrence, and maximum abundance (MaxN) of crustaceans and the blenniid fish Scartichthys spp. varied across sites. Consumption of P. laevigatus and kelp did not vary with latitude, while squid baits were consumed more quickly at mid and high latitudes. This is likely explained by the increased occurrence of predatory crabs, which was positively correlated with consumption of squidpops after 2 h. Crabs, rather than fish, were the principal consumers of squid baits (91% of all recorded predation events) at sites south of 30°S. Fish and crustaceans preyed in similar proportion on P. laevigatus, with most fish predation events at northern sites. The absence of any strong latitudinal patterns in consumption rate of tethered prey is likely due to redundancy among consumers across the latitudinal range, with crustaceans gaining in importance with increasing latitude, possibly replacing fish as key predators.",We are grateful to the local fishermen who allowed us to work in their fishing areas and helped with logistics at many of our study sites.

What are the channels through which extractive activity affects the economy?,"Changes in the extractive industry since the 1990s have been considered an opportunity to increase mining linkages due to the growth of outsourcing and the formation of a more complex organization of the supply chain. Using information from the Chilean input-output tables compiled by the OECD, we analyze whether or not the expected increase in mining linkages has taken place between 1995 and 2011. Furthermore, we extend the study of linkages using a Structural Path Analysis to understand how the effect of mining linkages is either transmitted to other economic activities or has a limited impact on the rest of the Chilean economy. Results show a significant reduction of mining linkages in Chile especially during the period of higher prices. At the same time, the way the influence of mining activity is transmitted to the rest of the economy through sectoral interactions is limited and lacks complexity.",,,Resources Policy,,,,2019-03,2019,,2019-03,60,,106-117,Closed,Article,"Castaño, Andrés; Lufin, Marcelo; Atienza, Miguel","Castaño, Andrés (Department of City and Regional Planning, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY, United States; Departamento de Economía, Instituto de Economía Aplicada Regional (IDEAR), Universidad Católica del Norte, Avenida Angamos 0610, Antofagasta, Chile); Lufin, Marcelo (Departamento de Economía, Instituto de Economía Aplicada Regional (IDEAR), Universidad Católica del Norte, Avenida Angamos 0610, Antofagasta, Chile); Atienza, Miguel (Departamento de Economía, Instituto de Economía Aplicada Regional (IDEAR), Universidad Católica del Norte, Avenida Angamos 0610, Antofagasta, Chile)","Atienza, Miguel (Catholic University of the North)","Castaño, Andrés (Cornell University; Catholic University of the North); Lufin, Marcelo (Catholic University of the North); Atienza, Miguel (Catholic University of the North)",26,9,,10.81,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1110901656,38 Economics; 3801 Applied Economics,
191,pub.1111654202,10.1016/j.jmarsys.2018.12.008,,,Dominant scales of subtidal variability in coastal hydrography of the Northern Chilean Patagonia,"The Chilean Patagonia, on the southeastern Pacific Ocean, is one of the largest fjord systems in the world. Its complex topography harbors an aquaculture industry that is among the top exporters of salmon and mussels worldwide. However, little is known about the scales of environmental variability of this region and how climate-related changes can alter the current conditions. This study provides a baseline understanding of the dominant scales of subtidal variability in meteorological forcing and water properties along and across the region that encompasses northern Patagonia and specifically the Inner Sea of Chiloé (ISC). We examined multiple datasets spanning multiple spatial and temporal scales. Reanalysis wind time series were combined with satellite-derived data (MODIS-Aqua) and in situ hydrographic records from the mussel farming industry as well as from instruments moored at various locations in the ISC. We assessed the influence of large-scale forcing on the variability of local conditions and used the assembled datasets to find modes of variability at interannual, seasonal and intraseasonal scales. The patterns of atmospheric and oceanographic variability along northern Patagonia are heterogeneous both in time and space. Long-term sea surface temperature (SST) averages revealed two areas with colder temperatures and attenuated seasonal variability that can be associated with stronger vertical mixing. These areas have been previously related to hotspots for whale sightings and might be important as bottom-up controls of Patagonian food webs. Northern Patagonia is strongly affected by large-scale processes at the South Pacific basin scale. Long-term wind data show a poleward displacement of the transition between upwelling and downwelling favorable conditions during spring-summer months for the last decade. The intraseasonal time scale was dominated by a band centered at 30 days that can be attributed to atmospheric variability driven by the Baroclinic Annular Mode (BAM), which induces the periodic mixing of the water column, but with substantial interannual variability. Variability in local conditions was found to closely track the large-scale variability, even in the small channels and bays. These findings highlight the strong connection between large-scale processes and the conditions faced by aquaculture in the ISC, and the need to consider such scales of variability - as well as climate trends - in planning and management decisions.","This research was funded by Millennium Nucleus “Center for the Study of Multiple-drivers on Marine Socio-Ecological Systems (MUSELS)” funded by MINECON NC120086.

Assessing land cover change using satellite images, vegetation survey, and local knowledge (i.e., traditional ecological knowledge) reveals the multi-faceted socio-ecological dimensions of bofedal change in Sajama National Park (PNS), Bolivia. Here, we present results from focus groups held in 2016 and 2017 to learn about the local knowledge of bofedales in five Aymara communities in PNS. Land cover maps, created from Landsat satellite imagery, provided a baseline reference of the decadal change of bofedales (1986, 1996, 2006, and 2016) and were field verified with vegetation sampling. At the park level, the land cover maps show a reduction of healthy bofedales (i.e., Juncaceae dominated peatland) cover from 33.8 km2 in 1986 to 21.7 km2 in 2016, and an increase in dry mixed grasses (e.g., Poaceae dominated land cover) from 5.1 km2 (1986) to 20.3 km2 (2016). Locals identify climate change, lack of irrigation, difficulty in water access, and loss of communal water management practices as key bofedal management challenges. Local improvement of bofedales was found in one community due to community-based irrigation efforts. Bridging knowledge of mountain land cover change helps to articulate the socio-ecological dimensions that influence local decision-making regarding bofedal management, and consideration of local actions that may be strengthened to support the sustainability of bofedales for local livelihoods in the context of climate change in the Andes.","We thank the communities of Sajama National Park, SERNAP, Herbario Nacional de Bolivia, IGEMA, and Victor Mamani.

Resolving these complexes is of utmost importance. Herein, we tested whether Lysmata wurdemanni, a shrimp distributed over three contiguous biogeographical provinces (Virginian, Carolinian and Caribbean) and traversing various phylogeographical breaks, is a cryptic species complex. Initially, principal components analyses using 12 anatomical traits confirmed that selected populations from the three biogeographical provinces were morphologically homogeneous. Nonetheless, molecular phylogenetic analyses (16S RNA mitochondrial DNA marker) demonstrated three well-supported monophyletic clades and deep genetic distances among them. Species delimitation approaches suggested at least five (maximum of nine) putative cryptic species. Population genetics focusing on a single widespread clade distributed in the Gulf of Mexico and northwestern Atlantic coast also found deep genetic structure, and an isolation-with-migration population divergence model indicated that population divergence with incomplete lineage sorting can be invoked as the single mechanism explaining genetic dissimilarity among populations within this clade. Altogether, the information above demonstrates that L. wurdemanni is a cryptic species complex. We argue in favour of additional integrative studies to reveal the extent and magnitude of cryptic species complexes in the marine realm.","We are deeply grateful to Robert Aguilar, Smithsonian Environmental Research Centre, MD, USA and Anja Schulze, Texas A&amp;M University at Galveston, TX, USA for making available specimens from Chesapeake Bay and Galveston, respectively.

Sediment burial ages were calculated using single-aliquot regenerative-dose (SAR) protocols applied to the optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) signal of quartz as well as infrared stimulated luminescence (IRSL) and post-infrared infrared stimulated luminescence (post-IR IRSL) signals of K-feldspar. Considering that the target sedimentary deposits comprise the Late Pleistocene age range, K-feldspar grains were dated using fading-corrected IRSL signals measured at 50 °C (IR50) and post-IR IRSL measured at 225 °C (pIRIR225) to minimize the potential effect of residual doses on calculated ages. The results of the analytical procedures indicate that quartz grains extracted from the studied sediments present a very weak or even no fast OSL component. The combination of a low OSL sensitivity, signal instability and equivalent dose distributions with high overdispersion (>40% for most samples) hinder reliable age estimation using quartz aliquots. Bleaching test results show that the IR50 signal from K-feldspar aliquots is well reset after 20–24 h of light exposure, while the pIRIR225 signal may present residual doses corresponding to between 10 and 15% of the natural signal. IR50 fading rates are ∼6–7%/decade for most studied samples, with exception of one sample which yielded a g-value of 18.77 ± 2.06%/decade. Fading rates for the pIRIR225 signal yielded variable results among sampling sites, with g-values ranging between 0.70 ± 0.24 and 6.77 ± 1.05%/decade. The dating results point out that quartz OSL ages are largely underestimated in relation to K-feldspar fading-corrected IR50 and pIRIR225 ages. Fading-corrected pIRIR225 K-feldspar ages indicate that the alluvial sedimentation in the downthrown block of an active normal fault in Mejillones Peninsula occurred between 163.4 ± 18.4 ka and 87.4 ± 6.6 ka. K-feldspar ages also allow to constrain the age of fault scarp degradation and fault reactivation in two main branches of the Atacama Fault System. In the Naguayán Fault, pIRIR225 ages indicate that faulting occurred after 21.4 ± 3.2 ka while in the Salar del Carmen Fault, faulting is recorded after 14.7 ± 1.0 ka.","This research was supported by funding provided by CONICYT (Chile) through the PhD Scholarship 21160616, the FONDECYT (Chile) grant 1140846 and the FONDAP (Chile) grant 15110017.

The studied basin is that of the upper Loa river and its sub-basins, which is adjacent to the basin occupied by the Salar de Atacama where Li-rich brines are commercially exploited. Due to the arid climate, water draining this part of the Andes does so primarily through the subsurface. Water from a thermal source is a common component of water sampled, but its geochemical signature evolves through multiple processes including dilution, cold rock-water reactions, influxes of sedimentary brine and evaporite mineral dissolution. These processes lead to a range of Li and B concentrations in groundwater (0.01–14 mg/L and 0.18–20 mg/L) and isotope compositions (−1 to +12‰ and −6 to +14‰). The effect of rock dissolution on δ7Li and δ11B within aquifers is apparent from their low values, but even in streams these values only undergo small increases relative to other rivers worldwide. This may be due to the weathering of ignimbrites producing water with less Al and limited clay formation, the large reservoir of thermally-sourced Li and B of which only a small component is removed, and because the streams acquire groundwater through their beds. The wider range in δ11B is a result of variable lithology and dissolution of evaporite minerals, which have lesser effects on δ7Li. Our multi-isotope approach highlights the role of lithology and different processes in defining groundwater chemistry. Isotopic signatures derived from marine sediments are recognizable in some springs even though this type of rock has nearly no surface exposure due to extensive volcanic rock cover, and are acquired directly or via incorporation of these sediments into volcanic systems. These high-Cl rocks can weather to produce water with a chemical composition like that of sedimentary brine but is distinguishable through δ11B composition. Combination of 87Sr/86Sr, δ7Li and δ11B also indicate that mixed salts which contribute to groundwater draining the ignimbrite covered areas of the basin did not form following cold temperature weathering, but from water where thermal contributions dominated solute budgets keeping δ7Li low, and Li/Cl and B/Cl high compared to other fluid reservoirs such as seawater. We propose that these saline systems lay within the confines of one of the multiple late-Miocene-Pliocene calderas following the active stage of volcanism and while heat gradients remained high.","We would like to acknowledge useful discussions with Dr. T.E.

The Subjective Monetary Value of Mental Health After the 27F Chilean Earthquake,"In this article we use the life satisfaction approach to assess the non-pecuniary costs of Mental health impacts after the 2010 Chile earthquake. By linking both subjective well-being valuation literature with studies that describe psychological impacts after natural disasters, we are able to quantify how big a compensation should be to leave individuals as well as they were before the event. Our results suggest that people who experience stress should be compensated by approximately 80–90% of the average monthly income if the shock was strong enough to cause significant damages. These estimates are robust to different empirical specifications, endogeneity, shock intensity measures, and mental health definitions. We estimate that the total costs of mental health deterioration are about 7% of the total reported damages, a significant amount that policymakers should not ignore in post-earthquake reconstruction stages.",,,Journal of Happiness Studies,,,,2019-04-04,2019,2019-04-04,2020-03,21,3,843-875,Closed,Article,"Sarrias, Mauricio; Jara, Benjamin","Sarrias, Mauricio (IDEAR, Department of Economics, Universidad Católica del Norte, Antofagasta, Chile); Jara, Benjamin (IDEAR, Department of Economics, Universidad Católica del Norte, Antofagasta, Chile)","Sarrias, Mauricio (Catholic University of the North)","Sarrias, Mauricio (Catholic University of the North); Jara, Benjamin (Catholic University of the North)",9,4,,1.97,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1113233929,52 Psychology; 5201 Applied and Developmental Psychology; 5203 Clinical and Health Psychology; 5205 Social and Personality Psychology,3 Good Health and Well Being
176,pub.1122463254,10.1007/s00382-019-05036-0,,,Change in strong Eastern Pacific El Niño events dynamics in the warming climate,"While there is evidence that ENSO activity will increase in association with the increased vertical stratification due to global warming, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Here we investigate this issue using the simulations of the NCAR Community Earth System Model Large Ensemble (CESM-LE) Project focusing on strong El Niño events of the Eastern Pacific (EP) that can be associated to flooding in Northern and Central Peru. It is shown that, in the warmer climate, the duration of strong EP El Niño events peaking in boreal winter is extended by two months, which results in significantly more events peaking in February–March–April (FMA), the season when the climatological Inter-Tropical Convergence Zone is at its southernmost location. This larger persistence of strong EP events is interpreted as resulting from both a stronger recharge process and a more effective thermocline feedback in the eastern equatorial Pacific due to increased mean vertical stratification. A heat budget analysis reveals in particular that the reduction in seasonal upwelling rate is compensated by the increase in anomalous vertical temperature gradient within the surface layer, yielding an overall increase in the effectiveness of the thermocline feedback. In CESM-LE, the appearance of strong EP El Niño events peaking in FMA accounts for one-quarter of the increase in frequency of occurrence of ENSO-induced extreme precipitation events, while one-third results from weak-to-moderate El Niño events that triggers extreme precipitation events because of the warmer mean SST becoming closer to the convective threshold. In CESM-LE, both the increase in mean EP SST and the change in ENSO processes thus contribute to the increase in extreme precipitation events in the warmer climate.","We acknowledge the CESM Large Ensemble Community Project for providing model outputs, which are available on https://www.earthsystemgrid.org.

175,pub.1111775220,10.1007/s10113-018-01459-3,,,Rock glaciers as a water resource in a changing climate in the semiarid Chilean Andes,"Rock glaciers likely play an important hydrological role in the semiarid Andes (SA; 27°–35°S). They supplement streamflow when water is needed most, especially during dry years in the late summer months. Despite their assumed importance, there are no publications that quantify their hydrological contribution to streamflow in the SA of Chile, based on measurements of rock glacier ice loss or discharge. In this study, we assess the available information on the hydrological importance of rock glaciers in the SA and provide suggestions on how future research can address knowledge gaps. We conclude that there is insufficient data available to quantify the hydrological contribution of rock glaciers in the SA. Measurements of glacier discharge are limited to unpublished data sets from which only very limited conclusions can be drawn. There are no ice volume change measurements or proxies available for individual rock glaciers. Approximations of rock glacier ice volume, calculated from areal extent, thickness, and percentage of ice content are available, and these data provide an initial baseline for calculating ice volume change in the future. While these baseline data are very valuable, they represent rough estimates due to a scarcity of studies, especially on glacier thickness and percentage of ice content. With increased temperatures and a decrease in precipitation expected in the future, rock glaciers could become an increasingly critical water resource in this region, especially in the Elqui and Juncal catchments. Improved estimates of rock glacier discharge, water content, processes, and hydrology are required to model their future evolution and evaluate their contribution to water resources.","We thank Cristián Campos, Sebastián Vivero, Sébastien Monnier, and Rodrigo Ponce for their helpful discussions and/or assistance with this manuscript.",This work was supported by CONICYT + Programa Regional + Fortalecimiento (R16A10003) and FIC-R (2016) Coquimbo (BIP: 40000343).

                    The purpose of this paper is to report on the reflective identity work of a white female chartered accountant, scholar and academic manager, regarding the intersectional transformations of gender and race as well as leadership within the South African accounting profession over four decades.
                  
                  
                    Design/methodology/approach
                    The theoretical lens of intersectionality is applied through an autoethnographic approach. Multiple layers of personal experiences and observations are interpreted through identity work of leadership provided and received. Autoethnographic data are substantiated and contextualised through the researchers’ sense-making, official and scholarly sources.
                  
                  
                    Findings
                    Sustainable transformation of the accounting profession requires a deepened understanding of the interconnections of the personal, structural and systemic areas within unique contexts. Leadership, as provided and received, must be included within the intersectional orientations. Intersectional orientations become then more significant for understanding progressive changes of the demographic profile of the accounting profession not only in South Africa but also in other countries. The transformation interventions aimed at affirming high-quality black African, coloured and female candidates to the South African accounting profession are founded on the principles of social justice. A sustained reframing of the demographic profile of a profession is possible through accelerated and well-funded collaborative transformation interventions enhancing intentional structural changes of the membership pipeline.
                  
                  
                    Research limitations/implications
                    The possible limitations of this study lie in the contextual nature of the material and findings and the lens of the specific theory.
                  
                  
                    Practical implications
                    The understanding of the practice of interventions aiming at transforming the country-specific demographic profile of a scarce skills profession such as the accountancy profession.
                  
                  
                    Originality/value
                    The originality of this paper lies in the application of an intersectional theoretical lens that argues for leadership as a dimension alongside age, gender and race in an autoethnographic sense making of the transformation of the South African accounting profession.","The authors wish to acknowledge the valuable feedback on our draft article from the following colleagues: Gayle Letherby, Dave Lubbe, Charmaine Williams and Stella Nkomo.",,Meditari Accountancy Research,,,,2019-06-03,2019,,2019-06-03,27,3,448-471,Closed,Article,"Sadler, Elmarie; Wessels, Jacobus Stephanus","Sadler, Elmarie (College of Accounting Sciences, University of South Africa, Pretoria, South Africa); Wessels, Jacobus Stephanus (Public Administration and Management, University of South Africa, Pretoria, South Africa)","Wessels, Jacobus Stephanus (University of South Africa)","Sadler, Elmarie (University of South Africa); Wessels, Jacobus Stephanus (University of South Africa)",11,5,,4.08,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1113204283,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3507 Strategy, Management and Organisational Behaviour",

Updated available dates of these products, both from the Apacheta and Aguilucho stratovolcanoes and nearby domes, allow us to define the activity during the last 1 Ma. This investigation shows that the andesitic magmas were affected by processes of Assimilation plus Fractional Crystallization (AFC, with a significant role played by amphibole fractionation) during their ascent through the upper crust, presumably by the interaction with the Altiplano-Puna Magma Body (15–20 km). These andesitic magmas were erupted with no or minor additional contamination at shallower levels, or experienced plagioclase-dominated Fractional Crystallization (FC) to dacite within shallower crustal magma chambers (4–8 km depth). The constructional phase of the Apacheta and Aguilucho stratovolcanoes (≥1 to ca. 0.6 Ma) reflect a transition from high-flux (i.e. flare-ups) to steady state magmatism, as also documented in other Pleistocene volcanic complexes of the Altiplano-Puna Volcanic Complex. During this stage the mafic magma recharge was high enough to permit a large spectrum of hybridization of the resident magmas in the upper crust to form the abundant andesites and dacites lavas. In contrast, at ∼150–100 ka, the magmatism turned to a new stage of recharge (waning stage?) and the episodic intrusion of small-volumes of andesitic magmas permitted the remobilization of the crystal-rich dacites, triggering the extrusions of the Chanka, Chac-Inca and Cerro Pabellón domes. The andesitic enclaves in the domes studied here represent a snapshot of the magmatic processes of interaction that occurred in the shallower reservoir at the interface of the resident dacite with the ascending andesitic magma. Nevertheless, as there are no dated volcanic products from the area between 0.6 and 0.1 Ma, the youngest dacitic domes could also be interpreted as the beginning of a new magmatic pulse of the Altiplano-Puna Volcanic Complex. Independently from the significance of the mafic recharge at 150–100 ka (waning stage vs. new pulse) the youngest investigated domes share similar geochemical features and crustal depth constraints (4–8 km) with the ignimbrites of the Altiplano-Puna Volcanic Complex, therefore suggesting that the remobilized magmas erupted as the domes are possibly remains of older plumbing systems left over from the last magmatic flare-up of the Altiplano-Puna Volcanic Complex.","This work is part of M.

Several models have proposed cessation of subduction as the reason behind the vast amounts of felsic magmatism and apparent lack of typical arc magmas. Here, new U-Pb in zircon ages, and geochemical and isotope analyses (Rb-Sr, Sm-Nd, Re-Os) indicate that mid Permian–Triassic granitic magmatism originated in a subduction-related extensional setting (slab rollback). Subduction and anatexis of lower continental crust were the main magma-generation mechanisms, the latter caused by asthenospheric upwelling, decompression and subsequent accumulation of underplated basalts. A comparison with coeval igneous units along the Chilean-Argentine border allows extension of this model from at least 21° to 40°S. The key elements triggering slab rollback are low subduction plate velocities and convergence rates, which can be attributed to the assembly of Pangea supercontinent (mid Permian–Triassic). Therefore, subduction of the oceanic plate beneath South America has been a continuous process from early Paleozoic times onwards—rather than having a period without subduction before the onset of the Andean cycle as previous models have invoked. New geochronological constraints indicate that the peak of the voluminous crustal-derived magmatism and related explosive volcanism (Choiyoi province) was contemporaneous with the emplacement of the Emeishan and Siberian Traps LIPs, potentially conditioning the Earth system for the environmental collapse and biotic crises related to those LIPs. The observed tectonic changes, magmatism and related environmental implications could potentially be linked to the assembly of Pangea supercontinent.","We thank J. Vargas and R.

Linking Tetonius and Pseudotetonius, two omomyid primates, are a series of stratigraphic and morphologic intermediates revealing trends suggestive of a functional and developmental reorganization of the dentition. Notable changes involved the P3, which reduced size and became indistinguishable from the canine and I2, and the P4, which became a robust tall-cusped tooth comparable to a molar. We test two hypotheses: (1) neutral evolution can explain the observed phenotypic differences in the lineage, and (2) P4 lost developmental association with P3 and became integrated with the molars. First, we calculate the rate of evolutionary differentiation, based on the ratio between inter- and intra-species variation in length and width of P3, P4, M1, and M2 teeth, between lineage segments and over the entire lineage. We test the second hypothesis by comparing bivariate correlations between teeth within individual lineage segments. As the lineage evolved, correlations between P3 and the molars diminished, whereas correlations between P4 and the molars increased. We found evidence of varying degrees of stabilizing selection in the lengths and widths of all cheek teeth and evidence of neutral evolution in the width of P4. These results support a trend towards P4 becoming integrated into the molar morphogenetic field, and demonstrates that morphological rates of evolution, and consequently the degree of selective pressures, vary through time and between teeth.","We would like to thank Kenneth Rose and Thomas Bown for their thorough work and publications on the Tetonius – Pseudotetonius lineage, which inspired this research.

169,pub.1117767209,10.1093/mnras/stz1729,,,Truncated γ-exponential models: evaporation and mass-segregation effects in the bi-component system,"ABSTRACT
                  The γ-exponential models were previously proposed as a phenomenological attempt to characterize the properties of stellar systems with a quasi-stationary evolution under the incidence evaporation, e.g. globular clusters. They represent a parametric family of distributions that unify profiles with isothermal cores and polytropic haloes, thus providing a suitable generalization for several models available in the literature. We start our discussion revisiting some results concerning the case of single-mass systems. In particular, we emphasized that these models predict the existence of a new type of collective phenomenon: the asymptotic gravothermal collapse. This gravitational instability differs from the normal gravothermal collapse (e.g. the one associated with isothermal model) because it requires that the system releases an infinite amount of energy. Afterwards, we enter to analyse how a mass spectrum modifies the thermodynamics of these models, in particular, the associated collective phenomena. Although the theoretical description concerns to any multimass system, our computational study addresses the simplest case: the bi-component system. This analysis allows a major understanding about the thermodynamics of stellar systems under the presence of evaporation and mass segregation. For the present models, the growth of mass segregation does not affect the system evaporation disruption but favours gravothermal collapse, e.g. it tends to reduce the energy interval of stability by increasing the lower bound critical energy associated with this collective phenomenon. Extreme cases appear under certain conditions, where gravothermal collapse changes its character from asymptotic to normal.","Authors thank the partial financial support of VRIDT-UCN research programme, and CONICYT ACT1204, FONDECYT REGULAR 1170834 and CONICYT grant 22140036 (Chilean agencies).

These dense blocks are widespread along the margin and located at the fore-arc, arc, and back-arc domains, including depths in the range of 12–18 km, and thickness of 5–8 km. The interplay of these dense blocks with long-lived Trans-Lithospheric-Faults (TLF) controls the emplacement, and most likely, provides the required fertile fluids for the Cu ore genesis. Dense blocks represent impervious crustal domains, surrounded by damage zones at the intersection with TLF systems. Concentration of seismicity, large Vp/Vs ratios, low gravity domains, active volcanism, and structural fabric, demonstrate that these damage zones are in fact the most likely places for magma as well as mineralized flow ascent and emplacement. Basic flow models in porous media show a flow path that migrates horizontally at the base of dense/impervious blocks until the high permeability edge flanks, where pressure gradients provide the ideal conditions for the upward and focusing hydrothermal fluid ascent. Although not fully addressed in this paper, evidence suggests that the interaction of subducting-related fluids and the mafic-dense block might produce a fertile fluid with a concentration of Cu. In contrast with the long-standing view of metallogenic belts of the same age and parallel to the trench axis, we propose a multi-age metallogenic cluster, along the periphery of dense blocks, and organized oblique to the margin, following the trend of a given TLF.","Regional Gravity data used in this article has been gathered from different public sources, SFB 267 project, ANILLO ACT-18 project, and in the final stages two infilling campaigns partially financed by project Fondecyt 1141139, and Millennium Nucleus for Metal Tracing Along Subduction (NMTM).

An approach from field data and 2-D reflection seismic data,"The tectonic evolution of the Andean forearc in the Central Andes is understood by the superimposition of deformational events associated with different tectonic regimes, which control the main morpho-tectonic units of northern Chile. Varied interpretations have opened a great discussion about the deep structure of the Andean forearc and its implications in the evolution of the Central Andes. These ideas are commonly accompanied by the lack of regional tectonic models that explain the geometry and kinematics of first-order structures. The main limitations are due to the unknown origin of the structural styles in the substrate and their relationships with those exposed in the field. In order to solve this problem, we present a new structural model of the forearc region of northern Chile, specifically along the Central Depression (22°-23°S) supported by field observations and the structural interpretations of 2D seismic data. Four major tectono-sequences have been recognized related to (a) a Paleozoic-Triassic basement rocks, (b) a Jurassic-Lower Cretaceous synrift deposits, (c) Upper Cretaceous-Paleocene volcano synorogenic deposits and (d) a Late Cenozoic covered gravel. The first-order structural styles identified correspond to inverted half-graben basement structures related to the Jurassic Tarapacá Basin. The hanging wall blocks of the master faults are usually composed of large inversion anticlines along which, Jurassic and Lower Cretaceous siliciclastic deposits were expelled. Other basement contractional structures consist of short-cut and by-pass faults that modified the previous geometry of extensional systems. The second-order thin-skinned fold and thrust exposed in the region accommodated the shortening experienced by the Mesozoic synrift deposits during the basin inversion. The Upper Cretaceous-Paleocene deposits usually unconformably overlie the folded Mesozoic synrift deposits. This structural feature is first-order evidence of the positive reactivation of the Mesozoic rift basins and therefore is a regional marker of the onset of the Andean uplift in the region.","The authors would like to thank Enap-Sipetrol for providing the seismic data used in the present study.

The loess sections were investigated for the first time through high-resolution luminescence dating in order to determine the chronology of the loess deposits and its temporal correlation with important palaeoclimatic records of the Southern Hemisphere. Reliable estimations of mass accumulation rates (MARs) for loess were used to infer the temporal dust flux variation during the last glacial/interglacial transition in southern South America. The new age models have significant differences compared to the previously published ones of likely Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) ages. The three studied sections showed general bimodal grain-size distributions consistent with multiple sources contributing dust to the Pampas. It is observed that higher MARs values are associated with an increased presence of finer loess. Increases in loess accumulation are coeval with climatic transitions from wetter to drier periods in the Puna-Altiplano Plateau, and high MARs are related to synchronous climatic shifts to humid conditions in the Pampean plain. Contrasting with dust fluxes observed in the more distal palaeoarchives (i.e., the South Atlantic Ocean and the Antarctic ice sheet) the new data suggest increased dust accumulation in the Pampas during the Antarctic Cold Reversal (ACR) and the Holocene. This supports the idea that changes related to atmospheric transport efficiency can better explain dust flux variations observed over glacial/interglacial periods in distant palaeoarchives.","This work was financially supported by SECyT-UNC, FONCyT (PICT 0525).

                    Design/methodology/approach
                    The research model was proposed based on two types of purchases (hedonic vs utilitarian) and on personal traits of individuals against technology throughout the Technology Readiness Index (TRI) 2.0. Generation and gender were considered to evaluate their impact on the type of purchases. Consumers’ data were collected in Chile through 788 face-to-face surveys. The partial least squares approach was used to test the research model.
                  
                  
                    Findings
                    The findings show that optimism and discomfort influence online shopping. Moreover, generation and gender moderate the relationship between the dimensions of the TRI and online purchases.

A long-lasting basin which records these changes corresponds to the Salar de Atacama Basin. Its tectonic history has been blurred by several interpretations of seismic reflection lines and multiple chronostratigraphic correlations between subsurface-surface units. As such, many aspects of its tectonic evolution are still unclear. In this study, we performed an E-W gravimetric profile across the Barros Arana Syncline and the basin. We analyzed interval velocities obtained from seismic reflection studies and reviewed the profiles closest to the gravity survey. Four U-Pb samples for detrital zircon analysis were obtained from Late Cretaceous-Paleogene units. Geophysical data show a segmentation of physical properties within the basin, with denser units and faster interval velocities around the late Mesozoic-early Cenozoic units, and lighter, slower units in the actual salt pan. The main contrast in physical properties is observed in the evaporitic and fine-grained continental deposits of the San Pedro Formation. Geophysical and geological constraints show that its thickness varies between 800 and 1200 m, and that it was deformed during later events. The U-Pb data show that the rocks within the Barros Arana Syncline reach well into the Paleogene, and that they were mainly deformed during the late Eocene Incaic Event, where an east-verging thrust system also involving Permo-Triassic units was developed, establishing the actual structural configuration. The late Oligocene-early Miocene units were then deposited in a post-orogenic setting, with minor compression. A stronger phase around the late Miocene reactivated previous structures and folded these deposits. This continuous, compressive history of the basin, which is mostly a result of the Incaic Event, is in agreement with the regional evolution of the Central Andes.","We would like to thank Empresa Nacional del Petróleo (ENAP) for the access to the seismic sections of the Basin.

Previous studies are basically descriptive, predictive, and not aiming at modeling the real situation. In this paper, we present a preliminary model representing the process of conformation of public opinion from the perspective of opinion mining, by using the Multilevel Fuzzy Cognitive Map (MFCM), which, in turn, is employed to evaluate the quality of the public opinion. This paper examines the capabilities of such model, for both, knowledge description and knowledge extraction about opinions presented in a certain topic, allowing the assessment of the quality of public opinion. This is very valuable for decision making, as well as for social and political analysis. We give special attention to the influence of the media on public opinion, because of its importance in the actual western society. The design of the MFCM, its concepts and relationships, are presented. The concepts describe the relevant aspects from which public opinion emerges, covering the social, technological and biological domains. The results are encouraging: the model permits to identify the media preferred by the public in order to understand better significant matters, including the high esteem that the new communication media hold, in contrast with the little merit that the traditional communication media enjoys, as well as the confidence and credibility in the information sources (from both, new and old media) diminish in time.",Declaration of Competing Interest No author associated with this paper has disclosed any potential or pertinent conflicts which may be perceived to have impending conflict with this work.

We introduce more appropriate dynamical variables that facilitate the study of the equilibrium points of the resulting dynamical system and, in addition, we discuss the dynamics at infinity. We study the qualitative properties of the models with a particular interest in their asymptotic behaviour and whether they admit singularities. We also present a number of new solutions.",G.

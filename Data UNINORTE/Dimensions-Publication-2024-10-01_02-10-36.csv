[1]. The model was configured with a multidomain grid using double-way communication between the hydrodynamic and wave module. The multidomain grids solve faster than single and nested grids because require less grid points to calculate. Also, the double-way communication between the hydrodynamic and wave modules allows to consider the non-linear interactions of wind, waves, tides and currents. Because there are no modelling examples related to multidomain grids in the open access official web site of Delft3d model, this data contributes to increase the availability information of this necessity. Finally, the files of this article are ready to be run in the Delft3D model to perform a sensitivity test recommended in Rueda-Bayona et al.

It is crucial to get diagnosed with time to take preventive measures, especially for patients in locations without proper access to laboratories and medical consultations. This work presented a new methodology to diagnose diseases using data mining that documents all the phases thoroughly for further improvement of the resulting models. We used the methodology to create a new model to diagnose the syndrome without using biochemical variables. We compared similar classification models, using their reported variables and previously obtained data from a study in Colombia. We built a new model and compared it to previous models using the holdout, and random subsampling validation methods to get performance evaluation indicators between the models. Our resulting ANN model used three hidden layers and only Hip Circumference, dichotomous Waist Circumference, and dichotomous blood pressure variables. It gave an Area Under Curve (AUC) of 87.75% by the IDF and 85.12% by HMS MetS diagnosis criteria, higher than previous models. Thanks to our new methodology, diagnosis models can be thoroughly documented for appropriate future comparisons, thus benefiting the diagnosis of the studied diseases.","The first author expresses his deep thanks to the Administrative Department of Science, Technology, and Innovation—COLCIENCIAS of Colombia for the Doctoral scholarship.

Strong evidence from genetic studies indicates that single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) harboured in the ADGRL3 (LPHN3), SNAP25, FGF1, DRD4, and SLC6A2 genes are associated with ADHD. We genotyped 26 SNPs harboured in genes previously reported to be associated with ADHD and evaluated their potential association in 386 individuals belonging to 113 nuclear families from a Caribbean community in Barranquilla, Colombia, using family-based association tests. SNPs rs362990-SNAP25 (T allele; p = 2.46 × 10-4), rs2282794-FGF1 (A allele; p = 1.33 × 10-2), rs2122642-ADGRL3 (C allele, p = 3.5 × 10-2), and ADGRL3 haplotype CCC (markers rs1565902-rs10001410-rs2122642, OR = 1.74, Ppermuted = 0.021) were significantly associated with ADHD. Our results confirm the susceptibility to ADHD conferred by SNAP25, FGF1, and ADGRL3 variants in a community with a significant African American component, and provide evidence supporting the existence of specific patterns of genetic stratification underpinning the susceptibility to ADHD. Knowledge of population genetics is crucial to define risk and predict susceptibility to disease.","We express our highest appreciation to the families enrolled in this study.

A molecular modeling simulation on a dataset of 23 compounds, all of which comply with Lipinski's rules and have a structure analogous to ellipticine, was performed using the quantitative structure activity relationship (QSAR) technique, followed by a detailed docking study on three different proteins significantly involved in this disease (PDB IDs: SYK, PI3K and BTK). As a result, a model with only four descriptors (HOMO, softness, AC1RABAMBID, and TS1KFABMID) was found to be robust enough for prediction of the antileukemia activity of the compounds studied in this work, with an R2 of 0.899 and Q2 of 0.730. A favorable interaction between the compounds and their target proteins was found in all cases; in particular, compounds 9 and 22 showed high activity and binding free energy values of around -10 kcal/mol. Theses compounds were evaluated in detail based on their molecular structure, and some modifications are suggested herein to enhance their biological activity. In particular, compounds 22_1, 22_2, 9_1, and 9_2 are indicated as possible new, potent ellipticine derivatives to be synthesized and biologically tested.",,The authors are grateful with the Instituto of Biomedicina and SINDE-1831-2019 of Universidad Católica Santiago de Guayaquil (UCSG) for the financial support to this research.

If these demands persist, and if there are insufficient resources with which to address them, they will eventually provoke stress. When stress is present for long periods of time, it can lead to academic burnout syndrome, the signs of which are emotional exhaustion, depersonalisation and inadequate personal accomplishment. This paper considers certain sociodemographic factors (age, sex, children, marital status, employment status, degree subject, faculty, academic year) in the identification of a risk profile of developing burnout syndrome. This study is cross-sectional, associative and ex post facto. The Maslach Burnout Inventory-Student Survey was administered to 445 students in the University of Granada. According to the risk profile obtained, first-year male students in Primary Education and Social Education courses are at risk of developing burnout syndrome.",,"This research was funded by the Excellence Research Project P11HUM-77771 (Junta de Andalucía, Spain), the Instituto de las Culturas de la Ciudad Autónoma de Melilla and the University of Granada.",International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health,,,"Adaptation, Psychological; Adolescent; Adult; Burnout, Psychological; Cross-Sectional Studies; Depersonalization; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Risk Assessment; Socioeconomic Factors; Spain; Stress, Psychological; Students; Surveys and Questionnaires; Universities; Young Adult",2019-02-27,2019,2019-02-27,2019-03-01,16,5,707,All OA; Gold,Article,"Aguayo, Raimundo; Cañadas, Gustavo R.; Assbaa-Kaddouri, Latifa; la Fuente, Guillermo A.

The development of molecular techniques able to identify hRSV is one of the current challenges in the field of clinical research.
Objective: To evaluate the ability of an isothermal amplification method to rapidly detect hRSV in children with acute respiratory infection.
Materials and methods: We collected 304 nasopharyngeal swab samples from children with symptoms of acute respiratory infection who attended the emergency unit at Hospital de la Universidad del Norte in Barranquilla from April, 2016, to July, 2017. After extracting viral RNA from the samples, we evaluated the ability of the reverse transcriptase-loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) M assay to rapidly detect hRSVA and hRSVB compared to other molecular techniques: quantitative PCR (qPCR), reverse transcriptase-LAMP L assay, and as a standard, the multiplex nested reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (nested RT-PCR).
Results: The RT-LAMP M assay had a sensitivity of 93.59% and a specificity of 92.92%, and a concordance of 0.83 ± 0.036 as compared with the nested RT-PCR test. While the Kappa index of the RT-LAMP M assay was higher than the values for the RT-LAMP L assay and the qPCR, the values of the latter two methods were in agreement (0.75 ± 0.043 and 0.71 ± 0.045, respectively).
Conclusion: Due to the shorter running times, lower costs and better performance of the RT-LAMP M assay, it can be considered as a useful clinical tool for the detection of RSVA.",,,Biomédica,,,"Child, Preschool; Cross-Sectional Studies; Early Diagnosis; Female; Humans; Infant; Male; Nasopharynx; Nucleic Acid Amplification Techniques; Polymerase Chain Reaction; RNA, Viral; Respiratory Syncytial Virus Infections; Respiratory Syncytial Virus, Human; Sensitivity and Specificity",2019-06-15,2019,2019-06-15,,39,2,415-426,All OA; Gold,Article,"Bettin-Martínez, Alfonso; Villareal-Camacho, José; Cervantes-Acosta, Guillermo; Acosta-Reyes, Jorge; Barbosa, Juliana; San Juan, Homero","Bettin-Martínez, Alfonso (Departamento de Medicina, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia; Posgrado de Microbiología, Universidad Metropolitana, Barranquilla, Colombia); Villareal-Camacho, José (Programa de Medicina, Universidad Libre, Barranquilla, Colombia); Cervantes-Acosta, Guillermo (Departamento de Medicina, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); Acosta-Reyes, Jorge (Departamento de Salud Pública, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); Barbosa, Juliana (Grupo de Virología, Instituto Nacional de Salud, Bogotá, D.C., Colombia); San Juan, Homero (Departamento de Medicina, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia)",,"Bettin-Martínez, Alfonso (Universidad del Norte; Universidad Metropolitana); Villareal-Camacho, José (Free University of Colombia); Cervantes-Acosta, Guillermo (Universidad del Norte); Acosta-Reyes, Jorge (Universidad del Norte); Barbosa, Juliana (Instituto Nacional de Salud); San Juan, Homero (Universidad del Norte)",1,1,,0.24,https://revistabiomedica.org/index.php/biomedica/article/download/4428/4037,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1120953319,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3202 Clinical Sciences; 3207 Medical Microbiology,

We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to investigate the usefulness of sputum Gram stain for defining the etiologic diagnosis of CAP in adult patients.MethodsWe systematically searched the Medline, Embase, Science Direct, Scopus and LILACS databases for full-text articles. Relevant studies were reviewed by at least three investigators who extracted the data, pooled them using a random effects model, and carried out quality assessment. For each bacterium (Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Staphylococcus aureus, and Gram-negative bacilli), pooled sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative likelihood ratios were reported.ResultsAfter a review of 3539 abstracts, 20 articles were included in the present meta-analysis. The studies included yielded 5619 patients with CAP. Pooled sensitivity and pooled specificity of sputum Gram stain were 0.59 (95% CI, 0.56–0.62) and 0.87 (95% CI, 0.86–0.89) respectively for S. pneumoniae, 0.78 (95% CI, 0.72–0.84) and 0.96 (95% CI, 0.94–0.97) for H. influenzae, 0.72 (95% CI, 0.53–0.87) and 0.97 (95% CI, 0.95–0.99) for S. aureus, and 0.64 (95% CI, 0.49–0.77) and 0.99 (95% CI, 0.97–0.99) for Gram-negative bacilli.ConclusionSputum Gram stain test is sensitive and highly specific for identifying the main causative pathogens in adult patients with CAP.Trial registrationThis study has been registered at PROSPERO International prospective register of systematic reviews under registration no.

The objective of this study was to determine the monthly-term association between air pollution and respiratory morbidity in five cities in South Brazil. An ecological time-series study was performed using the municipality as the unit of observation in five cities in South Brazil (Gravataí, Triunfo, Esteio, Canoas, and Charqueadas) between 2013 and 2016. Data for hospital admissions was obtained from the records of the Hospital Information Service. Air pollution data, including PM10, SO2, CO, NO2, and O3 (µg/m3) were obtained from the environmental government agency in Rio Grande do Sul State. Panel multivariable Poisson regression models were adjusted for monthly counts of respiratory hospitalizations. An increase of 10 μg/m3 in the monthly average concentration of PM10 was associated with an increase of respiratory hospitalizations in all age groups, with the maximum effect on the population aged between 16 and 59 years (IRR: Incidence rate ratio 2.04 (95% CI: Confidence interval = 1.97-2.12)). For NO2 and SO2, stronger intermediate-term effects were found in children aged between 6 and 15 years, while for O3 higher effects were found in children under 1 year. This is the first multi-city study conducted in South Brazil to account for intermediate-term effects of air pollutants on respiratory health.","Authors want to acknowledge the Departamento de Informática do Sistema Único de Saúde (DATASUS, Portuguese acronym) and Ministerio de Saúde, from the Government of Brazil, for providing the morbidity data.","This research was funded by CAPES and CNPq (Brazil).

Therefore, the present study aims to explore the relation between school motivation, goal orientation and academic performance in adolescent students.
METHODS: This cross-sectional study was performed on adolescent students (N=3512) from 18 public Secondary Education (ESO) centers. The Scale of School Motivation (EME-S), the Perception of Success Questionnaire (POSQ) and academic performance, quantified by each student's mean mark, were instruments used.
RESULTS: The results revealed significant relations among, on the one hand, intrinsic school motivations, task-oriented goal orientations and academic performance in a more adaptive pattern behavior and, on the other hand, relations between extrinsic motivations and ego-oriented goal orientations. The influence of intrinsic motivations, task-oriented goal orientations and low amotivation indices on predicting academic performance was deduced.

Hybrid compounds 7c-d showed remarkable antifungal activity against Cryptococcus neoformans with a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) value of 15.6 µg/mL. Against other opportunistic fungi such as Candida spp. and Aspergillus spp., these hybrids showed MIC values of 62.5 µg/mL. Regarding their antibacterial activity, all the synthetic hybrids demonstrated little inhibition of Gram-negative bacteria (MIC ≥50 µg/mL), however, hybrid 7b displayed >50% inhibition against Klebsiella pneumoniae at 20 µg/mL and full inhibition at 50 µg/mL. Moreover, this hybrid was shown to be a potent anti-staphylococcal molecule, with a MIC value of 2 µg/mL (5 µM). In addition, hybrid 7h also demonstrated inhibition of Staphylococcus aureus at 20 µg/mL (47 µM). Hybrids 7a and 7b were the most potent against Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv with MIC values of 20 and 10 µg/mL (46 and 24 µM), respectively. The 7b hybrid demonstrated high selectivity in killing S. aureus and M. tuberculosis H37Rv in comparison with mammalian cells (SI >20), and thus it can be considered a hit molecule for mechanism of action studies and the exploration of related chemical space.","The authors gratefully acknowledge financial support from COLCIENCIAS, Universidad del Valle, Universidad del Norte.

It depends on several parameters for the solution, which in general are defined arbitrarily or based on the literature. In this work the influence of the optimization parameters applied to the design of periodic cellular materials were studied. Different filtering schemes, penalization factors, initial guesses, mesh sizes, and optimization solvers were tested. In the obtained results, it was observed that using the Method of Moving Asymptotes (MMA) can be achieved feasible convergent solutions for a large amount of parameters combinations, in comparison, to the global convergent method of moving asymptotes (GCMMA) and optimality criteria. The cases of studies showed that the most robust filtering schemes were the sensitivity average and Helmholtz partial differential equation based filter, compared to the Heaviside projection. The choice of the initial guess demonstrated to be a determining factor in the final topologies obtained.","The author would like to acknowledge to the Universidad del Norte and the Departamento Administrativo de Ciencia, Tecnología e Innovación (Colciencias) for the support given within the framework of the Ph.D. National Scholarship Colciencias N 647-2015.

The aim of the present study was to explore whether an association exists between Carnival in Barranquilla, Colombia, and an increase in homicides in the city. We used mortality records to identify the number of daily homicides of men and women throughout the week of Carnival, and we compared those with records from all of standard days between 1 January 2005 and 31 December 2015. Conditional fixed-effects models were used, stratified by time and adjusted by weather variables. The average number of homicides on Carnival days was found to be higher than on a standard day, with an OR of 2.34 (CI 95%: 1.19-4.58) for the occurrence of at least one male homicide per day during Carnival, and 1.22 (CI 95%: 1.22-7.36) for female homicides, adjusted by weather variables. The occurrence of homicides during Carnival was observed and was similar to findings for other holidays. Given that violence is a multifactorial phenomenon, the identification of the factors involved serves as a basis for evaluating whether current strategies have a positive effect on controlling it.",,This research received no external funding.,International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health,,,Cities; Colombia; Female; Holidays; Homicide; Humans; Male; Time Factors; Violence; Weather,2019-12-19,2019,2019-12-19,2020-01-01,17,1,35,All OA; Gold,Article,"Guarin-Ardila, Jhon Albert; Montero-Ariza, Rossycela; Astudillo-García, Claudia Iveth; Fernández-Niño, Julián Alfredo","Guarin-Ardila, Jhon Albert (Facultad de Medicina, Fundación Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla 081007, Colombia;, ajguarin@uninorte.edu.co, (J.A.G.-A.);, rossycelam@uninorte.edu.co, (R.M.-A.)); Montero-Ariza, Rossycela (Facultad de Medicina, Fundación Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla 081007, Colombia;, ajguarin@uninorte.edu.co, (J.A.G.-A.);, rossycelam@uninorte.edu.co, (R.M.-A.)); Astudillo-García, Claudia Iveth (Servicios de Atención Psiquiátrica, Secretaría de Salud, Ciudad de Mexico 11410, Mexico); Fernández-Niño, Julián Alfredo (Departamento de Salud Pública, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla 081007, Colombia;, aninoj@uninorte.edu.co)","Astudillo-García, Claudia Iveth (Secretaria de Salud)","Guarin-Ardila, Jhon Albert (Universidad del Norte); Montero-Ariza, Rossycela (Universidad del Norte); Astudillo-García, Claudia Iveth (Secretaria de Salud); Fernández-Niño, Julián Alfredo (Universidad del Norte)",1,0,0.13,0.24,https://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/17/1/35/pdf?version=1576743800,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1123563214,42 Health Sciences; 4206 Public Health,"16 Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions"

Therefore, the objective of this study was to assess the antibiotic resistance of airborne viable bacteria for different sizes (0.65-7 µm) in private-style and public-style neonatal intensive care units (NICU). Airborne bacteria concentrations were assessed by a six-stage Andersen impactor, operating at 28.3 L/min. Public-style NICU revealed higher concentrations of airborne viable bacteria (53.00 to 214.37 CFU/m3) than private-style NICU (151.94-466.43), indicating a possible threat to health. In the public-style NICU, Staphylococcus was the highest bacterial genera identified in the present study, were Staphylococcus saprophyticus and Staphylococcus epidermidis predominated, especially in the second bronchi and alveoli size ranges. Alloiococcus otitidis, Bacillus subtiles, Bacillus thuringiensis, Kocuria rosea, and Pseudomonas pseudoalcaligene, were identified in the alveoli size range. In NICU#2, eight species were identified in the alveoli size range: Bacillus cereus, Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus thuringiensis, Eikenella corrodens, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Streptococcus gordoni. Multi-drug-resistant organisms (MDROs) were found in both of the NICUs. Bacillus cereus strains were resistant to Ampicillin, Cefoxitin, Ceftaroline, and Penicillin G. Staphylococcus cohnii ssp. cohnii was resistant in parallel to ampicillin and G penicillin. Staphylococcus saprophyticus strains were resistant to Ampicillin, Penicillin G, Oxaxilin, and Erythromycin. Results may indicate a potential threat to human health due to the airborne bacteria concentration and their antibiotic resistance ability. The results may provide evidence for the need of interventions to reduce indoor airborne particle concentrations and their transfer to premature infants with underdeveloped immune systems, even though protocols for visitors and cleaning are well-established.","Special mention to environmental engineering students: Ericka Arbelaez, Wilson Guerrero, Andres De La Cruz, and Mary Imitola.",This research was funded by Universidad de la Costa and Universidad Metropolitana.

The new configuration consists of two turbines operating at two different working pressures with a low-heat source temperature, below 150 °C. A comprehensive analysis was conducted to determine the effect of key operation parameters such as ammonia mass fraction at the absorber outlet and boiler-rectifier, on the power output, cooling capacity, effective first efficiency, and effective exergy efficiency, while the performance of the dual-pressure configuration was compared with the original single pressure cycle. In addition, a Pareto optimization with a genetic algorithm was conducted to obtain the best power and cooling output combinations to maximize effective first law efficiency. Results showed that the new dual-pressure configuration generated more power than the single pressure cycle, by producing up to 327.8 kW, while the single pressure cycle produced up to 110.8 kW at a 150 °C boiler temperature. However, the results also showed that it reduced the cooling output as there was less mass flow rate in the refrigeration unit. Optimization results showed that optimum effective first law efficiency ranged between 9.1% and 13.7%. The maximum effective first law efficiency at the lowest net power (32 kW) and cooling (0.38 kW) outputs was also shown. On the other hand, it presented 13.6% effective first law efficiency when the net power output was 100 kW and the cooling capacity was 0.38 kW.","This paper received administrative support from Universidad del Norte by the PhD scholarship Contract UN-OJ-2013-22062, and the Colombian Administrative Department of Science and Technology (Colciencias) Scholarship No. 727 of 2015.",This research received no external funding.,Entropy,,,,2019-07-20,2019,2019-07-20,,21,7,711,All OA; Gold,Article,"Guzmán, Gustavo; De Los Reyes, Lucía; Noriega, Eliana; Ramírez, Hermes; Bula, Antonio; Fontalvo, Armando","Guzmán, Gustavo (Department of Mechanical Engineering, Universidad Autónoma del Caribe, Barranquilla 080020, Colombia); De Los Reyes, Lucía (AST Ingeniería SAS, Barranquilla 080001, Colombia); Noriega, Eliana (Department of Energy, Universidad de la Costa, Barranquilla 080002, Colombia); Ramírez, Hermes (Department of Mechanical Engineering, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla 081007, Colombia); Bula, Antonio (Department of Mechanical Engineering, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla 081007, Colombia); Fontalvo, Armando (Research School of Electrical, Mechanical and Materials Engineering, The Australian National University, Acton, ACT 2600, Australia)","Guzmán, Gustavo (Universidad Autónoma del Caribe)","Guzmán, Gustavo (Universidad Autónoma del Caribe); De Los Reyes, Lucía (AST Ingeniería SAS, Barranquilla 080001, Colombia); Noriega, Eliana (University of the Coast); Ramírez, Hermes (Universidad del Norte); Bula, Antonio (Universidad del Norte); Fontalvo, Armando (Australian National University)",5,3,,,https://www.mdpi.com/1099-4300/21/7/711/pdf?version=1563614793,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1119743751,49 Mathematical Sciences; 51 Physical Sciences,7 Affordable and Clean Energy

METHODS: DEMOJUAN was a randomized controlled trial conducted in Juan Mina and Barranquilla, Northern Colombia. Eligible participants were randomized into one of three groups (control group, initial nutritional intervention, and initial physical activity intervention). The duration of the intervention was 24 months. The main study outcome in the present analysis was reversion to normoglycemia. Relative risks and their corresponding 95% confidence intervals were calculated for reversal to normoglycemia and T2D incidence.
RESULTS: There was no statistically significant association between the intervention groups and reversion to normoglycemia. The relative risk of reversion to normoglycemia was 0.88 (95% CI 0.70-1.12) for the initial nutritional intervention group participants and 0.95 (95% CI 0.75-1.20) for the initial physical activity intervention group participants.

Here we present a report on ZikaPLAN`s mid-term achievements since its initiation in October 2016 to June 2019, illustrating the research objectives of the 15 work packages ranging from virology, diagnostics, entomology and vector control, modelling to clinical cohort studies in pregnant women and neonates, as well as studies on the neurological complications of Zika infections in adolescents and adults. For example, the Neuroviruses Emerging in the Americas Study (NEAS) has set up more than 10 clinical sites in Colombia. Through the Butantan Phase 3 dengue vaccine trial, we have access to samples of 17,000 subjects in 14 different geographic locations in Brazil. To address the lack of access to clinical samples for diagnostic evaluation, ZikaPLAN set up a network of quality sites with access to well-characterized clinical specimens and capacity for independent evaluations. The International Committee for Congenital Anomaly Surveillance Tools was formed with global representation from regional networks conducting birth defects surveillance. We have collated a comprehensive inventory of resources and tools for birth defects surveillance, and developed an App for low resource regions facilitating the coding and description of all major externally visible congenital anomalies including congenital Zika syndrome. Research Capacity Network (REDe) is a shared and open resource centre where researchers and health workers can access tools, resources and support, enabling better and more research in the region. Addressing the gap in research capacity in LMICs is pivotal in ensuring broad-based systems to be prepared for the next outbreak. Our shared and open research space through REDe will be used to maximize the transfer of research into practice by summarizing the research output and by hosting the tools, resources, guidance and recommendations generated by these studies. Leveraging on the research from this consortium, we are working towards a research preparedness network.","We acknowledge all our consortium members and their institutions, as listed above, and we are thankful to many other institutional staff members (all the administrators and financial managers) who participate and support the implementation of the ZikaPLAN project in different capacities. We are grateful to our Scientific Advisory Board members (Duane Gubler, James Sejvar, Herman Goossens) and Ethics Advisory Committee member (Anna Durbin) for their timely support and guidance at various stages of the project so far. We appreciate our collaborative work with ZIKAction (Grant Agreement No. 734857) and ZIKAlliance (Grant Agreement No. 734548) which allows advancing common efforts and strengthening the research output.

We addressed this question for termite assemblages from tropical dry forests in Colombia. These forests are endangered and poorly understood ecosystems and termites are important ecosystem engineers in the tropics. Using biodiversity and environmental data, combined with phylogenetic community analyses, trait mapping, and stable isotopes studies, we investigated the termite community composition of three protected dry forests in Colombia. Our data suggest that the structuring mechanisms differed between sites. Phylogenetic overdispersion of termite assemblages correlated with decreasing rainfall and elevation and increasing temperature. Food niche traits-classified as feeding groups and quantified by δ15N‰ and δ13C‰ isotope signatures-were phylogenetically conserved. Hence, the overdispersion pattern implies increasing interspecific competition with decreasing drier and warmer conditions, which is also supported by fewer species occurring at the driest site. Our results are in line with a hypothesis that decreased biomass production limits resource availability for termites, which leads to competition. Along with this comes a diet shift: termites from drier plots had higher δ13C signatures, reflecting higher δ13C values in the litter and more C4 plants. Our study shows how a phylogenetic community approach combined with trait analyses can contribute to gaining the first insights into mechanisms structuring whole termite assemblages.",We are also grateful to the National Agency of Environmental Licenses for research permit no. 739/ANLA/MADS (8 July 2014) and the Natural Parks Unit research permit 005/PNNC/ANLA/MADS (10 July 2015).

Yet they are often difficult to identify due to the lack of reliable species-specific morphological traits for many species, which hampers ecological research. Recently, termitologists working with West African termites (West African Termite Taxonomy Initiative) convened for a workshop with the aim of beginning to address this problem. Repeated determination of the same termite samples by the most renowned taxonomists for West African termites identified the huge scale of the problem, as less than 10% of all species could be unambiguously determined to the species level. Intensive discussions and comparisons increased the identification success to around 25% at the end of the workshop. Yet many groups remained problematic and molecular markers and barcoding techniques combined with species delimitation approaches will be needed to help resolve these existing taxonomic problems. Based on the outcome of this workshop, we propose concerted initiatives to address termite taxonomy on a global scale. We are convinced that dedicated workshops on regional taxonomy that follow a similar structured approach, with repeated determination of the same sample, will help overcome the difficulties that termite taxonomy faces. This initiative can also serve as a blueprint for other taxonomical groups that are difficult to identify.",,We thank the DFG (German Research Foundation) for funding the workshop (KO1895/24-1).,Insects,,,,2019-01-16,2019,2019-01-16,,10,1,32,All OA; Gold,Article,"Korb, Judith; Kasseney, Boris D.; Cakpo, Yvonne Tété; Daza, Robin H.

PARTICIPANTS AND METHODS: Twenty individuals were selected and distributed into two groups. The experimental group (CP group) comprised ten individuals with a medical diagnosis of CP, and ten individuals with typical development (sex- and age-matched) composed the control group (TD group). Both groups followed the same intervention protocol, which included a virtual coincident timing task: the participants performed upper limb movements in front of a computer's webcam and interacted with the task with the aim of virtually intercepting spheres that fell in four rows following the rhythm of a pre-selected song during an 8-minute period. To verify the influence on a real task, pre- and posttests were performed in a similar task, but with physical contact (using the spacebar on the keyboard of a computer). To analyze the data, we evaluated the variable, constant, and absolute errors during the task and in the pre- and posttests.
RESULTS: The results showed that there was an improvement in performance between the pre- and posttests; that is, after practicing the task in an environment without physical contact, there was a performance improvement in posttests in the real task, but only for the CP group. Moreover, there were significant differences in precision and accuracy between the two groups, with worse performance in the CP group.
CONCLUSION: Individuals with CP presented better performance in the real task after practice in a virtual reality task, albeit with worse performance compared with individuals with TD. This is an interesting result that supports the possible use of virtual tasks for the rehabilitation of individuals with CP.","The authors would like to acknowledge Ian de Araújo Barros, Maithê Blaya Leite, Fyamma Rillari Trajana Beiruth, Ingrid Guimarães Brandão, Jéssica Raiany Silva Duarte, Leyryana Conceição de Oliveira, Kássia Hianara Sena de Oliveira, and Laysa Cristina Moreira dos Santos for assistance with data collection for this research.

In 2012, the World Diabetes Foundation provided financing project in Barranquilla (Colombia), aimed to implement a clinical guide for the diagnosis and treatment of this condition.
AIM: To estimate the adherence of the guide in primary care centers.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: A Cross-sectional study of pregnant women suspected of having gestational diabetes. Pregnant women were classified according to the week of admission to the prenatal control program: < week 24 or later. Women with a fasting blood glucose over 92 mg/dL and under 126 mg/dL or with some positive result to the oral glucose tolerance test were included.
RESULTS: Nine percent (1,887 women) of 21,699 registries of pregnant women, were at risk for gestational diabetes. Of these, 1,880 registries with complete data were analyzed. Sixty nine entered the program at less than 24 weeks of pregnancy and 71% had had a fasting blood glucose measured in the first control. In 69.2% of these women, criteria for gestational diabetes was met. A glucose tolerance test was suggested to women with a blood glucose below 92 mg/dl. Among 72% of the latter, the glucose tolerance test met the criteria for gestational diabetes. Among the 498 women who entered the program after 24 weeks of gestation, 68% met the criteria for gestational diabetes with the fasting blood glucose levels. In 90 women, a glucose tolerance test was performed and 80% met the criteria for gestational diabetes.

The distribution of this single nucleotide polymorphism and its association with the phenotype depend on the genetic background of each population.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the distribution of single nucleotide polymorphism rs693 and its association with lipid profile and body mass index in a sample of Colombian Caribbeans.
METHODS: 108 non-related adult subjects of both gender were included in this study. Body mass index and lipid profile that included total cholesterol, triglycerides, Low Density Lipoprotein and High Density Lipoprotein were determined. The single nucleotide polymorphism rs693 was determined by Polymerase Chain Reaction/Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism from genomic DNA followed by digestion with the restriction enzyme XbaI. The chi-square test was used to analyze the genotype distribution of rs693 and the genotype-phenotype association was evaluated through different inheritance model.
RESULTS: The genotype frequencies for single nucleotide polymorphism rs693 were CC (45.0%), TT (16.5%) and CT (38.5%). The allele frequencies were C (64.0%) and T (36.0%). The single nucleotide polymorphism was in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium in the studied sample. No association of the single nucleotide polymorphism rs693 with lipid profile nor the body mass index was found (p >0.05).
CONCLUSION: There is no significant association between single nucleotide polymorphism rs693 and body mass index nor lipid profile, in a sample of Colombian Caribbeans.","The authors extend their thanks to Laboratorio Clínico Continental from Barranquilla, Colombia, for the determination of tests lipid profile.

To identify miRNA dysregulation in SLE, we used miR2Disease and PhenomiR for information about miRNAs exhibiting differential regulation in disease and other biological processes, and HMDD for information about experimentally supported human miRNA-disease association data from genetics, epigenetics, circulating miRNAs, and miRNA-target interactions. This information was incorporated into the miRNA analysis. High-throughput sequencing revealed circulating miRNAs associated with kidney damage in patients with SLE. As the main finding of our in silico analysis of miRNAs differentially expressed in SLE and their interactions with disease-susceptibility genes, post-translational modifications, and transcription factors; we highlight 226 miRNAs associated with genes and processes. Moreover, we highlight that alterations of miRNAs such as hsa-miR-30a-5p, hsa-miR-16-5p, hsa-miR-142-5p, and hsa-miR-324-3p are most commonly associated with post-translational modifications. In addition, altered miRNAs that are most frequently associated with susceptibility-related genes are hsa-miR-16-5p, hsa-miR-374a-5p, hsa-miR-34a-5p, hsa-miR-31-5p, and hsa-miR-1-3p.","We declare that the funds or sources of support received in this specific internal report study of Simón Bolívar University, Barranquilla, Colombia, and external funding by the Administrative Department of Science, Technology and Innovation of Colombia - COLCIENCIAS, subsidy 125380763038 to ENQ and 125380763188 to GAM.

In order to contribute evidence to this still unresolved question, the objective of the present study was to evaluate the association between air quality and daily suicides registered in Mexico City (MC) between 2000 and 2016. Air quality was measured based on exposure to particulate matter under 2.5 and 10 micrometers (µm) (PM2.5 and PM10, respectively), ozone (O3), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and sulfur dioxide (SO2), adjusting for weather variables (air temperature and relative humidity), and holidays. To this end, an ecologic time series analysis was performed using a Poisson regression model conditioned by time and stratified by gender and age groups. Models were also generated to explore the lagged and accumulative effects of air pollutants, adjusted by weather variables. The effects of the pollutants were very close to the null value in the majority of the models, and no accumulative effects were identified. We believe these results, in this case, no evidence of a statistical association, contribute to the current debate about whether the association between air pollution and suicide reported in the scientific literature reflects an actual effect or an uncontrolled confounding effect.",The authors thank the valuable contributions of Beatriz Paulina Vázquez Jaime to the discussion of the results.,This research received no external funding.,International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health,,,Cities; Female; Humans; Male; Mexico; Nitrogen Dioxide; Ozone; Particulate Matter; Suicide; Sulfur Dioxide; Temperature; Time Factors; Weather,2019-08-01,2019,2019-08-18,2019-08-01,16,16,2971,All OA; Gold,Article,"Astudillo-García, Claudia Iveth; Rodríguez-Villamizar, Laura Andrea; Cortez-Lugo, Marlene; la Cruz, Julio César Cruz-De; Fernández-Niño, Julián Alfredo","Astudillo-García, Claudia Iveth (Servicios de Atención Psiquiátrica, Secretaría de Salud, Ciudad de México 11410, Mexico); Rodríguez-Villamizar, Laura Andrea (Departamento de Salud Pública, Escuela de Medicina, Universidad Industrial de Santander, Bucaramanga 680002, Colombia); Cortez-Lugo, Marlene (Dirección de Salud Ambiental, Centro de Investigación en Salud Poblacional, Instituto Nacional de Salud Pública, Cuernavaca 62100, Mexico); la Cruz, Julio César Cruz-De (Dirección de Salud Ambiental, Centro de Investigación en Salud Poblacional, Instituto Nacional de Salud Pública, Cuernavaca 62100, Mexico); Fernández-Niño, Julián Alfredo (Departamento de Salud Pública, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla 081007, Colombia)","Fernández-Niño, Julián Alfredo (Universidad del Norte)","Astudillo-García, Claudia Iveth (Secretaria de Salud); Rodríguez-Villamizar, Laura Andrea (Industrial University of Santander); Cortez-Lugo, Marlene (Instituto Nacional de Salud Pública); la Cruz, Julio César Cruz-De (Instituto Nacional de Salud Pública); Fernández-Niño, Julián Alfredo (Universidad del Norte)",27,14,1.43,3.72,https://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/16/16/2971/pdf?version=1566120053,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1120409759,37 Earth Sciences; 3701 Atmospheric Sciences; 41 Environmental Sciences; 4105 Pollution and Contamination; 42 Health Sciences; 4202 Epidemiology,11 Sustainable Cities and Communities

This requires a series of water treatment processes which require investment. However, the economic limitations of rural communities hinder their ability to implement such water-treatment systems, as is the case in Ciénaga Grande of Santa Marta (""Large Swamp"", in English) in Colombia. Low-cost systems can be used instead as simple and safe alternatives. Therefore, the objective of this work was to evaluate non-conventional, low-cost water processes to purify the water from the collection point of two stilt house villages in Ciénaga Grande of Santa Marta. These include: 1) Using two natural coagulants, Moringa Oleifera and Cassia Fistula; 2) filtration through a biosand filter and a carbon activated filter; and 3) disinfection through UV-C Radiation and through solar disinfection. The results showed a turbidity values reduction between 52% and 96% using the two natural coagulants; both turbidity and total coliforms achieved reductions of 98.4% and 76.9%, respectively in the filtration process; and removal of total coliforms up to 98.8% in the disinfection process.

Within the CDSSs, we can find Fuzzy inference systems. For the reasons above, the objective of this study was to design, to implement, and to validate a methodology for developing data-driven Mamdani-type fuzzy clinical decision support systems using clusters and pivot tables. For validating the proposed methodology, we applied our algorithms on five public datasets including Wisconsin, Coimbra breast cancer, wart treatment (Immunotherapy and cryotherapy), and caesarian section, and compared them with other related works (Literature). The results show that the Kappa Statistics and accuracies were close to 1.0% and 100%, respectively for each output variable, which shows better accuracy than some literature results. The proposed framework could be considered as a deep learning technique because it is composed of various processing layers to learn representations of data with multiple levels of abstraction.","The first author expresses his deep thanks to the Administrative Department of Science, Technology, and Innovation—COLCIENCIAS of Colombia and the Universidad del Norte for the Doctoral scholarship.

Variants in the ADGRL3 (LPHN3) gene predispose to ADHD and predict ADHD severity, disruptive behaviors comorbidity, long-term outcome, and response to treatment. In this study, we investigated whether variants within ADGRL3 are associated with SUD, a disorder that is frequently co-morbid with ADHD. Using family-based, case-control, and longitudinal samples from disparate regions of the world (n = 2698), recruited either for clinical, genetic epidemiological or pharmacogenomic studies of ADHD, we assembled recursive-partitioning frameworks (classification tree analyses) with clinical, demographic, and ADGRL3 genetic information to predict SUD susceptibility. Our results indicate that SUD can be efficiently and robustly predicted in ADHD participants. The genetic models used remained highly efficient in predicting SUD in a large sample of individuals with severe SUD from a psychiatric institution that were not ascertained on the basis of ADHD diagnosis, thus identifying ADGRL3 as a risk gene for SUD. Recursive-partitioning analyses revealed that rs4860437 was the predominant predictive variant. This new methodological approach offers novel insights into higher order predictive interactions and offers a unique opportunity for translational application in the clinical assessment of patients at high risk for SUD.","First and foremost, we thank all the patients who participated in this study.

The objective of this study was to describe the demographics and clinical characteristics of suspected chikungunya cases. Chikungunya infection was confirmed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and 548 patients where included in the study. Of these patients, 295 were positive for antibodies against chikungunya (53.8%), and 27.6% (151/295) were symptomatic for chikungunya infection, with a symptomatic:asymptomatic ratio of 1.04:1. Factors associated with infection included low income and low socio-economic strata (odds ratio [OR]: 1.8; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.0-3.2, p = 0.003 and OR: 2.1; CI: 1.3-3.4, p = 0.002, respectively). Confirmed symptomatic cases were associated with symmetric arthritis (OR: 11.7; CI: 6.0-23.0, p < 0.001) of ankles (OR: 8.5; CI: 3.5-20.9, p < 0.001), hands (OR: 8.5; CI: 3.5-20.9, p < 0.001), feet (OR: 6.5; CI: 2.8-15.3, p < 0.001), and wrists (OR: 17.3; CI: 2.3-130.5, p < 0.001). Our study showed that poverty is associated with chikungunya infection. Public health strategies to prevent and control chikungunya should focus on poorer communities that are more vulnerable to infection. The rate of asymptomatic infections among confirmed cases was 48.8%. However, those with symptoms displayed a characteristic rheumatic clinical picture, which could help differentiate chikungunya infection from other endemic viral diseases.",The authors would like to thank the patients for their patience and support.,"The study was supported by the Colombian Rheumatology Association (Asociación Colombiana de Reumatología – ASOREUMA) [grant number Acta 169 10th July 2015]; Universidad de La Sabana [grant number MED-197-2015]; and Departamento Administrativo de Ciencia, Tecnología e Innovación (COLCIENCIAS) doctoral scholarship [grant number 757-2016].",Emerging Microbes & Infections,,,"Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Antibodies, Viral; Chikungunya Fever; Chikungunya virus; Cities; Cohort Studies; Colombia; Cross-Sectional Studies; Demography; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Young Adult",2019-01,2019,2019-10-21,2019-01,8,1,1490-1500,All OA; Gold,Article,"Rueda, Juan C.; Santos, Ana M.; Angarita, Jose-Ignacio; Giraldo, Rodrigo B.; Saldarriaga, Eugenia-Lucia; Muñoz, Jesús Giovanny Ballesteros; Forero, Elías; Valencia, Hugo; Somoza, Francisco; Martin-Arsanios, Daniel; Quintero, Elias-Josué; Reyes-Martinez, Viviana; Padilla, Diana; Cuervo, Francy M.; Peláez-Ballestas, Ingris; Cardiel, Mario H.; Pavía, Paula X.; Londono, John","Rueda, Juan C.

Thus, models are needed to assist rabbit producers in decision-making to maintain the production environment within the zone of thermoneutrality for the animals. The aim of this paper is to develop decision trees to predict the physiological responses of rabbits based on environmental variables. The experiment was performed in a rabbit house with 26 rabbits at eight weeks of age. The experimental database is composed of 546 observed data points. Sixty decision tree models for the prediction of respiratory rate (RR, mov.min-1) and ear temperature (ET, °C) of rabbits exposed to different combinations of dry bulb temperature (tdb, °C) and relative humidity (RH, %) were developed. The ET model exhibited better statistical indices than the RR model. The developed decision trees can be used in practical situations to provide a rapid evaluation of rabbit welfare conditions based on environmental variables and physiological responses. This information can be obtained in real time and may help rabbit breeders in decision-making to provide satisfactory environmental conditions for rabbits.","The authors would like to thank the Federal University of Lavras, where the experiment was performed.

METHODS: Thirty-four Zika virus-associated GBS cases were assessed a median of 17 months following acute GBS illness. We assessed demographics, results of Overall Disability Sum Scores (ODSS), Hughes Disability Score (HDS), Zung Depression Scale (ZDS), and Health Related Quality of Life (HRQL) questionnaires; and compared outcomes indices with a normative sample of neighborhood-selected control subjects in Barranquilla without GBS.
RESULTS: Median age at time of acute neurologic onset was 49 years (range, 10-80); 17 (50%) were male. No deaths occurred. At long-term follow-up, 25 (73%) patients had a HDS 0-1, indicating complete / near complete recovery. Among the group, HDS (mean 1.4, range 0-4), ODSS (mean 1.9, range 0-9) and ZDS score (mean 34.4, range 20-56) indicated mild / moderate ongoing disability. Adjusting for age and sex, Zika virus-associated GBS cases were similar to a population comparison group (n = 368) in Barranquilla without GBS in terms of prevalence of physical or mental health complaints, though GBS patients were more likely to have an ODSS of ≥ 1 (OR 8.8, 95% CI 3.2-24.5) and to suffer from moderate / moderate-severe depression (OR 3.89, 95% CI 1.23-11.17) than the comparison group.
CONCLUSIONS: Long-term outcomes of Zika virus-associated GBS are consistent with those associated with other antecedent antigenic stimuli in terms of mortality and ongoing long-term morbidity, as published in the literature. Persons with Zika virus-associated GBS more frequently reported disability and depression after approximately one year compared with those without GBS.","The author(s) received no specific funding for this work.

Little knowledge is available about them in Togo, especially ants. This study aimed to find out how ants and termites could be used to assess the restoration of former agricultural land. These insect groups were sampled within six transects of 50 × 2 m2 (using pitfall traps, monoliths, baits for ants and hand sampling for termites) in two consecutive habitats: open area (grassland) and covered area (an artificial forest). Seventeen termite species and 43 ant species were collected. Seven ant species were specific to the covered area against four for the open area, while four unshared species of termite were found in the open area against three in the covered area. The presence of unshared species was linked to vegetation, as Trinervitermes (Holmgren, 1912), a grass feeding termite, was solely found in open area. Also, for some ant species like Cataulacus traegaordhi (Santschi, 1914), Crematogaster (Lund, 1831) species, Oecophylla longinoda (Latreille, 1802) and Tetraponera mocquerysi (Brown, 1960), all arboreal species, vegetation was a determining factor for their presence. The occurrence of these species together with Basidentitermes mactus (Sjöstedt, 1911), Strumigenys bernardi (Brown, 1960) and S. sistrura (Bolton, 1983), suggest a more advanced level of restoration of the covered area.","We are very grateful to Maurice Lombart Kouakou (Station d’écologie de Lamto, Université Nangui Abrogoua, Côte d’Ivoire) and Robin Cassala Daza (Departamento de Química y Biología, Universidad del Norte, Kilómetro 5 Antigua vía Puerto Colombia, 081007-Puerto Colombia, Colombia) for their assistance respectively in ant and termite species identification.

In this study, we assessed the association between religious affiliation and major depressive episode (MDE) in older adults (> = 60 years) from China, Ghana, India, Mexico, Russia and South Africa.MethodsWe conducted a secondary analysis of data from the Study on global Ageing and adult health (SAGE), with six nationally-representative community-based samples (n = 21,410). Religious affiliation was self-reported by participants, and we defined MDE based on ICD-10 classification. We estimated the association of MDE with religious affiliation versus no religious affiliation, and minority versus majority affiliation.ResultsWe observed no association between having a religious affiliation (vs. no affiliation) and the odds of MDE in older adults. In most cases minorities had higher odds of MDE as compared with the majority religion, but the associations were only significant for Muslims in Ghana and for Muslims, Hindus and Other in South Africa.ConclusionsWhile the results were significant only for two countries, we observed higher odds of MDE among minorities in most of them. Older adults who are members of religious minorities might be at risk for mental health problems, and there is a need for public health interventions aimed at them.",Not applicable.,"The conception, analysis and report of this work were conducted without funding.",BMC Public Health,,,"Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Cross-Sectional Studies; Depressive Disorder, Major; Factor Analysis, Statistical; Female; Humans; Male; Mental Health; Middle Aged; Minority Groups; Religion and Psychology; Self Report; Socioeconomic Factors",2019-04-30,2019,2019-04-30,2019-12,19,1,460,All OA; Gold,Article,"Fernández-Niño, Julian A.; Bojorquez, Ietza; Becerra-Arias, Carolina; Astudillo-Garcia, Claudia I.","Fernández-Niño, Julian A.

The evidence supporting this, however, is inconsistent. Ecologic studies in particular suggest more severe outcomes from influenza infection during pregnancy than studies based on individual patient data. Individual studies however may be underpowered and, as reported in a previous systematic review, confounding factors could not be adjusted for. We therefore conducted an individual participant data meta-analysis to assess the risk for severe outcomes of influenza infection in pregnant women while adjusting for other prognostic factors.MethodsWe contacted authors of studies included in a recently published systematic review. We pooled the individual participant data of women of reproductive age and laboratory confirmation of influenza virus infection. We used a generalized linear mixed model and reported odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI).ResultsA total of 33 datasets with data on 186,656 individuals were available, including 36,498 eligible women of reproductive age and known pregnancy status. In the multivariable model, pregnancy was associated with a 7 times higher risk of hospital admission (OR 6.80, 95%CI 6.02–7.68), among patients receiving medical care as in- or outpatients, pregnancy was associated with a lower risk of admission to intensive care units (ICU; OR 0.57, 95%CI 0.48–0.69), and was not significantly associated with death (OR 1.00, 95%CI 0.75–1.34).ConclusionsOur study found a higher risk of influenza associated hospitalization among pregnant women as compared to non-pregnant women. We did not find a higher mortality rate or higher likelihood of ICU admission among pregnant women who sought medical care. However, this study did not address whether a true community based cohort of pregnant women is at higher risk of influenza associated complications.","The authors from Ministry of Health, Singapore, would like to thank Prof Kenneth Kwek and A/Prof Bernard Chern from KK Women’s and Children’s Hospital, Singapore, Prof Eu Leong Yong and Prof Arijit Biswas from National University Hospital, Singapore, A/Prof Tan Hak Koon and Dr. Devendra Kanagalingam from Singapore General Hospital for agreeing to the use of individual participants data for this study.

The proposed architecture consists of two wearable sensors: one for motion, and another for heart rate. The system employs machine learning algorithms to determine the activity performed by a user, and takes a concept from ergonomics, the Frimat's score, to compute the corresponding physical workload from measured heart rate values providing in addition a qualitative description of the workload. A random forest activity classifier is trained and validated with data from nine subjects, achieving an accuracy of 97.5%. Then, tests with 20 subjects show the reliability of the activity classifier, which keeps an accuracy up to 92% during real-time testing. Additionally, a single-subject twenty-day physical workload tracking case study evinces the system capabilities to detect body adaptation to a custom exercise routine.

These can be combined with wet lab experiments for a rational search. Improved, point-of-care diagnostic tests for visceral leishmaniasis (VL), early case detection and surveillance are required. Previous investigations demonstrated the potential of IgG1 as a biomarker for monitoring clinical status in rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs), although using a crude lysate antigen (CLA) as capturing antigen. Replacing the CLA by specific antigens would lead to more robust RDTs.
METHODOLOGY: Immunoblots revealed L. donovani protein bands detected by IgG1 from VL patients. Upon confident identification of these antigens by mass spectrometry (MS), we searched for evidence of constitutive protein expression and presence of antigenic domains or high accessibility to B-cells. Selected candidates had their linear epitopes mapped with in silico algorithms. Multiple high-scoring predicted epitopes from the shortlisted proteins were screened in peptide arrays. The most promising candidate was tested in RDT prototypes using VL and nonendemic healthy control (NEHC) patient sera.
RESULTS: Over 90% of the proteins identified from the immunoblots did not satisfy the selection criteria and were excluded from the downstream epitope mapping. Screening of predicted epitope peptides from the shortlisted proteins identified the most reactive, for which the sensitivity for IgG1 was 84% (95% CI 60-97%) with Sudanese VL sera on RDT prototypes. None of the sera from NEHCs were positive.
CONCLUSION: We employed in silico searches to reduce drastically the output of wet lab experiments, focusing on promising candidates containing selected protein features. By predicting epitopes in silico we screened a large number of peptides using arrays, identifying the most promising one, for which IgG1 sensitivity and specificity, with limited sample size, supported this proof of concept strategy for diagnostics discovery, which can be applied to the development of more robust IgG1 RDTs for monitoring clinical status in VL.","BCBH was part of the Euroleish.net training network (http://www.euroleish.net/) and has received funding from the European Commission Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Programme under Marie-Sklodowska Curie grant agreement number 642609.

For this reason, the Registro Latinoamericano de Hipertensión Pulmonar (RELAHP) is under development. The aim of this study is to estimate the prevalence of PAH in the Colombian Caribbean in 2015 based on data from a private health insurance company (PHIC) with coverage in that region. All the Individual Service Delivery Registries (RIPS) of all ambulatory care centers that serve the population of the Colombian Caribbean region affiliated with a PHIC selected for this research were reviewed. All patients who had a diagnosis of pulmonary hypertension (PH) were included (International Classification Diseases 10-Revision [ICD-10 I270, I272, I278, and I279]). Subsequently, the information on electronic medical records was reviewed. To estimate the prevalence of PAH, the total population of the PHIC and population projections of Colombian Caribbean by Departamento Administrativo Nacional de Estadisticas (DANE) was used. We identified 27 patients with a confirmed diagnosis of PH and 18 patients with a confirmed diagnosis of PAH. Taking into account the total population affiliated to the Caribbean Regional of the PHIC selected for the study in September 2015, a PAH prevalence of approximately 28 cases per million inhabitants is estimated. The mean of age was 22 ± 21.4 years (14.8% children) and 17 (62.9%) were girls/women. The majority of patients presented with PAH (Group 1) (66.6%). The estimated number of cases of PH in Colombian Caribbean in 2015 is approximately 292 cases or 1 in 35,760.

While such changes can improve the quality of life of its users, problematic mobile phone use can result in its users experiencing a range of negative outcomes such as anxiety or, in some cases, engagement in unsafe behaviors with serious health and safety implications such as mobile phone distracted driving. The aims of the present study are two-fold. First, this study investigated the current problem mobile phone use in Australia and its potential implications for road safety. Second, based on the changing nature and pervasiveness of mobile phones in Australian society, this study compared data from 2005 with data collected in 2018 to identify trends in problem mobile phone use in Australia. As predicted, the results demonstrated that problem mobile phone use in Australia increased from the first data collected in 2005. In addition, meaningful differences were found between gender and age groups in this study, with females and users in the 18-25 year-old age group showing higher mean Mobile Phone Problem Use Scale (MPPUS) scores. Additionally, problematic mobile phone use was linked with mobile phone use while driving. Specifically, participants who reported high levels of problem mobile phone use, also reported handheld and hands-free mobile phone use while driving.",,"Funding.

Therefore, the aim of this study was to examine the association between structural and social characteristics of the neighborhood, and depression in Mexican older adults. A longitudinal study was conducted based on waves 1 (2009-2010) and 2 (2014) of the Mexican sample from the Study on global AGEing and adult health (SAGE). A street-network buffer around each participant's household was used to define neighborhood, so that built environment and social characteristics were assessed within it. Depression was ascertained by using an algorithm based on the Composite International Diagnostic Interview. In the analysis, multilevel logistic regression models were constructed separately for each built and social environments measurement, adjusted for socioeconomic, demographic and health-related covariates, and stratified by area of residence (urban versus rural). The results showed that a length of space between 15-45 meters restricted to vehicles was significantly associated with a lower risk of depression in older adults from the urban area (OR: 0.44; IC 95% 0.23-0.83) and the protective association appeared to be larger with increasing space with this restriction, although it lacked significance. Contrarily, the built environment measures were not predictive of depression in the rural setting. On the other hand, none of the variables from the social environment had a significant association, although safety appeared to behave as a risk factor in the overall (OR: 1.48; CI 95% 0.96-2.30; p = 0.08) and rural (OR: 3.44; CI 95% 0.95-12.45; p = 0.06) samples, as it reached marginal significance. Research about neighborhood effects on older adults' mental health is an emergent field that has shown that depression might be treated not only from the individual-level, but also from the neighborhood-level. Additionally, further research is needed, especially in low- and middle-income countries, to help guide neighborhood policies.","SAGE is supported by the US National Institute on Aging through Interagency Agreements OGHA 04034785; YA1323-08-CN-0020; Y1-AG-1005-0) and through research grants R01-AG034479 and R21-AG034263.

However, such links can be essential to understand mechanisms of ecological speciation. The Costa Rican endemic Mangrove Warbler subspecies provides an excellent subject to study differentiation with gene flow, as it is distributed along a strong precipitation gradient on the Pacific coast with no strong geographic barriers to isolate populations. Mangrove Warbler populations could be subject to divergent selection driven by precipitation, which influences soil salinity levels, which in turn influences forest structure and food resources. We used single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and morphological traits to examine the balance between neutral genetic and phenotypic divergence to determine whether selection has acted on traits and genes with functions related to specific environmental variables. We present evidence showing: (a) associations between environmental variables and SNPs, identifying candidate genes related to bill morphology (BMP) and osmoregulation, (b) absence of population genetic structure in neutrally evolving markers, (c) divergence in bill size across the precipitation gradient, and (d) strong phenotypic differentiation (P ST) which largely exceeds neutral genetic differentiation (F ST) in bill size. Our results indicate an important role for salinity, forest structure, and resource availability in maintaining phenotypic divergence of Mangrove Warblers through natural selection. Our findings add to the growing body of literature identifying the processes involved in phenotypic differentiation along environmental gradients in the face of gene flow.","ACKNOWLEDGMENTS This research was supported by the Costa Rican Government PINN‐MICIT (Graduate Research Fellowship), Chapman Grant (American Natural History Museum), University of Florida (Grinter Fellowship), Mc Daniel Lab, and Kimball‐Braun Lab (Department of Biology, University of Florida).

OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to implement an educational intervention on the human papillomavirus (HPV) to increase knowledge about the disease among university students.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: In a preexperimental study with 385 students of both genders, the strategy was designed under the parameters of the PAHO and the Theory of Beliefs in Health. The problem was identified through biological samples of the genitals, and the impact was measured through a questionnaire. The presence of HPV DNA was made with molecular polymerase chain reaction tests; and the answers, through coefficients of variation.
RESULTS: Of the participants, 60 were positive: 49 women and 11 men. At the beginning of the application, the knowledge level was medium, between 9.0 and 9.6. After the application, it was between 12.5 and 13, being the level of knowledge average, but very close to the threshold of high.
CONCLUSIONS: With the results of the tests, it was found that HPV is a real problem among university students. The level of knowledge remained medium, despite the educational intervention.",,,Indian Journal of Community Medicine,,,,2019,2019,,2019,44,3,213-216,All OA; Gold,Article,"Barrios, Meryene C.; Rodríguez, Liliana Stella; Pachón, Claudia M.; Lugo, Emily A.","Barrios, Meryene C.

This study aimed to explore the spatiotemporal heterogeneity in the occurrence of CHIKV and ZIKV outbreaks throughout the major international seaport city of Barranquilla, Colombia in 2014 and 2016 and the potential for clustering. Incidence data were fitted using multiple Bayesian Poisson models based on multiple explanatory variables as potential risk factors identified from other studies and options for random effects. A best fit model was used to analyse their case incidence risks and identify any risk factors during their epidemics. Neighbourhoods in the northern region were hotspots for both CHIKV and ZIKV outbreaks. Additional hotspots occurred in the southwestern and some eastern/southeastern areas during their outbreaks containing part of, or immediately adjacent to, the major circular city road with its import/export cargo warehouses and harbour area. Multivariate conditional autoregressive models strongly identified higher socioeconomic strata and living in a neighbourhood near a major road as risk factors for ZIKV case incidences. These findings will help to appropriately focus vector control efforts but also challenge the belief that these infections are driven by social vulnerability and merit further study both in Barranquilla and throughout the world's tropical and subtropical regions.","The authors would like to thank all fellow authors for their contributions and dedication to this work.

A meta-analysis was performed to assess these associations.
METHODS: A systematic search was conducted to identify all relevant studies from Medline, Web of science, Embase, China biology medical literature database (CBM), China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), WanFang and Weipu (VIP) databases up to June 30, 2018. The odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated to assess the strength of associations. All of the statistical analyses were conducted using Revman 5.3 and Stata 14.0.
RESULTS: Ten studies involved 3028 cases and 3258 controls. Overall, significant association was observed between the CYP1A1 rs4646903 polymorphism and male infertility (C vs T: OR = 1.42, 95%CI = 1.14-1.76; CC vs TT: OR = 2.13, 95%CI = 1.36-3.34; CC vs CT+TT: OR = 1.96, 95%CI = 1.30-2.95; CC+CT vs TT: OR = 1.51, 95%CI = 1.16-1.97). In subgroup analysis by ethnic group, a statistically significant association was observed in Asians (C vs T: OR = 1.59, 95%CI = 1.22-2.08), but not in Non-Asians (C vs T: OR = 1.01, 95%CI = 0.79-1.30). Additionally, none of the individual studies significantly affected the association between CYP1A1 rs4646903 polymorphism and male infertility, according to sensitivity analysis.
CONCLUSION: Our meta-analysis supports that the CYP1A1 rs4646903 polymorphism might contribute to individual susceptibility to male infertility in Asians.",,"The study was supported by National key research and development program of China (SQ2017YFSF090096), National Natural Science Foundation of China (81770756), and 1.3.5 project for disciplines of excellence, West China Hospital, Sichuan (ZY2016104).",Medicine,,Nikhil Jain.,"Cytochrome P-450 CYP1A1; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Humans; Infertility, Male; Male; Odds Ratio",2019-08-02,2019,2019-08-02,2019-08,98,31,e16543,All OA; Gold,Article,"Cao, DeHong; Ren, ZhengJu; Lu, DongLiang; Liu, LiangRen; Xu, Peng; Zhang, Qin; Wei, Qiang","Cao, DeHong (Department of Urology, Institute of Urology, West China Hospital, Sichuan University, Chengdu); Ren, ZhengJu (Department of Urology, Institute of Urology, West China Hospital, Sichuan University, Chengdu); Lu, DongLiang (); Liu, LiangRen (Department of Urology, Institute of Urology, West China Hospital, Sichuan University, Chengdu); Xu, Peng (Department of Urology); Zhang, Qin (Department of Radiology, Chongqing Traditional Chinese Medicine Hospital, Chongqing, China.); Wei, Qiang (Department of Urology, Institute of Urology, West China Hospital, Sichuan University, Chengdu)","Zhang, Qin (Department of Radiology, Chongqing Traditional Chinese Medicine Hospital, Chongqing, China.)","Cao, DeHong (West China Hospital of Sichuan University; Sichuan University); Ren, ZhengJu (West China Hospital of Sichuan University; Sichuan University); Lu, DongLiang (); Liu, LiangRen (West China Hospital of Sichuan University; Sichuan University); Xu, Peng (Department of Urology); Zhang, Qin (Department of Radiology, Chongqing Traditional Chinese Medicine Hospital, Chongqing, China.); Wei, Qiang (West China Hospital of Sichuan University; Sichuan University)",5,0,0.47,1.59,https://doi.org/10.1097/md.0000000000016543,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1120111986,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3202 Clinical Sciences,

In this setting, an attacker with physical access to a computer may obtain noisy data of a cryptographic secret key of a cryptographic scheme from main memory via this data remanence attack. Therefore, the attacker would need a key-recovery algorithm to reconstruct the secret key from its noisy version. We will first describe this attack setting and then pose the problem of key recovery in a general way and establish a connection between the key recovery problem and the key enumeration problem. The latter problem has already been studied in the side-channel attack literature, where, for example, the attacker might procure scoring information for each byte of an Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) key from a side-channel attack and then want to efficiently enumerate and test a large number of complete 16-byte candidates until the correct key is found. After establishing such a connection between the key recovery problem and the key enumeration problem, we will present a comprehensive review of the most outstanding key enumeration algorithms to tackle the latter problem, for example, an optimal key enumeration algorithm (OKEA) and several nonoptimal key enumeration algorithms.

The objectives of this study were to 1) determine the self-management education needs for patients with co-morbid diabetes and CKD and 2) co-develop an educational resource meeting the self-management education needs of patients with co-morbid diabetes and CKD.MethodsPatients with co-morbid diabetes and CKD attending a co-designed, patient-centred outpatient diabetes and kidney clinic at a tertiary metropolitan hospital were recruited for semi-structured interviews. Maximal variation sampling was used, ensuring adequate representation of different gender, age, diabetes duration and stage of CKD. Data were thematically analysed using grounded theory.ResultsForty-two patients participated. Most were male (67%) and the mean age was 64.8 (11.1) years. The majority of patients preferred an educational resource in the form of a Digital Versatile Disc (DVD) and they thought that current education could be improved. In particular patients wanted further education on 1) management of diabetes and kidney disease (including nutrition and lifestyle, and prevention of the progression of kidney disease) and 2) complications of comorbid diabetes and kidney disease.ConclusionPatients with co-morbid diabetes and kidney disease have education gaps on the management of, and complications of diabetes and kidney disease.

Explored individual socio-educational and school technological infrastructure characteristics and habits of use of mobile technologies. A logistic regression model was fitted to identify variables associated with ubiquitous connectivity.ResultsOne thousand three hundred thirty-six students were included and six questionnaires (0.45%) were eliminated due to duplication of information. Fifty-four percent of participants were female, and the mean age was 16.31 ± 0.84 years. In total, 47% of students were ubiquitously connected. Associated factors to ubiquitous connectivity included better academic performance, the need to use Internet-based technologies, engaging in ludic activities on the Web and living in the state capital.ConclusionsUbiquitous connectivity it’s a desirable condition for strengthening health promotion programs focused on young population. Strategies including digital technology tools with potential to increase adolescent engagement should be explored and evaluated. However, it is necessary to recognize that there are additional factors that may influence the success of health promotion interventions.","To the students, professors and directors of the Colegio de Bachilleres del Estado de Morelos (COBAEM).",No funding was received.,BMC Medical Informatics and Decision Making,,,Adolescent; Adolescent Behavior; Cell Phone; Female; Habits; Humans; Internet; Male; Mexico; Surveys and Questionnaires; Telemedicine,2019-11-15,2019,2019-11-15,2019-12,19,1,225,All OA; Gold,Article,"Aguilar-Ye, Arturo; Reyes-Morales, Hortensia; Campero, Lourdes; Garnelo-Bibiano, Nicéforo","Aguilar-Ye, Arturo (Escuela de Salud Pública de Médico, Instituto Nacional de Salud Pública, Av.

Housewives are not excluded. Domestic and care chores, which are considered to be sources of stress, increase when taking on the role of caregiver for a family member with Alzheimer's disease.
OBJECTIVE: To analyse the influence of emotional exhaustion, somatic symptoms and social dysfunction, based on the activity they carry out.
METHODOLOGY: Cross-sectional survey. 193 women participated, of which: housewives (HWs) (n = 97), and Alzheimer's patient caregiver-housewives (CHWs) (n = 96). The evaluation tools were: sociodemographic/working data questionnaire (ad hoc), Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI) and Goldberg General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-28).
RESULTS: High rates of emotional exhaustion are observed, as well as an existing positive link between chronic diseases, somatic symptoms and social dysfunction. The structural model indicates that emotional exhaustion predicts the amount and extent of diseases, somatic symptoms and social dysfunction. The influence is higher in CHWs.
LIMITATIONS: Sample procedure implemented at convenience; the variable of the grade of dependence of the Alzheimer's patient caregiver was not included in the study.
CONCLUSIONS: The domestic and care chores that HWs and CHWs carry out affect their health.

Specifically, the application of the methodology is focused on the cylinders, exhaust manifold, and turbocharger turbine sections. The proposed model was validated with actual operating data, obtaining an error rate not exceeding 5%, which allow a thermal characterization of the Jenbacher JMS 612 GS-N based on the model. A parametric analysis is conducted; considering the volumetric efficiency, the output electric power, the effective efficiency, the exhaust gas temperature, the turbine mass flow, the specific fuel consumption under the nominal operation conditions, which is 1.16 bar in the gas pressure, 65 °C in the cooling water temperature, 35 °C in the average ambient temperature, and 1500 rpm. The results of this model can be used to evaluate the thermodynamic performance parameters of waste heat recovery systems. On the other hand, new control strategies and the implementation of state observers for the detection and diagnosis of failures can be developed based on the proposed model.","Acknowledgments are given to Universidad Pontificia Bolivariana, UPB as cooperation research partners supporting researches related to energy topics.",This work was supported by the Mechanical Engineering Program of Universidad del Atlántico.

This study assessed the frequency of these manifestations in a reference unit in Acre, Brazil.
METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study with a convenience sample of patients having their first consultation at the rheumatology outpatient clinics of a referral unit in Rio Branco, Acre, from March to November 2017. Sociodemographic, clinical, laboratory, and imaging data registereds using a standardized questionnaire form.
RESULTS: Among the 600 patients with rheumatic complaints, 3.0% were newly diagnosed with hepatitis B virus (HBV) or hepatitis C virus (HCV), and 8.7% were previously diagnosed with hepatitis. Among the 70 patients with hepatitis, 54.3% were carriers of HBV and 45.7% of HCV. For patients infected with HBV and HCV, arthralgia was the most prevalent rheumatic manifestation in 97.4% and 90.6%, followed by myalgia in 81.6% and 65.6%, and arthritis in 26.3% and 40.6% of patients, respectively, according to the descriptive analysis performed using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences software. In comparative analyses using the chi-squared test, despite the fact that fibromyalgia was the most prevalent rheumatic disease only the Rheumatoid Arthritis there were differences in distribution between the carriers of HCV (18.8%) and HBV (2.6%). According to the Fisher's exact test, hypothyroidism was the most frequent comorbidity in patients with HCV (21.9%).
CONCLUSIONS: An increased frequency of musculoskeletal manifestations, better than those reported in the medical literature, in patients infected with HBV and HCV was observed.","We offer our deepest thanks to the institutions Hospital das Clínicas do Acre, Brazil, and to the Federal University of Acre for providing technical support for the development and implementation of this study.",,Revista da Sociedade Brasileira de Medicina Tropical,,,Adult; Aged; Brazil; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Hepatitis B; Hepatitis C; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Rheumatic Diseases; Socioeconomic Factors,2019,2019,2019,,52,,e20180407,All OA; Gold,Article,"de Oliveira, Ídila Mont’Alverne Xavier; da Silva, Rita do Socorro Uchôa","de Oliveira, Ídila Mont’Alverne Xavier (); da Silva, Rita do Socorro Uchôa (Universidade Federal do Acre, Programa de Pós-Graduação Stricto Sensu em Ciências da Saúde na Amazônia Ocidental, Universidade Federal do Acre, Rio Branco, Acre, Brasil., Programa de Pós-Graduação Stricto Sensu em Ciências da Saúde na Amazônia Ocidental, Universidade Federal do Acre, Rio Branco, Acre, Brasil; Secretaria de Saúde do Estado do Acre, Rio Branco, Brasil., Secretaria de Saúde do Estado do Acre, Rio Branco, Brasil)",,"de Oliveira, Ídila Mont’Alverne Xavier (); da Silva, Rita do Socorro Uchôa (Universidade Federal do Acre; Secretaria de Saúde do Estado do Acre, Rio Branco, Brasil., Secretaria de Saúde do Estado do Acre, Rio Branco, Brasil)",9,2,0.65,2.86,http://www.scielo.br/pdf/rsbmt/v52/1678-9849-rsbmt-52-e20180407.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1123102253,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3202 Clinical Sciences,3 Good Health and Well Being

The aim of this study was to determine the seroprevalence of HTLV I/II and its associated factors in donors to a blood bank of Medellín Colombia, 2014-2018.
METHODS: This is a cross-sectional study of 52,159 donors with a secondary information source. Seroprevalence of HTLV I/II was determined with its confidence interval and the population characteristics were described by frequency and summary measures. To explore the associated factors, Pearson's Chi square test, Mann-Whitney U test, crude odds ratios were used and they were adjusted by logistic regression in SPSS 25.0.
RESULTS: 88% of the population lived in the metropolitan area, 68.5% belonged to the University. 76.2% were altruistic donors (unpaid donors who did not donate to a specific patient). 24.5% were repetitive (paid) donors. 75% of the donors were under 41 years old. The seroprevalence of HTLV I/II was 0.176% (95% CI = 0.139% -0.213%), being statistically lower in repetitive donors and men.
CONCLUSION: The seroprevalence of HTLV I/II infection in the studied blood bank is lower than that reported in other blood banks at the departmental and national levels. In Medellín, it was associated with the frequency of donation and gender, which is useful information for the hemovigilance programs of the city.","This research relies upon salary support for the authors.

METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted in the Sistema Assistencial è Saúde da Mulher e da Criança (Health Care System for Women and Children; SASMC) in Acre, Brazil, in 2017. The participants comprised 196 health professionals. The data collection instrument contained 31 questions about HPV, its clinical repercussions for women, and the HPV vaccine. Quantitative variables were presented as medians and 95% confidence intervals (CIs), and p<0.05 was considered statistically significant. For the analyses, chi-square tests and Mann-Whitney tests were used. The collected data were analyzed using Stata®11.0.
RESULTS: Of the 196 health professionals, 39.8% (n=76) were physicians and 61.2% (n=120) were other health professionals. The interviewees were mostly female (n=143, 73%, 95% CI 66.1 to 78.9%) who worked in the medical field (n=81, 41.3%, 95% CI 34.4 to 48.6%), and the median age was 38 years (95% CI 36.0 to 39.7). Physicians had increased knowledge regarding only the statement ""cervical cancer is one of the main causes of cancer in women"", with a proportion ratio of 0.88 (0.80; 0.97) and p<0.001. Regarding clinical knowledge of the HPV vaccine, a low proportion of correct answers was obtained for all the questions, and no significant differences were found between the groups.

Additionally, this study evaluated the economic impact of GM and BNM to determine if the former represents a cost-effective alternative to the latter.
METHODS: Patients treated between January 2011 and May 2014 received GM while patients treated between June 2014 and March 2017 received BNM. Mortality was compared between groups. Total infection cost was defined by the cost of antimicrobial consumption, length of stay, and laboratory and imaging exams until infection resolution.
FINDINGS: A total of 168 patients were included; survival rate for the 68 patients treated with GM was 38% compared to 59% in the patients treated with BNM. Multivariate analysis showed that the variables most strongly-associated with mortality were cardiovascular disease (OR 18.18, 95% CI 1.25-262.3, p = 0.033) and treatment with generic meropenem (OR 18.45, 95% CI 1.45-232.32, p = 0.024). On the other hand, total infection cost did not show a significant difference between groups (BNM $10,771 vs. GM $11,343; p = 0.91).
INTERPRETATION: The present study suggests that patients treated with GM have a risk of death 18 times higher compared to those treated with BNM. Furthermore, economic analysis shows that GM is not more cost effective than BNM.
SUMMARY: More studies measuring clinical outcomes are needed to confirm the clinical equivalence of brand-name versus generic antibiotics, not only for meropenem but also for other molecules.",,,The Brazilian Journal of Infectious Diseases,,,"Adolescent; Adult; Age Distribution; Aged; Anti-Bacterial Agents; Colombia; Cost-Benefit Analysis; Drugs, Generic; Female; Gram-Negative Bacterial Infections; Humans; Intensive Care Units; Logistic Models; Male; Meropenem; Middle Aged; Multivariate Analysis; Risk Factors; Sex Distribution; Survival Analysis; Tertiary Care Centers; Treatment Outcome; Young Adult",2019-07-22,2019,2019-07-22,2019-07,23,4,237-245,All OA; Gold,Article,"Ordóñez, Karen; Feinstein, Max M.; Reyes, Sergio; Hernández-Gómez, Cristhian; Pallares, Christian; Villegas, María V.","Ordóñez, Karen (E.S.E.

Revisión de la bibliografía científica,"The intensification of agriculture in countries of the Southern Cone of Latin America has led to a significant rise in the use of agrochemicals. Scientific output in the field of health has concentrated on the epidemiological aspects of this issue and studies addressing the social dimensions of exposure to these substances remain scarce. The aim of this scoping review was to assess the scientific literature on the subjective production of groups exposed to agrochemicals. To this end, searches were conducted of the Scopus, PubMed, BVS, SciELO, and DOAJ databases for articles published between 1991 and 2016. A complementary search strategy drawing on references to other studies in the selected articles was also adopted. The findings show that the studies give subjective production different names and that the predominant themes covered by the literature were risk perception and health beliefs. With regard to understanding-explaining the subjective production process, a series of articles focused on individual lifestyles, while another group considered collective ways of life. The wide-ranging findings suggest that this area is a field of study in dispute, where positivist and functionalist approaches converge with historically situated studies that adopt a critical perspective.","A Leonardo Federico y Andrés Trotta por las orientaciones metodológicas para la realización de la revisión bibliográfica.

The SABE Colombia Study,"OBJECTIVE: To estimate the prevalence of frailty and evaluate the relationship with the social determinants of health in elderly residents in urban and rural areas of Colombia.
METHODS: The SABE (Health, Wellbeing, and Aging) Colombia project is a cross-sectional study, carried out in 2014-2015, involving 24,553 men and women aged 60 years and older who live in the community in Colombia. For this analysis, we used data from 4,474 participants included as a subsample with grip strength measurements. The frailty syndrome was diagnosed according to the Fried criteria (weakness, low speed, low physical activity, exhaustion, and weight loss). The independent variables were grouped as (a) biological and genetic flow, (b) lifestyle (adverse conditions in childhood) (c) social networks and community, and (d) socio-economic, cultural and environmental conditions. Multiple logistic and linear regression analyses were used to assess the prognostic value of frailty for the outcomes of interest.
RESULTS: The prevalence of frailty was 17.9%. The factors significantly associated with frailty were older age, being women, living in rural areas, having low education, a greater number of medical conditions, insufficient current income, childhood health problems and a poor economic situation in childhood.
CONCLUSION: Our results support the need to include frailty prevention programs, to improve the socioeconomic health conditions of infants to avoid future development of frailty.",,,Colombia Medica,,,Aged; Colombia; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Frail Elderly; Frailty; Humans; Life Style; Male; Middle Aged; Prevalence; Risk Factors; Rural Population; Social Determinants of Health; Socioeconomic Factors; Urban Population,2019-06-30,2019,2019-06-30,,50,2,89-101,All OA; Gold,Article,"Ocampo-Chaparro, José M.; Reyes-Ortiz, Carlos A.; Castro-Flórez, Ximena; Gómez, Fernando","Ocampo-Chaparro, José M.

To compare work capacity and quality of life of taxi and motorcycle taxi drivers, and correlate quality of life and work ability, a cross-sectional descriptive study was conducted among 232 motorcycle taxi drivers and 60 male taxi drivers in urban cities of Brazil. Three instruments were used for evaluation: a questionnaire on sociodemographic and occupational issues, the Work Capacity Index (WCI), and the WHOQOL-bref (World Health Organization Quality of Life⁻Bref). Taxi drivers presented better evaluation scores in the physical and psychological domains and general quality of life (QOL) (p < 0.01), and better self-perceived work ability (lower physical and mental demands, fewer diagnosed diseases, less incapacity for professional practice, p < 0.001). In addition, there was a positive relationship between QOL and WCI (p = 0.001).

The objective of this study is to explore the attitudes and motivations associated with the use of antibiotics without prescription.
METHODS: Focus group sessions were held with residents of Bogotá. Different socioeconomic groups were approached to identify possible differences of opinion. A semi-structured interview guide was used to guide the discussion, with thematic analysis used to identify central themes.
RESULTS: In total, 21 people, aged between 25 and 50 years participated in four focus groups. The results suggest that the use of antibiotics without prescription is common practice. The main reasons included barriers to access to prescribed medications due to limited health insurance. Even those with adequate access to health insurance report being willing to use a treatment without a prescription if they have confidence in its effectiveness. The relationship with the physician is important, but pharmacy storekeepers are also highly trusted. While some participants understood that antibiotics can cure infections but cause serious adverse events, several misconceptions about antibiotics therapy were identified. These included a lack of knowledge of resistance transmissibility among communities.
CONCLUSIONS: The results have implications for interventions aimed at reducing inappropriate use of antibiotics, highlighting i) how lack of access to timely care creates an incentive to self-prescribe, ii) the key role that pharmacy storekeepers play in the Colombian healthcare system and the need to include them in interventions, and iii) the misconceptions about inappropriate use of medications that need to be addressed by educational programs. These findings provide insights to other countries where antibiotics misuse is also a problem.","The authors thank Juliana Lopez—social worker—for her support in guiding the data analysis.

A Case Study: Meta River, Colombia","Numerical models are important tools for analyzing and solving water resources problems; however, a model’s reliability heavily depends on its calibration. This paper presents a method based on Design of Experiments theory for calibrating numerical models of rivers by considering the interaction between different calibration parameters, identifying the most sensitive parameters and finding a value or a range of values for which the calibration parameters produces an adequate performance of the model in terms of accuracy. The method consists of a systematic process for assessing the qualitative and quantitative performance of a hydromorphological numeric model. A 75 km reach of the Meta River, in Colombia, was used as case study for validating the method. The modeling was conducted by using the software package MIKE-21C, a two-dimensional flow model. The calibration is assessed by means of an Overall Weighted Indicator, based on the coefficient of determination of the calibration parameters and within a range from 0 to 1. For the case study, the most significant calibration parameters were the sediment transport equation, the riverbed load factor and the suspended load factor. The optimal calibration produced an Overall Weighted Indicator equal to 0.857. The method can be applied to any type of morphological models.",The authors acknowledge the teamwork with the Institute of Hydraulic and Environmental Studies of the Universidad del Norte and data from the project “Update of the Studies and Designs for the Navigation of the Meta River between Cabuyaro (K804) and Puerto Carreño (K0)”.,"This research was funded by the Universidad del Norte, Colombia.",Water,,,,2019-07-05,2019,2019-07-05,,11,7,1382,All OA; Gold,Article,"Acuña, Guillermo J.; Ávila, Humberto; Canales, Fausto A.","Acuña, Guillermo J.

Through enactment of the Disability Law, Colombia has made improvements to recognize and address some of the barriers for PWDs, including access to comprehensive rehabilitation. However access remains limited with significant disconnect between perspectives of various stakeholders and the needs of the population. We examined the unique perceptions on access to comprehensive rehabilitation services and participation of PWDs. We also explored the perspective of caregivers of PWDs, rehabilitation professionals, and other stakeholders on the experiences of PWDs. Our goal was to identify gaps in the implementation of comprehensive rehabilitation programs, and barriers to access resources for comprehensive rehabilitation or services that would impact participation of PWDs.MethodsQualitative study conducted in 2017. Data was collected from a purposive sample of adults with physical disability, aged 18–44 years, who had received rehabilitation services at a local partner organization and with different backgrounds and experiences with disability. Purposive sampling was also conducted with caregivers, rehabilitation professionals, and other stakeholders. Socio-demographic information was collected and semi-structured interviews were conducted by a research team member, recorded, transcribed and analyzed using a thematic analysis method to identify main themes related to our aim. CES University ethical review board approved this study.ResultsThirty-two participants were interviewed: eight were male, 42.1 ± 11.1 years old, and 44% (n = 14) were PWDs. Three main themes were identified among all the participants: the meaning of rehabilitation, challenges to access services, and participation. Challenges to access services had three sub-themes: barriers to personal mobility, perceptions and knowledge on disability, and navigating the system.ConclusionThe main focus of rehabilitation as perceived by stakeholders is still on functional rehabilitation. If healthcare personnel is better trained on disability and if those with disabilities are actively involved in the developing these programs, the focus may evolve to a comprehensive and equitable rehabilitation process that fosters full participation.","The authors would like to acknowledge the contribution to the collection and analysis of the information of the physiotherapy students: Lorena Salazar-Mateus, Libeth Sosa-Torrez, María Camila Quiroz-Corrales, Daniela Rendón-Bolivar and David Rendón-Bolivar.

The limited data available on varicella in Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC) indicate substantial burden in countries where varicella vaccine is not part of publicly funded childhood national immunization programs.MethodsA systematic literature review of published studies was complemented by “gray” literature on varicella incidence, complications, mortality, and economic consequences, in the absence and presence of universal varicella vaccination (UVV) in LAC.ResultsSeroprevalence data indicate that varicella is usually a disease of childhood in LAC. Varicella incidence rates, while unreliable in the absence of mandatory reporting, show a trend to increased incidence due to greater urbanization and population density. The introduction of UVV in national immunization programs has led to significant reductions in varicella incidence in these areas.ConclusionsVaricella continues to pose a substantial healthcare burden in LAC. The future introduction of UVV in additional countries is predicted to provide substantial reductions in cases, with important economic benefits. For countries that have already implemented UVV, the challenge is to maintain high rates of coverage and, where relevant, consider inclusion of a second dose to reduce breakthrough cases. Given the significant proportion of the region now implementing UVV, a regional recommendation in order to prevent any potential for age-shifts in varicella infection might be considered.","The authors take full responsibility for the scope, direction, and content of the manuscript, and have approved the submitted manuscript.

We describe a new, exceptionally preserved enigmatic crab from the mid-Cretaceous of Colombia and the United States, whose completeness illuminates the early disparity of the group and the origins of novel forms. Its large and unprotected compound eyes, small fusiform body, and leg-like mouthparts suggest larval trait retention into adulthood via heterochronic development (pedomorphosis), while its large oar-like legs represent the earliest known adaptations in crabs for active swimming. Our phylogenetic analyses, including representatives of all major lineages of fossil and extant crabs, challenge conventional views of their evolution by revealing multiple convergent losses of a typical ""crab-like"" body plan since the Early Cretaceous. These parallel morphological transformations may be associated with repeated invasions of novel environments, including the pelagic/necto-benthic zone in this pedomorphic chimera crab.","We thank H.

Here we investigated the impact of long-term space exploration on the microbiome of nine astronauts that spent six to twelve months in the ISS. We present evidence showing that the microbial communities of the gastrointestinal tract, skin, nose and tongue change during the space mission. The composition of the intestinal microbiota became more similar across astronauts in space, mostly due to a drop in the abundance of a few bacterial taxa, some of which were also correlated with changes in the cytokine profile of crewmembers. Alterations in the skin microbiome that might contribute to the high frequency of skin rashes/hypersensitivity episodes experienced by astronauts in space were also observed. The results from this study demonstrate that the composition of the astronauts’ microbiome is altered during space travel. The impact of those changes on crew health warrants further investigation before humans embark on long-duration voyages into outer space.",We gratefully acknowledge the participation of the astronauts in the study and the ISSMP experiment team at NASA.

Despite this, assessment of depressive symptoms is not a routine clinical practice in the care of people with HIV in Colombia. One reason could be the lack of validated depression screening scales for this population.
OBJECTIVE: To test the reliability and construct validity of the 20- and 10-item-Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale in patients attending an HIV clinic in Cali, Colombia.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A non-random sample of 105 adults was enrolled. The 20 item-CES-D (CES-D-20) scale was administered twice: At baseline and 2-4 weeks later. We calculated the Cronbach's alpha coefficient and the intraclass correlation coefficient. In addition, we used an exploratory and confirmatory factorial analysis, as well as the item response theory to assess the validity of the scale.
RESULTS: Most participants were men (73%), with a mean age of 40 years, 53% of whom had not completed high school. Cronbach's coefficients were 0.92 and 0.94 at baseline and at the second interview, respectively. The intraclass correlation was 0.81 (95% CI: 0.72-0.88). Although all 20 items loaded distinctly in 4 factors, 5 items did not load as expected. The structure factor of the CES-D-20 was not confirmed, as 4 items had poor goodness of fit. The CES-D-10 appeared to perform better in this population.

Objective: We aimed to estimate the social inequalities in health in Colombia, according to the type of affiliation to the health system as a proxy of socioeconomic status.
Materials and methods: We conducted a retrospective descriptive analysis calculating incidence rates age and sex adjusted for all mandatory reporting events using the affiliation regime (subsidized and contributory) as a socioeconomic proxy. Estimates were made at departmental level for 2015. Social inequalities were calculated in terms of absolute and relative gaps.
Results: We found social inequalities in the occurrence of mandatory reporting events in population affiliated to the Colombian subsidized regime (poor population).
In this population, 82.31 cases of Plasmodium falciparum malaria per 100,000 affiliates were reported more than those reported in the contributory regime. Regarding the relative gap, belonging to the subsidized regime increased by 31.74 times the risk of dying from malnutrition in children under 5 years of age.
Other events such as those related to sexual and reproductive health (maternal mortality, gestational syphilis and congenital syphilis); neglected diseases and communicable diseases related to poverty (leprosy and tuberculosis), also showed profound inequalities.
Conclusion: In Colombia there are inequalities by regime of affiliation to the health system. Measured socioeconomic status was a predictor of increased morbidity and premature mortality.","A todo el equipo de trabajo del Sistema de Vigilancia en Salud Pública, que diariamente se encarga de consolidar y depurar la información proveniente de todas las unidades generadoras de datos del país, y la Dirección de Vigilancia y Análisis del Riesgo en Salud Pública del Instituto Nacional de Salud, por la gestión y entrega de los datos",,Biomédica,,,"Age Factors; Cause of Death; Colombia; Disease Notification; Female; Health Status Disparities; Health Systems Plans; Healthcare Disparities; Humans; Insurance, Health; Male; Mandatory Reporting; Medically Uninsured; National Health Programs; Retrospective Studies; Sex Factors; Socioeconomic Factors",2019-12-01,2019,2019-12-01,,39,4,737-747,All OA; Gold,Article,"Hilarión-Gaitán, Liliana; Díaz-Jiménez, Diana; Cotes-Cantillo, Karol; Castañeda-Orjuela, Carlos","Hilarión-Gaitán, Liliana (Observatorio Nacional de Salud, Instituto Nacional de Salud, Bogotá, D.C., Colombia, Observatorio Nacional de Salud, Instituto Nacional de Salud, Bogotá, D.C, Colombia); Díaz-Jiménez, Diana (Observatorio Nacional de Salud, Instituto Nacional de Salud, Bogotá, D.C., Colombia, Observatorio Nacional de Salud, Instituto Nacional de Salud, Bogotá, D.C, Colombia); Cotes-Cantillo, Karol (Observatorio Nacional de Salud, Instituto Nacional de Salud, Bogotá, D.C., Colombia, Observatorio Nacional de Salud, Instituto Nacional de Salud, Bogotá, D.C, Colombia); Castañeda-Orjuela, Carlos (Observatorio Nacional de Salud, Instituto Nacional de Salud, Bogotá, D.C., Colombia, Observatorio Nacional de Salud, Instituto Nacional de Salud, Bogotá, D.C, Colombia)","Hilarión-Gaitán, Liliana (Instituto Nacional de Salud)","Hilarión-Gaitán, Liliana (Instituto Nacional de Salud); Díaz-Jiménez, Diana (Instituto Nacional de Salud); Cotes-Cantillo, Karol (Instituto Nacional de Salud); Castañeda-Orjuela, Carlos (Instituto Nacional de Salud)",20,10,1.39,4.31,https://revistabiomedica.org/index.php/biomedica/article/download/4453/4274,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1123268727,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 42 Health Sciences; 4202 Epidemiology; 4206 Public Health,10 Reduced Inequalities; 3 Good Health and Well Being

OBJECTIVE: To determine the presence of Lutzomyia species and to detect the Leishmania infection in Didelphis marsupialis in an endemic area for visceral leishmaniasis.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Phlebotomine fauna and individuals of D. marsupialis were collected with CDC and Tomahawk™ traps, respectively. The species of Lutzomyia were identified using the Young and Duncan key (1994). Ear and tail biopsies and blood samples from D. marsupialis were taken to identify the Leishmania species by amplifying a fragment of the gene associated with the 70 kD heat shock protein.
RESULTS: Seven Lutzomyia species were identified: Lu. evansi, Lu. gomezi, Lu. panamensis, Lu. dubitans, Lu. cayennensis cayennensis, Lu. rangeliana and Lu. trinidadensis. The first three species have epidemiological importance in Colombia because of their implications in the transmission of the Leishmania parasite. Sixty-five tissue samples from 19 D. marsupialis individuals were negative for Leishmania spp.
CONCLUSIONS: The presence of the Lutzomyia species that have been identified as vectors for Leishmania inside and around houses in the village of El Bledo, in El Carmen de Bolívar represents a risk of infection. Furthermore, the presence of Lu. panamensis is reported for first time in El Carmen de Bolívar in Colombia.

Differences in suicide rates in rural and urban areas have been previously described.
Objective: To study the trend of mortality rates by suicide in Colombia, in rural and urban areas by gender, age group, and suicide method during the years 1979-2014.
Materials and methods: We conducted a temporal trend ecologic study using death certificates from the Departamento Administrativo Nacional de Estadística, DANE. Specific and adjusted by age and gender mortality rates were calculated. We estimated negative binomial and inflection point regression models to study the trends in mortality rates stratified by gender, age group, and suicide method.
Results: A total of 56,448 suicides was reported in Colombia between 1979 and 2014. The risk of suicide was higher in urban areas for men, individuals between 25 and 44 years, and 65 and over; and for those who used hanging as the suicide method. Also, the risk of suicide was higher in the rural area for men between 45 and 64 years old, and those who used firearms, sharp weapons, hanging, and others as suicide methods. The trend of suicide rates in urban areas showed its maximum peak in 1999 and in the rural ones in 2000. Then, in the two areas, there was a gradual decrease. Hanging in both areas presented a tendency to rise in men.

It has been proposed that optimal learning occurs when the preferences of the primary learning style of the student correspond to the course content and the method of instruction. The Visual, Aural, Written/Read and Kinesthetic (VARK) model is a preferred instruction model. The objective of the study was to investigate the relationship between the VARK preferences and the Gross Anatomy test results of a group of students from the Universidad del Norte. The study included 111 (61 female and 50 male) students enrolled in their third semester of medical school in the skeletomuscular system during the summer of 2015. The VARK Aural and Kinesthetic modes were the most common (34.2% and 26.1%, respectively), while Visual was the learning style with the lowest number of representatives (9%). The multimodal style was preferred by 12.6% of the students involved. There was no significant statistical relationship (X 2 =2.61; p =.62 and X 2 =5.4; p =.24) between the VARK modes and the mid-term test results. The Aural and Kinesthetic modes showed significant negative correlations with the mid-term electronic multiple-choice assessment (r s =−0.19; p =.03; and (r s =−0.24; p =.01).

Therefore, the purpose of the present study was to estimate the levels of empathy in general, and the potential for the growth of empathy in medical students. Materials and methods This exploratory and cross-sectional study included students from the first to fifth academic year of the University Corporation Rafael Nunez (Cartagena, Colombia) (N =971, n =756, 77.86% of the population studied). Participants were given the Jefferson Scale of Empathy, Spanish version for medical students, validated and adapted in Colombia. A bifactorial variance analysis (model III) was used to find the mean differences between courses and genders, and the interaction between these two factors. Data was described using simple arithmetic graphs and processed with SPSS 20.0 to estimate the total potential for growth. Results Differences were found between academic years and gender in empathy in general and in the component of “compassionate care”. Conclusion The levels of empathy are relatively low, and the behavior of empathy levels does not match the concept of empathy decline.

One way is to examine the perceptions of undergraduates of a teaching method applied to specific individuals, geographical contexts, and their relationship to achieving the objectives of the course. This study analysed students’ perceptions of the effectiveness of the Project-Based Learning (PBL) method within the Colombian Caribbean. The study used both Chi-square, Wilcoxon rank sum and independent variable correlation tests in a survey of 340 students in the Economic Development undergraduate course in a total of four cohorts over two years. The students compared the PBL to a traditional teaching method to fulfill the course’s objectives, identifying cross—curricular skills that were considered better and worse during the learning process. It was found that only competencies of Autonomy and Critical Thinking had significant positive perceptions when using the PBL revealing that perceptions of students form a complementary tool that contributes to the analysis of the usefulness of teaching methods in different geographical contexts.",,"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: The author received financial support from the Centre for Teaching Excellence (CEDU) under grant [Number 2017-1-3A].",Cogent Education,,,,2019-01,2019,2019-05-20,2019-01,6,1,1616364,All OA; Gold,Article,"de la Puente Pacheco, Mario Alberto; Guerra, Dick; de Oro Aguado, Carlos Mario; Alexander McGarry, Callum; Tinoca, Luís","de la Puente Pacheco, Mario Alberto (Department of Political Science and International Relations, Universidad Del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); Guerra, Dick (Centre for Teaching Excellence, Universidad Del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); de Oro Aguado, Carlos Mario (Department of Matemathics and Statistics, Universidad del Norte, Barraquilla, Colombia); Alexander McGarry, Callum (Languages Institute, Universidad Del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); Tinoca, Luís (Universidade de Lisboa, Portugal)","de la Puente Pacheco, Mario Alberto (Universidad del Norte)","de la Puente Pacheco, Mario Alberto (Universidad del Norte); Guerra, Dick (Universidad del Norte); de Oro Aguado, Carlos Mario (Universidad del Norte); Alexander McGarry, Callum (Universidad del Norte); Tinoca, Luís (University of Lisbon)",18,14,,10.74,https://doi.org/10.1080/2331186x.2019.1616364,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1113947747,39 Education; 3901 Curriculum and Pedagogy,

The paper uses Unigrid to maximize the resilience of the unbalanced distributions network through optimal sizing and location of renewable energy sources. Unigrid is a scaled-down standard IEEE 13 microgrid built to analyze the behavior of electrical systems. The research methodology consist in evaluating the penetration of non-conventional renewable energy generation to the distribution network in different nodes and different injected power values. The first scenario is the connection of the microgrid with the power system of Providencia (Colombia), a low inertia network; the second scenario is the connection with La Guajira network, a high inertia included in the National Interconnected System (NIS). The connection of generators with non-conventional sources allowed to identify the percentage of non-conventional penetration sources of the modified IEEE 13 network in two scenarios in Colombia. The results lead that the candidate nodes to connect renewable sources are 632 and 671.

PKM can be obtained as the result of solvent or mechanical extraction of palm kernel oil; in both cases, meal has a remaining oil content that could be recovered. In this work, PKM coming from a mechanical pressing extraction system with an initial oil content between 7 to 8% (wt.) was treated with subcritical water in a batch stirred reactor. To find the proper operational conditions, a three-step experimental process was performed. Extraction temperature, reaction time, particle size and alkaline catalyst usage were selected as process factors. After subcritical extraction, the system was cooled down and depressurized; then oil phase was separated by centrifugation. After extraction, meal was oven-dried at 80 °C. A maximum recovery of 0.034 kg-oil/kg-meal was obtained at 423 K, 720 s and particles smaller than 0.001 m. The experimental procedure showed consistent extraction yields of 40% without modifying the quality of the obtained oil.",Authors would like to thank PALMACEITE SA for funding this research.,"This research was funded by PALMACEITE S.A., grant number UN-OJ-2017-36459 and The APC was funded by Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla-Colombia.",Processes,,,,2019-11-02,2019,2019-11-02,,7,11,797,All OA; Gold,Article,"Maury, Johnnys Bustillo; Rico, Andrés Aldana; Pinto, Cindy García; Medina, Ingrid Hernández; Urueta, Juan Urueta; King, Jerry W.; Silvera, Antonio Bula","Maury, Johnnys Bustillo (Departamento de Ingeniería Mecánica, Universidad del Norte, Km 5 vía Puerto Colombia, Barranquilla C.P. 080001, Colombia;, pintoc@uninorte.edu.co, (C.G.P.);, abula@uninorte.edu.co, (A.B.S.)); Rico, Andrés Aldana (Departamento de Ingeniería Mecánica, Universidad del Norte, Km 5 vía Puerto Colombia, Barranquilla C.P. 080001, Colombia;, pintoc@uninorte.edu.co, (C.G.P.);, abula@uninorte.edu.co, (A.B.S.)); Pinto, Cindy García (Departamento de Ingeniería Mecánica, Universidad del Norte, Km 5 vía Puerto Colombia, Barranquilla C.P. 080001, Colombia;, pintoc@uninorte.edu.co, (C.G.P.);, abula@uninorte.edu.co, (A.B.S.)); Medina, Ingrid Hernández (Departamento de Ingeniería Industrial, Universidad del Norte, Km 5 vía Puerto Colombia, Barranquilla C.P. 080001, Colombia;, inhernandez@uninorte.edu.co); Urueta, Juan Urueta (Departamento de Innovación, Aceites S.A., Santa Marta C.P. 470001, Colombia;, proyectos@aceitesa.com); King, Jerry W.

The structures of the pipelines are designed to withstand several environmental loading conditions to ensure safe and reliable distribution from point of production to the shore or distribution depot. However, leaks in pipeline networks are one of the major causes of innumerable losses in pipeline operators and nature. Incidents of pipeline failure can result in serious ecological disasters, human casualties and financial loss. In order to avoid such menace and maintain safe and reliable pipeline infrastructure, substantial research efforts have been devoted to implementing pipeline leak detection and localisation using different approaches. This paper discusses pipeline leakage detection technologies and summarises the state-of-the-art achievements. Different leakage detection and localisation in pipeline systems are reviewed and their strengths and weaknesses are highlighted. Comparative performance analysis is performed to provide a guide in determining which leak detection method is appropriate for particular operating settings. In addition, research gaps and open issues for development of reliable pipeline leakage detection systems are discussed.","The authors acknowledge the supports of Petroleum Technology Development Fund (PTDF), Abuja Nigeria for Providing Funding Under its Overseas Scholarship scheme.","This research was funded by Petroleum Technology Development Fund (PTDF), Abuja Nigeria, grant number PTDF/ED/PHD/AMM/1385/18.",Sensors,,,,2019-06-04,2019,2019-06-04,,19,11,2548,All OA; Gold,Article,"Adegboye, Mutiu Adesina; Fung, Wai-Keung; Karnik, Aditya","Adegboye, Mutiu Adesina (Communications and Autonomous Systems Group, Robert Gordon University, Aberdeen AB10 7GJ, UK;, m.adegboye@rgu.ac.uk; School of Engineering, Robert Gordon University, Aberdeen AB10 7GJ, UK;, a.karnik@rgu.ac.uk); Fung, Wai-Keung (Communications and Autonomous Systems Group, Robert Gordon University, Aberdeen AB10 7GJ, UK;, m.adegboye@rgu.ac.uk; School of Engineering, Robert Gordon University, Aberdeen AB10 7GJ, UK;, a.karnik@rgu.ac.uk); Karnik, Aditya (School of Engineering, Robert Gordon University, Aberdeen AB10 7GJ, UK;, a.karnik@rgu.ac.uk)","Fung, Wai-Keung (Robert Gordon University; Robert Gordon University)","Adegboye, Mutiu Adesina (Robert Gordon University; Robert Gordon University); Fung, Wai-Keung (Robert Gordon University; Robert Gordon University); Karnik, Aditya (Robert Gordon University)",285,128,3.5,70.27,https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/19/11/2548/pdf?version=1559638230,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1116686893,40 Engineering; 46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4605 Data Management and Data Science,

Determining how to order the $r$ -packets that emerge from the source node $s$ through their output $n$ -links, constitutes a combinatorial problem. In this work, the set of all the possible output configurations is constructed, where each configuration is a vector of packets tags of length equal to $n$ . Each tag has a length equal to $r$ . Through a combinatorial algorithm on the set of possible output configurations, a path is carried out on the graph representing the one-session multicast network. The path is based on a topological ordering of the multicast graph that allowed us finding all possible ways to order the output of the $r$ -packets from $s$ to the sink nodes in $T$ . An ordering configuration based on Network Coding is valid, if the coding of packets is achieved through a linear combination in the coding nodes and the decoding of packets in the sink nodes. This validation verifies, then, a one-session multicast solution. The proposal of this work is independent of the network topology, the maximum flow value, and the size of the packets.","This work was supported in part by the Research, Development, and Innovation Management of the Universidad del Norte (DIDI).",,IEEE Access,,,,2019-01-01,2019,2019-10-15,2019-01-01,7,,152064-152075,All OA; Gold,Article,"Márquez, José D.; Salcedo, Carolina A.","Márquez, José D.

Most of them require the knowledge of the user location, either for their core service or for marketing purposes. Location-based services (LBS) offer context-based assistance to users based on their location. Although these applications ask the user for permission to use their location and even explain in detail how this information will be used in its terms and conditions, most users are not aware or even interested in the fact that their location information is stored in databases and monetized by selling it to third-party companies. Regarding this situation, we developed a study with the aim to assess perception, concerns and awareness from users about their location information. Methods: This work is based on an exploratory survey applied to the university community, mainly from the North Coast of Colombia, to measure the perception of location privacy of users with mobile devices. The questionnaire was applied using Google Forms. The survey has nineteen questions organized in three sections: personal information, identification of privacy and privacy management. These questions were designed to know the users’ perceptions of privacy concerns in LBS and any actions they take to preserve it. Results: The results show that, in general, the respondents do not have a real concern regarding the privacy of their geolocation data, and the majority is not willing to pay to protect their privacy. Conclusions: This type of surveys can generate awareness among participants about the use of their private information. The results expose in this paper can be used to create government policies and regulations by technology companies about the privacy management.",,,Ingenieria y Universidad,,,,2019-02-21,2019,2019-02-21,,23,1,,All OA; Gold,Article,"Gamarra-Acosta, Margarita; Meriño-Fuentes, Ines; Calabria-Sarmiento, Juan; Gutierrez-Acosta, Omar; Barrios-Barrios, Mauricio; Leal-Narvaez, Nallig Eduardo; Wightman-Rojas, Pedro Mario","Gamarra-Acosta, Margarita (Universidad del Norte); Meriño-Fuentes, Ines (Universidad del Norte); Calabria-Sarmiento, Juan (Universidad del Norte); Gutierrez-Acosta, Omar (Universidad del Norte); Barrios-Barrios, Mauricio (Universidad del Norte); Leal-Narvaez, Nallig Eduardo (Universidad Autonoma del Caribe); Wightman-Rojas, Pedro Mario (Universidad del Norte.

The objective of this cross-sectional descriptive study is to analyze the association between sociodemographic factors and the consumption of fresh and processed meat in Spanish university students. This study is part of a cohort of 11 Spanish universities with 9862 university students (UniHcos Project). A descriptive analysis and a chi2 test were carried out to assess differences between personal and sociodemographic variables and meat consumption, and binary logistic regression analysis to assess factors associated with consumption; 19.9% and 73.5% met the recommendations for meat-fresh and meat-processed consumption, respectively. Only 3.8% of students meet the recommendations for both fresh and processed meat. Statistically significant differences were found between sex, BMI, employment, housing, and coexistence regarding compliance with recommendations. Female employed students living in rental accommodations with a partner are more likely to meet the recommendations for fresh meats while male, normal weight, employed students living in rental accommodations with a partner are more likely to meet the recommendations for processed meats. There is a lack of compliance with the recommendations for consumption of fresh meat in Spanish university students, differences in compliance among students of differing regions and an association with sex, employment, housing, and coexistence regarding compliance.","To the research group of the UniHcos Project of each one of the participating universities for the contribution of the information and the database for the study: Jose Miguel Martínez Sanz (Universidad de Alicante), Javier Llorca, Inés Gómez Acebo (Universidad de Cantabria), Aurora Bueno-Cavanillas and Eladio Jiménez-Mejías (Universidad de Granada), Juan Alguacil Ojeda (Universidad de Huelva), Miguel Delgado-Rodríguez (Universidad de Jaén), Vicente Martín (Universidad de León), Ana Almaraz Gómez (Universidad de Valladollid) and Carlos Ayán Pérez (Universidad de Vigo); likewise, to the students who participated in the study.

The reaction mechanism remains unclear. Three possible pathways proposed for the reaction are the iminium route, an enamine intermediate, and the Knoevenagel pathway. However, when thiourea was used, no theoretical calculations were reported. Thus, based on the literature, the iminium pathway was used to obtain evidence explaining the lack of reactivity of 2,4-dihydroxybenzaldehyde towards the Biginelli adduct, compared with 4-hydroxybenzaldehyde. This computational study, carried out using the B3LYP/6-31++G(d,p) level of theory, showed an increment of 150 kJ/mol in the activation energy of the slowest pathway, due to the presence of a hydroxyl group in position 2 (ortho) of the aromatic aldehyde, decreasing its reactivity. Natural bond orbital (NBO) calculations suggest that the determinant steps are simultaneous, i.e., the polarization of the carbonyl group and its corresponding protonation by the hydrogen of the SH fragment of the thiourea tautomer. The activation enthalpy values suggest that the nucleophile attack takes place later on the compound 2,4-dihydroxybenzaldehyde compared to 4-hydroxybenzaldehyde-TS, confirming that the OH group in position 2 hinders the condensation reaction.",Virginia Flores-Morales is grateful to Carlos F.

In fact, mixing and placement are conducted at lower temperatures leading to energy savings, a reduction of asphalt aging, fume and odour releasing, and a general decrease of airborne emissions. However, there are still several concerns related to the high variability of reclaimed asphalt pavement (RAP), the lack of standard mix-design procedures and the fair/low mechanical performance often achieved especially due to poor moisture resistance. On other side, the addition of crumb rubber into hot mix asphalts is considered an environmentally-friendly and cost-effective practice in several countries. Producing bituminous cold mixes containing crumb rubber to develop a ""greener"" paving material with a performance level comparable to that of conventional materials, represents a great challenge to materials engineering. This paper presents the results of a laboratory investigation concerning the mixdesign characteristics of cold 100%-recycled asphalt emulsion mixes, using crumb rubber to improve cold recycling engineered properties.

Recently, the use of Construction Waste and Demolition (C&WD) in different construction fields has been reported by different authors as its composition includes a wide range of materials. One example of C&WD with potential use in Pavement Infrastructure is Recycled Concrete Aggregate (RCA). RCA have been studied as suitable replacement to Natural Aggregates (NA) in asphalt pavement, results have shown good performance and important environmental and economic benefits from the use of RCA with respect to conventional aggregates. This paper aims to evaluate the feasibility of using RCA obtained from different resources as a replacement material to NA in asphalt concrete mixtures. NA from regional representative quarries were used in this investigation. Instead, RCA was obtained from two different sources; one source, was obtained from a concrete pavement demolition project (Recycled Concrete Aggregate Pavement source-RCAP), and the second source was obtained from the demolition of some concrete structures in a baseball stadium in Barranquilla's city (Recycled Concrete Aggregate Building source – RCAB). Characterization of both RCA and NA includes determination of physical, mechanical and chemical properties according to Colombian Standards. Laboratory test results indicates that RCA could be a viable option as potential replacement of natural aggregate in asphalt pavement and to reduce the carbon footprint during the production of asphalt mixtures. Nevertheless, some intrinsic properties of the material must be considered with special care, e.g. absorption, gradation, abrasion resistance, pH, among others. Finally, scanning electron microscope (SEM) techniques were used to provide images on RCA's surface morphology and its composition, giving significant differences between RCA and NA.",,,IOP Conference Series Materials Science and Engineering,,,,2019-02-24,2019,2019-02-24,,471,10,102045,All OA; Gold,Article,"Martinez-Arguelles, Gilberto; Coll, Margareth Dugarte; Pumarejo, Luis Guillermo Fuentes; Cotte, Edgar Humberto Sanchez; Rondon, Hugo; Pacheco, Carlos Albeiro; Martinez, Julian Yepes; Espinoza, Ricardo Gabriel Lagares","Martinez-Arguelles, Gilberto (Universidad del Norte, km 5 vía Puerto Colombia, Barranquilla, Colombia); Coll, Margareth Dugarte (Universidad del Norte, km 5 vía Puerto Colombia, Barranquilla, Colombia); Pumarejo, Luis Guillermo Fuentes (Universidad del Norte, km 5 vía Puerto Colombia, Barranquilla, Colombia); Cotte, Edgar Humberto Sanchez (Universidad Distrital Francisco José de Caldas, Carrera 7 No. 40B – 53, Bogotá D.C., Colombia); Rondon, Hugo (Universidad Distrital Francisco José de Caldas, Carrera 7 No. 40B – 53, Bogotá D.C., Colombia); Pacheco, Carlos Albeiro (Universidad del Norte, km 5 vía Puerto Colombia, Barranquilla, Colombia); Martinez, Julian Yepes (Universidad del Norte, km 5 vía Puerto Colombia, Barranquilla, Colombia); Espinoza, Ricardo Gabriel Lagares (Universidad del Norte, km 5 vía Puerto Colombia, Barranquilla, Colombia)",,"Martinez-Arguelles, Gilberto (Universidad del Norte); Coll, Margareth Dugarte (Universidad del Norte); Pumarejo, Luis Guillermo Fuentes (Universidad del Norte); Cotte, Edgar Humberto Sanchez (District University of Bogotá); Rondon, Hugo (District University of Bogotá); Pacheco, Carlos Albeiro (Universidad del Norte); Martinez, Julian Yepes (Universidad del Norte); Espinoza, Ricardo Gabriel Lagares (Universidad del Norte)",23,11,,4.49,https://doi.org/10.1088/1757-899x/471/10/102045,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1112373230,33 Built Environment and Design; 3302 Building; 34 Chemical Sciences; 3403 Macromolecular and Materials Chemistry; 40 Engineering; 4005 Civil Engineering,12 Responsible Consumption and Production; 13 Climate Action

1706,pub.1121402370,10.3390/pr7100673,,,CFD-DEM Modeling and Simulation Coupled to a Global Thermodynamic Analysis Methodology for Evaluating Energy Performance: Biofertilizer Industry,"This work develops a methodology based on real chemical plant data collected from a Nitrogen-Phosphorus-Potassium fertilizer (NPK) cooling rotary drum. By blending thermodynamic variables given by global energy and mass balances with computational fluid dynamics-discrete element method (CFD-DEM) modeling and simulation, the methodology provides an initial approximation to the understanding of heat transfer inside industry rotary coolers. The NPK cooling process was modeled in CFD software Simcenter STAR − CCM + 13.06.011 using a Eulerian–Lagrangian scheme through a coupled CFD-DEM method using one-way coupling. The average temperature of the NPK particles was obtained as well as the average mass flow of the particles dropping as the drum was rotating. The analysis was performed for two-particle diameters (8 and 20 mm) during 17.5 s. The average heat transfer coefficient between the fluid and the NPK particles during the simulated time was obtained. A thermodynamic analysis was carried out using instantaneous energy and mass balances. Prandtl, Nusselt, and Reynolds numbers were obtained for each simulated time step. Finally, through a non-linear regression using the Marquardt method, a correlation between Prandtl, Nusselt, and Reynolds number was developed that allowed analyzing the rotating drum. Results showed that the proposed methodology could serve as a useful tool during the design and analysis of any given rotary cooler, allowing calculation of the heat transfer coefficient and obtaining the process variables that could expand the machine operational capabilities due to the knowledge of the Nusselt number as a function of the drum working parameters.",,This work was funded by COLCIENCIAS Research Call 757 and the Office of Management and Academic Development at Universidad del Norte.,Processes,,,,2019-09-29,2019,2019-09-29,,7,10,673,All OA; Gold,Article,"Burgos-Florez, Francisco; Bula, Antonio; Marquez, John; Ferrer, Alberto; Sanjuan, Marco","Burgos-Florez, Francisco (Department of Mechanical Engineering, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla 081007, Colombia;, fjburgos@uninorte.edu.co, (F.B.-F.);, msanjuan@uninorte.edu.co, (M.S.)); Bula, Antonio (Department of Mechanical Engineering, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla 081007, Colombia;, fjburgos@uninorte.edu.co, (F.B.-F.);, msanjuan@uninorte.edu.co, (M.S.)); Marquez, John (Engineering Department, Monomeros Colombo-Venezolanos, Vía 40 Las Flores, Barranquilla 080001, Colombia;, jmarquez@monomeros.com.co, (J.M.);, aferrer@monomeros.com.co, (A.F.)); Ferrer, Alberto (Engineering Department, Monomeros Colombo-Venezolanos, Vía 40 Las Flores, Barranquilla 080001, Colombia;, jmarquez@monomeros.com.co, (J.M.);, aferrer@monomeros.com.co, (A.F.)); Sanjuan, Marco (Department of Mechanical Engineering, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla 081007, Colombia;, fjburgos@uninorte.edu.co, (F.B.-F.);, msanjuan@uninorte.edu.co, (M.S.))","Bula, Antonio (Universidad del Norte; Department of Mechanical Engineering, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla 081007, Colombia;, fjburgos@uninorte.edu.co, (F.B.-F.);, msanjuan@uninorte.edu.co, (M.S.))","Burgos-Florez, Francisco (Universidad del Norte; Department of Mechanical Engineering, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla 081007, Colombia;, fjburgos@uninorte.edu.co, (F.B.-F.);, msanjuan@uninorte.edu.co, (M.S.)); Bula, Antonio (Universidad del Norte; Department of Mechanical Engineering, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla 081007, Colombia;, fjburgos@uninorte.edu.co, (F.B.-F.);, msanjuan@uninorte.edu.co, (M.S.)); Marquez, John (Engineering Department, Monomeros Colombo-Venezolanos, Vía 40 Las Flores, Barranquilla 080001, Colombia;, jmarquez@monomeros.com.co, (J.M.);, aferrer@monomeros.com.co, (A.F.); Engineering Department, Monomeros Colombo-Venezolanos, Vía 40 Las Flores, Barranquilla 080001, Colombia;, jmarquez@monomeros.com.co, (J.M.);, aferrer@monomeros.com.co, (A.F.)); Ferrer, Alberto (Engineering Department, Monomeros Colombo-Venezolanos, Vía 40 Las Flores, Barranquilla 080001, Colombia;, jmarquez@monomeros.com.co, (J.M.);, aferrer@monomeros.com.co, (A.F.); Engineering Department, Monomeros Colombo-Venezolanos, Vía 40 Las Flores, Barranquilla 080001, Colombia;, jmarquez@monomeros.com.co, (J.M.);, aferrer@monomeros.com.co, (A.F.)); Sanjuan, Marco (Universidad del Norte; Department of Mechanical Engineering, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla 081007, Colombia;, fjburgos@uninorte.edu.co, (F.B.-F.);, msanjuan@uninorte.edu.co, (M.S.))",3,1,,0.55,https://www.mdpi.com/2227-9717/7/10/673/pdf?version=1569745217,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1121402370,40 Engineering; 4012 Fluid Mechanics and Thermal Engineering,7 Affordable and Clean Energy

In 2013–2016, the Caribbean experienced the worst drought since the 1950s, and climate projections for the southern Caribbean predict less rainfall by the end of the 21st century. We assessed streamflow response to drought for a watershed in the Colombian Caribbean by analyzing the effects of drought length and land cover on streamflow recovery. We generated a calibrated SWAT model and created annual and monthly drought scenarios from rainfall records. We used our model to predict water yield for selected land covers (wet forest, shade coffee, shrub, and dry forest) under drought conditions. Annual scenarios resulted in water yield reductions of ~15 mm month−1 (wet forest, coffee, and shrub) and 5 mm month−1 (dry forest) for the first month after a two-year drought. Maximum water yield reductions for monthly scenarios occurred after a 10-month drought and were ~100 mm month−1 (wet forest, coffee, and shrub) and 20 mm month−1 (dry forest). Streamflow recovered within nine months (annual scenarios), and two to eight months (monthly scenarios) after drought termination. Drought response seems to be conditioned by climatic factors (rainfall seasonality and spatial variability) and catchment properties.","We gratefully acknowledge the support provided in the field by Hector Meza, Doña Mirosalba Meza and Wilington Meza.

Questionnaire of 90 symptoms (SCL- 90-R) is frequently used in the exploration of mental health, but there are no studies on its validity or sensitivity to change in Colombian clinical population. The objective is to establish the structural and psychometric properties of SCL-90-R for Colombian clinical samples, and to identify differences in relation to gender and sensitivity to change. Methodology. Longitudinal design with a three-month difference between the first and second observation. 214 patients participated (51.9 % men and 43.1 % women), with a mean age of 26 years (deviation 11.3). Both the confirmatory factorial analysis and the exploratory one were carried out to search for the best validity indexes. Instruments: SCL-90-R, and sociodemographic questionnaire and characteristics of psychotherapy. Results. Levels of reliability were identified as adequate with Cronbach alphas 0.74 to 0.90. The confirmatory factor analysis showed low goodness of fit on the indexes: Comparative goodness indexes = 0.67, Tucker- Lewis index = 0.65 and normalized adjustment index = 0.508, and approximate value of the mean square error of 0.068. The final solution of the exploratory factor analysis showed a Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin index of 0.92 and a significant result in the Bartlett sphericity test (Chi square = 3,682.9, gl = 603, p-value < 0.001). This structure included 36 items for a sample/item size ratio = 5.9 and explained 60.7 % of the total variance, with seven of the nine factors that the original questionnaire contains: depression, obsessions/compulsions, somatization, anxiety, hostility, phobic anxiety and paranoid ideation. Indices of sensitivity to change were identified for both versions. Regarding the difference according to sex, significant differences were reported in some factors, with higher scores in women; for the original questionnaire, differences were found in the anxiety factor, and on the abbreviated questionnaire in the depression factor and hostility. Conclusions. The original questionnaire reported adequate levels of reliability. The abbreviated questionnaire, generated through exploratory factor analysis, reported adequate levels of both reliability and validity. Both versions of the scale presented sensitivity to detect changes in a second evaluation moment. [Londoño NH, Agudelo DM, Martínez E, Anguila D, Aguirre DC, Arias JF.

1677,pub.1113919177,10.28945/4321,,,Online Teacher-Students Interactions Using WhatsApp in a Law Course,"Aim/Purpose: The purpose of this study was to analyze the online teacher- students’ interactions using WhatsApp, an instant messaging tool, and to identify the students’ view towards the use of that tool in a law course from a higher education institution in Colombia.

Background: WhatsApp is a trending tool that is ultimately being used in academic contexts. However, little research is known on the types of interactions that occur when teachers are involved in student conversation groups. 

Methodology: This is a mixed- method study. Participants completed an opinion survey in order to establish students’ satisfaction towards the use of WhatsApp to complement face-to- face classes, a focus group to explore in depth the students´ opinions and acceptance of the WhatsApp tool for academic purposes and a chat conversation register to analyze the different types of interactions. The sample included 166 Law students.

Contribution: Our contribution is to enrich the current literature on the interactions between teachers and students in a virtual environment where teachers can monitor the different academic tasks, coordinate in real time and analyze the students’ interactions that impact on the students’ ´learning process.

Findings: The findings found in this research reveal that the different interactions between students and teachers in order to facilitate learning should be valued not only the relationships of knowledge construction, but also the social and interdependence presences due to the fact that in traditional learning processes they are not usually taken into account.

Recommendations for Practitioners: The results of our research give evidence of how students in each subgroup (Plaintiffs, Defendant or Judges) diversify the use of the WhatsApp tool. Whether it is to organize, coordinate meetings, plan work, make quick inquiries, clear doubts, share messages and especially be able to communicate in real time and directly with the teacher, thus facilitating the learning process in the classroom. 

Recommendation for Researchers: This study identified that law university students appear to have a special preference for the WhatsApp tool, thanks to the immediacy of being able to coordinate tasks and communicate with the teacher, in comparison to using other technological means such as email. We recommend continuing to explore the use of WhatsApp in other different disciplines in order to compare the teacher-student interactions.

Impact on Society: The analysis of academic interactions through WhatsApp may lead to further exploration of innovative forms of communication of teachers with their millennial students and new teacher roles to design constructive learning environments.

Future Research: Future studies are suggested with regard to this topic and it would be interesting to carry out research work that deeply analyzes the role the instructor plays when participating in a WhatsApp chat group with academic purposes and how it may condition the way students interact.",,,Journal of Information Technology Education Research,,,,2019,2019,2019,,18,,231-252,All OA; Gold,Article,"R Robles, Heydy; Guerrero, Janitza; LLinas, Humberto; MONTERO, PEDRO","R Robles, Heydy (Universidad del Norte); Guerrero, Janitza (Universidad del Norte); LLinas, Humberto (Universidad del Norte); MONTERO, PEDRO (UNIVERSIDAD DEL NORTE)",,"R Robles, Heydy (Universidad del Norte); Guerrero, Janitza (Universidad del Norte); LLinas, Humberto (Universidad del Norte); MONTERO, PEDRO (Universidad del Norte)",28,9,,16.01,https://doi.org/10.28945/4321,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1113919177,39 Education; 3901 Curriculum and Pedagogy; 3903 Education Systems,4 Quality Education

Adolescence is the stage of greatest biological, psychological and social vulnerability, with regard to the development and acquisition of lifestyle habits; thus the need to identify and monitor factors such as obesity and cardiovascular risk. Objective. Correlate body mass index, waist circumference and cardiovascular risk in young students of Popayán, Colombia. Methodology. Descriptivecorrelati with a sample of 1,105 students of an average age of 13.47±1.09 years between August 2014 and December 2015. The body mass index, waist circumference and blood pressure were evaluated. Results. Most of the students’ parameters were normal in terms of body mass index (normal weight 44.6%, overweight 20.2% and obese 28.9%) and blood pressure. A general increase in abdominal girth (39.3%) was detected. Discussion. Although the students’ values were normal in contrast with the existing literature, there is an anticipated risk in relation to cardiovascular indices, which, according to international research, gives rise to follow-up and assessment of significant biological markers that determine major health issues. Conclusions. It is clear that the students’ values are normal for most of the variables, except for waist circumference. An increased risk was found in women, which allows us to establish a high and very high correlation that contrasts with cardiovascular risk. [Molano-Tobar NJ, Vélez-Tobar RA, Molano- Tobar DX.

This method consists of two main phases. The phase I relates what the market wants (the WHATs) with the manufacturing decision categories (the HOWs). The WHATs are expressed as the manufacturing objectives (i.e. cost, quality, delivery, flexibility and innovation) and the HOWs are expressed as the strategic manufacturing decisions areas (such as, facilities, capacity, process technology, new product design and control systems). A matrix is built, where the rows are the WHATs and the columns are the HOWs. The entries of the matrix are the relationships between both types of concepts. The “roof” of the house is the relationships between the manufacturing decisions (the HOWS). The analysis of this House allows managers to generate strategic action plans in order to fill the gap between what the market wants and what manufacturing is achieving. The phase II builds another house, where the WHATs are the manufacturing decision areas and the HOWS are strategic manufacturing plans. In this phase the strategic action plans are ranked. The application of the proposed method in a company that manufactures industrial tanks is shown.",,,Procedia Manufacturing,,,,2019,2019,,2019,39,,843-850,All OA; Gold,Article,"Oddershede, Astrid M.; Quezada, Luis E.; Valenzuela, Juan E.; Palominos, Pedro I.; Lopez-Ospina, Hector","Oddershede, Astrid M.

Generally, the LCA is performed for all stages of the evaluated product; nevertheless, based on the goal and scope of an LCA study, several phases may be considered, whereas others may be excluded. In this study, an LCA was conducted to evaluate the potential environmental benefits related to the use of recycled concrete aggregates (RCA) as a partial replacement of natural aggregates in the production of Warm Mix Asphalt (WMA). In order to estimate the potential environmental impacts associated with the use of these alternative resources in the construction and rehabilitation of road pavements in Barranquilla, Colombia, primary data were collected in some companies in the region. The SimaPro 8.4.0 software was used for modelling the processes analyzed in the case study and all the life cycle inputs and outputs related to the functional unit were characterized during life cycle impact assessment (LCIA) phase into potential impacts according to the impact assessment methodology TRACI v.2.1. The pavement life cycle phases and processes included within the system boundaries were the following: (1) extraction and processing of natural and recycled aggregates and production of asphalt binder, (2) transportation of materials, and (3) production of the asphalt mixtures. Three percentages of RCA replacements were analyzed:15, 30 and 45%. By comparing both asphalt mixtures with different RCA replacements levels, it was shown that RCA use implies an increase in the optimal asphalt content, which in turn, originates higher potential environmental impacts than those stemming from conventional mixtures.",,,IOP Conference Series Materials Science and Engineering,,,,2019-09-01,2019,2019-09-18,2019-09-01,603,5,052016,All OA; Gold,Article,"A., Daniela L.

This innovative material offers several environmental benefits, such as reducing water runoff volumes and peak flowrates, enabling the natural recharge of groundwater reservoirs and filtering contaminants in water, among others. Despite the promising environmental advantages of this material, some limitations remain in the fields of application due to its mechanical performance and the limited availability of mix-design guidelines. The current study aimed at investigating the effect of water proportion, cement content and compaction energy on volumetric and mechanical properties of pervious concrete mixtures. The influence of these variables were statistically analyzed and modeled through regressions in order to develop a primal procedure for proportioning. Outcomes from ANOVA showed that all the studied factors significantly contributed to both strength and porosity, being cement/aggregate ratio and compaction energy the most influential. The resulting regression models had fair-to-good coefficients of determination; models were used to generate contour graphs of the material properties that were plotted in order to develop user-friendly mix proportioning schemes.",,,IOP Conference Series Materials Science and Engineering,,,,2019-02-23,2019,2019-02-23,,471,3,032060,All OA; Gold,Article,"Bonicelli, Alessandra; Pérez-Osorio, Andrés; Fuentes, Luis","Bonicelli, Alessandra (Universidad del Norte, Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, km 5 via Puerto Colombia, Barranquilla, Colombia); Pérez-Osorio, Andrés (Universidad del Norte, Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, km 5 via Puerto Colombia, Barranquilla, Colombia); Fuentes, Luis (Universidad del Norte, Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, km 5 via Puerto Colombia, Barranquilla, Colombia)",,"Bonicelli, Alessandra (Universidad del Norte); Pérez-Osorio, Andrés (Universidad del Norte); Fuentes, Luis (Universidad del Norte)",2,0,,0.49,https://doi.org/10.1088/1757-899x/471/3/032060,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1112373454,33 Built Environment and Design; 3302 Building; 40 Engineering; 4005 Civil Engineering,

The samples obtained were characterized structural and optically by both X-ray diffraction (XRD) and diffuse reflectance spectrophotometry. The XRD analysis showed the formation of the Wurtzite type structure proper of ZnO up to Sulfur mole fraction of x = 0.50. It was observed that this phase disappears at a mole fraction of x = 0.80 and converts to Cubic Zinc blende type structure proper of Zinc Sulfide. Furthermore, was observed that increasing calcination temperature higher crystallinity was achieved for all set of samples. The Rietveld refinement method was used to obtain lattice parameters for Wurtzite structure as well as cell volume and the ratio c/a. These parameters show slight incremental changes in relation to S doped ZnO crystalline structure. On the other hand, it was determined optically, that increasing the dopant concentration to a mole fraction x = 0.50, a maximum reduction of the band gap from 3,29 eV to 2,70 eV was reached, while increasing the calcination temperature shows a general tendency to band gap reduction. Photocatalytic activity of Sulfur doped and pure ZnO powders were tested for degradation of p, p'-DDT under visible light, measuring the p, p'-DDT time-dependent concentration by gas chromatography-μECD coupling. The results revealed that the sulfur modified ZnO material showed an improved photocatalytic activity towards p, p'-DDT under visible light illumination respect to pure ZnO.",,,Journal of Physics Conference Series,,,,2019-06-01,2019,2019-06-17,2019-06-01,1247,1,012002,All OA; Gold,Article,"Arenas, Javier Mena; Varela, Julio Mass; Albor, Milton Manotas; Téllez, David Landínez","Arenas, Javier Mena (Department of Physics and Geosciences, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); Varela, Julio Mass (Department of Physics and Geosciences, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); Albor, Milton Manotas (Department of Physics and Geosciences, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); Téllez, David Landínez (Department of Physics, Universidad Nacional de Colombia, Bogotá, Colombia)",,"Arenas, Javier Mena (Universidad del Norte); Varela, Julio Mass (Universidad del Norte); Albor, Milton Manotas (Universidad del Norte); Téllez, David Landínez (National University of Colombia)",0,0,,,https://doi.org/10.1088/1742-6596/1247/1/012002,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1117326726,51 Physical Sciences,

During these years, statistical and documentary analysis have shown that the resources of international cooperation came, mostly, from the two most important partners of Colombia: the United States and the European Union. The first country, privileging a military component; the second actor, based solely on civil assistance. These two different, and sometimes opposed, policies of cooperation for peace reflect distinct interests in both donors (US and EU) and the petitioners (the Colombian State and its civil society). However, the two different cooperation policies converged around the Havana dialogues (2012-2016), and with the signing of the agreements, Colombia took a path towards a new and unprecedented scenario: the “post-conflict”, better known as “post-agreement”. It is precisely this convergence of the two major hegemonic approaches to international cooperation that makes Colombia a sui generis country when it comes to talking about scenarios of conflict and a transition towards post-conflict contexts that could be representative for other geographical circumstances, feeding and fostering the debate between “liberal peace” and “post-liberal peace” for future specific research on this topic.",,,Geopolítica(s) Revista de estudios sobre espacio y poder,,,,2019-03-29,2019,2019-03-29,,10,1,107-134,All OA; Gold,Article,"Taborda, Jairo Agudelo; Riccardi, Davide","Taborda, Jairo Agudelo (Universidad del Norte); Riccardi, Davide (Universidad del Norte)",,"Taborda, Jairo Agudelo (Universidad del Norte); Riccardi, Davide (Universidad del Norte)",11,5,,6.56,https://doi.org/10.5209/geop.61477,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1113174538,44 Human Society; 4408 Political Science,"16 Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions"

In the hilly area, fragments of biodiverse tropical dry forest still exist in various states of conservation and degradation. To understand the interrelated social, economic, and ecological transformations in the area, we analyzed land use change on the local scale including the local community’s perception, because the local community is a key actor for sustainable land use. For the analysis of the interrelated social, economic, and ecological processes, we combined visual interpretation of high-resolution satellite imagery, on-site field land use mapping, and a spatial statistical analysis of the distribution of land use classes with in-depth interviews and a participatory GIS workshop, thus benefitting from the complementary methodological strengths of these approaches. The case study is the rural community of El Morro, which exhibits the typical social, economic, and ecological changes of the coastal strip of the western peri-urban area of Barranquilla. The local community perceives a continuous loss of forest area, but observations from on-site field mapping cannot confirm this linear trend. We observed a gradual replacement of traditional land uses such as smallholder agriculture, charcoal production, and cattle breeding by services for tourism, gated community projects for urban dwellers, and infrastructure projects; these spatial developments have several characteristics of rural gentrification. We conclude that the drivers of environmental degradation have changed and the degradation increased. The development projects of external companies have been rejected by the local community and have induced environmental consciousness among community members. Thus, the local community has become an advocate for sustainable land use in the study area.","We thank our colleagues as well as the project coordinators Grischa Brokamp and Yolanda Marcela Celis Pacheco from the Freie Universität Berlin and the Universidad del Norte in Barranquilla for their valuable help, insights, and expertise, which greatly assisted this study.

The Cocinetas Basin is located on the eastern flank of the Guajira Peninsula, northern Colombia (southern Caribbean). During the late Oligocene through the Pliocene, much of the basin was submerged. The extensive deposits in this area suggest a transition from a shallow marine to a fluvio-deltaic system, with a rich record of invertebrate and vertebrate fauna. The elasmobranch assemblages of the early Miocene to the late Pliocene succession in the Cocinetas Basin (Jimol, Castilletes and Ware formations, as well as the Patsúa Valley) are described for the first time. The assemblages include at least 30 taxa of sharks (Squaliformes, Pristiophoriformes, Orectolobiformes, Lamniformes and Carcharhiniformes) and batoids (Rhinopristiformes and Myliobatiformes), of which 24 taxa are reported from the Colombian Neogene for the first time. Paleoecological interpretations are based on the feeding ecology and on estimates of the paleohydrology (relative salinity, temperature) using stable isotope compositions of oxygen in the bioapatite of shark teeth. The isotopic composition of the studied specimens corroborates paleoenvironmental settings for the studied units that were previously estimated based on the sedimentology and biology of the taxa. These Neogene elasmobranch assemblages from the Cocinetas Basin provide new insights into the diversity the sharks and rays inhabiting the coastal and estuarine environments of the northwestern margin of South America, both during the existence of the gateway between the Atlantic and Pacific oceans and following its closure.","This work was supported by the Swiss National Science Foundation (SNF 31003A-149605 to MRSV, SNF 200020-160055/1 to Zoneibe Luz and Torsten Vennemann) and by the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute (National Geographic Society, Anders Foundation, Gregory D. and Jennifer Walston Johnson, 1923 Fund, Universidad del Norte and National Science Foundation EAR 0957679 to Carlos Jaramillo).

It is suggested that it is necessary to do so, because at present, we are in the knowledge and information society. For this, we use the literature review as an investigative method, with which we hope to explain the disadvantages of continuing to use traditional methods and the importance of innovating it through reflective practices and collaborative projects. Then, we will address the skills that need to be developed, to adapt students to the demands of today‘s societies.

Satellite imagery from earth observation missions enable processing big data to gather information about the world. Automatizing the creation of maps that reflect ground truth is a desirable outcome that would aid decision makers to take adequate actions in alignment with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. In order to harness the power that the availability of the new generation of satellites enable, it is necessary to implement techniques capable of handling annotations for the massive volume and variability of high spatial resolution imagery for further processing. However, the availability of public datasets for training machine learning models for image segmentation plays an important role for scalability.This work focuses on bridging remote sensing and computer vision by providing an open source based pipeline for generating machine learning training datasets for road detection in an area of interest. The proposed pipeline addresses road detection as a binary classification problem using road annotations existing in OpenStreetMap for creating masks. For this case study, Planet images of 3m resolution are used for creating a training dataset for road detection in Kenya.",,,The International Archives of the Photogrammetry Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences,,,,2019-08-23,2019,2019-08-23,,XLII-4/W14,,255-260,All OA; Gold,Article,"Zurbaran, M.

Adorno: Metafísica Negativa,"This article is based on Adorno’s reflections on a new idea of philosophy developed in Negative Dialectics, specifically in the section “Meditations on Metaphysics”. In this passage, the author develops a critique of the categories of traditional metaphysics that serve as the basis for the philosophical proposal of the Enlightenment, both in Kant and Hegel. Adorno considers that philosophy has been an accomplice of barbarism in history. In this way, Auschwitz as a new category of analysis and metaphorical expression of irrationality and barbarism that destroys the human and the natural environment, allows the exercise of reflection. For this reason, for Adorno it is urgent to rethink philosophy after Auschwitz to prevent new forms of terror from repeating themselves. A new idea of metaphysics with a horizon of understanding,intervention, transformation and resignification is put forward. In short, a negative metaphysics that is directed towards what has been discarded by the traditional rationality.",,,Estudios de Filosofía,,,,2019-01,2019,,2019-01,0,59,213-232,All OA; Gold,Article,"Peña, Arlex Berrio","Peña, Arlex Berrio (Universidad del Norte)",,"Peña, Arlex Berrio (Universidad del Norte)",1,1,,0.99,https://revistas.udea.edu.co/index.php/estudios_de_filosofia/article/download/331649/pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1111763255,50 Philosophy and Religious Studies; 5002 History and Philosophy Of Specific Fields,

PCPC is composed by coarse aggregate, little or no fine aggregate, a reduced water/cement ratio and additives. In consequence to its lack of fine aggregate, PCPC has high porosity and lower strength in comparison with traditional concrete, thus its main applications are in low traffic areas such as parking lots, sidewalks, residential streets, path in natural areas. Within its benefits stand out the simplification of drain system, the management of storm water runoff and the reduction of pavement infrastructure costs. Pervious concrete pavement is worldwide recognized for its environmental benefits; the use of pervious concrete for urban pavements produce a reduction of traffic noise, as well as the water and soil pollution, it allows the natural recharge of the groundwater and helps in limiting the heat island effect, due to its clear surface and permitting the soil transpiration. In the very few years a new application of this material has been implemented: pervious concrete layer as an overlay over existing concrete slab. The resulting pavement structure may be used for high traffic volume roads, thanks to the support of the stiff concrete slab, with the addition of the benefits of the optimal pervious concrete surface characteristics. In the present investigation work, design methodologies, construction techniques, laboratory measurements and long term evaluations of this innovative material are presented. Pervious concrete has proven to have a broad scope and a promising future for the research of eco-friendly materials for the construction of pavements throughout the world. In conclusion, the case of study of the application of a pervious concrete overlay in an airport infrastructure is proposed. In particular, the pavement structural behaviour was studied and verified for determining the suitability for solving drainage problems in an aircraft parking lot.",,,IOP Conference Series Materials Science and Engineering,,,,2019-02-23,2019,2019-02-23,,471,3,032061,All OA; Gold,Article,"Bonicelli, Alessandra; Pianeta, Lorena Rico","Bonicelli, Alessandra (Universidad del Norte, Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering – Km 5 via Puerto Colombia, Barranquilla, Colombia); Pianeta, Lorena Rico (Universidad del Norte, Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering – Km 5 via Puerto Colombia, Barranquilla, Colombia)",,"Bonicelli, Alessandra (Universidad del Norte); Pianeta, Lorena Rico (Universidad del Norte)",3,2,,0.62,https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1757-899X/471/3/032061/pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1112373455,33 Built Environment and Design; 3302 Building; 40 Engineering; 4005 Civil Engineering; 41 Environmental Sciences; 4104 Environmental Management,

These efforts have originated the numerical methods known at present, which allow formulating mathematical problems that can be solved using logical and arithmetic operations. This paper presents a comparison between the numerical optimization algorithms golden section search and simulated annealing, which are tested in four different scenarios. These scenarios are functions implemented with a feedforward neural network, which emulate a partial shading behavior in photovoltaic modules with local and global maxima. The presence of the local maxima makes it difficult to track the maximum power point, necessary to obtain the highest possible performance of the photovoltaic module. The programming of the algorithms was performed in C language. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithms to find global maxima. However, the golden section search method showed a better performance in terms of percentage of error, computation time and number of iterations, except in test scenario number three, where a better percentage of error was obtained with the simulated annealing algorithm for a computational temperature of 1000.",,"This research was funded by Patrimonio Autónomo Fondo Nacional de Financiamiento para la Ciencia, la Tecnología y la Innovación Francisco José de Caldas, grant number 193-219 and the APC was funded by Vicerrectoría de Investigación of the Universidad del Magdalena.",Computation,,,,2019-08-22,2019,2019-08-22,,7,3,43,All OA; Gold,Article,"Guillot, Jordan; Restrepo-Leal, Diego; Robles-Algarín, Carlos; Oliveros, Ingrid","Guillot, Jordan (Facultad de Ingeniería, Universidad del Magdalena, Santa Marta 470003, Colombia; Departamento de Ingeniería Eléctrica y Electrónica, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla 080015, Colombia); Restrepo-Leal, Diego (Facultad de Ingeniería, Universidad del Magdalena, Santa Marta 470003, Colombia); Robles-Algarín, Carlos (Facultad de Ingeniería, Universidad del Magdalena, Santa Marta 470003, Colombia); Oliveros, Ingrid (Departamento de Ingeniería Eléctrica y Electrónica, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla 080015, Colombia)","Guillot, Jordan (University of Magdalena; Universidad del Norte)","Guillot, Jordan (University of Magdalena; Universidad del Norte); Restrepo-Leal, Diego (University of Magdalena); Robles-Algarín, Carlos (University of Magdalena); Oliveros, Ingrid (Universidad del Norte)",9,1,,3.69,https://www.mdpi.com/2079-3197/7/3/43/pdf?version=1566467570,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1120508514,46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4601 Applied Computing; 4613 Theory Of Computation,

Nevertheless, asphalt pavements, commonly also known as ""flexible pavements"" have demonstrated to present high moisture susceptibility, low resistance to several chemical agents and poor long-term performance. Moreover, both high and low temperatures can produce different damages in flexible pavement such as rutting and cracking. On the other hand, rigid pavements have been losing popularity mainly due to the presence of transversal joints, required to consider the expansion of concrete slabs that produce a reduction of user-comfort and safety. In addition, Concrete pavement need longer construction procedure and a curing time before opening to traffic. Hence, a new technology has been developed in the last years in order to gather the essential properties that characterize rigid and flexible pavements. This technology, usually called semi-flexible pavements, or grouted macadam, consist in producing a highly open porous asphalt mix (voids around 25-30%) and filling the voids with selected cementitious grout. Thus, the ease and speed of construction of flexible pavement, joint with the optimal surface properties is combined with the concrete good mechanical behaviour, resistance to chemical agents and limited temperature susceptibility. The final product is a high performance pavement material, particularly indicated to high traffic volume roads, airports, ports, and industrial areas. However, the fact that this type of pavement is still innovative compared to rigid and flexible pavement has made that there is no standard procedure to produce this type of mixture. For this reason, the characteristics of the mixtures vary with authors and in the different real scale applications. In this manner, this paper aims at studying the most significant advances in the area of semi-flexible pavements, describing, comparing and statistically analysing the different investigation and practical experiences. Mix-design details, i.e., asphalt binder characteristics, aggregate properties and cementitious grout composition are deeply investigated, as well as mixing and compaction procedures, lab testing and real application performance of this innovative and promising pavement material.",,,IOP Conference Series Materials Science and Engineering,,,,2019-02-23,2019,2019-02-23,,471,3,032062,All OA; Gold,Article,"Bonicelli, Alessandra; Preciado, Jaime; Rueda, Ana; Duarte, Alejandro","Bonicelli, Alessandra (Universidad del Norte, Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering – Km 5 vía Puerto Colombia, Barranquilla, Colombia); Preciado, Jaime (Universidad del Norte, Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering – Km 5 vía Puerto Colombia, Barranquilla, Colombia); Rueda, Ana (Universidad del Norte, Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering – Km 5 vía Puerto Colombia, Barranquilla, Colombia); Duarte, Alejandro (Universidad del Norte, Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering – Km 5 vía Puerto Colombia, Barranquilla, Colombia)",,"Bonicelli, Alessandra (Universidad del Norte); Preciado, Jaime (Universidad del Norte); Rueda, Ana (Universidad del Norte); Duarte, Alejandro (Universidad del Norte)",16,12,,3.91,https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1757-899X/471/3/032062/pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1112373456,33 Built Environment and Design; 3302 Building; 40 Engineering; 4005 Civil Engineering,
1462,pub.1113474553,10.3390/en12081437,,,Instantaneous in-Cylinder Volume Considering Deformation and Clearance due to Lubricating Film in Reciprocating Internal Combustion Engines,"A new methodology for predicting the real instantaneous in-cylinder volume in the combustion chamber of a reciprocating internal combustion engine is implemented. The mathematical model developed as part of this methodology, takes into consideration the deformations due to pressure and inertial forces, via a deformation constant adjusted through ANSYS®, using a high-precision CAD model of a SOKAN SK-MDF300 engine. The deformation constant was obtained from the CAD model using the computational tool ANSYS® and the pressure data was obtained from the engine running at three regimes: 1500, 2500, and 3500 rpm. The results were compared with previous models reported in the literature, showing that the deformation constant obtained has a smaller variation among cycles, which leads to a more precise value of the mechanical deformations. Furthermore, to have a more accurate model of the instantaneous volume variation, a factor taking into consideration the lubricant film behavior is introduced to calculate volumetric variation due to geometrical clearances. The influence of the introduced volumetric variation was evaluated through a process of combustion diagnosis, evidencing the improvement in the predictive capacity of thermodynamic modeling and, therefore, the correct prediction of heat release rate.","Acknowledgments to Universidad del Atlántico, to Sphere Energy Company and Colombian Institute for Scientific and Technological Development (COLCIENCIAS) through the “Convocatoria Nacional para Estudios de Doctorado en Colombia año 2012” for the support provided.",This research received no external funding.,Energies,,,,2019-04-15,2019,2019-04-15,,12,8,1437,All OA; Gold,Article,"Consuegra, Franklin; Bula, Antonio; Guillín, Wilson; Sánchez, Jonathan; Forero, Jorge Duarte","Consuegra, Franklin (Departamento de Ingeniería Mecánica, Universidad del Norte, Km. 5 Vía Puerto Colombia, Área Metropolitana de Barranquilla 080007, Colombia;, franklinc@uninorte.edu.co, (F.C.);, abula@uninorte.edu.co, (A.B.)); Bula, Antonio (Departamento de Ingeniería Mecánica, Universidad del Norte, Km. 5 Vía Puerto Colombia, Área Metropolitana de Barranquilla 080007, Colombia;, franklinc@uninorte.edu.co, (F.C.);, abula@uninorte.edu.co, (A.B.)); Guillín, Wilson (Departamento de Ingeniería Mecánica, Universidad del Atlántico, Carrera 30 Número 8-49, Puerto Colombia, Área Metropolitana de Barranquilla 080007, Colombia;, wguillin@mail.uniatlantico.edu.co, (W.G.);, jonathansanchez@mail.uniatlantico.edu.co, (J.S.)); Sánchez, Jonathan (Departamento de Ingeniería Mecánica, Universidad del Atlántico, Carrera 30 Número 8-49, Puerto Colombia, Área Metropolitana de Barranquilla 080007, Colombia;, wguillin@mail.uniatlantico.edu.co, (W.G.);, jonathansanchez@mail.uniatlantico.edu.co, (J.S.)); Forero, Jorge Duarte (Departamento de Ingeniería Mecánica, Universidad del Atlántico, Carrera 30 Número 8-49, Puerto Colombia, Área Metropolitana de Barranquilla 080007, Colombia;, wguillin@mail.uniatlantico.edu.co, (W.G.);, jonathansanchez@mail.uniatlantico.edu.co, (J.S.))","Forero, Jorge Duarte (University of Atlántico)","Consuegra, Franklin (Universidad del Norte; Departamento de Ingeniería Mecánica, Universidad del Norte, Km. 5 Vía Puerto Colombia, Área Metropolitana de Barranquilla 080007, Colombia;, franklinc@uninorte.edu.co, (F.C.);, abula@uninorte.edu.co, (A.B.)); Bula, Antonio (Universidad del Norte; Departamento de Ingeniería Mecánica, Universidad del Norte, Km. 5 Vía Puerto Colombia, Área Metropolitana de Barranquilla 080007, Colombia;, franklinc@uninorte.edu.co, (F.C.);, abula@uninorte.edu.co, (A.B.)); Guillín, Wilson (University of Atlántico); Sánchez, Jonathan (University of Atlántico); Forero, Jorge Duarte (University of Atlántico)",28,2,,4.49,https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/12/8/1437/pdf?version=1555308342,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1113474553,40 Engineering; 4002 Automotive Engineering; 4017 Mechanical Engineering,

According to binding energy, around −3.15 to −11.91 kJ/mol, the interaction between antimalarial compounds and hydrogel model are exothermic in nature. The extent of interaction found is primaquine > amodiaquine > chloroquine. The natural bond orbital (NBO) calculation and application of second-order perturbation theory show strong charge transfer between the antimalarial and hydrogel model. In addition, the results suggest these interactions are polar in nature, where hydrogen bonds play a principal role in stabilization of the complex. Comparing with the gas-phase, the complexes in the water environment are also stable, with suitable values of Log P (Partition coefficient), and dipolar momentum. Consequently, these results encourage to test acrylamide hydrogels as antimalarial delivery systems.",,This research received no external funding.,Processes,,,,2019-06-26,2019,2019-06-26,,7,7,396,All OA; Gold,Article,"Cortes, Eliceo; Márquez, Edgar; Mora, José R.; Puello, Esneyder; Rangel, Norma; De Moya, Aldemar; Trilleras, Jorge","Cortes, Eliceo (Grupo de Investigación en Ciencias Naturales y Exactas, Departamento de Ciencias Naturales y Exactas, Universidad de la Costa, Barranquilla 080002, Colombia); Márquez, Edgar (Grupo de Investigación en Química y Biología, Departamento de Química y Biología, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla 081007, Colombia); Mora, José R.

This study aims to establish Minimum Qualitative Variables (MQVs) to support the valuation of patents by technology-based firms. The method to determine the MQVs was qualitative and based on a correlation matrix between MQVs identified in the literature and those suggested by experts. The results indicate that identifying such variables, especially the legal kind, is crucial to the valuation process because they suggest the possibility of producing and commercializing the technology in a given geographical context.",,,Journal of Technology Management and Innovation,,,,2019-07,2019,2019-07,,14,2,21-32,All OA; Gold,Article,"Arroyave, Sergio Gmez; Enciso, Eliana Mara Villa; Hernndez, Claudia Nelcy Jimnez","Arroyave, Sergio Gmez (); Enciso, Eliana Mara Villa (); Hernndez, Claudia Nelcy Jimnez ()",,"Arroyave, Sergio Gmez (); Enciso, Eliana Mara Villa (); Hernndez, Claudia Nelcy Jimnez ()",2,1,,0.74,https://scielo.conicyt.cl/pdf/jotmi/v14n2/0718-2724-jotmi-14-02-21.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1120287187,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3507 Strategy, Management and Organisational Behaviour",

The use of social network sites (SNS) allows them to reduce their isolation, improve their social participation, and increase their autonomy. Although the adoption of various information technologies by older adults has been studied, some assumptions still predominate, for example, that older adults use SNS only for utilitarian purposes. However, considering SNS as hedonic information systems, and in order to extend the theoretical explanation of the intention to use hedonic systems to their actual use, this study aims to determine the influence of perceived enjoyment, perceived usefulness, and perceived ease of use on the use of SNS by elders in Concepción, Chile. Two hundred fifty-three older adults participated in the cross-sectional study. The results indicate that perceived ease of use is the variable that has the greatest total effect in explaining the use of SNS and that by adding the perceived enjoyment construct, the explanatory power of the model increases significantly. Therefore, advancement in user acceptance models, especially in the use of SNS by elders, can be made by focusing on the type of system, hedonic or utilitarian.",,This research received no external funding.,International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health,,,"Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Chile; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Humans; Information Systems; Intention; Male; Middle Aged; Perception; Pleasure; Social Networking",2019-05-01,2019,2019-05-14,2019-05-01,16,10,1673,All OA; Gold,Article,"Ramírez-Correa, Patricio; Grandón, Elizabeth E.; Ramírez-Santana, Muriel; Órdenes, Leonard Belmar","Ramírez-Correa, Patricio (Engineering School, Universidad Católica del Norte, Coquimbo 1780000, Chile;, patricio.ramirez@ucn.cl); Grandón, Elizabeth E.

1405,pub.1121596298,10.32479/ijeep.8294,,,Energy Storage Development using Hydrogen and its Potential Application in Colombia,"With the increase in the world population, the needs for energy generation have increased, the biggest contribution for this production comes from fossil fuels, which causes significant negative impacts on the environment and sustainability, such as global warming and stock-outs. In this way, it is essential to develop renewable energy alternatives that gradually replace conventional sources. However, these kinds of sources mostly dependent on environmental conditions, so they have the disadvantage of being intermittent and fluctuating. It is considered that hydrogen can be an attractive option for energy storage maximizing the benefit of renewable energy sources. In the last decades, different technologies have been developed to the use of hydrogen as backup and a renewable energy source. This study provides an inspection of the hydrogen technologies that range from the ways to produce hydrogen from renewable energy sources to their different storage alternatives. It is also presented an outlook of available energy policies and development background in different Latin American countries for power generation using renewable sources. Finally, the analysis focuses its attention in the Colombian potential for several sources (solar, wind, biomass) combined with the use of production and storage technologies for hydrogen as an energy carrier.Keywords: Hydrogen Energy Storage, Hydrogen Production, Renewable Energy, Power-to-GasJEL Classifications: Q28, Q48, Q58DOI: https://doi.org/10.32479/ijeep.8294",,,International Journal of Energy Economics and Policy,,,,2019-10-01,2019,2019-10-01,,9,6,254-268,All OA; Gold,Article,"Montenegro, Adriana Rincon; Sanjuan, Marco; Carmona, Mauricio","Montenegro, Adriana Rincon (Universidad del Norte); Sanjuan, Marco (Universidad de Norte); Carmona, Mauricio (Universidad del Norte)",,"Montenegro, Adriana Rincon (Universidad del Norte); Sanjuan, Marco (Universidad de Norte); Carmona, Mauricio (Universidad del Norte)",7,3,,3.08,https://www.econjournals.com/index.php/ijeep/article/download/8294/4709,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1121596298,38 Economics; 3801 Applied Economics; 44 Human Society; 4407 Policy and Administration,13 Climate Action; 7 Affordable and Clean Energy

A density functional theory (DFT) study at the ω B97XD/6-311G(d,p) level was performed to analyze the differences in two reaction mechanisms: (i) the formation of five-membered cyclic products: maleimide and succinimide, and (ii) the more classical, six-membered cyclic products (diketopiperazine species) which are common in the pyrolysis of many other amino acids. The effect of temperature was included in the calculations at 300 °C or 625 °C, as required. Moreover, a detailed study based on the degree of rate control and thermodynamic control of the proposed mechanism for the formation of maleimide and succinimide is also presented. Results show that, for asparagine, the five-membered ring formation is the preferred process instead of the six-membered cycle (32 kJ/mol of Gibbs free energy difference between them at the first cyclization step); therefore, the polymerization is favored. On the other hand, the rupture of the polymer represents the highest energetic barrier (ΔG‡ = 281 kJ/mol) and the most influential process in the overall rate of the reaction. These results are in good agreement with the experimental evidence.",The authors express their gratitude to the institutions that supported this research: Universidad San Francisco de Quito through the Grupo de Química Teórica (QCT) and the Instituto de Simulación Computacional (ISC).

This becomes a difficult task to solve with conventional methods. Therefore, this paper uses integer linear programming and Branch and Bound algorithm to balance the loads in the three phases of the distribution system, employing stored data of power demand. Results show that the method helps to decrease the unbalance factor in more than 10%, by selecting the phase where a load should be connected. The solution may be used as a planning tool in distribution systems applied to installations with systems for measuring power consumption in different time intervals. Furthermore, in conjunction with communications and processing technologies, the solution could be useful to implement with a smart grid.",,This research received no external funding.,Energies,,,,2019-03-29,2019,2019-03-29,,12,7,1219,All OA; Gold,Article,"Arias, Jorge; Calle, Maria; Turizo, Daniel; Guerrero, Javier; Candelo-Becerra, John E.","Arias, Jorge (Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla 080001, Atlántico, Colombia;, jpuertas@uninorte.edu.co, (J.A.);, djturizo@uninorte.edu.co, (D.T.)); Calle, Maria (Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla 080001, Atlántico, Colombia;, jpuertas@uninorte.edu.co, (J.A.);, djturizo@uninorte.edu.co, (D.T.)); Turizo, Daniel (Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla 080001, Atlántico, Colombia;, jpuertas@uninorte.edu.co, (J.A.);, djturizo@uninorte.edu.co, (D.T.)); Guerrero, Javier (School of Electrical Engineering & Computer Science, Washington State University, Bremerton, WA 98312, USA;, j.guerrerosedeno@wsu.edu); Candelo-Becerra, John E.

In this sense, a modeling evaluation of the inhibition of Pin1 using quinazoline, benzophenone, and pyrimidine derivatives was performed by using multilinear, random forest, SMOreg, and IBK regression algorithms on a dataset of 51 molecules, which was divided randomly in 78% for the training and 22% for the test set.

                    : The signing of the peace accords in Colombia created challenges that are inherent to post-conflict transitions. One of those is the process of reintegrating ex-combatants into society, in which ensuring their rights to health is a particularly significant challenge in rural areas affected by armed conflict. These areas, known as Territorial Spaces for Training and Reintegration (ETCR, in Spanish), are geographically dispersed throughout 24 municipalities and 13 departments in Colombia. This study aimed to describe how ex-combatants in ETCR regions perceived access to health services one year after the signing of the peace accords.
                  
                  
                    Methods:
                    A descriptive, cross-sectional study was performed between September and October 2018. It included 591 adults and their families, from 23 ETCRs. The study was designed, culturally validated, and piloted. Interviewers were trained and a structured survey was administered containing five dimensions that characterized the perception of effective access to health services.
                  
                  
                    Results
                    : The majority of interviewees were women, heads of household, young adults, ex-combatants, and residents in an ETCR. In total of 96.4% were enrolled in Colombia’s subsidized health system, and 20.8% indicated that a member of their household required emergency health services. The regional health center provided the majority of the services. Most of those surveyed (96.0%) reported that they did not have to pay for the services, and that they received respectful (91.6%) and good quality (66.6%) care. There were few referrals to disease prevention and health promotion activities, and only 19.0% of households reported having been visited by extramural health care teams, whose activities were highly valued (80%). Lastly, there was little knowledge about community health activities.
                  
                  
                    Conclusions
                    : While residents of ETCR regions have a favorable perception of their access to health services, they need to be made aware of extramural and public health activities.","The present work was performed under the auspices of Health for Peace, a project sponsored by the United Nation’s Multi-Donor Trust Fund for post-conflict (MDTF), led by the Ministry of Health and Social Protection and implemented by three United Nation agencies: United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), Pan-American Health Organization (PAHO/WHO), and the International Organization for Migration (OIM).

Consequently, focused efforts are required to compile such information and ultimately facilitate its diffusion. Bogotá D.C. consists of a large territory of rural and urban zones which has become a place of diverse cultural dynamics due to complex processes of historical evolution, making it an important target to conserve ethnobotanical knowledge. Here, we made a thorough compilation of ethnobotanical data for Bogotá focusing on plant common names and developed a freely available online tool (Platform of Plant Common Names of Bogotá) with the aim of preserving and promoting the transmission of biocultural heritage. The compiled dataset consists of over 2,226 combinations between scientific and common names which may be queried using the online tool, leading to specific pages that display several additional features. Since its launch, the online tool has been visited over 6200 times, mainly by Colombian users under the age of 34, which is conveniently in line with our goal of improving the intergenerational transmission of biocultural heritage.","We thank the professionals of the Botanical Garden of Bogotá, as well as other external people who contributed with information associated with the plants of Bogotá D.C.

The problem is represented by a nonlinear programming (NLP) model that was formulated using an exponential voltage-dependent load model, which is the main contribution of this paper. An artificial neural network was employed for the short-term prediction of available renewable energy from wind and photovoltaic sources. The NLP model was solved by using the general algebraic modeling system (GAMS) to implement a 30-node test feeder composed of four renewable generators and three batteries. Simulation results demonstrate that the cost reduction for a daily operation is drastically affected by the operating conditions of the BESS, as well as the type of load model used.","In this section you can acknowledge any support given which is not covered by the author contribution or funding sections.

In Canada, the transport of goods across the northern reaches of the prairie provinces was spurred by mining and logging interests, and began with horses and donkeys, subsequently shifting to gasoline engine power when they became available, via ""cat (caterpillar tractor) freight sleighs"". In northern Chile, camelid caravans had been replaced in many instances by horse and donkey caravans to haul the goods required for mining copper and nitrate. As vehicles became available, the horse and donkey caravans were replaced at the same time that roads were built, often along the same trails that had been used by animal caravans for hundreds and thousands of years. While rapid and convenient vehicle transport is widely available in both Canada and Chile, transport that is dependent upon and limited by specific environmental parameters has not been universally replaced, and continues to fill important social, economic, political, and behavioural roles that can be considered in reviewing and reconstructing ancient caravan lifeways. Una revisin de las caravanas histricas del norte de Canad en el siglo XX revela convincentes comparaciones histricas, tecnolgicas, econmicas, sociales, polticas y de parentesco con los desarrollos de las caravanas en el norte de Chile en el siglo XX. En Canad, el transporte de bienes a travs de los lmites septentrionales de las Provincias de las Praderas fue estimulado por intereses mineros y forestales y comenz con caballos y burros, para luego incorporar, cuando estuvo disponible, el motor de gasolina a travs de ""trineos de transporte cat (tractor Caterpillar)"". En el norte de Chile, las caravanas de camlidos haban sido reemplazadas en muchos casos por caravanas de caballos y burros para transportar los bienes necesarios para la minera de cobre y nitrato. A medida que los vehculos comenzaron a estar disponibles, las caravanas de caballos y burros fueron reemplazadas al mismo tiempo que se construan caminos, a menudo a lo largo de los mismos senderos que haban sido usados por las caravanas de animales por cientos y miles de aos. Mientras que el transporte por vehculo, rpido y conveniente, es ampliamente disponible en el norte de Chile, aquel tipo de transporte que depende de y est limitado por parmetros ambientales especficos no fue reemplazado universalmente y contina cumpliendo importantes roles sociales, econmicos, polticos y conductuales que pueden ser considerados al revisar y reconstruir los antiguos estilos de vida caravaneros.",,,Chungara - Revista de Antropología Chilena,,,,2019,2019,2019,,51,ahead,57-69,All OA; Gold,Article,"Clarkson, Persis B.","Clarkson, Persis B.

Two different ordering processes are at work: alignment and pairing of two fermions to total spin zero. They compete among themselves and with thermal disorder. A complex physics ensues as a consequence. The existence of novel phenomena is revealed by the behavior of the statistical complexity.

Extreme waves are assessed from a wave reanalysis that are propagated from deep waters to the beach considering the hydrodynamic processes and taking into account the interaction between waves and the coastal elevation within the study area. First, we consider present sea level, storm surges and waves affecting the area. Next, we analyze the effect of sea level rise according to a moderate (RCP4.5) climate change scenario for the 21st century (years 2025, 2050, 2075, and 2100). The most pessimistic scenario (year 2100) yields a percentage of flooded area of 97.2%, thus revealing the major threat that represents sea level rise for coastal areas in the Caribbean Sea.",,"Funding.

1230,pub.1115225974,10.1111/ddi.12932,,,Precipitation and tree cover gradients structure avian alpha diversity in North‐western Costa Rica,"Abstract  Aim Changes in climate and land use are modifying biodiversity worldwide. Yet it remains unclear how both drivers interact to structure communities and determine patterns in taxonomic, phylogenetic and functional diversity at local scales. We focused on bird diversity and asked: how do precipitation and forest cover gradients interactively structure these elements of avian diversity?   Location Guanacaste, North‐western Costa Rica.   Methods We quantified changes in the abundance and composition of bird communities along independent gradients of regional precipitation, local forest cover and landscape forest cover that serve as proxies for climate drying and habitat conversion. We conducted point counts at 150 sites and statistically accounted for imperfect detection to test how environmental variation shaped community‐wide diversity metrics.   Results We found that the three dimensions of diversity diverged in their responses to environmental gradients. Specifically, species richness increased linearly with precipitation, reached maximum values with intermediate tree cover at local scales and peaked at high levels of landscape tree cover. While phylogenetic diversity did not vary strongly across any gradient, functional diversity increased monotonically with both local and landscape‐level tree cover. Maximum values of functional diversity only occurred in large patches of forest where the tree cover was >75% at both local and landscape scales. Contrary to our expectations, we did not detect significant interactions between precipitation and tree cover gradients on any metric of local bird diversity.   Main conclusions Our findings suggest that taxonomic diversity was more sensitive to environmental gradients than functional and phylogenetic diversity. The lack of synergies between precipitation and forest cover gradients on alpha diversity, at least in this system, simplifies the prospects of predicting future biodiversity change at local scales as our results suggest that climate change and land use act independently of one another.","ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS We thank landowners, SINAC&#x27;s staff, the Obando family, E.

Participants were categorised into three weight-change groups (Weight-loss: ≥ 25 kg m−2→ < 25 kg m−2; Weight-gain: < 25 kg m−2→ ≥ 25 kg m−2; Weight-stability: remained < 25 kg m−2 or ≥ 25 kg m−2). Daily ambulation and activity energy expenditure (AEE), measured in the 2005–2007 health survey, was examined across the weight-change groups. Using the daily AEE data, the proportion of those in the weight-change groups, meeting or not meeting two PA guidelines (150- and 420 min week−1), was examined.ResultsWeight-change was found in 18.2% of the sample. There was no significant overall body mass change (+ 1.2 kg, p = 0.1616). However, there was significant change in body mass in the weight-gain (+ 15.2 kg) and weight-loss (− 10.8 kg) groups (p ≤ 0.0011). Nearly 90% of those who gained weight met the 150 min week−1 guideline. A significantly greater proportion of the weight-stable group (< 25 kg m−2) met the 420 min week−1 guideline (p < 0.05). Ambulatory level was high irrespective of weight group, although the weight-stable group (< 25 kg m−2) approached 15,000 steps day−1. There was an inconsistent and weak association between PA and weight-change in this group.","The author would like to thank Professor Marianne Alberts for access to the 1997 survey data, and the communities, participants and field workers of the Dikgale Demographic and Health Surveillance System Site.","The Research Development and Administration Division of the University of Limpopo (Turfloop Campus), The Norwegian Universities Committee for Development Research and Education, and the Thuthuka and Institutional Research Development Programmes of the National Research Foundation of South Africa supported the initial studies on which this manuscript is based [14, 15].

ABSTRACT This article proposes urban communication as a tool for analysis and cultural transformation of cities. It suggests that urban communications allow reaching inclusion processes at a relational level through (re)configuring shared imaginaries and empathic experiences related to functional diversity or disability. First, the notion of disability is presented as a problem of perspective, to then address the imaginary about disability that can be perceived in cities. In a third moment, the corresponding relations between accessibility, inclusion and public space are established. Finally, it is exposed the way urban communication would fulfill the purpose of including socio-culturally the persons in condition of disability in the life of the cities.",,,EURE,,,,2019,2019,2019,,45,135,273-282,All OA; Gold,Article,"Cuesta, scar; Melndez-Labrador, Sandra","Cuesta, scar (); Melndez-Labrador, Sandra ()",,"Cuesta, scar (); Melndez-Labrador, Sandra ()",8,4,,,https://doi.org/10.4067/s0250-71612019000200273,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1115243379,,

Although the technology for the mass production of freshwater prawn juveniles has advanced positively, the non-commercial availability of an exclusive live feed for amphidromous crustaceans, such as C. caementarius , has created the need to optimize the management of organisms commonly used as feed in the larval culture of marine crustaceans. We investigated the effect of salinity on embryonic development dynamics and the hatching rate of commercial Artemia sp. cysts, including the effect of cooling decapsulated cysts on the hatching rate, and the effect of salinity on the behavior of marine microalgae used as live feed in the larviculture of C. caementarius . The results encourage a sustained and stable production of Artemia nauplii at different salinities, and at the same time, reduce by 80% the daily time used in feeding activities. Also, the information generated in this study adds critical information about activities and procedures for the larviculture of the northern river shrimp, which could be used to improve larval feeding strategies either in C. caementarius or in other amphidromous crustacean species.",,,Latin American Journal of Aquatic Research,,,,2019-11-10,2019,2019-11-10,,47,5,791-797,All OA; Gold,Article,"Moreno-Reyes, Jorge E.; Morales, María C.; Méndez, Carlos A.; Álvarez, Cármen A.; Meruane, Jaime A.","Moreno-Reyes, Jorge E.

LC impairs the normal sleep-awake cycle and produces disturbances in behavior, cognition and motor skills. Abnormal melatonin (MT) levels have also been identified in LC. Administration of MT may regulate circadian rhythms and prevent the oxidative damage. We studied the effects of MT on spatial memory acquisition (SMA) and motor skills in a liver fibrosis model (LF)s.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty-five rats, divided into 4 groups. [G1: LF; G2: LF + MT; G3: MT; G4: Healthy control (HC)]. LF was induced by carbon tetrachloride intraperitoneal injection (0.2 mL/kg) for 5 months. MT was administered during 5 weeks (0.4 mg/kg/day). SMA was evaluated by using the Morris Water Maze protocol where the escape latency (EL) and mean speed were measured. Data were registered by SMART®.
RESULTS: The EL measurement analyzed by two way ANOVA: cirrhosis presented a higher EL than controls or those treated with MT suggesting impaired memory acquisition which is rescued by MT treatment. The mean speed analysis revealed that LF presented higher speed than LF+MT or HC, suggesting that LF affects motor skills, which are improved by MT. To discard whether EL is affected by altered motor skills in LF treated with MT, we compared the average EL and speed between days 2 and 6 of the training protocol. Speed was not improved during the trials unlike EL, suggesting that memory acquisition is independent of motor skills.
CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that MT improves cognition and motor skills in the LF model.",,,Annals of Hepatology,,,"Animals; Antioxidants; Behavior, Animal; Cognition; Hepatic Encephalopathy; Liver Cirrhosis, Experimental; Male; Melatonin; Motor Activity; Motor Skills; Rats; Rats, Sprague-Dawley",2019-01,2019,,2019-01,18,1,101-108,All OA; Gold,Article,"Haeger, Paola; Bouchet, Antoine; Ossandon, Carolina; Bresky, Gustavo","Haeger, Paola (Department of Biomedical Sciences.

The objective of this research is to analyze the possible mediating role of rooting in the host location on the negative effect that acculturation stress has on the level of well-being. Data for this study were collected using 699 Colombian and Peruvian immigrants who have been permanently residing in Chile for more than six months. Participants were assessed by using Riff's Psychological Well-being Scale, rooting of Torrente et al., and Ruiz et al. scales of stress. The results demonstrated the mediating role of settling down within the host country in relation to stress and psychological well-being, except for the sub-dimension of autonomy. It is concluded that the need for rooting in the host country is a protective factor against the negative effects of stress on perceived well-being.","This research was supported by the Comisión Nacional de Investigación Científica y Tecnológica, FONDECYT 1140843 and 1180315 to AU.

In this article, it is analysed how this social problem is defined in Colombia and to what extent there is coherence between the causes identified and the preventive measures proposed to end it. Through N-Vivo software, we perform a content analysis of the judicial decrees issued by the Constitutional Court between 2008 and 2015 about the situation of internally displaced people within the context of the armed conflict. Findings suggest that, when addressing sexual violence, most judicial decrees identify armed actors as the main perpetrators of sexual violence and that when identifying risk factors, judicial decrees tend to stress the importance of the socio-demographic profile of the people attacked rather than the structural causes of the phenomena. Preventive measures are partially coherent with the diagnosis performed; however, some of them are not the most effective ones according to the specialized literature.",,,Revista iberoamericana de estudios de desarrollo = Iberoamerican journal of development studies,,,,2019-11-05,2019,2019-11-05,,8,2,202-226,All OA; Gold,Article,"Inguanzo, Isabel; Rodríguez-Rodríguez, Angélica","Inguanzo, Isabel (); Rodríguez-Rodríguez, Angélica ()",,"Inguanzo, Isabel (); Rodríguez-Rodríguez, Angélica ()",3,3,,4.86,http://dx.doi.org/10.26754/ojs_ried/ijds.401,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1122360378,44 Human Society; 48 Law and Legal Studies; 4807 Public Law,"16 Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions; 5 Gender Equality"

The purpose of this study is to confirm the diagnostic capacity of this methodology to differentiate normal neonatal cardiac and cardiac pathologies through a blind study. For this, 80 Holter records were taken, 10 with evaluation within the limits of normality and 70 with different cardiac pathologies. The conventional evaluations were masked, and the maximum and minimum heart rates were taken every hour and the number of beats/hours, during 21 hours. These values were used to generate the neonatal cardiac attractor, then their fractal dimension was calculated, their occupation spaces were quantified in the fractal space of Box-Counting, determining their physic mathematical diagnosis. The spaces of occupation of neonatal chaotic cardiac attractors measured according to the number of frames occupied by the Box Counting method, differentiate states of normality from acute pathologies, achieving a sensitivity and specificity of 100%, as well as a kappa coefficient of 1.

Simulations that mirror the complex realities of clinical practice have the potential to induce a range of emotions, without a clear understanding of their impact on learning and the learner. Students’ emotional states have important effects on their learning process that can be either positive or negative, and are often difficult to predict. We aimed to determine: (1) To what extent achievement emotions are experienced by medical students during a complex simulation based learning activity, i.e. a ward round simulation (WRS). (2) What their performance scores are and too which extent performance scores do correlate with emotions and 3) how these emotions are perceived to impact learning.MethodsA mixed methods approach was used in this study. Using an Achievement Emotion Questionnaire, we explored undergraduate medical student’s emotions as they participated in a complex ward round-based simulation. Their performance was rated using an observational ward round assessment tool and correlated with emotions scores. Six focus groups were conducted to provide a deeper understanding of their emotional and learning experiences.ResultsStudents experienced a range of emotions during the simulation, they felt proud, enjoyed the simulation and performed well. Students felt proud because they could show in the complex simulation what they had learned so far. Students reported moderate levels of anxiety and low levels of frustration and shame. We found non-significant correlations between achievement emotions and performance during ward round simulation.ConclusionsPlacing undergraduate students in high complex simulations that they can handle raises positive academic achievement emotions which seem to support students’ learning and motivation.",We thank all our students who participated in the present study.,FundingThe authors report no financial support from any company/government/private foundation in this study.

Quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) is considered the most accurate and reliable technique to measure gene expression and to validate the data obtained by RNA-seq; however, accurate normalization is crucial. In Chile, the freshwater silverside fish Basilichthys microlepidotus inhabits both polluted and nonpolluted areas, showing differential gene expression related to pollution. In this study, we infer the stability of six potential reference genes (tubulin alpha, hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, beta-actin, 60S ribosomal protein L13, and 60S ribosomal protein L8) in the gills and liver of silverside individuals inhabiting polluted and nonpolluted areas. To validate the reference genes selected, the most and least stable reference genes were used to normalize two target transcripts, one for each organ. The RefFinder tool was used to analyze and identify the most stably expressed genes. The 60S ribosomal protein L8 gene was ranked as the most stable gene for both organs. Our results show that reference gene selection influences the detection of differences in the expression levels of target genes in different organs and, also highlighting candidate reference genes that could be used in field studies.","This work was supported by: Fondecyt 11150213.

A development board such as Arduino can be programmed with an algorithm that utilizes a combination of sensors and connectivity modules, constituting a microcontroller unit that is able to achieve successful monitoring over emission gases, one such algorithm is proposed by the authors.",,,Journal of Physics Conference Series,,,,2019-11-01,2019,,2019-11-01,1409,1,012007,All OA; Gold,Article,"Valdes-Solano, D M; Fonseca-Herreño, L C; Alba-Maldonado, J M","Valdes-Solano, D M (Grupo de Investigación Laboratorio de Química Orgánica Aplicada, Universidad Manuela Beltrán, Bucaramanga, Colombia); Fonseca-Herreño, L C (Grupo de Investigación Ambiental Agropecuario y Desarrollo Sostenible, Universidad Francisco de Paula Santander Seccional Ocaña, Colombia); Alba-Maldonado, J M (Grupo de Investigación Ambiental Agropecuario y Desarrollo Sostenible, Universidad Francisco de Paula Santander Seccional Ocaña, Colombia)",,"Valdes-Solano, D M (Universidad Manuela Beltrán); Fonseca-Herreño, L C (Grupo de Investigación Ambiental Agropecuario y Desarrollo Sostenible, Universidad Francisco de Paula Santander Seccional Ocaña, Colombia); Alba-Maldonado, J M (Grupo de Investigación Ambiental Agropecuario y Desarrollo Sostenible, Universidad Francisco de Paula Santander Seccional Ocaña, Colombia)",1,1,,,https://doi.org/10.1088/1742-6596/1409/1/012007,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1122871233,51 Physical Sciences,13 Climate Action

At present, there are a large number of applications dedicated to providing service of positioning through mobile devices, with the global positioning system (GPS) which is the main positioning technology used. However, other technologies exist that using the correct algorithms can give the position of a target with good precision; one of these technologies is the global system for mobile communications (GSM). The most popular positioning methods include the angle of arrival (AoA), time of arrival (ToA), triangulation, time difference of arrival (TDoA), and trilateration. At the beginning, the GSM service was simply a means of transmitting voice and short messages, with the passage of time the technologies evolved and expanded their characteristics, providing values that can be used to locate a person based on the signal strength received by a person, device, and in the known position of three or more reference nodes. When an emergency occurs, the current communication services (3G or 4G) are insufficient due to the high concentration of mobile subscribers in a single place that exceeds the capacity of an antenna. This means that calls to emergency services are not completed, which makes it difficult to rescue people in danger. Although GSM does not have a technology dedicated to positioning, it can provide valuable data for location by using dedicated algorithms, such as trilateration, with which the coordinates of the target device can be processed by the coordinates of three or more reference nodes.","This work was supported by the European Union’s Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Programme under Grant 700326.

(Gastropoda: Mitridae), collected on the summit of seamounts (~200 m water depth) in the vicinity of Desventuradas Islands, Chile insular territory. Additionally, we provide some insight into the habitat of this new species based on underwater imagery taken with a remotely operated vehicle. A. isolata sp. n. is characterized by its small size (up to 26 mm), elongate-ovate shape, solid shell and smooth appearance. It has a base brown color, with some specimens being tan or yellow. It is morphologically related to counterparts from shallow depths on the west coast of North, Central and South America (i.e., Atrimitra idae, Atrimitra orientalis and Atrimitra semigranosa), but has no affinities with species of the family reported from around Easter Island, on the far western side of the Salas y Gómez ridge (e.g., Strigatella flavocingulata, Imbricariopsis punctata and Neocancilla takiisaoi), or with other Indo-Pacific species. The present contribution adds to the knowledge of the poorly studied fauna of the seamounts in the southern portion of the Nazca ridge and easternmost section of the Sala y Gómez ridge, an area characterized by the high degree of endemism of its benthic fauna, and now protected within the large and newly created Nazca-Desventuradas Marine Park.","This work was supported by grants (CONA C22 16-09, FONDECYT 1181153, FONDEQUIP EQM 150109) and the Chilean Millennium Initiative, ESMOI.

According to the National Institute of Statistics and Informatics (INEI), in 2017 there were three million people with disabilities in our country. Of these, 5% have a significant functional limitation, so they have to require a caregiver; who can see affected his physical and emotional activity, and eventually, they get sick. Objective. To establish the relationship between the burden of the caregiver and level of functionality of the person with disabilities. Methods. 50 caregivers and 50 people with disabilities were included. The Functional Independence Measure (FIM) is an accepted instrument for measuring disability, in three categories: complete dependence, relative dependence and independence. The Zarit and Zarit Test measures the burden of caregiver; classifying it into three categories: absence of burden, light burden and intense burden. Results. The majority of caregivers of people with disabilities reported having an intense burden, this being greater when caring for a person with complete dependence and lower when caring for a person with functional independence. However, no statistically significant association was found. Conclusion. It is common for caregivers with intense burden to be in charge of patients with complete or relative dependence, in people registered in the Comprehensive Care Service for People with Disabilities (SAIPD) of the Instituto Nacional de Bienestar Familiar (INABIF), during the year 2018.

To perform this evaluation, using spray drying, citral was encapsulated in a matrix of dextrin using twelve combinations of citral:dextrin ratios (CDR) and inlet air temperatures (IAT). From each treatment, six samples were extracted, and their S C C t   and NIR absorption spectral profiles were measured. Then, the spectral profiles, pretreated and randomly divided into modeling and validation datasets, were used to build the following prediction models: principal component analysis-multilinear regression (PCA-MLR), principal component analysis-artificial neural network (PCA-ANN), partial least squares regression (PLSR) and an artificial neural network (ANN). During the validation stage, the models showed  R 2   values from 0.73 to 0.96 and a root mean squared error (RMSE) range of [0.061-0.140]. Moreover, when the models were compared, the full and optimized ANN models showed the best fits. According to this study, NIR coupled with chemometric tools has the potential for application in determining S C C t   on microparticles, particularly when using ANN models.","The authors thank Cristina Vergara, Estefanía González, Inés Cea and Guibeth Morello for their contributions, technical support and suggestions during the execution of this study.",This work was supported by FONDECYT CONCYTEC-Peru.,Heliyon,,,,2019-07-30,2019,2019-07-30,2019-07,5,7,e02122,All OA; Gold,Article,"Yoplac, Ives; Avila-George, Himer; Vargas, Luis; Robert, Paz; Castro, Wilson","Yoplac, Ives (Facultad de Ingeniería Zootecnista, Agronegocios y Biotecnología, Universidad Nacional Toribio Rodríguez de Mendoza de Amazonas, Chachapoyas, Peru; Escuela de Posgrado, Programa Doctoral en Ciencia de Alimentos, Universidad Nacional Agraria La Molina, Lima, Peru); Avila-George, Himer (Departamento de Ciencias Computacionales e Ingenierías, Universidad de Guadalajara, Ameca, Jalisco 46600, Mexico); Vargas, Luis (Facultad de Industrias Alimentarias, Universidad Nacional Agraria La Molina, Lima, Peru); Robert, Paz (Departamento de Ciencia de Alimentos y Tecnología Química, Facultad de Ciencias Químicas y Farmacéuticas, Universidad de Chile, Santiago, Chile); Castro, Wilson (Facultad de Ingeniería, Universidad Privada del Norte, Cajamarca 06002, Peru)","Yoplac, Ives (National University Toribio Rodríguez de Mendoza; National Agrarian University)","Yoplac, Ives (National University Toribio Rodríguez de Mendoza; National Agrarian University); Avila-George, Himer (University of Guadalajara); Vargas, Luis (National Agrarian University); Robert, Paz (University of Chile); Castro, Wilson (Private University of the North)",14,7,0.74,1.56,http://www.cell.com/article/S2405844019357822/pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1119956553,40 Engineering; 4018 Nanotechnology,

School sharks, Galeorhinus galeus, are targeted by commercial fisheries in Australia and New Zealand. The Australian stock has been depleted to below 20% of its virgin biomass, and the species is recorded as Conservation Dependent within Australia. Individuals are known to move between both countries, but it is disputed whether the stocks are reproductively linked. Accurate and unbiased determination of stock and population connectivity is crucial to inform effective management. In this study, we assess the genetic composition and population connectivity between Australian and New Zealand school sharks using genome-wide SNPs, while accounting for non-random kin sampling. Between 2009 and 2013, 88 neonate and juvenile individuals from Tasmanian and New Zealand nurseries were collected and genotyped. Neutral loci were analyzed to detect fine-scale signals of reproductive connectivity. Seven full-sibling groups were identified and removed for unbiased analysis. Based on 6,587 neutral SNPs, pairwise genetic differentiation from Tasmanian and New Zealand neonates was non-significant (F ST = 0.0003, CI95 = [-0.0002, 0.0009], p = 0.1163; D est = 0.0006 ± 0.0002). This pattern was supported by clustering results. In conclusion, we show a significant effect of non-random sampling of kin and identify fine-scale reproductive connectivity between Australian and New Zealand school sharks.

This study represents the first comprehensive diversity and composition description of polyplacophoran assemblages along the Peruvian Province (SE Pacific, 12°S–39°S), as a model system for ecological latitudinal gradients. A total of 4,775 chitons from 21 species were collected on twelve localities along the Peruvian Province. This sampling allowed us to quantitatively estimate the relative abundance of the species in this assemblage, and to test whether chitons conform to elementary predictions of major biogeographic patterns such as a latitudinal diversity gradient. We found that the species composition supported the division of the province into three ecoregional faunal groups (i.e. Humboldtian, Central Chile, and Araucanian). Though chiton diversity did not follow a clear latitudinal gradient, changes in species composition were dominated by smaller scale variability in salinity and temperature. Body size significantly differed by ecoregions and species, indicating latitudinal size-structure assamblages. In some localities body size ratios differed from a random assemblage, evidencing competition at local scale. Changes in composition between ecoregions influence body size structure, and their overlapping produce vertical size segregation, suggesting that competition coupled with environmental conditions structure these assemblages.","We would like to thank Boris Sirenko and Douglas Eernisse for their help during sampling and species identification.

The use of UAV in the daily tasks of industry, commerce or as entertainment for children and adults becomes more recurrent. Each of the UAVs has a specific task, depending on the technologies that are provided, in addition to their basic functions with which they were manufactured. However, in most cases the security of these UAVs is not usually taken into account since some of them are inexpensive and do not have a robust security system that protects the data they send or receive for their operation, that can cause its communication system or the operating system that controls its basic functions of flight, landing, among others, to be compromised. These computer attacks could cause physical or moral harm to people around the same operator of the UAV because they could steal information related to the locations they have visited, or intercept images or videos taken by the UAV. This paper shows the exploitation of GPS vulnerability in the commercial drone of the company 3D Robotics, this vulnerability can cause a malicious user to have control of their autonomy, and carry out illicit activities, such as overflying in spaces not allowed as an airport and private areas. The exploitation of this vulnerability is important to make known that the UAVs should have a more robust security system and also give importance to the security of GPS since the only one that has security is the military GPS.","This work was supported in part by the European Union’s Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Programme under Grant 700326, the National Science and Technology Council of Mexico (CONACyT), and the Instituto Politécnico Nacional.",,IEEE Access,,,,2019-01-01,2019,2019-04-15,2019-01-01,7,,51782-51789,All OA; Gold,Article,"Arteaga, Sandra Pérez; Hernández, Luis Alberto Martínez; Pérez, Gabriel Sánchez; Orozco, Ana Lucila Sandoval; Villalba, Luis Javier García","Arteaga, Sandra Pérez (Instituto Politécnico Nacional, Sección de Estudios de Posgrado e Investigación, Escuela Superior de Ingeniería Mecánica y Eléctrica Unidad Culhuacán, Ciudad de México, 04260, México); Hernández, Luis Alberto Martínez (Instituto Politécnico Nacional, Sección de Estudios de Posgrado e Investigación, Escuela Superior de Ingeniería Mecánica y Eléctrica Unidad Culhuacán, Ciudad de México, 04260, México); Pérez, Gabriel Sánchez (Instituto Politécnico Nacional, Sección de Estudios de Posgrado e Investigación, Escuela Superior de Ingeniería Mecánica y Eléctrica Unidad Culhuacán, Ciudad de México, 04260, México); Orozco, Ana Lucila Sandoval (Group of Analysis, Security and Systems (GASS), Department of Software Engineering and Artificial Intelligence (DISIA), Faculty of Computer Science and Engineering, Office 431, Universidad Complutense de Madrid (UCM), 28040, Madrid, Spain); Villalba, Luis Javier García (Group of Analysis, Security and Systems (GASS), Department of Software Engineering and Artificial Intelligence (DISIA), Faculty of Computer Science and Engineering, Office 431, Universidad Complutense de Madrid (UCM), 28040, Madrid, Spain)",,"Arteaga, Sandra Pérez (Instituto Politécnico Nacional); Hernández, Luis Alberto Martínez (Instituto Politécnico Nacional); Pérez, Gabriel Sánchez (Instituto Politécnico Nacional); Orozco, Ana Lucila Sandoval (Complutense University of Madrid); Villalba, Luis Javier García (Complutense University of Madrid)",65,24,,17.44,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/ielx7/6287639/8600701/08691741.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1113522784,46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4604 Cybersecurity and Privacy,

Water availability influences the rate of expansion of the tree canopy and thus light interception. Another extremely important factor is pruning, which influences the production of floral sprouts that will give rise to new fruits, influencing productivity. Objective. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of drip irrigation and pruning on the performance, phenology and phytosanitary behavior of cacao trees. Materials and methods. The study was developed between 2015 and 2016 in the Cauca department, Colombia. The six-year-old trees were subjected to two watering layers: L-100 % and L-0 % and two pruning levels: soft and strong. Total number of fruits, number of healthy and sick fruits, kg of wet and dry cocoa, fruit index and seed index, longitudinal and equatorial diameters and incidence of Moniliopthora roreri, Phytophthora palmivora and Monalonion dissimulatum were evaluated. The growth and development curves of the fruit throughout time were built. An experimental design of complete random blocks was used in an arrangement of divide plots. Results. Fruit index varied from 22 (T2) up to 33 fruits (T3), the seed index varied from 0.91 g (T4) to 1.14 g (T2). There were no other significant results for other variables. Conclusion. From a technical and economic point of view an optimal response to the interaction of irrigation with the two levels of pruning was observed because, with a timely application of watering and an adequate pruning management, crop performance can be increased, harvests can be programmed and better quality fruits can be obtained.",,,Agronomía Mesoamericana,,,,2019-08-07,2019,2019-08-07,,,,681-693,All OA; Gold,Article,"Meneses-Buitrago, Diego Hernán; Bolaños-Benavides, Martha Marina; Gómez-Gil, Luis Fernando; Ramos-Zambrano, Housseman Steven","Meneses-Buitrago, Diego Hernán (Corporación colombiana de investigación agropecuaria (AGROSAVIA)); Bolaños-Benavides, Martha Marina (Corporación Colombiana de Investigación Agropecuaria (AGROSAVIA)); Gómez-Gil, Luis Fernando (Corporación Colombiana de Investigación Agropecuaria (AGROSAVIA)); Ramos-Zambrano, Housseman Steven (Corporación Colombiana de Investigación Agropecuaria (AGROSAVIA))",,"Meneses-Buitrago, Diego Hernán (Corporación colombiana de investigación agropecuaria (AGROSAVIA)); Bolaños-Benavides, Martha Marina (Corporación Colombiana de Investigación Agropecuaria (AGROSAVIA)); Gómez-Gil, Luis Fernando (Corporación Colombiana de Investigación Agropecuaria (AGROSAVIA)); Ramos-Zambrano, Housseman Steven (Corporación Colombiana de Investigación Agropecuaria (AGROSAVIA))",3,1,,0.65,https://revistas.ucr.ac.cr/index.php/agromeso/article/download/36307/39492,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1120853495,"30 Agricultural, Veterinary and Food Sciences; 3004 Crop and Pasture Production",

Inhibition of FAAH increases endogenous levels of fatty acid ethanolamides such as anandamide (AEA) and thus consitutes an indirect strategy that can be used to modulate endocannabinoid tone. In the present work, we present a three-dimensional quantitative structure-activity relationships/comparative molecular similarity indices analysis (3D-QSAR/CoMSIA) study on a series of 90 reported irreversible inhibitors of FAAH sharing a piperazine-carboxamide scaffold. The model obtained was extensively validated (q2 = 0.734; r2 = 0.966; r2m = 0.723). Finally, based on the information derived from the contour maps we designed a series of 10 new compounds with high predicted FAAH inhibition (predicted pIC50 of the best-proposed compounds = 12.196; 12.416).",Marcos Lorca thanks beca Conicyt-PFCHA/Doctorado Nacional/2018-21180427.,,International Journal of Molecular Sciences,,,Amidohydrolases; Cannabinoids; Enzyme Inhibitors; Humans; Ligands; Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship,2019-05-21,2019,2019-05-21,,20,10,2510,All OA; Gold,Article,"Lorca, Marcos; Valdes, Yudisladys; Chung, Hery; Romero-Parra, Javier; Pessoa-Mahana, C.

This species, included in the IOC-UNESCO Taxonomic Reference List of Harmful Microalgae, may be a diarrhetic shellfish poisoning (DSP) toxin vector, but little is known about its ecophysiology and behavior. A vertical net haul collected during the austral summer of 2018 in Reloncaví Sound (Chilean Patagonia) revealed an unusually abundant population of P. rotundatum and prompted intensive 24 h sampling on 16-17 January to study the cell cycle and feeding behavior of this species. Hydrographic measurements from a buoy revealed the local characteristic estuarine circulation, with a brackish surface layer (salinity 26-28) separated from saltier, colder bottom waters by a pycnocline at a depth modulated by the tidal regime. A high proportion of P. rotundatum cells were packed with digestive vacuoles (peak of 70% at 14:00), and phased cell division (µ = 0.46 d-1) occurred 3 h after sunrise. The division time (TD) was 2 h. This is the first cell cycle study of P. rotundatum. The results here disagree with those of previous field studies that considered asynchronous division in some Dinophysis species to be related to heterotrophic feeding.

Material and methods : A cross-sectional study was carried out on university students using the Epworth Sleepiness Scale, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index and Insomnia severity index. In addition, anthropometric variables were determined; weight, height and waist circumference. Results : We evaluated 1275 university students (74% female). Students on average slept at midnight and slept on average 6.4 hours, 77.9% sleep less than recommended, 34.2% had daytime somnolence and 68.5% had insomnia. Regarding insomnia, it was observed that the low weight group presented the highest insomnia score that significantly contrasted with the normal weight group (p=0.04). In the case of daytime sleepiness when comparing by nutritional status, it was observed that obese students are the ones with the greatest daytime somnolence (p <0.05). Finally, there is an association between fewer sleep hours with higher BMI (OR: 1.12 (95% CI 1.01-1.991)) and presence of insomnia (OR: 2.734 (95% CI: 1.324-5.645). Conclusion : University students sleep less than recommended, have a high prevalence of insomnia and excessive daytime sleepiness, in addition, it is obese women who present this alteration more frequently and the highest insomnia score is identified in underweight students. Both a high BMI and insomnia are associated with short-term sleep.",,,Revista Española de Nutrición Humana y Dietética,,,,2019-10-27,2019,2019-10-27,,23,3,153-161,All OA; Gold,Article,"Durán-Agüero, Samuel; Sepulveda, Ricardo; Guerrero-Wyss, Marion","Durán-Agüero, Samuel (Facultad de Ciencias de la Salud, Universidad San Sebastián.

In addition, this work proposed a possible biological effect of ultrasound to describe its effect on grain hydration. Carioca beans were irradiated at doses of 2.3 and 3.8 kGy using γ-rays, establishing different metabolic activities for the beans. Then, they were hydrated with and without the ultrasound technology (91 W/L and 25 kHz) at 25 °C. Both the hydration and germination kinetics were evaluated considering the application of both technologies alone and in combination. As results, irradiation did not significantly affect (P > 0.05) the hydration rate, the equilibrium moisture, or the lag phase time, but ultrasound affected them, reducing 50% of the processing time. On the other hand, only the equilibrium moisture was slightly reduced by the interactive effect of irradiation and ultrasound technology, which was discussed based on different metabolism levels. Furthermore, the germination process of carioca bean was hindered by both the studied variables, reducing its germination capacity to 0% in some cases. Therefore, by studying the effect of ultrasound on beans with different active metabolism (due to different irradiation doses), it was suggested that both physical and biological mechanisms are involved during hydration process and that both can be affected by ultrasound. Further, irradiation could be used on carioca beans with objectives such as avoid germination, insects, and microorganism's growth, without an important effect on the hydration kinetics. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: Ultrasound technology has demonstrated to accelerate the soaking process of several legume grains. However, sometimes, grains are irradiated for disinfestation purpose to improve their shelf life. Indeed, irradiation can change the grain properties as the cooking time, hydration time, and germination capacity. Therefore, this work verified if irradiation changes the desirable effect of ultrasound on grain processing: soaking and germination. Moreover, this work novelty is also based on describing the phenomena: by proposing a possible biological effect, further approaches to improve the grain processing can be achieved.","The authors are grateful to the São Paulo Research Foundation (FAPESP, Brazil) for funding the project no. 2016/18052‐5 and the V.D.

The results have been adjusted and validated through experimental results taken from the bibliography. Finally, this paper presents a table where the population can easily interpret the UVI values and calculate the maximum time one can be exposed to solar radiation without getting sunburn. In addition, this article aims to raise awareness of the potential harm caused by solar radiation by indicating the percentage of population affected by different types of sunburn depending on skin-type. Moreover, ultraviolet exposure to sunlight could not just result in sunburn, but also have long-term effects on eyes, or even cause immune system disorders or melanoma.

Abstract: The littoral of the Atacama Desert (North of Chile, South America) has been a source of energy and an environment relevant to the social life of prehistoric and colonial populations. Fish and other seafood were key products in the human diet. Moreover, guano (a natural fertilizer of marine origin) was also crucial for agricultural development and economic and symbolic interchanges. Hunting and collecting seafood encouraged the use of technologies and tools. These activities are reflected in the existence of complex political organizations and cultural development. Access to marine resources depended on global or imperial political changes occurring in the Andean and American social landscape. This article offers an overview based on historical sources related to the transformations in the marine economic exploitation from the Tawantinsuyu (Inca rule) to late colonial times and the early nineteenth-century. This article analyses, from an ethnohistorical point of view, the process of human adaptation, as well the relationship of power that were part of the extraction activities in the marine landscape.",,,Estudios Atacameños,,,,2019,2019,2019,,,ahead,275-298,All OA; Gold,Article,"Hidalgo, Jorge; Cisternas, Priscilla; Aguilar, Julio","Hidalgo, Jorge (); Cisternas, Priscilla (); Aguilar, Julio ()",,"Hidalgo, Jorge (); Cisternas, Priscilla (); Aguilar, Julio ()",8,3,,,https://scielo.conicyt.cl/pdf/eatacam/n61/0718-1043-eatacam-00502.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1117060536,,

This earthquake seems to be spatially located between two major historical earthquakes, the 1868 Mw 8.8 earthquake in southern Peru and the 1877 Mw 8.5 earthquake in northern Chile. Continuous GPS data were used to model the coseismic slip of the mainshock and the largest aftershock (Mw 7.6). The afterslip was modeled for 273 days (end of year 2014) after the largest aftershock, revealing two patches of afterslip: a southern patch between the mainshock and the largest aftershock and a patch to the north of the mainshock. Observations from the seismic network indicate that aftershocks were concentrated near the southern patch. Conversely, the northern patch contained hardly any aftershocks, indicating a dominant aseismic slip. The Pisagua earthquake occurred within a prominent, curved section of the Andean subduction zone. This section may have acted as a barrier for the largest historical earthquakes and as an isolated segment during the Pisagua earthquake.","The study was supported the National Research Center for Integrated Natural Disaster Management (CIGIDEN), CONICYT/FONDAP project 15110017.

The effect of aeration in the microbial community has scarcely been studied at industrial level. Leptospirillum ferriphilum is one of the most representative species of the Fe3+ producing population in this kind of systems. We analyzed the effect of oxygen availability on L. ferriphilum by growth activity and transcriptional dynamics of its two terminal oxidases (cbb3 and bd complexes) under different experimental test: culture reactor, bioleaching column, and industrial heap tests. Relatively low O2 availability triggered important changes in the microbial community composition, cell growth, microbial activity and cydAB genes transcription in all cases of study. We assessed the potential role of the terminal oxidases on the adaptation to variable aeration conditions in different lifestyles of L. ferriphilum and identified transcriptional markers associated to oxygen metabolism in an industrial system. An interesting hypothesis about the possible role of the cbb3 complex in the response to oxidative stress as well as their role as a high oxygen-affinity oxidase in L. ferriphilum is proposed and discussed. This study successfully proves the function of the cydAB genes as valid genetic markers for low-grade copper industrial bioleaching systems.",This work was performed with the industrial samples provided by Minera Escondida Ltda.

The aim of this study was to validate a Latin American version of the ISMI in people with schizophrenia.MethodsThe study included 253 stabilized outpatients with schizophrenia from 3 Mental Health Services in three Latin American countries: Bolivia (N = 83), Chile (N = 85) and Peru (N = 85). We analyzed the psychometric properties using item response and classical test theories. An item reduction was then performed to improve the psychometric properties of the ISMI-29. The final version of the ISMI was tested for construct validity, reliability, external validity and differential item functioning (DIF).ResultsThe five-factor structure of the ISMI-29 was not confirmed using confirmatory factor analysis (RMSEA = 0.12, CFI = 0.77, and WRMR = 2.20). Seventeen items were discarded to obtain a satisfactory psychometric version. The ISMI-12 evaluates 3 dimensions: social stigma (4 items), stigma experience (4), and self-stigma (3). The factor structure accounted for 68% of the total variance. Internal consistency was satisfactory. The scalability was satisfactory, with INFIT statistics within an acceptable range. In addition, the results confirmed the absence of DIF and supported the invariance of the item calibrations between countries.ConclusionThe ISMI-29 is not valid in our sample and should not be used in Latin American countries. The ISMI-12 is the first internalized stigma questionnaire with satisfactory psychometric properties available in Latin American countries.

Nevertheless, information about VO2, lactate concentration [Lac], and work efficiency are absent in this CIHH miner population. Our aim was to determine aerobic capacity, [Lac], and work efficiency at sea level (SL) and HA during maximum exercise in miners acclimatized to CIHH at 3,800 m. Eight volunteer miners acclimatized to CIHH at HA (> 4 years) performed an exercise test at SL and HA. The test was performed on the 4th day at HA or SL and consisted of three phases: Rest (5 min); Exercise test, where the load was increased by 50 W every 3 min until exhaustion; and a Recovery period of 30 min. During the procedure VO2, transcutaneous arterial saturation (SpO2, %), and HR (bpm) were assessed at each step by a pulse oximeter and venous blood samples were taken to measure [Lac] and hemoglobin concentration. No differences in VO2 and [Lac] in SL vs. HA were observed in this CIHH miner population. By contrast, a higher HR and lower SpO2 were observed at SL compared with HA. During maximum exercise, a reduction in VO2 and [Lac] was observed without differences in intensity (W) and HR. A decrease in [Lac] was observed at maximum effort (250 W) and recovery at HA vs. SL. These findings are related to an increased work efficiency assessment such as gross and net efficiency. This study is the first to show that miners exposed to CIHH maintain their work capacity (intensity) with a fall in oxygen consumption and a decrease in plasmatic lactate concentration at maximal effort at HA. These findings indicate that work efficiency at HA is enhanced.",We would like to thank our assistant researcher Mr. Hervis Galleguillos who collaborated in this study.

Conducted between January-September 2015 in a nearshore site of the northern Humboldt Current System directly exposed to year-round upwelling episodes, this study was aimed at assessing the relationship between upwelling mediated pH-changes and functional traits of the numerically dominant planktonic copepod-grazer Acartia tonsa (Copepoda). Environmental temperature, salinity, oxygen, pH, alkalinity, chlorophyll-a (Chl), copepod adult size, egg production (EP), and egg size and growth were assessed through 28 random oceanographic surveys. Agglomerative clustering and multidimensional scaling identified three main di-similitude nodes within temporal variability of abiotic and biotic variables: A) ""upwelling"", B) ""non-upwelling"", and C) ""warm-acid"" conditions. Nodes A and B represented typical features within the upwelling phenology, characterized by the transition from low temperature, oxygen, pH and Chl during upwelling to higher levels during non-upwelling conditions. However, well-oxygenated, saline and ""warm-acid"" node C seemed to be atypical for local climatology, suggesting the occurrence of a low frequency oceanographic perturbation. Multivariate (LDA and ANCOVA) analyses revealed upwelling through temperature, oxygen and pH were the main factors affecting variations in adult size and EP, and highlighted growth rates were significantly lower under node C. Likely buffering upwelling pH-reductions, phytoplankton biomass maintained copepod reproduction despite prevailing low temperature, oxygen and pH levels in the upwelling setting. Helping to better explain why this species is among the most recurrent ones in these variable yet productive upwelling areas, current findings also provide opportune cues on plankton responses under warm-acid conditions, which are expected to occur in productive EBUS as a consequence of climate perturbations.","This work was supported by VAR was funding by FONDECYT Grant No. 11130495 VAR, RE &amp; CVG were fundedby Millennium Scientific Initiative Grant IC120019.

Divergence between Atlantic and Pacific clades has been associated with the uplift of the Panama Isthmus, and inside the Pacific region, a biogeographic barrier located west of Hawaii has restricted the gene flow between Central/Eastern and Western Pacific populations. We investigated the carapace shape of C. mydas from individuals of Atlantic, Eastern Pacific, and Western Pacific genetic lineages using geometric morphometrics to evaluate congruence between external morphology and species' phylogeography. Furthermore, we assessed the variation of carapace shape according to foraging grounds. Three morphologically distinctive groups were observed which aligned with predictions based on the species' lineages, suggesting a substantial genetic influence on carapace shape. Based on the relationship between this trait and genetic lineages, we propose the existence of at least three distinct morphotypes of C. mydas. Well-defined groups in some foraging grounds (Galapagos, Costa Rica and New Zealand) may suggest that ecological or environmental conditions in these sites could also be influencing carapace shape in C. mydas. Geometric morphometrics is a suitable tool to differentiate genetic lineages in this cosmopolitan marine species. Consequently, this study opens new possibilities to explore and test ecological and evolutionary hypotheses in species with wide morphological variation and broad geographic distribution range.","Financial support for this study was provided by the Vice-Rectory of Research of the University of Costa Rica through the Integral Network of Marine Turtles in the Eastern Pacific (RITMA), The Leatherback Trust, Veritas University, Surfari del Mar, Centro de Rescate de Especies Marinas Amenazadas (CREMA), National Marine Fisheries Service and the Turner Foundation, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Rufford Small Grant, Idea Wild, Chilean Government Environmental Protection Fund (FPA), and the Institute of Natural and Mathematical Sciences, Massey University, Auckland.

In this cross-sectional study, the final sample included 1245 adult and 686 older women. The PA levels, mode of commuting, ST, and leisure-time PA were self-reported. Vitamin D deficiency was defined as <12 ng/mL and insufficiency as <20 ng/mL. A higher ST was associated with vitamin D deficiency (odds ratio (OR): 2.4, 95%: 1.6⁻4.3) in adults, and passive commuting was associated with vitamin D deficiency in older (OR: 1.7, 95%: 1.1⁻2.7). Additionally, we found a joint association in the high ST/passive commuting group in adults (OR: 2.8, 95%: 1.6⁻4.9) and older (OR: 2.8, 95%: 1.5⁻5.2) with vitamin D deficiency, in respect to low ST/active commuting. The PA levels and leisure-time PA were not associated with vitamin D deficiency. In conclusion, mode of commuting and ST seems important variables related to vitamin D deficiency. Promoting a healthy lifestyle appears important also for vitamin D levels in adult and older women. Further studies are needed to establish causality of this association and the effect of vitamin D deficiency in different diseases in this population.","We thank all participants for their cooperation and the Chilean Health Ministry and Department of Public Health, The Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile for designing and conducting the third National Health Survey 2016–2017.","P.S.-U. was supported by a grant from CONICYT/BECAS Chile/72180543.

A European multicentric qualitative research by the European general practice research network,"BackgroundGeneral Practice (GP) seems to be perceived as less attractive throughout Europe. Most of the policies on the subject focused on negative factors. An EGPRN research team from eight participating countries was created in order to clarify the positive factors involved in appeals and retention in GP throughout Europe. The objective was to explore the positive factors supporting the satisfaction of General Practitioners (GPs) in clinical practice throughout Europe.MethodQualitative study, employing face-to-face interviews and focus groups using a phenomenological approach. The setting was primary care in eight European countries: France, Belgium, Germany, Slovenia, Bulgaria, Finland, Poland and Israel. A thematic qualitative analysis was performed following the process described by Braun and Clarke. Codebooks were generated in each country. After translation and back translation of these codebooks, the team clarified and compared the codes and constructed one international codebook used for further coding.ResultsA purposive sample of 183 GPs, providing primary care to patients in their daily clinical practice, was interviewed across eight countries. The international codebook included 31 interpretative codes and six themes. Five positive themes were common among all the countries involved across Europe: the GP as a person, special skills needed in practice, doctor-patient relationship, freedom in the practice and supportive factors for work-life balance. One theme was not found in Poland or Slovenia: teaching and learning.ConclusionThis study identified positive factors which give GPs job satisfaction in their clinical practice. This description focused on the human needs of a GP. They need to have freedom to choose their working environment and to organize their practice to suit themselves. In addition, they need to have access to professional education so they can develop specific skills for General Practice, and also strengthen doctor-patient relationships. Stakeholders should consider these factors when seeking to increase the GP workforce.","We would like to sincerely thank the European General Practice Research Network for its support in the survey.

The goal of this study was to conduct the first in-depth characterization of the swim bladder-associated microbiota using high-throughput sequencing of the V4 region of the 16 S rRNA gene in rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss). We observed major differences in bacterial communities composition between swim bladder-associated microbiota and distal intestine digesta microbiota in fish. Whilst bacteria genera, such as Cohnella, Lactococcus and Mycoplasma were more abundant in swim bladder-associated microbiota, Citrobacter, Rhodobacter and Clavibacter were more abundant in distal intestine digesta microbiota. The presumptive metabolic function analysis (PICRUSt) revealed several metabolic pathways to be more abundant in the swim bladder-associated microbiota, including metabolism of carbohydrates, nucleotides and lipoic acid as well as oxidative phosphorylation, cell growth, translation, replication and repair. Distal intestine digesta microbiota showed greater abundance of nitrogen metabolism, amino acid metabolism, biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids and bacterial secretion system. We demonstrated swim bladder harbors a unique microbiota, which composition and metabolic function differ from microbiota associated with the gut in fish.",This work was supported by FONDECYT 1171129 and Postdoc FONDECYT 3160835 grants from CONICYT Chile.

The obtained compounds were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), Raman spectroscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Structural, morphological, and chemical analyses confirmed the synthesis of poorly crystalline Re-doped MoS2 flower-like microspheres composed of few stacked layers. They exhibit enhanced hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) performance with low overpotential of 210 mV at current density of 10 mA/cm2, with a small Tafel slope of 78 mV/dec. The enhanced catalytic HER performance can be ascribed to activation of MoS2 basal planes and by reduction in charge transfer resistance during HER upon doping.","The authors gratefully thank CONICYT (FONDECYT GRANT 3170761 and 11771803) for the financial support.

Marine microalgae are of particular interest in this context because they have developed tolerance and defense strategies to resist the exposure to pathogenic bacteria, viruses, and fungi in the aquatic environment. Although antimicrobial activities have been reported for some microalgae, natural algal bioactive peptides have not been described yet. In this work, acid extracts from the microalga Tetraselmis suecica with antibacterial activity were analyzed, and de novo sequences of peptides were determined. Synthetic peptides and their alanine and lysine analogs allowed identifying key residues and increasing their antibacterial activity.

Despite their potential, the characterization and use of PHCO for road paving is still limited. This study focuses on assessing the adhesion quality and rheological properties of both unmodified and nano-modified asphalt residues (AR) obtained from two sources of PHOC. The results suggest that the AR offer smaller stiffness and develop asphalt-aggregate interfaces with lower adhesion quality as compared to those generated by the control conventional asphalt. In general, the nano-modifier addition led to lower stiffness values for the AR, and although it improved the adhesion in dry condition, the susceptibility to moisture damage at the asphalt-aggregate interfaces was not reduced.

Based on these features, users can make informed decisions about the products and services they buy online. Although prior studies have investigated on various review characteristics, the writing style has been examined less frequently. This empirical study simulated an e-commerce platform, in which participants (N = 124) were confronted with the reviews and helpfulness votes of other users while searching for one certain product (i.e. a laptop). The task was to rate how trustworthy or fake the reviews are, and the purchase intention after reading each review. Our results show that a factual writing style is considered more trustworthy, less fake, and entails a higher purchase intention when compared to emotional reviews. The trust cues were only relevant in interaction with variables that measure trust in the Internet as a safe environment for making monetary transactions. Furthermore, we found that trustworthiness influenced purchase intention, but the fakeness perception of the review does not yield such effects. We suggest future studies to understand this result and highlight implications for platform design.","This work was supported by the German Research Foundation (DFG) under grant No. GRK 2167, Research Training Group “User-Centred Social Media.”","This work was supported by the German Research Foundation (DFG) under Grant No. GRK 2167, Research Training Group “User-Centred Social Media”.",Cogent Business & Management,,Andreea Molnar,,2019-01,2019,2019-03-18,2019-01,6,1,1586062,All OA; Gold,Article,"Carbonell, Guillermo; Barbu, Catalin-Mihai; Vorgerd, Laura; Brand, Matthias","Carbonell, Guillermo (General Psychology: Cognition, University of Duisburg-Essen, Duisburg, Germany; Erwin L.

Se asume como hipótesis central que existe una brecha significativa en los usos de los avances tecnológicos en la educación en los países en desarrollo. Para ello, se recurre al trabajo heurístico y hermenéutico, explorando en las investigaciones en países del primer mundo, las posibilidades de la virtualidad para la formación primaria y secundaria en Colombia y México. Un mapa conceptual se presenta como herramienta de compilación y asociación. Se identifica que simSchool tiene mayor potencial para usarse como una plataforma para la educación especialmente a distancia y para distintos grupos y que los países de la región deben hacer esfuerzos para enmarcar sus sistemas educativos en la dinámica inmersiva.
Abstract Despite the fact that technology is a core tool for teaching and learning, technological advances and its applications even demand greater dissemination and socialization, especially within the teachers’ community in developing countries. This article systematizes a virtual learning state-of-the-art and describes the more important technological advances underlying virtual environments. Our assumption was that developing countries have a signifying gap in using technological advances for educational purposes. Using heuristic and hermeneutic strategies, we explore research in developed countries trying to identify real possibilities of virtual environment for K-12 education (primary and secondary school) for both countries: Colombia and Mexico. In addition, we designed a map to compile concepts and associate them. Results suggest that simSchool has a great potential for being used as an educational platform, particularly for remote courses and different groups.

Being able to identify the origin of the difficulty is a real challenge, which is why the executive functions (FE) are analyzed because they are very useful and use for learning. This study included a sample of 30 school students with low academic performance, who were evaluated for FE through the TMT tests, verbal fluency test and Wisconsin card test. The low academic performance was identified through the academic history. It is a study of quantitative approach, descriptive type - transversal and correlational. Most of the participants had a performance below the mean and standard deviation in the Wisconsin letter test in the errors measure, as well as in the phonological FAS and in the TMT part B with some non-significant differences identified by age in other measurements of the tests. There is a statistically significant relationship between self-monitoring and self-correction and FEs: design of plans and programs and efficient resolution of problems in the participants. There is also a relationship between age and the development of the ability to solve problems efficiently, as well as the ability to self-monitor and self-correct. The greater the design of plans and programs, the greater the efficient resolution of problems. There is a need to study other variables that affect the academic performance of school children.

The SLP technique recalculates the optimal beam-forming vectors by solving a non-negative least squares problem per every set of transmitted symbols. It exploits the advantages of constructive inter-user interference to minimize the total transmitted power and increase service availability. The benefits of using SLP come with a substantially increased computational load at the gateway. The FPGA design enables the SLP technique to perform in real-time operation mode and provide a high symbol throughput for the multiple receive terminals. We define the SLP technique in a closed-form algorithmic expression and translate it to hardware description language (HDL) and build an optimized HDL core for an FPGA. We evaluate the FPGA resource occupation, which is required for the high throughput multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) systems with sizeable dimensions. We describe the algorithmic code, the I/O ports mapping, and the functional behavior of the HDL core. We deploy the IP core to an actual FPGA unit and benchmark the energy efficiency performance of the SLP. The synthetic tests demonstrate a fair energy efficiency improvement of the proposed closed-form algorithm compared to the best results obtained through the MATLAB numerical simulations.",,,IEEE Access,,,,2019-02-11,2019,2019-02-11,,7,,15509-15520,All OA; Gold,Article,"Krivochiza, Jevgenij; Duncan, Juan Merlano; Andrenacci, Stefano; Chatzinotas, Symeon; Ottersten, Bjorn","Krivochiza, Jevgenij (SnT Department, University of Luxembourg, Luxembourg City, Luxembourg); Duncan, Juan Merlano (SnT Department, University of Luxembourg, Luxembourg City, Luxembourg); Andrenacci, Stefano (SnT Department, University of Luxembourg, Luxembourg City, Luxembourg); Chatzinotas, Symeon (SnT Department, University of Luxembourg, Luxembourg City, Luxembourg); Ottersten, Bjorn (SnT Department, University of Luxembourg, Luxembourg City, Luxembourg)",,"Krivochiza, Jevgenij (University of Luxembourg); Duncan, Juan Merlano (University of Luxembourg); Andrenacci, Stefano (University of Luxembourg); Chatzinotas, Symeon (University of Luxembourg); Ottersten, Bjorn (University of Luxembourg)",20,3,,6.49,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/ielx7/6287639/8600701/08624286.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1111635691,40 Engineering; 4006 Communications Engineering; 46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4613 Theory Of Computation,7 Affordable and Clean Energy

Chronic treatment with this antidepressant drug is thought to favor functional recovery by promoting structural and molecular changes in several forebrain areas. At the synaptic level, chronic fluoxetine induces an increased size and density of dendritic spines and an increased ratio of GluN2A over GluN2B N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor subunits. The ""maturation""-promoting molecular changes observed after chronic fluoxetine should also induce structural remodeling of the neuronal dendritic arbor and changes in the synaptic responses. We treated adult rats with fluoxetine (0.7 mg/kg i.p. for 28 days) and performed a morphometric analysis using Golgi stain in limbic and nonlimbic cortical areas. Then, we focused especially on the auditory cortex, where we evaluated the dendritic morphology of pyramidal neurons using a 3-dimensional reconstruction of neurons expressing mRFP after in utero electroporation. With both methodologies, a shortening and decreased complexity of the dendritic arbors was observed, which is compatible with an increased GluN2A over GluN2B ratio. Recordings of extracellular excitatory postsynaptic potentials in the auditory cortex revealed an increased synaptic response after fluoxetine and were consistent with an enrichment of GluN2A-containing NMDA receptors.

This study reports, for the first time, the complete mitochondrial genome of B. humboldti n. sp., a new cryptic species from the South-East Pacific (SEP).MethodsThe mitogenome of B. humboldti n. sp. was assembled from short Illumina 150 bp pair-end reads. The phylogenetic position of B. humboldti n. sp. among other closely related congeneric and confamiliar capsalids was examined using mitochondrial protein-coding genes (PCGs). Morphology of B. humboldti n. sp. was examined based on fixed and stained specimens.ResultsThe AT-rich mitochondrial genome of B. humboldti is 13,455 bp in length and comprises 12 PCGs (atp8 was absent as in other monogenean genomes), 2 ribosomal RNA genes, and 22 transfer RNA genes. All protein-coding, ribosomal RNA, and transfer RNA genes are encoded on the H-strand. The gene order observed in the mitochondrial genome of B. humboldti n. sp. was identical to that of B. seriolae from Japan but different from that of B. seriolae from Australia. The genetic distance between B. humboldti n. sp. and B. seriolae from Japan was high. Minor but reliable differences in the shape of the penis were observed between Benedenia humboldti n. sp. and congeneric species.ConclusionsPhylogenetic analyses based on PCGs in association with differences in the shape of the penis permitted us to conclude that the material from the South-East Pacific represents a new species of Benedenia infecting S. lalandi off the coast of Chile. The discovery of this parasite represents the first step to improving our understanding of infestation dynamics and to develop control strategies for this pathogen infecting the farmed yellowtail kingfish, Seriola lalandi, in the South-East Pacific.",Many thanks to Dr Vince P.

One of the consequences of intra-sexual selection is that male reproductive traits tend to evolve and diverge at high rates. In benthic octopuses, females often mate with more than one male in a single reproductive event, opening the venue for intra-sexual selection at multiple levels. For instance, males transfer spermatophores through hectocotylus, and can remove the spermatophores left by other males. Considering the limited evidence on post-copula competition in benthic octopuses, and the potential to affect the evolution of reproductive traits within octopodids, we put this hypothesis to a test employing a phylogenetic comparative approach. We combined data on hectocotylized arm length (HAL), ligula length (LL), spermatophore length (SL) with a Bayesian molecular phylogeny of 87 species, to analyze how reproductive traits have diverged across lineages and covary with body size (mantle length; ML). First, additionally to ML, we estimated the phylogenetic signal (λ) and mode of evolution (κ) in each reproductive trait. Second, we performed phylogenetic regressions to quantify the association among reproductive traits and their co-variation with ML. This analysis allowed us to estimate the phenotypic change along a branch into the phylogeny, and whether selection may have played a role in the evolution and diversification of specific clades. Estimations of λ were always high (>0.75), indicating concordance between the traits and the topology of the phylogenetic tree. Low values of κ (<1.0) suggested that evolution depends on branch lengths. All reproductive traits exhibiting a positive relation with ML (β > 0.5 in all cases). Overall, evolutionary rate models applied to the SL-ML regression suggested that octopuses of the family Megaleledonidae have evolved larger spermatophores than expected for their size. The regression HAL-ML indicated that HAL was more variable in Megaleledonidae than in the remaining clades, suggesting that the high divergence across species within this group might partially reflect intra-sexual selection. These results support the hypothesis that, at least in some lineages, sexual selection may account for the divergence in reproductive traits of male octopuses.",We thank Prof. Elie Poulin and Prof. Marco Méndez from Universidad de Chile for their review of an early version of the manuscript.

This saturation is usually due to the admission of non-urgent patients, who constitute a high percentage of patients in an ED. The Agent-based Model (ABM) is one of the most important tools that helps to study complex systems and explores the emergent behavior of this type of department. Its simulation more accurately reflects the complexity of the operation of real systems. Our proposal is the design of an ABM to schedule the access of these non-critical patients into an ED, which can be useful for the service management dealing with the actual growing demand for emergency care. We suppose that a relocation of these non-critical patients within the expected input pattern, provided initially by historical records, enables a reduction in waiting time for all patients, and therefore, it will lead to an improvement in the quality of service. It would also allow us to avoid long waiting times. This research offers the availability of relevant knowledge for Emergency Department managers in order to help them make decisions to improve the quality of the service, in anticipation of the expected growing demand of the service in the very near future.","This work was supported in part by the Agencia Estatal de Investigacion (AEI), Spain, in part by the Fondo Europeo de desarrollo Regional (FEDER) UE under Contract TIN2017-84875-P, and in part by a research collaboration agreement with the Fundacio Escoles Universities Gimbernat (EUG).",,IEEE Access,,,,2019-12-30,2019,2019-12-30,2020-01-01,8,,9209-9220,All OA; Gold,Article,"Bruballa, Eva; Wong, Alvaro; Rexachs, Dolores; Luque, Emilio","Bruballa, Eva (Escoles Universitaries Gimbernat (EUG), Computer Science School, Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona, 08193, Barcelona, Spain); Wong, Alvaro (Computer Architecture and Operating Systems Department, Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona Campus Bellaterra, 08193, Barcelona, Spain); Rexachs, Dolores (Computer Architecture and Operating Systems Department, Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona Campus Bellaterra, 08193, Barcelona, Spain); Luque, Emilio (Computer Architecture and Operating Systems Department, Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona Campus Bellaterra, 08193, Barcelona, Spain)","Wong, Alvaro (Autonomous University of Barcelona)","Bruballa, Eva (Autonomous University of Barcelona); Wong, Alvaro (Autonomous University of Barcelona); Rexachs, Dolores (Autonomous University of Barcelona); Luque, Emilio (Autonomous University of Barcelona)",5,3,,1.23,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/ielx7/6287639/8948470/08945359.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1123731003,46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4605 Data Management and Data Science,3 Good Health and Well Being

However, in Higher Education, this transformation relies mostly on teacher's efforts to innovate within the learning environments, requiring institutional efforts to generate strategies towards educational innovation. This paper presents the analysis of didactic trends and training needs of teachers at UNIMINUTO Colombia, based on the data gathered at the Annual Meetings for Innovative Pedagogical Practices and an additional survey applied on-line, to determine teachers' training needs and, furthermore, institutional strategies to strengthen the teaching-learning process. The study uses a mixed methodology through a concurrent triangulation design with qualitative and quantitative methods, with an exploratory scope; both quantitative and qualitative parts of the study counted on a voluntary sampling method. Trend analysis shows that the most used didactic methods are Project-Based learning, Research-Based Learning, and Collaborative Learning. However, the analysis of teachers' appropriation of knowledge about didactics, especially on those strategies, is low or basic, which compared to the training needs expressed by teachers demonstrate that training processes in educational innovation and new teaching methods is crucial to help educational innovation initiatives to evolve. The study stablishes a trend towards the use active-learning methodologies in pedagogical practices, highlighting the necessity of teachers' training in how and when to use them, and setting the importance of including communication skills as a topic in teachers' training programs.",,,International Journal of Cognitive Research in Science Engineering and Education,,,,2019-12-20,2019,2019-12-20,2019-12-20,7,3,71-85,All OA; Gold,Article,"A.

The ackee, Blighia sapida, is a tree native to the African continent and in Costa Rica the fruits are consumed mainly by Afro-descendants living in the Atlantic. Objective. The objective of this work was to describe the geographical distribution, phenotypic diversity and management of the ackee crop in the Huetar Atlantic Region of Costa Rica. Materials and methods. A vegetative and reproductive prospection and characterization was carried out, in addition to the measurement of the yield index (IR) of ackee materials in the Region, between 2015 and 2016. Results. Sixty-six trees growing along the Braulio Carrillo highway and the road to the South Atlantic, were evaluated. The cantons with the highest number of genotypes were Siquirres and Limon. The great majority of these materials were found growing near the houses, which denotes a rooting of this species in the local culinary culture. Of the forty genotypes characterized, little phenotypic variability was found in the vegetative characters. As for the fruits, they showed greater diversity, with variation in the weight, size, color and number, and weight and firmness of the arils. A 86.9 % of the genotypes presented arils with firm consistency before and after the cooking test. IR values were between 8 and 20, with the best genotypes having an index close to 8. The agronomic management of the trees in terms of fertilization, pruning, pests and pathogens, control is almost non-existent. Conclusion. It is suggested to validate the use of the trees selected for their good productive performance, and to create the bases to establish the simple agronomic management, which includes the use of fertilization, pruning, higher planting densities, among other tasks, and measure the impact on the productivity and quality of the fruits of this species.",,,Agronomía Mesoamericana,,,,2019-09-01,2019,2019-09-01,,,,885-898,All OA; Gold,Article,"Quesada-Rojas, Patricia; Barrantes-Santamaría, Walter Vicente","Quesada-Rojas, Patricia (Universidad de Costa Rica); Barrantes-Santamaría, Walter Vicente (Universidad de Costa Rica)",,"Quesada-Rojas, Patricia (University of Costa Rica); Barrantes-Santamaría, Walter Vicente (University of Costa Rica)",0,0,,0.0,https://revistas.ucr.ac.cr/index.php/agromeso/article/download/34701/39550,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1120853485,"30 Agricultural, Veterinary and Food Sciences; 3008 Horticultural Production",

                    Irresponsible self-medication is a problem for health systems in developing countries. We aimed to estimate the frequency of self-medication and associated factors in users of drugstores and pharmacies in Peru.
                  
                  
                    Methods:
                    We performed a secondary data analysis of the 2015 National Survey on User Satisfaction of Health Services (ENSUSALUD), a two-stage probabilistic sample of all regions of Peru. Non self-medication (NSM), responsible self-medication (RSM) and irresponsible self-medication (ISM) were defined as the outcome categories. Demographic, social, cultural and health system variables were included as covariates. We calculated relative prevalence ratios (RPR) with their 95% confidence intervals (95%CI) using crude and adjusted multinomial logistic regression models for complex samples with NSM as the referent category.
                  
                  
                    Results:
                    2582 participants were included. The average age was 41.4 years and the frequencies of NSM, RSM and ISM were 25.2%, 23.8% and 51.0%; respectively. The factors associated with RSM were male gender (RPR: 1.35; 95%CI: 1.06-1.72), being between 40 and 59 years old (RPR: 0.53; 95%IC: 0.39-0.72), being 60 or older (RPR: 0.39; 95%IC: 0.25-0.59), not having health insurance (RPR: 1.89; 95%CI: 1.31-2.71) and living in the Highlands region (RPR: 2.27; 95%CI: 1.23-4.21). The factors associated with ISM were male gender (RPR: 1.41; 95%CI: 1.16-1.72), being between 40 and 59 years old (RPR: 0.68; 95%IC: 0.53-0.88), being 60 or older (RPR: 0.65; 95%IC: 0.48-0.88) and not having health insurance (RPR: 2.03; 95%CI: 1.46-2.83).

Most of the morphology-based identifications of species within this genus reported from Africa require critical revision. The aim of the present study was to determine the diversity of Diplostomum metacercariae in South African fishes applying molecular and traditional morphological techniques. To achieve this aim, a total of 216 fishes belonging to 21 species collected in the Rivers Phongolo, Riet, Usuthu and Mooi in three provinces of South Africa were examined. Metacercariae of Diplostomum were recovered from the eye lenses of 38 fishes belonging to five species of the families Anguillidae, Cichilidae and Mochokidae, with an overall low prevalence of infection (18%). Metacercariae were subjected to morphological study and molecular sequencing of the partial mithochondrial cox1 and ribosomal 28S rDNA genes as well as of ribosomal ITS1-5.8S-ITS2 region. Morphological and phylogenetic analyses revealed the presence of three species which matched those previously reported from Nigeria, Iraq and China, therefore those from Tilapia sparrmanii and Synodontis zambezensis were named Diplostomum sp.; those from Anguilla labiata, Oreochromis mossambicus and S. zambezensis were named Diplostomum sp. 14; and those from Pseudocrenilabrus philander were named Diplostomum sp. 16. Geographic distribution of several species of Diplostomum appeared to be wider than expected. Morphological description and novel sequence data generated during this study will contribute to the elucidation of the life cycles of Diplostomum sp., Diplostomum sp. 14 and Diplostomum sp. 16 and advance further research of diplostomids in Africa.","We are grateful to Ezemvelo KZN Wildlife and to the Department of Rural, Environmental and Agricultural Development, North-West Provincial Government for providing the permits: OP 1582/2018 for sampling in KwaZulu-Natal and NW 8065/03/2019 for sampling in the North-West Province.

It is caused mainly by enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) colonization in pig gut. Antibiotics has been used to prevent, combat and control PWD and its negative impact on the productivity of pig breeding sector. Nonetheless, antibiotics due to their wide antibacterial spectrum also can reach beneficial gut bacteria, such as Lactobacillus. Lately, essential oils (EOs) have emerged as a potential alternative to using antibiotics in animal breeding because of their effect on bacterial growth. Commonly, citrus EOs are by-products of food industry and the availability of these EOs in the worldwide market is huge. Thus, six commercials citrus EOs were evaluated on ETEC strains, as model of pathogenic bacteria, and on Lactobacillus species, as models of beneficial bacteria. In overall, citrus EOs exhibited a selective antibacterial activity with higher effect on pathogenic bacteria (ETECs) than beneficial bacteria (Lactobacillus). Brazilian orange terpenes (BOT) oil presented the highest selective performance and caused higher disturbances on the normal growth kinetic of ETEC than on Lactobacillus rhamnosus. The action was dose-dependent on the maximal culture density (A) and the lag phase duration (λ) of the ETEC. The highest sub-inhibitory concentration (0.925 mg/mL) extended the λ duration to ETEC eight times (14.6 h) and reduced A in 55.9%. For L. rhamnosus, the λ duration was only extended 1.6 times. Despite the fact that limonene was detected as the major compound, the selective antibacterial activity of the citrus EOs could not be exclusively attributed to limonene since the presence of minor compounds could be implicated in conferring this feature.","The authors are grateful to CIENCIACTIVA for Carmen M.S.

To ensure maintenance of cell function upon thawing, the preservation of the actin cytoskeleton is crucial, but so far there is little quantitative data on the influence of cryopreservation on cytoskeletal structures. For this reason, our study aims to quantitatively describe cryopreservation induced alterations to F-actin in adherent human mesenchymal stem cells, as a basic model for biomedical applications. Here we have characterised the actin cytoskeleton on single-cell level by calculating the circular standard deviation of filament orientation, F-actin content, and average filament length. Cryo-induced alterations of these parameters in identical cells pre and post cryopreservation provide the basis of our investigation. Differences between the impact of slow-freezing and vitrification are qualitatively analyzed and highlighted. Our analysis is supported by live cryo imaging of the actin cytoskeleton via two photon microscopy. We found similar actin alterations in slow-frozen and vitrified cells including buckling of actin filaments, reduction of F-actin content and filament shortening. These alterations indicate limited functionality of the respective cells. However, there are substantial differences in the frequency and time dependence of F-actin disruptions among the applied cryopreservation strategies; immediately after thawing, cytoskeletal structures show least disruption after slow freezing at a rate of 1°C/min. As post-thaw recovery progresses, the ratio of cells with actin disruptions increases, particularly in slow frozen cells. After 120 min of recovery the proportion of cells with an intact actin cytoskeleton is higher in vitrified than in slow frozen cells. Freezing at 10°C/min is associated with a high ratio of impaired cells throughout the post-thawing culture.",The authors received no specific funding for this work.

In this paper, we propose a novel DNA-based model for arithmetic over  G F (  p n   )   . Our model has three main advantages over other previously described models. First, it has a flexible implementation in the laboratory that allows the realization arithmetic calculations in parallel for  p  ≥ 2  , while the tile assembly and the sticker models are limited to p = 2  . Second, the proposed model is less prone to error, because it is grounded on conventional Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) amplification and gel electrophoresis techniques. Hence, the problems associated to models such as tile-assembly and stickers, that arise when using more complex molecular techniques, such as hybridization and denaturation, are avoided. Third, it is simple to implement and requires 50 ng/μL per DNA double fragment used to develop the calculations, since the only feature of interest is the size of the DNA double strand fragments. The efficiency of our model has execution times of order  O ( 1 )   and  O ( n )   , for the addition and multiplication over  G F (  p n   )   , respectively. Furthermore, this paper provides one of the few experimental evidences of arithmetic calculations for molecular computing and validates the technical applicability of the proposed model to perform arithmetic operations over G F (  p n   )   .",,"This work was supported by VRIDT/UCN N° 171/17, VRIDT/UCN N° 084/2018 and Project FONDEF IT17M10012.",Heliyon,,,,2019-12-11,2019,2019-12-11,2019-12,5,12,e02901,All OA; Gold,Article,"Jirón, Iván; Soto, Susana; Marín, Sabrina; Acosta, Mauricio; Soto, Ismael","Jirón, Iván (Departamento de Matemáticas, Universidad Católica del Norte, Antofagasta, Chile); Soto, Susana (Departamento de Matemáticas, Universidad Católica del Norte, Antofagasta, Chile); Marín, Sabrina (Centro de biotecnología “Profesor Alberto Ruiz”, Universidad Católica del Norte, Antofagasta, Chile); Acosta, Mauricio (Centro de biotecnología “Profesor Alberto Ruiz”, Universidad Católica del Norte, Antofagasta, Chile); Soto, Ismael (Departamento de Ingeniería Eléctrica, Universidad de Santiago de Chile, Santiago, Chile)","Jirón, Iván (Catholic University of the North)","Jirón, Iván (Catholic University of the North); Soto, Susana (Catholic University of the North); Marín, Sabrina (Catholic University of the North); Acosta, Mauricio (Catholic University of the North); Soto, Ismael (University of Santiago Chile)",4,2,0.08,1.64,http://www.cell.com/article/S2405844019365600/pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1123287945,46 Information and Computing Sciences; 49 Mathematical Sciences; 4903 Numerical and Computational Mathematics,

The reasons come from economic viability to the latency along with behavioral changes that may affect the applications that use data stored remotely. Among those challenges, there is the problem of ensuring the integrity and retrievability of users’ data in the cloud. Several schemas have been proposed: proof of data possession (PDP), proof of retrievability (PoR), and proof of ownership (PoW) that differ on the approach to guarantee the effective retrieval of data stored remotely. In this paper, a novel PoR protocol is proposed: hyper-scalability, availability, and integrity layer (Hy-SAIL), where a new PoR scheme adds higher availability to data stored and a flexible manner to perform integrity checks. It is demonstrated that Hy-SAIL leads to an efficient and scalable cryptographic system that meets near-optimal bounds in terms of communication and storage complexities. It is also proposed a new adversarial model that aggregates the main functionalities of a realistic adversary in cloud computing environments. Hy-SAIL operates on data that are not affected by any kind of incremental change or update, which is the characteristic of various file types stored in clouds, such as stored video and audio streams. When compared to other systems, such as HAIL, Hy-SAIL is more scalable and efficient. The results collected with an unoptimized implementation of Hy-SAIL point to a better perspective than other approaches.","This work was supported in part by the European Union’s Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Programme under Grant 700326, the Brazilian Research Council’s CNPq under Grant 465741/2014-2 (INCT on Cybersecurity), CAPES under Grant 23038.007604/2014-69 FORTE, and FAP-DF under Grant 0193.001366/2016 UIoT, Grant 0193.001365/2016 SSDDC, and Grant Call 01/2019, the Institutional Security Office of the Presidency of the Republic of Brazil under Grant 002/2017, the LATITUDE/UnB Laboratory under Grant 23106.099441/2016-43 SDN, the Ministry of the Economy under Grant 005/2016 DIPLA, Grant 011/2016 SEST, and Grant 083/2016 ENAP, the EAGER: USBRCCR: Collaborative: Securing Networks in the Programmable Data Plane Era project funded by the NSF and RNP (Brazilian National Research Network), and the Institutional Security Office of the Presidency of the Republic of Brazil under Grant 002/2017.

The aim of this study was to improve our knowledge of the mechanisms conferring low susceptibility or resistance to quinolones among bacteria recovered from Chilean salmon farms. Sixty-five isolates exhibiting resistance, reduced susceptibility, or susceptibility to flumequine recovered from salmon farms were identified by their 16S rRNA genes, detecting a high predominance of species belonging to the Pseudomonas genus (52%). The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of flumequine in the absence and presence of the efflux pump inhibitor (EPI) Phe-Arg-β-naphthylamide and resistance patterns of isolates were determined by a microdilution broth and disk diffusion assays, respectively, observing MIC values ranging from 0.25 to >64 µg/mL and a high level of multi-resistance (96%), mostly showing resistance to florfenicol and oxytetracycline. Furthermore, mechanisms conferring low susceptibility to quinolones mediated by efflux pump activity, quinolone target mutations, or horizontally acquired resistance genes (qepA, oqxA, aac(6')-lb-cr, qnr) were investigated. Among isolates exhibiting resistance to flumequine (≥16 µg/mL), the occurrence of chromosomal mutations in target protein GyrA appears to be unusual (three out of 15), contrasting with the high incidence of mutations in GyrB (14 out of 17). Bacterial isolates showing resistance or reduced susceptibility to quinolones mediated by efflux pumps appear to be highly prevalent (49 isolates, 75%), thus suggesting a major role of intrinsic resistance mediated by active efflux.",,"This research was partially funded by the Science and Technology National Council (CONICYT) of Chile, grant number 1040924.

The study’s sample consisted of 599 students, from both genders, and from different cycles of their university studies. Their ages ranged between 21 and 25 years. To assess them, the Dysfunctional Parenting Styles Scale by Parker, et al. (1979) was used, previously adapted to Peruvian population. The participants were also evaluated with the Personal and Professional Empathy Scale designed by Yaraskavitch (2009), and completed a socio-demographic data sheet created ad hoc. General results showed no significant relationships between the dysfunctional parenting styles and empathy total scores. In contrast, considering the father figure, an inverse relationship between the authoritarian-controlling dysfunctional parenting style and the personal and professional cognitive empathy was found, while the indifference – negligence dysfunctional parenting style was inversely associated with the emotive personal empathy. As to the mother figure, there is a significant and direct relationship between authoritarian-controlling dysfunctional parenting style and personal and professional emotive empathy. It was also found that regarding gender, women have higher levels of empathy. With respect to professional degree courses, nursing students have a higher level of empathy than Medicine and Psychology students, while Medicine students have more dysfunctional parenting styles than the Nursing and Psychology groups.

The main aims of this study were, to characterize and identify the pathogenic strain using biochemical and molecular methods, to demonstrate its pathogenic activity on scallop larvae, to characterize its pathogenic properties and to describe the chronology of the pathology. The pathogenic strain was identified as Vibrio bivalvicida based on its phenotypic properties, the multilocus sequence analysis (MLSA) of eight housekeeping genes (ftsZ, gapA, gyrB, mreB, pyrH, recA, rpoA, and topA) and different in silico genome-to-genome comparisons. When triplicate cultures of healthy 10 days old scallop larvae were challenged with 1 × 105 colony forming units (CFU) mL-1 of the VPAP30 strain, percentages of larval survival of 78.9 ± 3.3%, 34.3 ± 4.9%, and 0% were observed at 12, 2,4 and 36 h, respectively, whereas uninfected larval cultures showed survival rates of 97.4 ± 1.2% after of 48 h. Clinical symptoms exhibited by the scallop larvae infected with the VPAP30 strain include the accumulation of bacteria around the scallop larvae, velum disruption and necrosis of digestive gland. The 50% lethal dose (LD50) of VPAP30 strain at 24 and 48 h was 1.3 × 104 and 1.2 × 103 CFU mL-1, respectively. The invasive pathogenic activity of the VPAP30 strain was investigated with staining of the bacterial pathogen with 5-DTAF and analyzing bacterial invasion using epifluorescence, and a complete bacterial dissemination inside the larvae at 24 h post-infection was observed. When scallop larvae were inoculated with cell-free extracellular products (ECPs) of VPAP30, the larval survival rate was 59.5 ± 1.7%, significantly (P < 0.001) lower than the control group (97.4 ± 1.2%) whereas larvae treated with heat-treated ECPs exhibited a survival rate of 61.6 ± 1.8% after 48 h of exposure. V. bivalvicida VPAP30 exhibits high pathogenic activity on scallop larvae, mediated both by bacterial invasion and the production of toxigenic heat-stable compounds. This report constitutes the first isolation of V. bivalvicida out of Europe and extends the host range of this species, having demonstrated its pathogenic activity on the Chilean scallop larvae (A. purpuratus).

Here, we examine rock thermal patterns in artificial breakwaters and test whether they have higher and spatially less variable rock temperature than natural adjacent habitats, which corresponds with lower biodiversity patterns. We estimated rock temperatures at mid-high intertidal using infrared thermography during mid-day in summer, in both artificial (Rip-raps) and natural (boulder fields) habitats. We also conducted diurnal thermal surveys (every 4 hr) in four seasons at one study site. Concurrent sampling of air and seawater temperature, wind velocity, and topographic structure of habitats were considered to explore their influence on rock temperature. Rock temperature was in average 3.7°C higher in the artificial breakwater in two of the three study sites, while air temperature was about 1.5-4°C higher at this habitat at summer. Thermal patterns were more homogeneous across the artificial habitat. Lower species abundance and richness in the artificial breakwaters were associated with higher rock temperature. Mechanism underlying enhanced substrate temperature in the artificial structures seems related to their lower small-scale spatial heterogeneity. Our study thus highlighted that higher rock temperature in artificial breakwaters can contribute to loss of biodiversity and that integrated artificial structures may alter coastal urban microclimates, a matter that should be considered in the spatial planning of urban coastal ecosystems.","ACKNOWLEDGMENT The project was financed by FONDECYT Grant # 1160223 and PAI‐CONICYT #79150002.

This small endemic petrel of the South American Pacific coast is now an important indicator of ongoing habitat loss and of the success of local conservation policies in the HCS - an ecoregion designated as a priority for the conservation of global biodiversity. Yet so far, poorly understood life history traits such as philopatry or dispersal ability may strongly influence the species’ response to ecosystem changes, but also our capacity to assess and interpret this response. To address this question, we explore the range-wide population structure of the Peruvian diving petrel, and show that this small seabird exhibits extreme philopatric behavior at the island level. Mitochondrial DNA sequences and genome-wide SNP data reveal significant isolation and low migration at very short distances, and provide strong evidence for questioning the alleged recovery in the Peruvian and Chilean populations of this species. Importantly, the full demographic independence between colonies makes local population rescue through migration unlikely. As a consequence, the Peruvian diving petrel appears to be particularly vulnerable to ongoing anthropogenic pressure. By excluding immigration as a major factor of demographic recovery, our results highlight the unambiguously positive impact of local conservation measures on breeding populations; yet at the same time they also cast doubt on alleged range-wide positive population trends. Overall, the protection of independent breeding colonies, and not only of the species as a whole, remains a major element in the conservation strategy for endemic seabirds. Finally, we underline the importance of considering the philopatric behavior and demographic independence of breeding populations, even at very fine spatial scales, in spatial planning for marine coastal areas.","We thank Diego Miranda-Urbina, Nicole Licuime Castillo, Gina Mori, Celia Caceres, Francisco Bermedo and Natalia Ortiz for their invaluable help on the field, as well as Rasme Hereme at the CEAZA, Morten Skage, Marianne Selander Hansen and Ave Tooming-Klunderud of the Norwegian Sequencing Center for their assistance in the laboratory.

The bacterium affects coho salmon (CS; Oncorhynchus kisutch), Atlantic salmon (AS; Salmo salar), and rainbow trout (RT; Oncorhynchus mykiss) in several countries, including Norway, Canada, Scotland, Ireland, and Chile. We used Bayesian genome-wide association study analyses to investigate the genetic architecture of resistance to P. salmonis in farmed populations of these species. Resistance to SRS was defined as the number of days to death and as binary survival (BS). A total of 828 CS, 2130 RT, and 2601 AS individuals were phenotyped and then genotyped using double-digest restriction site-associated DNA sequencing and 57K and 50K Affymetrix® Axiom® single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) panels, respectively. Both traits of SRS resistance in CS and RT appeared to be under oligogenic control. In AS, there was evidence of polygenic control of SRS resistance. To identify candidate genes associated with resistance, we applied a comparative genomics approach in which we systematically explored the complete set of genes adjacent to SNPs, which explained more than 1% of the genetic variance of resistance in each salmonid species (533 genes in total). Thus, genes were classified based on the following criteria: i) shared function of their protein domains among species, ii) shared orthology among species, iii) proximity to the SNP explaining the highest proportion of the genetic variance, and iv) presence in more than one genomic region explaining more than 1% of the genetic variance within species. Our results allowed us to identify 120 candidate genes belonging to at least one of the four criteria described above. Of these, 21 of them were part of at least two of the criteria defined above and are suggested to be strong functional candidates influencing P. salmonis resistance. These genes are related to diverse biological processes, such as kinase activity, GTP hydrolysis, helicase activity, lipid metabolism, cytoskeletal dynamics, inflammation, and innate immune response, which seem essential in the host response against P. salmonis infection. These results provide fundamental knowledge on the potential functional genes underpinning resistance against P. salmonis in three salmonid species.","Aguas Claras, Pesquera Antares, and Salmones Chaicas provided the CS, RT, and AS datasets, respectively.

Increased abundances of grazers, mainly due to reduction of their predators, are among the causes of this development. Here, we compared the species richness (SR), frequency of occurrence (FO), and maximum abundance (MaxN) of predatory fish and their predation pressure between kelp forest and barren ground habitats of northern-central Chile. Sampling was done using baited underwater cameras with vertical and horizontal orientation. Two prey organisms were used as tethered baits, the black sea urchin Tetrapygus niger and the porcelanid crab Petrolisthes laevigatus. SR did not show major differences between habitats, while FO and MaxN were higher on barren grounds in vertical videos, with no major differences between habitats in horizontal videos. Predation pressure did not differ between habitats, but after 24 h consumption of porcelanid crabs was significantly higher than that of sea urchins. Scartichthys viridis/gigas was the main predator, accounting for 82% of the observed predation events on Petrolisthes laevigatus. Most of these attacks occurred on barren grounds. Scartichthys viridis/gigas was the only fish observed attacking (but not consuming) tethered sea urchins. High abundances of opportunistic predators (Scartichthys viridis/gigas) are probably related to low abundances of large predatory fishes. These results suggest that intense fishing activity on large predators, and their resulting low abundances, could result in low predation pressure on sea urchins, thereby contributing to the increase of T. niger abundances in subtidal rocky habitats.","Funding was received through a FONDECYT grant (CONICYT-FONDECYT 1161383).

Dynamic processes in the water column (such as turbidity or UV penetration) as well as in the benthic bed (temperature gradients, turbation, or sedimentation rate) contribute to supply nutrients to a potential microbial ecosystem. High altitude, oligotrophic, and deep Andean lakes with active deglaciation processes and recent or past volcanic activity are natural models to assess the feasibility of life in other planetary lake/ocean environments and to develop technology for their exploration. We sampled the benthic sediments (down to 269 m depth) of the oligotrophic lake Laguna Negra (Central Andes, Chile) to investigate its ecosystem through geochemical, biomarker profiling, and molecular ecology studies. The chemistry of the benthic water was similar to the rest of the water column, except for variable amounts of ammonium (up to 2.8 ppm) and nitrate (up to 0.13 ppm). A life detector chip with a 300-antibody microarray revealed the presence of biomass in the form of exopolysaccharides and other microbial markers associated to several phylogenetic groups and potential microaerobic and anaerobic metabolisms such as nitrate reduction. DNA analyses showed that 27% of the Archaea sequences corresponded to a group of ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA) similar (97%) to Nitrosopumilus spp. and Nitrosoarchaeum spp. (Thaumarchaeota), and 4% of Bacteria sequences to nitrite-oxidizing bacteria from the Nitrospira genus, suggesting a coupling between ammonia and nitrite oxidation. Mesocosm experiments with the specific AOA inhibitor 2-Phenyl-4,4,5,5-tetramethylimidazoline-1-oxyl 3-oxide (PTIO) demonstrated an AOA-associated ammonia oxidation activity with the simultaneous accumulation of nitrate and sulfate. The results showed a rich benthic microbial community dominated by microaerobic and anaerobic metabolisms thriving under aphotic, low temperature (4°C), and relatively high pressure, that might be a suitable terrestrial analog of other planetary settings.","We thank Karina Simpertigui, Victor Robles, and Victoria Donoso from Campoalto Operaciones for technical assistance in the field, and the Aguas Andinas Company (Santiago, Chile) for providing access to Laguna Negra.","Funding.

High salinity results in osmotic stress and it can negatively impact plant grow and survival. Some plant species, however, can tolerate salinity by accumulating osmolytes like proline and maintaining low Na+ concentrations inside the cells. Another mechanism of saline stress tolerance is the association with symbiotic microorganism, an alternative that can be used as a biotechnological tool in susceptible crops. From the immense diversity of plant symbionts, those found in extreme environments such as Antarctica seems to be the ones with most potential since they (and their host) evolved in harsh and stressful conditions. We evaluated the effect of the inoculation with a consortium of plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPB) and endosymbiotic fungi isolated from an Antarctic plant on saline stress tolerance in different crops. To test this we established 4 treatments: (i) uninoculated plants with no saline stress, (ii) uninoculated plants subjected to saline stress (200 mM NaCl), (iii) plants inoculated with the microorganism consortium with no saline stress, and (iv) inoculated plants subjected to saline stress. First, we assessed the effect of symbiont consortium on survival of four different crops (cayenne, lettuce, onion, and tomato) in order to obtain a more generalized response of this biological interaction. Second, in order to deeply the mechanisms involved in salt tolerance, in lettuce plants we measured the ecophysiological performance (Fv/Fm) and lipid peroxidation to estimate the impact of saline stress on plants. We also measured proline accumulation and NHX1 antiporter gene expression (involved in Na+ detoxification) to search for possible mechanism of stress tolerance. Additionally, root, shoot, and total biomass was also obtained as an indicator of productivity. Overall, plants inoculated with microorganisms from Antarctica increased the fitness related traits in several crops. In fact, three of four crops selected to assess the general response increased its survival under salt conditions compared with those uninoculated plants. On the other hand, saline stress negatively impacted all measured trait, but inoculated plants were significantly less affected. In control osmotic conditions, there were no differences in proline accumulation and lipid peroxidation between inoculation treatments. Interestingly, even in control salinity, Fv/Fm was higher in inoculated plants after 30 and 60 days. Under osmotic stress, Fv/Fm, proline accumulation and NHX1 expression was significantly higher and lipid peroxidation lower in inoculated plants compared to uninoculated individuals. Moreover, inoculated plants exposed to saline stress had a similar final biomass (whole plant) compared to individuals under no stress. We conclude that Antarctic extremophiles can effectively reduce the physiological impact of saline stress in a salt-susceptible crops and also highlight extreme environments such as Antarctica as a key source of microorganism with high biotechnological potential.",We thank Instituto Antártico Chileno (INACH) and the Chilean Navy for logistics and field support.

Islands’ exposure to such contaminants, littered over long distances in marine or terrestrial habitats, is due to the ocean currents that can transport plastic over long ranges. Here, this issue is addressed for the Easter Island ecoregion (EIE). High-resolution ocean circulation models are used with a Lagrangian particle-tracking tool to identify the connectivity patterns of the EIE with industrial fishing areas and coastline regions of the Pacific basin. Connectivity patterns for “virtual” particles either floating (such as buoyant macroplastics) or neutrally-buoyant (smaller microplastics) are investigated. We find that the South American shoreline between 20°S and 40°S, and the fishing zone within international waters off Peru (20°S, 80°W) are associated with the highest probability for debris to reach the EIE, with transit times under 2 years. These regions coincide with the most-densely populated coastal region of Chile and the most-intensely fished region in the South Pacific. The findings offer potential for mitigating plastic contamination reaching the EIE through better upstream waste management. Results also highlight the need for international action plans on this important issue.","We acknowledge the National Oceanography Centre (NOC) and Mercator-Océan-International (MOI) for providing the Ocean Global Circulation Model simulations.

Los fechados fueron tomados de nueve estudios publicados, desarrollados en el Valle de Azapa. Las muestras datadas fueron obtenidas de entierros (cuerpos) y ofrendas (cermicas) de cementerios vinculados al periodo Medio. Cronolgicamente este periodo ha sido asociado a la presencia del Horizonte Tiwanaku en los Valles Occidentales, 500 al 1000 DC, cuyo rasgo ms representativo es la presencia de cermica decorada con formas de keros, tazones, pucos y jarras. Sin embargo, los fechados obtenidos vinculados con estos estilos cermicos corresponden mayormente a dataciones tardas, en un rango desde los 900 al 1100 DC cal. Por otra parte, la informacin reciente obtenida del cementerio Az-115 sobre nuevas dataciones, muestran que en los primeros ocho siglos del primer milenio de la Era Cristiana en el poblamiento azapeo no se observa una presencia Tiwanaku, sino ms bien una continuidad aldeana vinculada a una historia local con races en el periodo Formativo. El presente estudio, apunta a: (a) caracterizar los inicios y el desarrollo del periodo Medio en el Valle de Azapa, tomando como indicadores diagnsticos los registros de los cementerios Az-115 y Az-75, los que presentan evidencias de un proceso agrcola aldeano de carcter local, incluso con evidencias relacionadas al periodo Formativo, abarcando el periodo Medio hasta el siglo VIII, y (b) definir una segunda etapa o fase II para periodo Medio en el Valle de Azapa, caracterizada por la consolidacin de un poblamiento local aldeano. En esta segunda fase, los estilos corresponden a Cabuza, Maitas y Chiribaya, que caracterizaran los estilos cermicos locales y habran coexistido con estilos vinculados con Tiwanaku. Al parecer es en esta etapa en donde las poblaciones locales comienzan a definir una identidad regional en nuestros valles cuya expresin final la observamos en lo que se conoce como Cultura Arica, alfarera que caracteriza el periodo Intermedio Tardo (PIT) en los valles y costa de Arica. Abstract: The results are presented of the analysis of a set of 116 radiometric dates obtained through the method of Carbon 14 (C14) and thermoluminescence (TL) dating. These datings were taken from nine published studies carried out in the Azapa Valley. Regarding dated samples, these were mostly taken from burials (bodies) and offerings (ceramic) from cemeteries in the Azapa Valley linked to the Middle period. Chronologically this period has been associated with the presence of the Tiwanaku Horizon in the western valleys, 500 to 1000 AD, and its most representative feature is the presence of painted pottery with forms of keros, bowls, pucos and jars. However, the datings obtained for these ceramics mostly correspond to late datings within a range from Cal 900 to 1100 AD. On the other hand, recent information obtained from cemetery Az-115 on new dates indicates that in the first eight centuries of the first millennium of the Christian era there is no Tiwanaku presence in the Azapeo settlement, but rather a type of village continuity linked to a local history with roots in the Formative period. The present study aims: (a) to characterize the beginnings and development of the Middle period in the Azapa Valley, taking as diagnostic elements the site records of cemeteries Az -115 and Az-75, which present evidence of a local village agricultural process, including evidence related to the Formative period, spanning the Middle period until the eighth century AD; and (b) to define a second stage or phase II of the Middle period in the Azapa Valley, characterized by the consolidation of a local village settlement. In this second phase, the Cabuza, Maitas and Chiribaya styles would characterize the local ceramic styles and would also coexist mainly with styles related to Tiwanaku. Apparently, this is the stage in which local people began to define their own regional identity, whose final expression can be observed in our valleys in what is known as Arica Culture, pottery that characterizes the late Intermediate period (LIP) in the valleys and coast of Arica.",,,Chungara - Revista de Antropología Chilena,,,,2019,2019,2019,,51,ahead,595-611,All OA; Gold,Article,"Ovalle, Ivn Muoz","Ovalle, Ivn Muoz ()",,"Ovalle, Ivn Muoz ()",13,7,,3.65,https://scielo.conicyt.cl/pdf/chungara/v51n4/0717-7356-chungara-01801.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1120860129,44 Human Society; 4406 Human Geography,

However, population genetic structure may be challenging to detect in species with large population sizes, since variation in allele frequencies are more robust under genetic drift. High gene flow among populations, that can be constant or pulses of migration in a short period, may also decrease power of algorithms to detect genetic structure. Penguin species usually have large population sizes, high migratory ability but philopatric behavior, and recent investigations debate the existence of subtle population structure for some species not detected before. Previous study on Humboldt penguins found lack of population genetic structure for colonies of Punta San Juan and from South Chile. Here, we used mtDNA and nuclear markers (10 microsatellites and RAG1 intron) to evaluate population structure for 11 main breeding colonies of Humboldt penguins, covering the whole spatial distribution of this species. Although mtDNA failed to detect population structure, microsatellite loci and nuclear intron detected population structure along its latitudinal distribution. Microsatellite showed significant Rst values between most of pairwise locations (44 of 56 locations, Rst = 0.003 to 0.081) and 86% of individuals were assigned to their sampled colony, suggesting philopatry. STRUCTURE detected three main genetic clusters according to geographical locations: i) Peru; ii) North of Chile; and iii) Central-South of Chile. The Humboldt penguin shows signal population expansion after the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM), suggesting that the genetic structure of the species is a result of population dynamics and foraging colder water upwelling that favor gene flow and phylopatric rate. Our findings thus highlight that variable markers and wide sampling along the species distribution are crucial to better understand genetic population structure in animals with high dispersal ability.","This work was supported by CNPq 490403/2008-5; FAPESP 2009/08624-8; FAPESP- CONICET 10/525908, FONDECYT 11110060, 1010250, 1100695 and 1150517; Sea World and Busch Gardens Conservation Fund, ECOS/CONICYT CO3BO2, CONICYT, PICT 2110.

Previously, we found that the expression of purinergic P2Y2 receptor (P2Y2R) is increased in GC samples as compared to adjacent healthy mucosa taken from GC-diagnosed patients. In this work, we studied in detail purinergic signaling in the gastric adenocarcinoma-derived cell lines: AGS, MKN-45, and MKN-74, and compared them to a nontumoral epithelial cell line: GES-1. In GC-derived cells, we detected the expression of several purinergic receptors, and found important differences as compared to GES-1 cells. Functional studies revealed a strong contribution of P2Y2Rs in intracellular calcium increases, elicited by adenosine-triphosphate (ATP), uridine-triphosphate (UTP), and the P2Y2R agonist MRS2768. Responses were preserved in the absence of extracellular calcium and inhibited by P2Y2R antagonists. In GES-1 cells, ATP and UTP induced similar responses and the combination of P2X and P2Y receptor antagonists was able to block them. Proliferation studies showed that ATP regulates AGS and MKN-74 cells in a biphasic manner, increasing cell proliferation at 10-100 μM, but inhibiting at 300 μM ATP. On the other hand, 1-300 μM UTP, a P2Y2R agonist, increased concentration-dependent cell proliferation. The effects of UTP and ATP were prevented by both wide-range and specific purinergic antagonists. In contrast, in GES-1 cells ATP only decreased cell proliferation in a concentration-dependent manner, and UTP had no effect. Notably, the isolated application of purinergic antagonists was sufficient to change the basal proliferation of AGS cells, indicating that nucleotides released by the cells can act as paracrine/autocrine signals. Finally, in tumor-derived biopsies, we found an increase of P2Y2R and a decrease in P2X4R expression; however, we found high variability between seven different biopsies and their respective adjacent healthy gastric mucosa. Even so, we found a correlation between the expression levels of P2Y2R and P2X4R and survival rates of GC patients. Taken together, these results demonstrate the involvement of different purinergic receptors and signaling in GC, and the pattern of expression changes in tumoral cells, and this change likely directs ATP and nucleotide signaling from antiproliferative effects in healthy tissues to proliferative effects in cancer.",,"This work was funded by Fondo Nacional de Desarrollo Científico y Tecnológico (FONDECYT) Regular Grant # 1161490, CONICYT Ph.D. Fellowship #21181885 and FONDEQUIP EQM140100.

On April 24, 2016, this bloom produced a massive beaching (an accumulation on the beach surface of dead or impaired organisms which were drifted ashore) of surf clams Mesodesma donacium in Cucao Bay, Chiloé. To determine the effect of paralytic shellfish poisoning (PSP) toxins in M. donacium, samples were taken from Cucao during the third massive beaching detected on May 3, 2016. Whole tissue toxicity evidence a high interindividual variability with values which ranged from 1008 to 8763 μg STX eq 100 g-1 and with a toxin profile dominated by GTX3, GTX1, GTX2, GTX4, and neoSTX. Individuals were dissected into digestive gland (DG), foot (FT), adductor muscle (MU), and other body fractions (OBF), and histopathological and toxin analyses were carried out on the obtained fractions. Some pathological conditions were observed in gill and digestive gland of 40⁻50% of the individuals that correspond to hemocyte aggregation and haemocytic infiltration, respectively. The most toxic tissue was DG (2221 μg STX eq 100 g-1), followed by OBF (710 μg STX eq 100 g-1), FT (297 μg STX eq 100 g-1), and MU (314 μg STX eq 100 g-1). The observed surf clam mortality seems to have been mainly due to the desiccation caused by the incapability of the clams to burrow. Considering the available information of the monitoring program and taking into account that this episode was the first detected along the open coast of the Pacific Ocean in southern Chiloé, it is very likely that the M. donacium population from Cucao Bay has not had a recurrent exposition to A. catenella and, consequently, that it has not been subjected to high selective pressure for PSP resistance. However, more research is needed to determine the effects of PSP toxins on behavioral and physiological responses, nerve sensitivity, and genetic/molecular basis for the resistance or sensitivity of M. donacium.","We would like to thank to Pedro Toledo Director of Aquaculture Department of Universidad Católica del Norte for his support.

The purposes of anthologists and compilators, the criteria adopted in gathering and selecting poems, the way in which those poems are ordered and disposed in each volume, the relationships between the different books, are some of the aspects which guide the analysis. Certain gestures can be observed in that process, like, among others, the ambition of elaborating a foundational and official discourse about Tucumán in the years of the Centennial of the National Independence, or the gesture of designing the chronology of local poetry and selecting (folowing strict criteria) representative poems of the moments and periods proposed by an anthology from the 1960s.",,,Poligramas,,,,2019-06-01,2019,2019-06-01,2019-06-01,,48,45-74,All OA; Gold,Article,"Martinez-Zuccardi, Soledad","Martinez-Zuccardi, Soledad (Universidad Nacional de Tucumán)",,"Martinez-Zuccardi, Soledad (National University of Tucumán)",0,0,,0.0,https://poligramas.univalle.edu.co/index.php/poligramas/article/download/8290/11013,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1122497727,"47 Language, Communication and Culture; 4705 Literary Studies",

Depression and anxiety are frequent conditions in women of childbearing age and are associated with adverse perinatal outcomes. The prevalence in Colombian population of low obstetric risk is unknown. Objective. Establish the prevalence of depression and gestational anxiety, and the associated demographic, psychosocial and clinical variables, in women attending prenatal care in Bucaramanga and Floridablanca, Santander. Methodology. A cross-sectional, descriptive study applying a survey and Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scales, Zung Anxiety Self-Assessment, family apgar and perceived social support questionnaire. The prevalence ratios were established with 95% confidence intervals. Results. A total of 244 pregnant women were studied, with an average of 24.8 years. The prevalence of depression was 24.6%, 95% CI (19.1-30.0) and anxiety was 25.8%, 95% CI (20.3-31.3). Depression is associated with a family history of depression in first or second degree, prevalence ratio: 2.0, 95% CI (1.1-3.7); presence of anxiety, prevalence ratio: 22.5, 95% CI (9.4-53.7); and alcohol consumption, prevalence ratio: 2.9, 95% CI (1.1-8.2). A protective factor was found to have two sources of income (couple and family), prevalence ratio: 0.6, 95% CI (0.4-0.8). Additionally, anxiety was associated with the presence of depression, prevalence ratio: 13.3, 95% CI (6.3-28.1); presence of psychological violence, prevalence ratio: 2.3, 95% CI (1.1-4.8) and trusting the couple, prevalence ratio: 3.4, 95% CI (1.5-8.2). Conclusion. There is a strong association between anxiety and depression so it should be screened during pregnancy.

However, there is insufficient information on its population structure and dynamics, conservation status, or extinction risk and population decreases have been inferred from observations of habitat degradation. In 2002 and 2012, surveys using manta tows, circular plots and satellite images were performed in Old Providence and Santa Catalina Islands (Seaflower Biosphere Reserve) to determine changes in the condition and structure of a local population of D. cylindrus and its habitat. Size-frequency histograms were asymmetric and leptokurtic, showing positive distribution induced by colony fragmentation, which is indicative of reef degradation. Signs of degradation were more evident in 2012, when partial mortality of living tissue in the parent colony yielded 96.6% of the asexually produced fragments. Most of the fragments were from larger colonies (≥115 cm), which exhibited the highest partial and total mortality (>50%). Three of the four benthic habitats used by the species in 2002 were seen in 2012, but with reduced areas. The results suggest that the reduction of living tissue, the dominance of colonies produced asexually, and reduced size of fragments limit population growth and species viability in an unfavorable and changing habitat within this marine protected area (MPA) of the southwestern Caribbean. In the west of the reef complex of Old Providence, a synergy of multiple stressors could cause the habitat degradation and the fragmentation of colonies, limiting the potential recovery of the species and therefore the ability to create a healthy, genetically diverse and resilient population. Thus, these stressors must be minimized to prevent local extinction. Monitoring the population trends and recording sexual recruitment continues to be vital to understand the larvae’s habitat selection and determine whether these habitats are suitable for the survival of coral recruits. Other stressors to be monitored include anchor damage, diseases and bleaching. We recommend the MPA management program to include specific plans of conservation, recovery and restoration for coral reef builders species like D. cylindrus.","The work was done with the permits of CORALINA (001-2012) and PNN McBean Lagoon (001-2013).

The model does not include the Ownership Subsystem, but it includes the Environment Subsystem, a subsystem that has a vital influence on the life and performance of an organization of that size. These three subsystems intersect in common elements such as culture, economy or company vision, triggering the success or failure of the company itself. The methodology used was a mixed methodology, with both qualitative and quantitative elements. First, the Delphi method was used on a scale that was applied to 25 owners of Small and Medium Enterprises and then, to make an additional confirmation, hypothesis testing, factorial analysis and the technique of structural equations were used. It was seen that the ownership subsystem has a lower weight than the business, environment and family subsystems, is the least relevant.",,This research received no external funding.,Resources,,,,2019-05-16,2019,2019-05-16,,8,2,96,All OA; Gold,Article,"de la Cruz Vicente, Omar; Castro, Verónica Itzel López; Mata, Leovardo Mata; Bermejo, Fernando Tomé","de la Cruz Vicente, Omar (Business Department, Universidad Antonio de Nebrija, 28015 Madrid, España;, ftome@nebrija.es); Castro, Verónica Itzel López (Business School, Universidad Anahuac, Mexico City 52786, Mexico;, itzel.lopez@anahuac.mx, (V.I.L.C.);, leovardo.mata@anahuac.mx, (L.M.M.)); Mata, Leovardo Mata (Business School, Universidad Anahuac, Mexico City 52786, Mexico;, itzel.lopez@anahuac.mx, (V.I.L.C.);, leovardo.mata@anahuac.mx, (L.M.M.)); Bermejo, Fernando Tomé (Business Department, Universidad Antonio de Nebrija, 28015 Madrid, España;, ftome@nebrija.es)","de la Cruz Vicente, Omar (Nebrija University)","de la Cruz Vicente, Omar (Nebrija University); Castro, Verónica Itzel López (Universidad Anáhuac México Sur); Mata, Leovardo Mata (Universidad Anáhuac México Sur); Bermejo, Fernando Tomé (Nebrija University)",2,0,,0.3,https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9276/8/2/96/pdf?version=1560247951,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1114517530,41 Environmental Sciences; 4104 Environmental Management,

Muchos de estos datos son ofrecidos en modo abierto; son los denominados datos abiertos, Open Data en inglés (en adelante OD), y que son actualidad, futuro, apertura, transparencia, conocimiento, eficiencia, ahorro de tiempo, profundidad en la investigación, desarrollo en la educación, precisión en los análisis y por tanto en las patologías y diagnósticos de cualquier ámbito de nuestra vida que interese estudiar. No obstante, de poco o nada sirve conocer todo sobre los mismos si no sabemos qué hacer con ellos ni tenemos la capacidad para explotarlos. En este contexto, y ante las escasas iniciativas en el entorno educativo, se presenta el siguiente trabajo que tiene como objeto de estudio los datos abiertos dentro del ámbito de las facultades de educación españolas, intentando dar respuesta a si se pueden aprovechar en la enseñanza superior como recurso docente. Como objetivo principal se plantea conocer qué tipo de percepción poseen los docentes universitarios ante el uso y el valor de los datos abiertos para el proceso de enseñanza-aprendizaje. La muestra ha sido de 192 docentes, con un margen de error máximo aplicable a datos globales no segmentados con un nivel de confianza del 95,5%, que en el caso más desfavorable (p=q=50%), es de ±7,2%. Para ello, se ha elaborado un diseño de investigación no experimental, de tipo exploratorio, utilizando el instrumento del cuestionario para la recogida de información.

Clinical and preclinical studies have shown that iron depletion exacerbates cognitive problems in offspring exposed to ethanol in utero and that PAE promotes dysregulation in brain iron homeostasis. However, the mechanisms underlying brain iron dysregulation and neuronal activity defects in adolescent offspring of PAE are unclear and poorly understand. Here, we used a PAE rat model to analyze messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein expression of iron homeostasis genes such as transferrin receptor (TfR), divalent metal transporter (DMT1), ferroportin (FPN1), and ferritin (FT) in brain areas associated with memory formation such as the prefrontal cortex (PFC), ventral tegmental area, and hippocampus. Interestingly, we found that 21 day old PAE rats have higher mRNA expression of DMT1 in the PFC, and TfR in the hippocampus, compared to control animals. In contrast FPN has lower mRNA expression in the PFC, and FT and FPN1 have lower expression in the hippocampus. In agreement with these results, we found a 1.5-2 fold increase of TfR and DMT1 protein levels both in the hippocampus and the PFC. Additionally, using an electrophysiological approach, we found that in hippocampal slices from PAE rats, iron treatment decreased long-term potentiation (LTP), but not AMPAR basal transmission (AMPAR fEPSP). In contrast, in control slices Fe-NTA did not affect LTP but decreased significantly the AMPAR fEPSP. Meanwhile, iron chelation with deferiprone decreased AMPAR transmission in PAE and control slices and decreased LTP only in controls slices. These results suggest that PAE affects iron homeostasis of specific brain areas-PFC and hippocampus-which could be involved in maladaptive cognition observed in this animal model.",We would like to thank Daniela Mun~oz and Daniela Jara for their contribution in the pilot experiments and Dr Ricardo M.

Therefore, targeting Akt can be a promising strategy for radiosensitization. Here, we explore the impact of the Akt inhibitor MK-2206 alone and in combination with the dual PI3K and mTOR inhibitor PI-103 on the radiation sensitivity of glioblastoma cells. In addition, we examine migration of drug-treated cells.MethodsUsing single-cell tracking and wound healing migration tests, colony-forming assay, Western blotting, flow cytometry and electrorotation we examined the effects of MK-2206 and PI-103 and/or irradiation on the migration, radiation sensitivity, expression of several marker proteins, DNA damage, cell cycle progression and the plasma membrane properties in two glioblastoma (DK-MG and SNB19) cell lines, previously shown to differ markedly in their migratory behavior and response to PI3K/mTOR inhibition.ResultsWe found that MK-2206 strongly reduces the migration of DK-MG but only moderately reduces the migration of SNB19 cells. Surprisingly, MK-2206 did not cause radiosensitization, but even increased colony-forming ability after irradiation. Moreover, MK-2206 did not enhance the radiosensitizing effect of PI-103. The results appear to contradict the strong depletion of p-Akt in MK-2206-treated cells. Possible reasons for the radioresistance of MK-2206-treated cells could be unaltered or in case of SNB19 cells even increased levels of p-mTOR and p-S6, as compared to the reduced expression of these proteins in PI-103-treated samples. We also found that MK-2206 did not enhance IR-induced DNA damage, neither did it cause cell cycle distortion, nor apoptosis nor excessive autophagy.ConclusionsOur study provides proof that MK-2206 can effectively inhibit the expression of Akt in two glioblastoma cell lines. However, due to an aberrant activation of mTOR in response to Akt inhibition in PTEN mutated cells, the therapeutic window needs to be carefully defined, or a combination of Akt and mTOR inhibitors should be considered.",The authors are grateful to the radiation therapists’ staff for their help with the irradiation procedure.,"This work was supported by the grant (No. 70112891 to CSD and VLS) of the Deutsche Krebshilfe e.V.

During a survey of monogeneans parasitizing alestids, species of Characidotrema were collected in Cameroon, D. R. Congo, Senegal, South Africa, Sudan and Zimbabwe. This paper provides new morphological data and the first molecular analysis broadening our knowledge on the diversity of these parasites.ResultsSeven species (four known and three new) of Characidotrema are reported from two species of Brycinus: C. auritum n. sp. and C. vespertilio n. sp. from B. imberi (Peters); and C. brevipenis Paperna, 1969, C. nursei Ergens, 1973, C. pollex n. sp., C. spinivaginus (Paperna, 1973) and C. zelotes Kritsky, Kulo & Boeger, 1987 from B. nurse (Rüppell). Species identification was based on morphological analysis of the sclerotized structures supported by nuclear ribosomal DNA (partial 18S rDNA, ITS1, and 28S rDNA) sequence data. Morphological analysis confirmed that the most apparent character distinguishing species in the genus is the morphology of the male copulatory organ and vagina. Observations on the haptoral sclerotized elements of these parasites by means of phase contrast microscopy revealed the presence of a sheath-like structure relating to the ventral anchor, a feature that supplements the generic diagnosis of Characidotrema. Maximum Likelihood and Bayesian analyses of the large subunit (28S) rDNA sequences recovered Characidotrema species isolated from the two Brycinus hosts as monophyletic, and indicated a closer relationship of this group to monogeneans parasitizing African cyprinids (Dactylogyrus spp.) and cichlids (species of Cichlidogyrus Paperna, 1960, Scutogyrus Pariselle & Euzet, 1995, and Onchobdella Paperna, 1968) than to those from catfishes (species of Quadriacanthus Paperna, 1961, Schilbetrema Paperna & Thurston, 1968 and Synodontella Dossou & Euzet, 1993). The overall agreement between the morphological diversification of the MCOs and the molecular tree observed in this study indicates that significant phylogenetic signals for clarifying relationships among species of Characidotrema are present in the characteristics of the MCO.ConclusionsIt seems that intra-host speciation is an important force shaping the present distribution and diversity of Characidotrema but further studies are necessary to confirm this hypothesis and assess questions related to the phylogeny of these parasites. To identify potential co-speciation events, co-phylogenetic analyses of these monogeneans and their alestid hosts are required.","The authors are grateful to K. Francová and I.

The main aims of this study were to investigate the presence of transferable sulfonamide- and trimethoprim-resistance genes, sul and dfr, and their association with integrons among bacteria associated to Chilean salmon farming. For this purpose, 91 Gram-negative strains resistant to sulfisoxazole and/or trimethoprim recovered from various sources of seven Chilean salmonid farms and mainly identified as belonging to the Pseudomonas genus (81.0%) were studied. Patterns of antimicrobial resistance of strains showed a high incidence of resistance to florfenicol (98.9%), erythromycin (95.6%), furazolidone (90.1%) and amoxicillin (98.0%), whereas strains exhibited minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC90) values of sulfisoxazole and trimethoprim of >4,096 and >2,048 μg mL-1, respectively. Strains were studied for their carriage of these genes by polymerase chain reaction, using specific primers, and 28 strains (30.8%) were found to carry at least one type of sul gene, mainly associated to a class 1 integron (17 strains), and identified by 16S rRNA gene sequencing as mainly belonging to the Pseudomonas genus (21 strains). Of these, 22 strains carried the sul1 gene, 3 strains carried the sul2 gene, and 3 strains carried both the sul1 and sul2 genes. Among these, 19 strains also carried the class 1 integron-integrase gene intI1, whereas the dfrA1, dfrA12 and dfrA14 genes were detected, mostly not inserted in the class 1 integron. Otherwise, the sul3 and intI2 genes were not found. In addition, the capability to transfer by conjugation these resistance determinants was evaluated in 22 selected strains, and sul and dfr genes were successfully transferred by 10 assayed strains, mainly mediated by a 10 kb plasmid, with a frequency of transfer of 1.4 × 10-5 to 8.4 × 10-3 transconjugant per recipient cell, and exhibiting a co-transference of resistance to florfenicol and oxytetracycline, currently the most used in Chilean salmon industry, suggesting an antibacterial co-selection phenomenon. This is the first report of the characterization and transferability of integrons as well as sul and dfr genes among bacteria associated to Chilean salmon farms, evidencing a relevant role of this environment as a reservoir of these genes.","We thank Dr. Matthew Lee, Centro i∼mar, Universidad De Los Lagos, Puerto Montt, Chile, for editing the manuscript.",Funding.

Feminist analysis points to the existence of an androcentric and patriarchal order, which through the practices of subjectification, builds the identity of the subjects. These practices have been shaped by close affective bonds, including couple bounds, who in turn have constructed them as criminals. Ninety-four women were interviewed in six prisons in four countries. Their life stories were analyzed through Atlas.ti. Affective bonds with the partner and gender violence are the two main categories of analysis. It was found that the affective bonds with the partner that included violent behavior can be a factor leading these women towards crime. The findings suggest that the women were imprisoned, before entering prison, in violent relationships that held them, configuring their subjectivity. The violent partner bonds and female delinquency associated with them are the product of a patriarchal society that does not see a difference between being a victim or being criminal.","Thanks are given to the women who voluntarily decided to participate in this study by sharing their life stories, to the Universities and Associations that supported the methodological development of this study, and to COLCIENCIAS for financing this research process.","This research was funded by COLCIENCIAS, grant number 617.",Social Sciences,,,,2019-01-24,2019,2019-01-24,,8,2,32,All OA; Gold,Article,"Aristizábal Becerra, Luz Adriana; Cubells Serra, Jenny","Aristizábal Becerra, Luz Adriana (Departamento Psicología Social, Universidad Autónoma de Barcelona, 08193 Barcelona, Spain); Cubells Serra, Jenny (Departamento Psicología Social, Universidad Autónoma de Barcelona, 08193 Barcelona, Spain)","Aristizábal Becerra, Luz Adriana (Autonomous University of Barcelona)","Aristizábal Becerra, Luz Adriana (Autonomous University of Barcelona); Cubells Serra, Jenny (Autonomous University of Barcelona)",3,0,,2.2,https://www.mdpi.com/2076-0760/8/2/32/pdf?version=1548332685,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1111635861,44 Human Society; 4402 Criminology; 48 Law and Legal Studies; 4804 Law In Context; 4805 Legal Systems,"16 Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions; 5 Gender Equality"

It explains the strategic use of decorations in time of war, the new enlightened character of honorific distinctions in the Napoleonic era, and why historians should be careful in viewing them as evidence of popular royalism.","Versões anteriores foram apresentadas no seminário “A 200 años de la reconquista española”, Biblioteca del Banco de la República, Santa Marta (Colômbia), setembro de 2015; na conferencia “Popular Royalism in the Revolutionary Atlantic World”, Universidade de Yale, outubro de 2016; e na conferência “El Bicentenario de la Independencia de Colombia 2019 y los retos de la celebración”, Academia Colombiana de Historia e Archivo General de la Nación, junho de 2018.

Cupriavidus metallidurans CH34 is a model strain to study heavy metal resistance and bioremediation as it is able to deal with high heavy metal concentrations. Biofilm formation by bacteria is mediated by the second messenger bis-(3'-5')-cyclic dimeric guanosine monophosphate (c-di-GMP). The aim of this study was to characterize the response of C. metallidurans CH34 planktonic and biofilm cells to cadmium including their c-di-GMP regulatory pathway. Inhibition of the initiation of biofilm formation and EPS production by C. metallidurans CH34 correlates with increased concentration of cadmium. Planktonic and biofilm cells showed similar tolerance to cadmium. During exposure to cadmium an acute decrease of c-di-GMP levels in planktonic and biofilm cells was observed. Transcription analysis by RT-qPCR showed that cadmium exposure to planktonic and biofilm cells induced the expression of the urf2 gene and the mercuric reductase encoding merA gene, which belong to the Tn501/Tn21 mer operon. After exposure to cadmium, the cadA gene involved in cadmium resistance was equally upregulated in both lifestyles. Bioinformatic analysis and complementation assays indicated that the protein encoded by the urf2 gene is a functional phosphodiesterase (PDE) involved in the c-di-GMP metabolism. We propose to rename the urf2 gene as mrp gene for metal regulated PDE. An increase of the second messenger c-di-GMP content by the heterologous expression of the constitutively active diguanylate cyclase PleD correlated with an increase in biofilm formation and cadmium susceptibility. These results indicate that the response to cadmium in C. metallidurans CH34 inhibits the initiation of biofilm lifestyle and involves a decrease in c-di-GMP levels and a novel metal regulated PDE.","The authors thank Dr. Juan Sanjuán and Dr. Daniel Pérez-Mendoza for the donation of pJB3Tc19 and pJBpleD∗ plasmids, and Natalie Gugala for support with the training and use of Calgary Biofilm Device.

Thus, we aimed to explore the potential reproduction-immunity trade-off in Argopecten purpuratus, a species with great economic importance for Chile and Peru. Hemocytes, key immunological cells in mollusks, were the center of this study, where we addressed for the first time the relation between reproductive stage, hemocyte metabolic energetics and their capacity to support immune responses at cellular and molecular levels. Hemocyte metabolic capacity was assessed by their respiration rates, mitochondrial membrane potential and citrate synthase (CS) activity. Cellular immune parameters such as the number of circulating and tissue-infiltrating hemocytes and their reactive oxygen species (ROS) production capacity were considered. Molecular immune responses were examined through the transcriptional levels of two pattern recognition receptors (ApCLec and ApTLR) and two anti-microbial effectors (ferritin and big defensin). Their expressions were measured in hemocytes from immature, matured and spawned scallops under basal, and one of the following challenges: (i) in vitro, where hemocytes were challenged with the β glucan zymosan, to determine the immune potentiality under standardized conditions; or (ii) in vivo challenge, using hemocytes from scallops injected with the pathogenic bacteria Vibrio splendidus. Results indicate a post-spawning decrease in the structural components of the immune system (hemocyte number/quality) and their potential capacity of performing immune functions (with reduced ATP-producing machinery and exhaustion of energy reserves). Both in vitro and in vivo challenges demonstrate that hemocytes from immature scallops have, in most cases, the best metabolic potential (increased CS activity) and immune performances, with for example, over threefold higher ROS production and tissue-infiltration capacity than those from mature and spawned scallops after the bacterial challenge. Agreeing with cellular responses, hemocytes from immature individuals induced the highest levels of immune receptors and antimicrobial effectors after the bacterial challenge, while spawned scallops presented the lowest values. Overall, results suggest a trade-off between resource allocation in reproduction and the immune responses in A. purpuratus, with hemocyte energy metabolic capacity potentially underlying cellular and molecular immune responses. Further research would be necessary to explore regulatory mechanisms such as signaling pleiotropy which may potentially be underlying this trade-off.","We are deeply grateful to Dr. Claudio Alvarez for his help with the immune-fluorescent essays.

Currently, several studies recognize that physical activity (PA) benefits brain health in children. However, most of these studies have not been carried out in developing countries or lack the transference into the education field. The Cogni-Action Project is divided into two stages, a cross-sectional study and a crossover-randomized trial. The aim of the first part is to establish the associations of PA, sedentarism, and physical fitness with brain structure and function, cognitive performance and academic achievement in Chilean schoolchildren (10–14 years-old). The aim of the second part is to determinate the acute effects of three PA protocols on neuroelectric indices during a working memory and a reading task.MethodsPA and sedentarism will be self-reported and objectively-assessed with accelerometers in a representative subsample, whilst physical fitness will be evaluated through the ALPHA fitness test battery. Brain structure and function will be assessed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in a randomized subsample. Cognitive performance will be assessed through the NeuroCognitive Performance Test, and academic achievement by school grades. In the second part 32 adolescents (12–13 year-old) will be cross-over randomized to these condition (i) “Moderate-Intensity Continuous Training” (MICT), (ii) “Cooperative High-Intensity Interval Training” (C-HIIT), and (iii) Sedentary condition. Neuroelectric indices will be measures by electroencephalogram (EEG) and eye-tracking, working memory by n-back task and reading comprehension by a reading task.DiscussionThe main strength of this project is that, to our knowledge, this is the first study analysing the potential association of PA, sedentarism, and physical fitness on brain structure and function, cognitive performance, and academic achievement in a developing country, which presents an important sociocultural gap. For this purpose, this project will use advanced technologies in neuroimaging (MRI), electrophysiology (EEG), and eye-tracking, as well as objective and quality measurements of several physical and cognitive health outcomes.Trial registrationClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT03894241 Date of register: March 28, 2019.

The Salar de Huasco is one of these environments due to its altitude, atmospheric pressure, solar radiation, temperature variations, pH, salinity, and the presence of toxic compounds such as arsenic. However, the physiological and/or molecular mechanisms that enable them to prosper in these environments have not yet been described. Our research group has isolated several strains of Exiguobacterium genus from different sites of Salar de Huasco, which show different resistance levels to As(III) and As(V). In this work, we compare the protein expression patterns of the three strains in response to arsenic by a proteomic approach; strains were grown in absence of the metalloid and in presence of As(III) and As(V) sublethal concentrations and the protein separation was carried out in 2D electrophoresis gels (2D-GE). In total, 999 spots were detected, between 77 and 173 of which showed significant changes for As(III) among the three strains, and between 90 and 143 for As(V), respectively, compared to the corresponding control condition. Twenty-seven of those were identified by mass spectrometry (MS). Among these identified proteins, the ArsA [ATPase from the As(III) efflux pump] was found to be up-regulated in response to both arsenic conditions in the three strains, as well as the Co-enzyme A disulfide reductase (Cdr) in the two more resistant strains. Interestingly, in this genus the gene that codifies for Cdr is found within the genic context of the ars operon. We suggest that this protein could be restoring antioxidants molecules, necessary for the As(V) reduction. Additionally, among the proteins that change their expression against As, we found several with functions relevant to stress response, e.g., Hpf, LuxS, GLpX, GlnE, and Fur. This study allowed us to shed light into the physiology necessary for these bacteria to be able to tolerate the toxicity and stress generated by the presence of arsenic in their niche.","We would like to thank the sequencing service of Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile that works through CONICYT – FONDEQUIP EQM150077.

This ecosystem has unique biological and oceanographic features, characterized by: small geographical units, high degree of endemism with a high degree of connectivity within the system. Two fleets have historically operated in this system: a long term coastal artisanal fishery associated with the Islands, focused mainly on lobster, and a mainland based industrial demersal finfish fishery operating on the seamounts which is currently considered overexploited. The management of these fisheries has been based on a classical single-species approach to determine output controls (industrial fleet) and a mixed management system with formal and informal components (artisanal fleet). There has been growing interest in increasing the exploitation of fisheries, and modernization of the fishing fleet already operating in the JFRE. Under this scenario of increased levels of fishing exploitation and the high level of interrelation of species it might be necessary to understand the impact of these fisheries from a holistic perspective based on a ecosystem-based modeling approach. To address these challenges we developed an Atlantis end-to-end model was configured for this ecosystem. The implemented model has a high degree of skill in representing the observed trends and fluctuations of the JFRE. The model shows that the industrial fishing has a localized impact and the artisanal fisheries have a relatively low impact on the ecosystem, mainly via the lobster fishery. The model indicates that the depletion of large sized lobster has leads to an increase in the population of sea urchins. Although this increase is not sufficient, as yet, to cause substantial flow-on effects to other groups, caution is advised in case extra pressure leads the ecosystem towards a regime shift.","This work was supported by The Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization and the Institute for Marine and Antarctic Studies, University of Tasmania.

Systematization and integration of previously unpublished data from several types of sites, suggests that this relationship would have been based on public ritual events involving acts of negotiation and redistribution. These acts would have been carried out mostly on the context of mortuary practices with significant displays of ceramic offerings, as well as meetings on the summit of “island” hills, both ideologically appropriated and resemantized through the use of architecture visually and spatially correlated with Andean peaks sacralized by the Inka.Certain differences on the geographic distribution of these displays in the study area, would have been related both to the Inka strategies as well as to the local sociopolitical scenarios, and eventually to the agency of native communities.Results contribute to the understanding of the modes of interaction or relation that were developed for incorporating and/or keeping different regions and peoples within the Tawantinsuyu, and specifically of the relationship between its representatives with non-hierarchical societies. Also, they reinforce the need to consider the role of the sociocultural dinamics and/or agency of local communities, to understand the different strategies used by the cuzqueño State in the various regions were its ideology was introduced.",,,Estudios Atacameños,,,,2019,2019,2019,,,63,43-80,All OA; Gold,Article,"Barbaric, Daniel Pavlovic; Sánchez, Rodrigo; Pascual, Daniel; Martínez, Andrea; Cortes, Constanza; Dávila, Cristian; La Mura, Natalia","Barbaric, Daniel Pavlovic (Departamento de Antropología, Universidad de Chile); Sánchez, Rodrigo (Departamento de Antropología, Universidad de Chile); Pascual, Daniel (Departamento de Antropología, Universidad Alberto Hurtado); Martínez, Andrea (Investigadora Independiente); Cortes, Constanza (Investigadora Independiente); Dávila, Cristian (Investigador Independiente); La Mura, Natalia (Investigadora Independiente)",,"Barbaric, Daniel Pavlovic (University of Chile); Sánchez, Rodrigo (University of Chile); Pascual, Daniel (Alberto Hurtado University); Martínez, Andrea (Investigadora Independiente); Cortes, Constanza (Investigadora Independiente); Dávila, Cristian (Investigador Independiente); La Mura, Natalia (Investigadora Independiente)",10,4,,5.4,https://doi.org/10.22199/issn.0718-1043-2019-0022,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1121510972,"43 History, Heritage and Archaeology; 4301 Archaeology; 44 Human Society",10 Reduced Inequalities

Learner’s dictionaries are specially designed as a support to foreign language-learning. We aim to present not only an historical panorama of this subject, but also we are especially interested in exploring which knowledge areas could help to improve learner’s dictionaries. As a methodological framework, we use principles of metalexicography, such the fact that every piece of information contained in a dictionary must corres-pond to the language in use. A second metalexicographical principle is that the user must profit from the lexicographical information in order to use the language. Subsequently, both principles are tested together in the light of disciplines as corpus linguistics, error analysis and cognition; furthermore, we analyze these principles with the aid of data obtained from learner’s corpora (in particular, errors performed by foreign-language students). Our results prove that all these areas offer a very useful knowledge for the design of English learners’ diction-naries and Spanish learners’ dictionaries.

The copper dissolution from white metal was studied using ferric ions in the range of 1–10 g/L, NaCl in the range of 30–210 g/L, and sulfuric acid in the range of 10–50 g/L. The test without NaCl produced a dissolution of 55%; through the addition of NaCl, the dissolution increased to nearly 90%. The effect of sulfuric acid on the copper dissolution was not significant in the studied range, as the excess sulfuric acid simply increased the iron precipitation. The positive effect of NaCl seems to be related to the action of chloro-complex oxidizing agents in relation to the Cu+2/Cu+ couple. A simplified two-stage mechanism is proposed for the leaching of white metal. In the first stage, the white metal produces covellite and Cu2+, and in the second stage it produces elemental sulfur and Cu2+.

To that end, narratological elements of voice, focus, time and modality, as well as title, heading, incipit, intra-diegesis and extra-diegesis, are identified. Once these have been identified, the way in which these textual elements and resources contribute to the creation of the homophobic experience and reality is described. Such analysis is supported by some theoretical principles of narratology, queer theory, social criticism and semiotic, in order to provide a hermeneutic reading. It concludes that a transindividual (re)affirmation of the homophobic habitus and injury is given through narrator’s voice. This comes to constitute the whole tale as a character assassination. In addition, how far the narrator’s homophobic prejudice, injurious story and double assassination have permeated literary critics is demonstrated, because it has accepted the homosexual’s stereotype and stigmatization.",,,Revista de Filología y Lingüística de la Universidad de Costa Rica,,,,2019-03-21,2019,2019-03-21,,45,1,11-55,All OA; Gold,Article,"López, Ronald Campos","López, Ronald Campos (Universidad de Costa Rica, Costa Rica)",,"López, Ronald Campos (University of Costa Rica)",0,0,,0.0,https://revistas.ucr.ac.cr/index.php/filyling/article/download/36654/37410,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1113221072,"47 Language, Communication and Culture; 4705 Literary Studies",

Previously, the wide-range antimicrobial capacity of inhibitory substances secreted by the Lactobacillus plantarum UTNCys5-4 strain was demonstrated in vitro ; however, its mechanism of action in the food matrix remains unclear. This study was aimed to evaluate the effect of antimicrobials produced by the Cys5-4 strain in raw meat applied as pure cell cultures, cell-free supernatant (CFS), and partially purified peptides. The bacteriological results indicated the presence of commensal microbes exhibiting resistance to several antibiotics in meat samples purchased from the local market. Dipping solutions containing antimicrobial substances produced by Cys5-4 resulted in a decrease by 1.91 , 1.69, and 1.55 log 10 in cell counts upon addition of CFS, peptides and respectively pure cell culture in raw meat at day 9 of storage with refrigeration. The microbial population was maintained in the untreated meat samples during storage. An increase in pH and a concentration of released ammonia was detected in nontreated meat, indicating protein degradation. The Cys5-4 peptides exerted their bacteriolytic mode of action inducing damage in the cell membrane of the target bacteria, allowing the leaching of DNA/RNA content. The results indicate that coating meat with CFS containing Cys5-4 is a promising approach to protect against further contamination by microorganism spoilage, as well as an alternative for increasing the shelf life of raw meat.","The authors gratefully acknowledge the generous technical support of T.

Among these are marine nodules, which have approximately 24% manganese and may be a solution to the shortage of high-grade ores on the surface. In this investigation, an ANOVA analysis was performed to evaluate the time independent variables and MnO2/reducing agent in the leaching of manganese nodules with the use of different Fe reducing agents (FeS2, Fe2+, Fe0 and Fe2O3). Tests were also carried out for the different reducing agents evaluating the MnO2/Fe ratio, in which the Fe0 (FeC) proved to be the best reducing agent for the dissolution of Mn from marine nodules, achieving solutions of 97% in 20 min. In addition, it was discovered that at low MnO2/Fe ratios the acid concentration in the system is not very relevant and the potential and pH were in ranges of −0.4–1.4 V and −2–0.1 favoring the dissolution of Mn from MnO2.","The authors are grateful for the contribution of the Scientific Equipment Unit- MAINI of the Universidad Católica del Norte for aiding in generating data by automated electronic microscopy QEMSCAN® and for facilitating the chemical analysis of the solutions.

Oil and gas industry projects almost always include blast-resistant buildings. For instance, based on a hazard identification (HAZID) and hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis of a plant, control rooms and substations are sometimes designed to withstand an external free air explosion that generates blast over pressure. In this regard, a building façade is considered to be the first barrier of resistance against explosion waves, and therefore a building façade has an important role in reducing a building’s vulnerability and human casualties. In case of a lack of enough resistance, explosion waves enter a building and bring about irreparable damage to the building. Consequently, it seems important to study and evaluate various materials used in a façade against the consequences of an explosion. This study tried to make a comparison between different types of building facades against explosion waves. The materials used in a building play a key role in the vulnerability of a building. In this research, a literature review and the fuzzy Delphi method were applied to find the most critical criteria, and then a fuzzy evaluation based on the distance from the average solution (EDAS) was applied in order to assess various materials used in building facades from the perspective of resiliency. A questionnaire was presented to measure effective indices in order to receive experts’ ideas. Finally, by implementing this methodology in a case study, it was concluded that a stone façade performs much better against explosions.",,,Algorithms,,,,2019-06-10,2019,2019-06-10,,12,6,119,All OA; Gold,Article,"Hasheminasab, Hamidreza; Hashemkhani Zolfani, Sarfaraz; Bitarafan, Mahdi; Chatterjee, Prasenjit; Abhaji Ezabadi, Alireza","Hasheminasab, Hamidreza (School of Civil Engineering, College of Engineering, University of Tehran, 16th Azar St., Enghelab Sq., Tehran 1417466191, Iran); Hashemkhani Zolfani, Sarfaraz (School of Engineering, Catholic University of the North, Larrondo 1281, Coquimbo 1780000, Chile); Bitarafan, Mahdi (Department of Risk Management, International Institute of Earthquake Engineering and Seismology, Tehran 1953714453, Iran); Chatterjee, Prasenjit (Department of Mechanical Engineering, MCKV Institute of Engineering, Howrah 711204, West Bengal 711204, India); Abhaji Ezabadi, Alireza (Amirkabir University of Technology (Tehran Polytechnic), Technology Foresight Group, Department of Management, Science and Technology, Tehran 15854413, Iran)",,"Hasheminasab, Hamidreza (University of Tehran); Hashemkhani Zolfani, Sarfaraz (Catholic University of the North); Bitarafan, Mahdi (International Institute of Earthquake Engineering and Seismology); Chatterjee, Prasenjit (Maulana Abul Kalam Azad University of Technology, West Bengal); Abhaji Ezabadi, Alireza (Amirkabir University of Technology)",15,5,,,https://www.mdpi.com/1999-4893/12/6/119/pdf?version=1561545289,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1117034919,40 Engineering; 46 Information and Computing Sciences; 49 Mathematical Sciences,11 Sustainable Cities and Communities

Volz (2008:112) concedes that, although European missionaries introduced Batswana to Christianity, they had hardly any control over how early Batswana converts perceived and adapted their teachings. In some instances, dikgosi, as traditional leaders, are still facing a serious conundrum of being a Christian, on the one hand, and a custodian of culture, on the other. This is in line with the view expressed by Amanze (2003:43) that many Christians, especially members of the African Independent Churches, live a strange life, with one foot rooted in the African traditional beliefs and the other in Christian beliefs and practices. Given the statement “For there is only one God and one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus” (1 Tim. 2:5), the question is: Where does this place traditions, customs and culture?",,,Acta Theologica,,,,2019-12-04,2019,2019-12-04,2019-12-04,Supp,28,104-120,All OA; Gold,Article,"van der Merwe, SJ; Thebe, OG","van der Merwe, SJ (Northwest University); Thebe, OG (Northwest University)",,"van der Merwe, SJ (Northwest University); Thebe, OG (Northwest University)",0,0,,0.0,https://journals.ufs.ac.za/index.php/at/article/download/4047/3640,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1123138336,50 Philosophy and Religious Studies; 5004 Religious Studies; 5005 Theology,

In previous studies, it has been shown that high concentrations of reducing agent (Fe) in the system are beneficial for the rapid extraction of manganese. However, it is necessary to optimize the operational parameters in order to maximize Mn recovery. In this study, a statistical analysis was carried out using factorial experimental design for the main parameters, including time, MnO2/Fe2O3 ratio, and H2SO4 concentration. After this, Mn recovery tests were carried out over time at different ratios of MnO2/Fe2O3 and H2SO4 concentrations, where the potential and pH of the system were measured. Finally, it is concluded that high concentrations of FeSO4 in the system allow operating in potential and pH ranges (−0.2 to 1.2 V and −1.8 to 0.1) that favor the formation of Fe2+ and Fe3+, which enable high extractions of Mn (73%) in short periods of time (5 to 20 min) operating with an optimum MnO2/Fe2O3 ratio of 1:3 and a concentration of 0.1 mol/L of H2SO4.","The authors are grateful for the contribution of the Scientific Equipment Unit- MAINI of the Universidad Católica del Norte for aiding in generating data by automated electronic microscopy QEMSCAN®, and for facilitating the chemical analysis of the solutions.

Cities are at the same time the places where we live in and the big dissipators of the final energy to the environment. The simultaneous rules of heat dissipator and place to live are quite contradictory, because of the increasing temperatures of the dissipator surfaces, phenomenon known as Urban Heat Island (UHI). Mediterranean climates should suffer, in the next years, changes in the thermal needs of buildings and in the outdoor comfort sensations. A change in the energy demand from heating to cooling is probable and overheating reduction could be a priority in the future. Many mitigation strategies of UHI are being discussed in these years, such as the city greening, the use of cool materials for roofs and soils, the reduction of automobile dependence, the shift to new urban morphologies. In this paper an evaluation of impacts of different possible strategies is done, by using computational simulations for various sectors of Rome and Valparaiso. Results show the importance of greening and traffic reduction to achieve better comfort; while to reduce building energy consumption changes in urban morphology and traffic are suggested as the best strategies.",,,IOP Conference Series Earth and Environmental Science,,,,2019-08-01,2019,2019-09-06,2019-08-01,323,1,012025,All OA; Gold,Article,"Palme, M; Clemente, C; Cellurale, M; Carrasco, C; Salvati, A","Palme, M (Universidad Católica del Norte, Escuela de Arquitectura, Antofagasta, Chile; Università di Roma ""La Sapienza"", Department PDTA, Rome, Italy); Clemente, C (Università di Roma ""La Sapienza"", Department PDTA, Rome, Italy); Cellurale, M (Università di Roma ""La Sapienza"", Department PDTA, Rome, Italy); Carrasco, C (Universidad de Valparaíso, Facultad de Ingeniería, Valparaíso, Chile); Salvati, A (University Brunel, Institute of Energy Futures, London, UK)",,"Palme, M (Catholic University of the North; Sapienza University of Rome); Clemente, C (Sapienza University of Rome); Cellurale, M (Sapienza University of Rome); Carrasco, C (University of Valparaíso); Salvati, A (Brunel University London)",5,2,,,https://doi.org/10.1088/1755-1315/323/1/012025,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1120882315,37 Earth Sciences,

At present, various solar dryer models have emerged, having achieved an optimal performance in what corresponds to the processing of vegetables, however in the processes of dehydration of fruits the results have not been satisfactory, due to the loss of its color, taste, aroma and texture (organoleptic properties). Faced with this problem, an innovative design of solar fruit dehydrator is proposed, which has two objectives, the first related to recovering the organoleptic properties through a system of condenzation, cyclic dehydration and the synchronization of the calorific balance, and the second one focused on the improvement of thermal efficiency, through the use of some heat piles and a trombe wall.

Searching for the best location to meet a business perspective which can be also a sustainable one would be really challenging and it needs pre-planning. Locating for business issues in tourism industry for instance hotel locating is one of the major complicated topics in this area. Locating can come along with pre-planning and kind of feasibility studies which can cover all necessities of current and future needs of an issue. Locating with sustainability point of view is one the newest approach in different studies which this research is also working on that based on a hybrid Multiple Attribute Decision Making (MADM) model. MADM methods are really suitable ways in making complicated decisions in different areas. A hybrid MADM model based on BWM-WASPAS is applied for locating problem in finding the best location for the hotel locating challenge.

312,pub.1114344127,10.3390/su11102769,,,Climate Change Impacts and Adaptation Strategies of Agriculture in Mediterranean-Climate Regions (MCRs),"The world’s five Mediterranean-climate regions (MCRs) share unique climatic regimes of mild, wet winters and warm and dry summers. Agriculture in these regions is threatened by increases in the occurrence of drought and high temperature events associated with climate change (CC). In this review we analyze what would be the effects of CC on crops (including orchards and vineyards), how crops and cropping and farming systems could adapt to CC, and what are the social and economic impacts, as well as the strategies used by producers to adapt to CC. In rainfed areas, water deficit occurs mostly during the flowering and grain filling stages (terminal drought stress), which has large detrimental effects on the productivity of crops. Orchards and vineyards, which are mostly cultivated in irrigated areas, will also be vulnerable to water deficit due to a reduction in water available for irrigation and an increase in evapotranspiration. Adaptation of agriculture to CC in MCRs requires integrated strategies that encompass different levels of organization: the crop (including orchards and vineyards), the cropping system (sequence of crops and management techniques used on a particular agricultural field) and the farming system, which includes the farmer.",,"This research was funded by the grant PIEI “Adaptación de la Agricultura al Cambio Climático (A2C2)”, Universidad de Talca.",Sustainability,,,,2019-05-15,2019,2019-05-15,,11,10,2769,All OA; Gold,Article,"del Pozo, Alejandro; Brunel-Saldias, Nidia; Engler, Alejandra; Ortega-Farias, Samuel; Acevedo-Opazo, Cesar; Lobos, Gustavo A.; Jara-Rojas, Roberto; Molina-Montenegro, Marco A.","del Pozo, Alejandro (Plant Breeding and Phenomic Center, Faculty of Agricultural Sciences, University of Talca, Talca 3460000, Chile;, nidiabrunel@gmail.com, (N.B.-S.);, globosp@utalca.cl, (G.A.L.)); Brunel-Saldias, Nidia (Plant Breeding and Phenomic Center, Faculty of Agricultural Sciences, University of Talca, Talca 3460000, Chile;, nidiabrunel@gmail.com, (N.B.-S.);, globosp@utalca.cl, (G.A.L.)); Engler, Alejandra (Department of Agricultural Economics, Faculty of Agricultural Sciences, University of Talca, Talca 3460000, Chile;, mengler@utalca.cl, (A.E.);, rjara@utalca.cl, (R.J.-R.); Millennium Nucleus CSIEP, University of Talca, Talca 3460000, Chile); Ortega-Farias, Samuel (Research and Extension Center for Irrigation and Agroclimatology (CITRA), University of Talca, Talca 3460000, Chile;, sortega@utalca.cl, (S.O.-F.);, cacevedo@utalca.cl, (C.A.-O.)); Acevedo-Opazo, Cesar (Research and Extension Center for Irrigation and Agroclimatology (CITRA), University of Talca, Talca 3460000, Chile;, sortega@utalca.cl, (S.O.-F.);, cacevedo@utalca.cl, (C.A.-O.)); Lobos, Gustavo A.

The future is shaped by probable future scenarios, for which dealing practically has many complications. This study is focused on the future scenarios for a comprehensive sustainable health financing model to support a superior structure for a decision and policy-making pilot for the society. This aim is followed based on multiple attribute decision making (MADM)-based scenarios using two MADM methods, step-wise weight assessment ratio analysis (SWARA) and weighted aggregated sum product assessment (WASPAS), as a hybrid model which is the first real case study of the approach. Four main probable future scenarios are identified and selected based on experts’ viewpoints about sustainable health financing models. These scenarios include membership in the World Trade Organization (WTO), dynamic basic insurance, international cooperation, and effective resources management. The process of evaluating based on the approach works as a wider picture, including all criteria and alternatives together. Sustainable medical services, empowering the private sector in both production and technology, and employing international managers took place as the top priority for considering the most applicable alternatives in the future.

In this research, the electrochemical behaviour of chalcopyrite has been analysed under different conditions in order to identify the parameters necessary to increase the leaching rates. This was carried out through cyclic voltammetry tests at 1 mV/s using a pure chalcopyrite macro-electrode to evaluate the effect of scan rate, temperature, and the addition of chloride, cupric, and ferrous ions. Lastly, the feasibility of using seawater for chalcopyrite dissolution was investigated. An increase in the sweep rate and temperature proved to be beneficial in obtaining highest current densities at 10 mV/s and 50 °C. Further, an increase of chloride ions enhanced the current density values. The maximum current density obtained was 0.05 A/m2 at concentrations of 150 g/L of chloride.

The current work develops an analytical model that extends a design of experiments for the leaching of manganese from marine nodules, using sulfuric acid (H2SO4) in the presence of iron-containing tailings, which are both by-products of conventional copper extraction. The experiments are configured to address the effect of time, particle size, acid concentration, Fe2O3/MnO2 ratio, stirring speed and temperature, under typical industrial conditions. The recovery of manganese has been modeled using a first order differential equation that accurately fits experimental results, noting that Fe2O3/MnO2 and temperature are the most critical independent variables, while the particle size is the least influential (under typical conditions). This study obtains representative fitting parameters, that can be used to explore the incorporation of Mn recovery from marine nodules, as part of the extended value chain of copper sulfide processing.",,,Metals,,,,2019-08-17,2019,2019-08-17,,9,8,903,All OA; Gold,Article,"Saldaña, Manuel; Toro, Norman; Castillo, Jonathan; Hernández, Pía; Trigueros, Emilio; Navarra, Alessandro","Saldaña, Manuel (Departamento de Ingeniería Industrial, Universidad Católica del Norte, Av.

The production of juveniles depends on a successful larval rearing, consequently the importance to investigate all aspects related to this culture stage, such as the stocking-density which is the extreme importance to improve culture conditions and reduce stress and mortality. Therefore, the objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of three stocking densities (10, 20 and 30 larvae L -1 ) on growth and survival of the fine flounder larvae, an important commercial species, under laboratory conditions. The number of larvae for each treatment was distributed randomly in 12-141 L fiberglass-tanks in a static-batch system. We used one day post-hatching larvae (DPH) and first feeding began two DPH with enriched rotifers (0.5 to 4 rotifers mL -1 ). The standard length (mm) was determined at 1, 5, 10 and 20 DPH, and the dry weight (mg) at the beginning and end of the experimental trial. Besides, the specific growth rate (SGR) and the coefficient of variation (CV) were calculated. Our results exposed that the stocking density of 10 larvae L -1 had significantly higher growth (8.14 mm and 0.90 mg), SGR (20.71 ± 1.48% d -1 ) and survival (42.38%) compared to the 20 and 30 larvae L -1 stocking densities. Additionally, treatment stocked with 10 larvae L -1 resulted in the highest final weight (0.90 ± 0.25 mg) and the lowest variation in sizes (CV = 5.86 ± 1.56). In conclusion, there is a significant effect of the stocking density on the growth and survival during the larval rearing of P. adspersus , and according to the results obtained in this study, the best stocking density for this species was that of 10 larvae L -1 . More research is necessary to evaluate other parameters to improve growth and survival during the larval rearing of this species.",,,Latin American Journal of Aquatic Research,,,,2019-03-10,2019,2019-03-10,,47,1,1-8,All OA; Gold,Article,"Castro, Angélica; Montes, Melissa; Orihuela, Lucas; Linares, Joel; Cota, Noemi; Carrera, Lili; Toledo, Pedro; Lazo, Juan Pablo","Castro, Angélica (IMARPE); Montes, Melissa (IMARPE); Orihuela, Lucas (); Linares, Joel (IMARPE); Cota, Noemi (IMARPE); Carrera, Lili (IMARPE); Toledo, Pedro (Universidad Catolica del Norte); Lazo, Juan Pablo (CICESE)",,"Castro, Angélica (IMARPE); Montes, Melissa (IMARPE); Orihuela, Lucas (); Linares, Joel (IMARPE); Cota, Noemi (IMARPE); Carrera, Lili (IMARPE); Toledo, Pedro (Catholic University of the North); Lazo, Juan Pablo (CICESE)",2,1,,0.28,https://doi.org/10.3856/vol47-issue1-fulltext-1,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1112795622,37 Earth Sciences; 3708 Oceanography,3 Good Health and Well Being
281,pub.1111321017,10.3390/sym11010074,,,Comparative Evaluation of Sustainable Design Based on Step-Wise Weight Assessment Ratio Analysis (SWARA) and Best Worst Method (BWM) Methods: A Perspective on Household Furnishing Materials,"For a few years, there has been an increasing consciousness to design structures that are concurrently economic and environmentally responsive. Eco-friendly inferences of building designs include lower energy consumption, reduction in CO2 emissions, assimilated energy in buildings and enhancement of indoor air quality. With the aim of fulfilling design objectives, designers normally encounter a situation in which the selection of the most appropriate material from a set of various material alternatives is essential. Sustainability has been developing as a new concept in all human activities to create a better balance between social, environmental and economic issues. Designing materials based on the sustainability concept is a key step to enable a better balance because there is no need to re-structure phases and procedures to make the system more efficient in comparison to previous models. Some of the most commonly used materials are household furnishing materials, which can be electrical devices, kitchen gears or general furnishing materials. The volume of production and consumption of these materials is considerable, therefore a newer sustainable plan for a better designed system is justifiable. In the literature, the application of multi-attribute decision-making (MADM) methods has been found to be very suitable for evaluating materials and developing general plans for them. This study contributes by applying two approaches based on MADM methods for weighting the criteria related to the sustainable design of household furnishing materials. Step-Wise Weight Assessment Ratio Analysis (SWARA) and Best Worst Method (BWM) are two specialized and new methods for weighting criteria with different approaches. This paper has not only investigated the weighting of important and related criteria for sustainable design but has also evaluated the similarities and differences between the considered weighting methods. A comparative study of SWARA and BWM methods has never been conducted to date. The results show that, except pairwise comparisons, SWARA and BWM are certainly similar and in some cases SWARA can be more accurate and effective.",,,Symmetry,,,,2019-01-10,2019,2019-01-10,,11,1,74,All OA; Gold,Article,"Zolfani, Sarfaraz Hashemkhani; Chatterjee, Prasenjit","Zolfani, Sarfaraz Hashemkhani (School of Engineering, Catholic University of the North, Larrondo 1281, Coquimbo, Chile); Chatterjee, Prasenjit (Department of Mechanical Engineering, MCKV Institute of Engineering, Howrah 711204, West Bengal, India)",,"Zolfani, Sarfaraz Hashemkhani (Catholic University of the North); Chatterjee, Prasenjit (Maulana Abul Kalam Azad University of Technology, West Bengal)",88,25,,23.29,https://www.mdpi.com/2073-8994/11/1/74/pdf?version=1547539335,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1111321017,33 Built Environment and Design; 3301 Architecture; 41 Environmental Sciences; 4104 Environmental Management,11 Sustainable Cities and Communities; 12 Responsible Consumption and Production
280,pub.1112323541,10.4102/sajip.v45i0.1493,,,Predictive performance models in the South African Business Process Services industry,"Orientation:  An earlier systematic literature review study (Jacobs & Roodt, 2011) conducted on research in Business Process Services (BPS) industry sector companies identified a number of variables that could be empirically linked to turnover intention and individual performance. The literature pointed to a potential health promotion process, as well as an individual performance process in the BPS environment. Research purpose:  The purpose of this study is to test two different predictive models that may explain two distal outcomes, namely turnover intention and individual employee performance, in the South African (SA) BPS industry. Motivation for the study:  There is little, if any, peer-reviewed, empirical research available on the BPS industry that links variables to either proximate or distal outcome variables, such as turnover intention and individual employee performance. Research approach/design and method:  A two-stage, census-based sampling approach was followed that initially targeted 40 organisations within the industry that employ about 13000 employees. Sixteen of these organisations (employing about 6800 individuals) indicated that they wish to voluntarily participate in the study; 821 individuals were targeted to participate in the cross-sectional survey and 487 usable responses were obtained (a 59% response rate). Multivariate data analyses were conducted from an exploratory perspective to retrospectively explain relationships in the structural models. Main findings:  An overall health promotion process model that predicted the distal outcome, turnover intention, was confirmed within the context of this exploratory study, where human resource management (HRM) practices, job demands (JDs) and job resources (JRs) were related to burnout as the only proximate outcome. On the other hand, an individual performance enhancing process model was also confirmed within the context of this exploratory study by using HRM practices, JRs and JDs, together with proximate variables, such as employee competence and engagement, to explain the distal outcome, individual performance. Practical/managerial implications:  The study has implications for executive (strategic) management, human resource (HR) professionals and work unit team leaders in the BPS industry. This study shows which JRs contribute towards the reduction of burnout and turnover intention in the BPS context. On the other hand, it explains how HRM practices, as well as JRs and JDs, in combination with employee competence and engagement, can be used to promote individual performance. Contribution/value-add:  This is the first SA study that uses a range of variables in a multivariate analysis to predict turnover intention and individual performance in the SA BPS industry.",,,SA Journal of Industrial Psychology,,,,2019-02-20,2019,2019-02-20,,45,0,16,All OA; Gold,Article,"Jacobs, Chris T.G.; Roodt, Gerhard","Jacobs, Chris T.G.

Aim:  To determine the ocular findings and vision status of learners with oculocutaneous albinism (OCA) as well as to establish the level of visual acuity, contrast sensitivity and reading rate improvements following optical correction. Setting:  Three special education schools in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. Methods:  A total of 81 learners with OCA participated in this study. Testing procedures included logMAR distance and near visual acuity (VA) measurements, cover tests, retinoscopy (dry), subjective refraction, tangent screen, ophthalmoscopy, contrast sensitivity and reading rate determination. Results:  The majority of participants (96.3%) had wheat straw coloured hair and 95.1% had grey irides. All the learners presented with iris-transillumination and an absent foveal reflex and all but one exhibited nystagmus. Esophoria and esotropia represented 72.8% of binocular vision anomalies. Myopic astigmatism was noted in 41.4% of the learners while with the rule astigmatism was predominant (64%). Following optical correction, VA significantly improved from a range of 0.50 to 1.40 logMAR to a range of 0.5 to 1.06 logMAR for distance ( p  < 0.05) and from a range of 0.40 to 1.30 logMAR to a range of 0.30 to 1.08 logMAR) for near ( p  < 0.05). In addition, contrast sensitivity improved from a range of 0.48 to 1.92 logCS to a range of 0.88 to 1.92 logCS ( p  < 0.05). However, the reading rate did not show any significant improvement following optical correction ( p > 0.05). Conclusion:  Learners with OCA exhibited various ocular and vision defects which impair visual functions.

For such a purpose, it is not uncommon to perform ultrasonic pulse laboratory tests. Many researchers have found experimental relationships between strength and P-wave velocity, but these relationships are based mainly on dry conditions and without considering any other physical or chemical characteristics of the studied rock. Specifically, for limestone, there are 11 correlations reported in the literature, eight of which are simple and the remaining three are multiple, and, among the latter, only two of them consider the saturation. In order to evaluate the combined effect of P-wave velocity, density, and porosity on the UCS of saturated limestone, simple and multiple regression analyses were carried out on the test results of 13 saturated limestone specimens to determine the parameters of both previously mentioned predictive models.

259,pub.1121941212,10.3390/met9101112,,,Extraction of Mn from Black Copper Using Iron Oxides from Tailings and Fe2+ as Reducing Agents in Acid Medium,"Exotic type deposits include several species of minerals, such as atacamite, chrysocolla, copper pitch, and copper wad. Among these, copper pitch and copper wad have considerable concentrations of manganese. However, their non-crystalline and amorphous structure makes it challenging to recover the elements of interest (like Cu or Mn) by conventional hydrometallurgical methods. For this reason, black copper ores are generally not incorporated into the extraction circuits or left unprocessed, whether in stock, leach pads, or waste. Therefore, to dilute MnO2, the use of reducing agents is essential. In the present research, agitated leaching was performed to dissolve Mn of black copper in an acidic medium, comparing the use of ferrous ions and tailings as reducing agents. Two samples of black copper were studied, of high and low grade of Mn, respectively, the latter with a high content of clays. The effect on the reducing agent/black copper ratio and the concentration of sulfuric acid in the system were evaluated. Better results in removing Mn were achieved using the highest-grade black copper sample when working with ferrous ions at a ratio of Fe2+/black copper of 2/1 and 1 mol/L of sulfuric acid. Besides, the low-grade sample induced a significant consumption of H2SO4 due to the high presence of gangue and clays.","The authors are grateful for the contribution of the Scientific Equipment Unit- MAINI of the Universidad Católica del Norte for aiding in generating data by automated electronic microscopy QEMSCAN® and for facilitating the chemical analysis of the solutions.

Due to its significance, the research journal TRANSPORT was established with the aim of developing and reinforcing the performance of national transport system based on theoretical and empirical investigations. The analyses such as transport policy, transport system fundamentals, multiple transport methods and traffic safety are all within the research scope of TRANSPORT. Therefore, this paper focuses on learning the development of this multidisciplinary journal by using the bibliometric tools. After analysing 704 papers published from January 2007 to June 2019 on TRANSPORT, the development of this journal is comprehensively analysed from the perspectives of its status quo and emerging trends. Specifically, the current status is introduced based on the general journal information, the publication and citation number, the citation structure and the significant contributors in terms of author, journal, institution and country.

If the problem has a solution, we say that Λ is realizable and that A is a realizing matrix. In this paper we consider the NIEP for a Toeplitz realizing matrix A , and as far as we know, this is the first work which addresses the Toeplitz nonnegative realization of spectra. We show that nonnegative companion matrices are similar to nonnegative Toeplitz ones. We note that, as a consequence, a realizable list Λ = {λ 1 , . . ., λn} of complex numbers in the left-half plane, that is, with Re  λ i  ≤ 0, i = 2, . . ., n , is in particular realizable by a Toeplitz matrix. Moreover, we show how to construct symmetric nonnegative block Toeplitz matrices with prescribed spectrum and we explore the universal realizability of lists, which are realizable by this kind of matrices. We also propose a Matlab Toeplitz routine to compute a Toeplitz solution matrix.",,,Special Matrices,,,,2019-01-01,2019,2019-12-13,2019-01-01,7,1,230-245,All OA; Gold,Article,"Collao, Macarena; Salas, Mario; Soto, Ricardo L.","Collao, Macarena (Departamento de Matemáticas, Universidad Católica del Norte, Casilla, 1280, Antofagasta, Chile); Salas, Mario (Departamento de Matemáticas, Universidad Católica del Norte, Casilla, 1280, Antofagasta, Chile); Soto, Ricardo L.

                    Chenopodium quinoa
                    (RQ and WQ, respectively). Four-day sprouts and leaves dried at 30, 45, and 60°C were tested. All sprouts contained significant amounts of phenolic compounds; however, higher content was determined in the RQ sprouts. Phenolic compounds from WQ sprouts seem to be thermostable in the studied temperature range, whereas total phenolics content in RQ sprouts decreased significantly after drying in the 60°C. Content of vanillic and
                    p
                    -coumaric acids did not differ significantly between sprouts dried at the same conditions; however, their level decreased in the high temperature. Irrespective of the drying temperature, higher activity against ABTS free radicals and reducing power was observed in the case of RQ sprouts extracts. Sprouts dried at 30°C had a higher ability to scavenge hydroxyl radicals. RQ sprouts were characterized by about two times higher antioxidant activity regardless of the method used. No significant differences between total phenolics (TPC) and flavonoids content in RQ and LQ leaves were found. In the both cases, decrease of TPC was observed after drying in the highest temperature. The leaves do not differ too much in terms of the phenolic acids profile, whereas the differentiating factor is thermal processing. Leaves of both quinoa contained thermostable compounds able to scavenge hydroxyl radicals. Reducing power and ability to scavenge OH radicals were correlated with all components of quinoa sprouts which suggest synergism between them and does not indicate the key role of a particular compound in creating antioxidant capacity. Germination and subsequent oven-drying at 30°C of quinoa seeds significantly increased the antioxidant properties compared with raw seeds. Also, in the case of leaves, the best results were obtained after drying at 30°C.","The study was financed by the University of Life Sciences in Lublin, Poland (Project VKB/DS/2 in 2013–2017).",,Journal of Chemistry,,,,2019-02-12,2019,,2019-02-12,2019,,1-8,All OA; Gold,Article,"Złotek, Urszula; Gawlik-Dziki, Urszula; Dziki, Dariusz; Świeca, Michał; Nowak, Renata; Martinez, Enrique","Złotek, Urszula (Department of Biochemistry and Food Chemistry, University of Life Sciences, Skromna Str. 8, 20-704 Lublin, Poland); Gawlik-Dziki, Urszula (Department of Biochemistry and Food Chemistry, University of Life Sciences, Skromna Str. 8, 20-704 Lublin, Poland); Dziki, Dariusz (Department of Thermal Technology and Food Process Engineering, University of Life Sciences, Doświadczalna Str. 44, 20-280 Lublin, Poland); Świeca, Michał (Department of Biochemistry and Food Chemistry, University of Life Sciences, Skromna Str. 8, 20-704 Lublin, Poland); Nowak, Renata (Department of Pharmaceutical Botany, Medical University, 1 Chodzki, 20-093 Lublin, Poland); Martinez, Enrique (Centro de Estudios Avanzados en Zonas Áridas, La Serena y Programa de Doctorado en Biología y Ecología Aplicada, Facultad de Ciencias Del Mar, Universidad Católica Del Norte, Coquimbo, Chile)","Gawlik-Dziki, Urszula (University of Life Sciences in Lublin)","Złotek, Urszula (University of Life Sciences in Lublin); Gawlik-Dziki, Urszula (University of Life Sciences in Lublin); Dziki, Dariusz (University of Life Sciences in Lublin); Świeca, Michał (University of Life Sciences in Lublin); Nowak, Renata (Medical University of Lublin); Martinez, Enrique (Catholic University of the North)",28,10,,,https://doi.org/10.1155/2019/7125169,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1112094329,34 Chemical Sciences,

This is mainly due to the dynamic and sensitive nature of knowledge within the healthcare sector that can assist in caring for the patients and other administrative operations. The absence of knowledge sharing and retention practice in healthcare organisations may result in negative repercussions. Hence, using Actor-Network Theory, the study will investigate and identify the factors influencing the current knowledge sharing taking place within the South African healthcare system. One of the top healthcare organisations was selected for data collection, and a qualitative research method was adopted in this study. The findings revealed the different actors involved in the sharing of knowledge and the networks that enable knowledge sharing and retention.

Different reagents were studied in the activation of carbon: HCl, HCl + H2O2, H3PO4, H3PO4 + H2O2, all with an impregnation rate of 1:1. The activated carbon that showed the best global results was activated with H3PO4, obtaining a 51.0, 32.8, 66.0, 81.0 and 97.1% elimination of chemical oxygen demand, ammonia, total chlorine, bromine and copper, respectively. This activated carbon has a total pore area of 4.85 m2/g and a median pore diameter of 65.32 micrometers. When different loads of this carbon were placed in a stirrer system in contact with landfill leachate, with the aim of evaluating the effect of the adsorption load and contact time, the concentration of ammonia decreased from the beginning of the adsorption process to the end of it, and the removal of ammonia increased with the increase in the adsorbent load. However, the trend of the amount adsorbed per unit mass decreased with increased dosage. The model Freundlich equilibrium isotherm fits experimental data adequately, giving R2 values of 0.95, 1/n of 0.5183, and a K value of 7.08*10-5 L/g, being favourable for adsorption process.
RESUMO Foi realizada uma série de experimentos para estabelecer e avaliar o potencial de carvão ativado produzido de resíduos de café por meio de um processo de adsorção na depuração do lixiviado de aterro sanitário. Foram estudados diferentes reagentes para a ativação do carvão: HCl, HCl + H2O2, H3PO4, H3PO4 + H2O2, todos com taxa de impregnação de 1:1. O carvão que apresentou os melhores resultados foi ativado com H3PO4, obtendo uma eliminação de 51,0; 32,8; 66,0; 81,0; e 97,1% de demanda química de oxigênio e concentração de amônia, cloro total, bromo e cobre, respetivamente. O referido carvão ativado tem uma área total de poro de 4,85 m2/g e diâmetro médio de poro de 65,32 micrômetros. Com o objetivo de avaliar o efeito da carga de adsorção e do tempo de contato, foram colocadas diferentes cargas desse carvão em um sistema de agitação em contato com o lixiviado de aterro sanitário. Observou-se que a concentração de amônia diminuiu e que sua remoção foi maior à medida que a carga adsorvente aumentava. No entanto, a quantidade adsorvida por unidade de massa diminuiu com o aumento da dosagem. Os dados experimentais adequaram-se corretamente ao modelo de isoterma de Freundlich, obtendo-se valores de R2 de 0,95, 1/n de 0,5183, e um valor de K de 7,08*10-5 L/g, considerados favoráveis para o processo de adsorção.",FONDECYT proyecto Nº 11140219.,,Engenharia Sanitaria e Ambiental,,,,2019-08,2019,2019-08,,24,04,833-842,All OA; Gold,Article,"Chávez, Rodrigo Poblete; Pizarro, Ernesto Cortes Cortés; Galiano, Yolanda Luna","Chávez, Rodrigo Poblete (Universidad Católica del Norte, Chile); Pizarro, Ernesto Cortes Cortés (Universidad Católica del Norte, Chile); Galiano, Yolanda Luna (Universidad de Sevilla, Spain)",,"Chávez, Rodrigo Poblete (Catholic University of the North); Pizarro, Ernesto Cortes Cortés (Catholic University of the North); Galiano, Yolanda Luna (University of Seville)",28,16,,,http://www.scielo.br/pdf/esa/v24n4/1809-4457-esa-s1413-41522019178655.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1119936742,,

A few studies prove that these communities are aware of change in climatic conditions and their impacts on people’s livelihoods. Climate change is usually perceived as increasing warming days, erratic rainfall patterns, ecological variability, biological change and their adverse effects on human beings. This study aims to assess Ga-Dikgale community’s perceptions on climate change and variability.   Design/methodology/approach A qualitative research method was adopted and community members of age 60 and above in GaDikgale community were purposively selected as participants in the study. Data were collected through in-depth interviews, and thematic content analysis was used to analyse data.   Findings The study found that the community perceives climate change and climate variability based on changes in temperature patterns, erratic rainfall patterns, seasonal change, depletion of biodiversity, decline in subsistence crop production, change in water quality and cessation of cultural activities.   Originality/value The study concludes that community’s perceptions of climate change are largely centred on variations in temperature and rainfall patterns. It has been established that knowledge of climate change in rural communities is of paramount importance in as far as adaptation to climate hazards is concerned.",,,International Journal of Climate Change Strategies and Management,,,,2019-05-20,2019,,2019-05-20,11,3,392-405,All OA; Gold,Article,"Chikosi, Enerst Shingai; Mugambiwa, Shingirai Stanley; Tirivangasi, Happy Mathew; Rankoana, Sejabaledi Agnes","Chikosi, Enerst Shingai (Department of Sociology and Anthropology, University of Limpopo, Sovenga, South Africa); Mugambiwa, Shingirai Stanley (Department of Sociology and Anthropology, University of Limpopo, Sovenga, South Africa); Tirivangasi, Happy Mathew (Department of Sociology and Anthropology, University of Limpopo, Sovenga, South Africa); Rankoana, Sejabaledi Agnes (Department of Sociology and Anthropology, University of Limpopo, Sovenga, South Africa)","Mugambiwa, Shingirai Stanley (University of Limpopo)","Chikosi, Enerst Shingai (University of Limpopo); Mugambiwa, Shingirai Stanley (University of Limpopo); Tirivangasi, Happy Mathew (University of Limpopo); Rankoana, Sejabaledi Agnes (University of Limpopo)",17,7,,1.55,https://doi.org/10.1108/ijccsm-01-2018-0004,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1107908500,41 Environmental Sciences; 4101 Climate Change Impacts and Adaptation,13 Climate Action
252,pub.1113257797,10.3390/min9040216,,,Analysis of Silica Pulp Viscoelasticity in Saline Media: The Effect of Cation Size,"The effect of alkali metal chlorides on the viscoelastic behavior and yielding properties of silica suspensions was studied through creep-recovery and dynamic oscillatory tests with stress control. Then, the viscoelasticity of the pulps was correlated with the silica zeta potential, aggregate size, and the percentage of cations adsorbed on the surface of the ore. The results indicate that larger cations are more prone to adhere to the silica surface, which increases the number of ionic bonds that bind the particles. This generates stronger particle networks and a greater agglomeration of particles, especially those smaller than 10 µm. As the size of the bare cations increases, the rheological response provides higher values of yield stress, complex viscosity, and viscoelastic moduli, but in turn, pulps undergo minor deformations under the application of stress. Dynamic oscillatory tests suggest structural changes, with the phase angle following the inverse relationship with the bare cation size, indicating that the liquid-like character of the pulps increases as the size of the cations increases.",,,Minerals,,,,2019-04-04,2019,2019-04-04,,9,4,216,All OA; Gold,Article,"Jeldres, Ricardo I.; Piceros, Eder C.; Leiva, Williams H.; Toledo, Pedro G.; Quezada, Gonzalo R.; Robles, Pedro A.; Valenzuela, Julio","Jeldres, Ricardo I.

These techniques are applied to the concatenated channels corresponding to red, green, and blue (RGB), hue, saturation, value (HSV), and lightness, red/green value, and blue/yellow value (L*a*b) color spaces (9 features in total). Machine learning techniques have been reported for sorting the Cape gooseberry fruits’ ripeness. Classifiers such as neural networks, support vector machines, and nearest neighbors discriminate on fruit samples using different color spaces. Despite the color spaces being equivalent up to a transformation, a few classifiers enable better performances due to differences in the pixel distribution of samples. Experimental results show that selection and combination of color channels allow classifiers to reach similar levels of accuracy; however, combination methods still require higher computational complexity.

245,pub.1117973894,10.3390/met9070780,,,Leaching of Pure Chalcocite in a Chloride Media Using Sea Water and Waste Water,"Chalcocite is the most important and abundant secondary copper ore in the world with a rapid dissolution of copper in an acid-chloride environment. In this investigation, the methodology of surface optimization will be applied to evaluate the effect of three independent variables (time, concentration of sulfuric acid and chloride concentration) in the leaching of pure chalcocite to extract the copper with the objective of obtaining a quadratic model that allows us to predict the extraction of copper. The kinetics of copper dissolution in regard to the function of temperature is also analyzed. An ANOVA indicates that the linear variables with the greatest influence are time and the chloride concentration. Also, the concentration of chloride-time exerts a significant synergic effect in the quadratic model. The ANOVA indicates that the quadratic model is representative and the R2 value of 0.92 is valid. The highest copper extraction (67.75%) was obtained at 48 h leaching under conditions of 2 mol/L H2SO4 and 100 g/L chloride. The XRD analysis shows the formation of a stable and non-polluting residue; such as elemental sulfur (S0). This residue was obtained in a leaching time of 4 h at room temperature under conditions of 0.5 mol/L H2SO4 and 50 g/L Cl−.","The authors are grateful for the contribution of the Scientific Equipment Unit- MAINI of the Universidad Católica del Norte for aiding in generating data by automated electronic microscopy QEMSCAN® and for facilitating the chemical analysis of the solutions.

243,pub.1118132875,10.3390/met9070799,,,Copper Dissolution from Black Copper Ore under Oxidizing and Reducing Conditions,"Black copper oxides are amorphous materials of copper-bearing phases of manganese. They are complex mineral compounds with difficult to recognize mineralogy and have slow dissolution kinetics in conventional hydrometallurgical processes. This study evaluates the effects of various leaching media on copper dissolution from black copper minerals. Leach of a pure black copper sample from Lomas Bayas Mine and another from a regional mine were characterized by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES), X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Qemscan and mechanically prepared for acid leaching under standard, oxidizing and reducing conditions through the addition of oxygen, iron sulfate or sulfur dioxide, respectively. Standard and high potential leaching (770 mV (SHE)) results in a copper dissolution rate of 70% and manganese dissolution rate of 2%. The addition of potential reducing agents (FeSO4 or SO2) decreases the redox potential to 696 and 431 mV, respectively, and favors the dissolution of manganese, thus increasing the overall copper extraction rate. The addition of SO2 results in the lowest redox potential and the highest copper extraction rates of 86.2% and 75.5% for the Lomas Bayas and regional samples, respectively, which represent an increase of 15% over the copper extract rates under standard and oxidizing conditions.",The authors are grateful for the financial support provided by the CORFO INNOVA Program and Glencore Lomas Bayas to the project “Geometallurgical Modelling and Design of a Specific Process for the Recovery of Ores with Black Copper Content”.,This research was funded by CORFO INNOVA (No. 08CM01-09).,Metals,,,,2019-07-19,2019,2019-07-19,,9,7,799,All OA; Gold,Article,"Benavente, Oscar; Hernández, María Cecilia; Melo, Evelyn; Núñez, Damián; Quezada, Víctor; Zepeda, Yuri","Benavente, Oscar (Laboratorio de Procesos Hidrometalúrgicos, Departamento de Ingeniería Metalúrgica y Minas, Universidad Católica del Norte, Avenida Angamos 0610, 1270709 Antofagasta, Chile); Hernández, María Cecilia (Laboratorio de Procesos Hidrometalúrgicos, Departamento de Ingeniería Metalúrgica y Minas, Universidad Católica del Norte, Avenida Angamos 0610, 1270709 Antofagasta, Chile); Melo, Evelyn (Laboratorio de Procesos Hidrometalúrgicos, Departamento de Ingeniería Metalúrgica y Minas, Universidad Católica del Norte, Avenida Angamos 0610, 1270709 Antofagasta, Chile); Núñez, Damián (Laboratorio de Procesos Hidrometalúrgicos, Departamento de Ingeniería Metalúrgica y Minas, Universidad Católica del Norte, Avenida Angamos 0610, 1270709 Antofagasta, Chile); Quezada, Víctor (Laboratorio de Procesos Hidrometalúrgicos, Departamento de Ingeniería Metalúrgica y Minas, Universidad Católica del Norte, Avenida Angamos 0610, 1270709 Antofagasta, Chile); Zepeda, Yuri (Compañía Minera Lomas Bayas, General Borgoño 934, 1270242 Antofagasta, Chile)","Melo, Evelyn (Catholic University of the North)","Benavente, Oscar (Catholic University of the North); Hernández, María Cecilia (Catholic University of the North); Melo, Evelyn (Catholic University of the North); Núñez, Damián (Catholic University of the North); Quezada, Víctor (Catholic University of the North); Zepeda, Yuri (Compañía Minera Lomas Bayas, General Borgoño 934, 1270242 Antofagasta, Chile)",13,2,,2.16,https://www.mdpi.com/2075-4701/9/7/799/pdf?version=1563510468,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1118132875,40 Engineering; 4019 Resources Engineering and Extractive Metallurgy,
239,pub.1114216989,10.3390/min9050289,,,Leaching of Manganese from Marine Nodules at Room Temperature with the Use of Sulfuric Acid and the Addition of Tailings,"Based on the results obtained from a previous study investigating the dissolution of Mn from marine nodules with the use of sulfuric acid and foundry slag, a second series of experiments was carried out using tailings produced from slag flotation. The proposed approach takes advantage of the Fe present in magnetite contained in these tailings and is believed to be cost-efficient. The surface optimization methodology was used to evaluate the independent variables of time, particle size, and sulfuric acid concentration in the Mn solution. Other tests evaluated the effect of agitation speed and the MnO2/Fe2O3 ratio in an acid medium. The highest Mn extraction rate of 77% was obtained with an MnO2/Fe2O3 ratio of 1/2 concentration of 1 mol/L of H2SO4, particle size of −47 + 38 μm, and 40 min of leaching. It is concluded that higher rates of Mn extraction were obtained when tailings instead of slag were used, while future research needs to focus on determination of the optimum Fe2O3/MnO2 ratio to improve dissolution of Mn from marine nodules.","The authors are grateful for the contribution of the Scientific Equipment Unit MAINI of the Universidad Católica del Norte for aiding in generating data by automated electronic microscopy QEMSCAN® and for facilitating the chemical analysis of the solutions.

238,pub.1121941222,10.3390/min9100639,,,Cupric and Chloride Ions: Leaching of Chalcopyrite Concentrate with Low Chloride Concentration Media,"In this paper, the effect of the cupric and chloride ions concentrations on copper dissolution from chalcopyrite concentrate was studied in acidified media. Variables included three different concentrations of Cu2+ (0.5, 1.5, and 2.5 g L−1), four different concentrations of Cl− (0, 5, 7, and 10 g L−1), two different pH values of 1 and 2, and a constant temperature of 60 °C. Results indicated that addition of Cl− to the system improves copper extractions, especially at higher concentrations of Cu2+. Initial copper concentrations in the leaching solution did not significantly affect the copper extraction when Cl− was not present. Better copper extractions were obtained at pH 1 as compared with pH 2. As the Cu2+ and Cl− concentrations were increased, higher values of redox potential were obtained. According to the formation constants of the chloro-complexes, the predominant species in the Cu2+/Cl− system in the studied interval were CuCl+ and Cu2+. Using a model of copper speciation in the experimental range predicted for a single copper concentration with increasing Cl− concentration, the Cu2+ concentration decreased significantly while the concentration of the chloro-complex species CuCl+ increased. In the leached residue, evidence of sulfur formation was found using SEM and corroborated by XRD analysis. When chloride is present in the medium, the amounts of copper and iron in the residue decrease, confirming a positive effect of chloride on the extraction of copper from concentrate for the studied conditions.",Assistance in ore preparation by the Mining Engineering and Chemical Engineering Departments of UA is acknowledged with thanks.

238,pub.1117920318,10.3390/min9070421,,,Optimization of the Heap Leaching Process through Changes in Modes of Operation and Discrete Event Simulation,"The importance of mine planning is often underestimated. Nonetheless, it is essential in achieving high performance by identifying the potential value of mineral resources and providing an optimal, practical, and realistic strategy for extraction, which considers the greatest quantity of options, materials, and scenarios. Conventional mine planning is based on a mostly deterministic approach, ignoring part of the uncertainty presented in the input data, such as the mineralogical composition of the feed. This work develops a methodology to optimize the mineral recovery of the heap leaching phase by addressing the mineralogical variation of the feed, by alternating the mode of operation depending on the type of ore in the feed. The operational changes considered in the analysis include the leaching of oxide ores by adding only sulfuric acid (H2SO4) as reagent and adding chloride in the case of sulfide ores (secondary sulfides). The incorporation of uncertainty allows the creation of models that maximize the productivity, while confronting the geological uncertainty, as the extraction program progresses. The model seeks to increase the expected recovery from leaching, considering a set of equiprobable geological scenarios. The modeling and simulation of this productive phase is developed through a discrete event simulation (DES) framework. The results of the simulation indicate the potential to address the dynamics of feed variation through the implementation of alternating modes of operation.",,This research received no external funding.,Minerals,,,,2019-07-10,2019,2019-07-10,,9,7,421,All OA; Gold,Article,"Saldaña, Manuel; Toro, Norman; Castillo, Jonathan; Hernández, Pía; Navarra, Alessandro","Saldaña, Manuel (Departamento de Ingeniería Industrial, Universidad Católica del Norte, Av.

Machine learning techniques, such as artificial neural networks, support vector machines (SVMs), decision trees, and K-nearest neighbor algorithms, have been successfully applied for classification problems in the literature, particularly for images of fruit. However, the particularities of each classification problem make it difficult, if not impossible, to select a general technique that is applicable to all types of fruit. In this paper, the combinations of four machine learning techniques and three color spaces (RGB, HSV, and L*a*b*) were evaluated with regard to their ability to classify Cape gooseberry fruits. To this end, 925 Cape gooseberry fruit samples were collected, and each fruit was manually classified into one of seven different classes according to its level of ripeness. The color values of each fruit image in the three color spaces and their corresponding ripening stages were organized for training and validation following a fivefold cross-validation strategy in an iterative process repeated 100 times. According to the results, the classification of Cape gooseberry fruits by their ripeness level was sensitive to both the color space and the classification technique used. The models based on the L*a*b* color space and the SVM classifier showed the highest f-measure regardless of the color space, and the principal component analysis combination of color spaces improved the performance of the models at the expense of increased complexity.",,,IEEE Access,,,,2019-01-01,2019,2019-03-04,2019-01-01,7,,27389-27400,All OA; Gold,Article,"Castro, Wilson; Oblitas, Jimy; De-La-Torre, Miguel; Cotrina, Carlos; Bazán, Karen; Avila-George, Himer","Castro, Wilson (Facultad de Ingeniería, Universidad Privada del Norte, Cajamarca, 06002, Peru); Oblitas, Jimy (Departamento de Tecnología de Alimentos, Universidad de Lleida, 25198, Lleida, Spain); De-La-Torre, Miguel (Centro Universitario de los Valles, Universidad de Guadalajara, Ameca, 46600, Mexico); Cotrina, Carlos (Facultad de Ingeniería, Universidad Privada del Norte, Cajamarca, 06002, Peru); Bazán, Karen (Facultad de Ingeniería, Universidad Privada del Norte, Cajamarca, 06002, Peru); Avila-George, Himer (Centro Universitario de los Valles, Universidad de Guadalajara, Ameca, 46600, Mexico)","Avila-George, Himer (University of Guadalajara)","Castro, Wilson (Private University of the North); Oblitas, Jimy (University of Lleida); De-La-Torre, Miguel (University of Guadalajara); Cotrina, Carlos (Private University of the North); Bazán, Karen (Private University of the North); Avila-George, Himer (University of Guadalajara)",112,45,,30.89,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/ielx7/6287639/8600701/08657936.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1112523235,46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4603 Computer Vision and Multimedia Computation; 4611 Machine Learning,

Based on the model of the five dominant personality traits and the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology, 155 users of Enterprise Resource Planning systems were examined in two Chilean organizations. A cluster analysis applied to personality traits identified three different types of personalities. Subsequently, a multi-group analysis in Partial Least Squares of the technology acceptance model detected statistically significant differences among these types of personalities. Specifically, although for all personality types, the intention to use technology is explained in more than 60 percent, the strength of the antecedent variables changes radically depending on the type of personality. These findings indicate that personality type plays an essential role as a moderator of technology acceptance at work. This study is one of the first attempts where personality types, instead of specific personality traits, have been associated with technology acceptance models. In it, we performed an analysis of statistically significant differences among the types. Its practical implications are to identify the personality type of employees and adapt the implementation of innovations accordingly.

To help a practicing engineer or scientist to choose a MATLAB DFO most suitable for their application at hand, this paper presents a set of five benchmarking criteria for optimization algorithms and then uses four widely adopted benchmark problems to evaluate the DFOs systematically. Comprehensive tests recommend that the PC be most suitable for a unimodal or relatively simple problem, whilst the genetic algorithm (with elitism in MATLAB, GAe) for a relatively complex, multimodal or unknown problem. This paper also provides an amalgamated scoring system and a decision tree for specific objectives, in addition to recommending the GAe for optimizing structures and categories as well as for offline global search together with PC for local parameter tuning or online adaptation. To verify these recommendations, all the six DFOs are further tested in a case study optimizing a popular nonlinear filter. The results corroborate the benchmarking results. It is expected that the benchmarking system would help select optimizers for practical applications.","This work was supported in part by the Guangdong Higher Education Research Program under Grant 2017KQNCX193, the Dongguan University of Technology under Research Grant ‘Industry 4.0 Smart Design and Innovation Platform’ KCYKYQD2017014 and under Postdoctoral Research Start-Up Grant GC300501-18, and the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant 71801044 and Grant 61773119.",,IEEE Access,,,,2019-01-01,2019,2019-06-14,2019-01-01,7,,79657-79670,All OA; Gold,Article,"Li, Lin; Saldivar, Alfredo Alan Flores; Bai, Yun; Chen, Yi; Liu, Qunfeng; Li, Yun","Li, Lin (Industry 4.0 Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, Dongguan University of Technology, Dongguan, 523808, China); Saldivar, Alfredo Alan Flores (Industry 4.0 Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, Dongguan University of Technology, Dongguan, 523808, China); Bai, Yun (Industry 4.0 Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, Dongguan University of Technology, Dongguan, 523808, China); Chen, Yi (Industry 4.0 Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, Dongguan University of Technology, Dongguan, 523808, China); Liu, Qunfeng (Industry 4.0 Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, Dongguan University of Technology, Dongguan, 523808, China); Li, Yun (Industry 4.0 Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, Dongguan University of Technology, Dongguan, 523808, China; Department of Design, Manufacturing and Engineering Management, Faculty of Engineering, University of Strathclyde, Glasgow, G1 1XJ, U.K.)","Li, Lin (Dongguan University of Technology)","Li, Lin (Dongguan University of Technology); Saldivar, Alfredo Alan Flores (Dongguan University of Technology); Bai, Yun (Dongguan University of Technology); Chen, Yi (Dongguan University of Technology); Liu, Qunfeng (Dongguan University of Technology); Li, Yun (Dongguan University of Technology; University of Strathclyde)",13,6,,3.76,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/ielx7/6287639/8600701/08736798.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1117164802,46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4602 Artificial Intelligence,
237,pub.1123334261,10.3390/met9121339,,,Copper Extraction from Black Copper Ores through Modification of the Solution Potential in the Irrigation Solution,"This article presented the behavior of ores containing black copper under acid leaching. The solution potential was modified by adding agents, and five leaching conditions were evaluated, one as a control based on sulfuric acid leaching (conventional), and the others by changing the solution potential with: ferrous sulfate (FeSO4), white metal (Cu2S), sulfur dioxide (SO2), and ozone (O3). Leaching behavior was evaluated with laboratory bottle (ISO-pH) and column leaching tests. Two ores samples from the Lomas Bayas mine were used. The samples, identified as low (LG) and high grade (HG), were characterized as 0.13–0.25% Cu and 0.15–0.38% Mn, respectively. The mineralogical analysis indicated that black copper represented around 20% of total Cu (0.05% Cu). The results of the bottle tests indicated that the solution potential decreased with the addition of reducing agents, while the copper extraction rate with the HG sample increased to 83.7%, which exceeded the extraction rate obtained by conventional acid leaching by 25%. Ozone did not favor the extraction of Mn and Cu extraction when the solution potential increased. Cu and Mn extraction were directly related. The results of the column leaching tests showed that it was possible to maintain the solution potential at values below 600 mV (SHE) with the addition of white metal and sulfur dioxide while obtaining the highest copper extraction rate of approximately 60%, which was 18% higher than the rate obtained with conventional leaching. Sulfuric acid consumption was 11 kg/t over 45 days of leaching.",The authors are grateful for funding provided by the CORFO INNOVA Program and Glencore Lomas Bayas to the project “Geometallurgical Modeling and Design of a Specific Process for the Recovery of Ores with Black Copper Content”.,This research was funded by CORFO INNOVA (No. 08CM01-09).,Metals,,,,2019-12-11,2019,2019-12-11,,9,12,1339,All OA; Gold,Article,"Benavente, Oscar; Hernández, Ma.Cecilia; Melo, Evelyn; Ardiles, Luis; Quezada, Víctor; Zepeda, Yuri","Benavente, Oscar (Laboratorio de Procesos Hidrometalúrgicos, Departamento de Ingeniería Metalúrgica y Minas, Universidad Católica del Norte, Avenida Angamos 0610, Antofagasta 1270709, Chile); Hernández, Ma.Cecilia (Laboratorio de Procesos Hidrometalúrgicos, Departamento de Ingeniería Metalúrgica y Minas, Universidad Católica del Norte, Avenida Angamos 0610, Antofagasta 1270709, Chile); Melo, Evelyn (Laboratorio de Procesos Hidrometalúrgicos, Departamento de Ingeniería Metalúrgica y Minas, Universidad Católica del Norte, Avenida Angamos 0610, Antofagasta 1270709, Chile); Ardiles, Luis (Laboratorio de Procesos Hidrometalúrgicos, Departamento de Ingeniería Metalúrgica y Minas, Universidad Católica del Norte, Avenida Angamos 0610, Antofagasta 1270709, Chile); Quezada, Víctor (Laboratorio de Procesos Hidrometalúrgicos, Departamento de Ingeniería Metalúrgica y Minas, Universidad Católica del Norte, Avenida Angamos 0610, Antofagasta 1270709, Chile); Zepeda, Yuri (Compañía Minera Lomas Bayas, General Borgoño 934, Antofagasta 1270242, Chile)","Melo, Evelyn (Catholic University of the North)","Benavente, Oscar (Catholic University of the North); Hernández, Ma.Cecilia (Catholic University of the North); Melo, Evelyn (Catholic University of the North); Ardiles, Luis (Catholic University of the North); Quezada, Víctor (Catholic University of the North); Zepeda, Yuri (Compañía Minera Lomas Bayas, General Borgoño 934, Antofagasta 1270242, Chile)",3,1,,0.5,https://www.mdpi.com/2075-4701/9/12/1339/pdf?version=1576743514,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1123334261,40 Engineering; 4019 Resources Engineering and Extractive Metallurgy,
237,pub.1122404429,10.3390/met9111198,,,A Stochastic Model Approach for Copper Heap Leaching through Bayesian Networks,"Multivariate analytical models are quite successful in explaining one or more response variables, based on one or more independent variables. However, they do not reflect the connections of conditional dependence between the variables that explain the model. Otherwise, due to their qualitative and quantitative nature, Bayesian networks allow us to easily visualize the probabilistic relationships between variables of interest, as well as make inferences as a prediction of specific evidence (partial or impartial), diagnosis and decision-making. The current work develops stochastic modeling of the leaching phase in piles by generating a Bayesian network that describes the ore recovery with independent variables, after analyzing the uncertainty of the response to the sensitization of the input variables. These models allow us to recognize the relations of dependence and causality between the sampled variables and can estimate the output against the lack of evidence. The network setting shows that the variables that have the most significant impact on recovery are the time, the heap height and the superficial velocity of the leaching flow, while the validation is given by the low measurements of the error statistics and the normality test of residuals. Finally, probabilistic networks are unique tools to determine and internalize the risk or uncertainty present in the input variables, due to their ability to generate estimates of recovery based upon partial knowledge of the operational variables.",Gonzalo Quezada and Ricardo Jeldres thank the Centro CRHIAM Project Conicyt/Fondap/15130015.,This research received no external funding.,Metals,,,,2019-11-07,2019,2019-11-07,,9,11,1198,All OA; Gold,Article,"Saldaña, Manuel; González, Javier; Jeldres, Ricardo I.; Villegas, Ángelo; Castillo, Jonathan; Quezada, Gonzalo; Toro, Norman","Saldaña, Manuel (Departamento de Ingeniería de Sistemas y Computación, Facultad de Ingeniería y Ciencias Geológicas, Universidad Católica del Norte, 1270709 Antofagasta, Chile); González, Javier (Departamento de Ingeniería Metalúrgica y Minas, Facultad de Ingeniería y Ciencias Geológicas, Universidad Católica del Norte, 1270709 Antofagasta, Chile;, javier.gonzalez@ucn.cl, (J.G.);, avf009@alumnos.ucn.cl, (Á.V.)); Jeldres, Ricardo I.

237,pub.1113730706,10.3390/min9040250,,,Accelerating Copper Leaching from Sulfide Ores in Acid-Nitrate-Chloride Media Using Agglomeration and Curing as Pretreatment,"This work investigates the effect of an agglomeration and curing pretreatment on leaching of a copper sulfide ore, mainly chalcopyrite, using mini-columns in acid-nitrate-chloride media. Ten pretreatment tests were conducted to evaluate different variables, namely the addition of nitrate as NaNO3 (11.7 and 23.3 kg/ton), chloride as NaCl (2.1 and 19.8 kg/ton), curing time (20 and 30 days) and repose temperature (25 and 45 °C). The optimum copper extraction of 58.6% was achieved with the addition of 23.3 kg of NaNO3/ton, 19.8 kg of NaCl/ton, and after 30 days of curing at 45 °C. Under these pretreatment conditions, three samples of ore were leached in mini-columns. The studied parameters were temperature (25 and 45 °C) and chloride concentration (20 and 40 g/L). The optimum copper extraction of 63.9% was obtained in the mini-column leaching test at 25 °C, with the use of 20 g/L of chloride. A higher temperature (45 °C) and a higher chloride concentration (40 g/L) negatively affected the extraction. The pretreatment stage had favorable effects, in terms of accelerating copper dissolution and improving leaching of copper sulfide ore in acid-nitrate-chloride media. Waste salts from caliche industry and waste brine from reverse osmosis can be used for providing the nitrate and chloride media.","Special thanks to Departamento de Ingeniería en Minas and Laboratorio de Investigación de procesos of Departamento de Ingeniería Química y Procesos de Minerales, of Universidad de Antofagasta for the assistance in ore preparation and technical support with equipment and materials.","The authors are grateful for the financial support provided by CONICYT through Fondecyt Iniciación Project N° 11170179 and PAI/Concurso Nacional Inserción en la Academia, Convocatoria 2015 folio N° 79150003.",Minerals,,,,2019-04-25,2019,2019-04-25,,9,4,250,All OA; Gold,Article,"Hernández, Pía C.; Dupont, Junior; Herreros, Osvaldo O.; Jimenez, Yecid P.; Torres, Cynthia M.","Hernández, Pía C.

Based on sales data related to local and external markets, it is shown that nowadays farmers from several regions and towns have changed the practice of sowing endogenous fruits for the trading of lands and the sowing of other types of products. This has caused the farmer’s economic and social recoil within the agricultural sector. We restrict our study to the case of lucuma (Pouteria Lucuma), an endogenous fruit possessing excellent nutritional properties and exotic flavor that can be used for the production of a variety of products. These features make it an exportable product with great acceptance in international markets, but mainly in its dehydrated form. Therefore, in order to stimulate farmers’ exporting opportunities, it is necessary to transform their products by employing clean technologies that, at the same time, reduce production costs. In this sense, we propose a set of strategies to revitalize the sowing of lucuma in regions where it used to be cultivated, as well as to promote a sustainable business program based on the use of an innovative proposal for hybrid solar dehydration process (dehydration process that preserves the organoleptic properties, which is different from other processes). This will assist the commercialization of farmers’ products in local and international markets, as well as complying with the quality standards required for agro-export.",The authors thank the National Direction of Research and Development from the Universidad Privada del Norte (DNID)—Perú; for the support and Ing.

In this model we studied the effect of the variation of parameter values (temperature, crevice depth, oxygen and sodium chloride concentration outside the cavity, and pH) on all the concentrations of the species, and on their differences with their concentrations outside the crevice and along the cavity using the network method. Moreover, a sensitivity study of the system parameters has been carried out. No simplifications have been considered, although the model is firmly coupled and susceptible to any variation of the aforementioned parameters. The development of the model is clearly explained. The results are compared with data published in the scientific literature for domains that establish the most complex and complete scenarios to verify the reliability of the model.

This article reports on a study that explored the role of semiotic representations in pre-service teachers’ reasoning about the similarity relationship between triangles. Data were generated from the written responses of 65 pre-service mathematics teachers as well as three semi-structured interviews. Duval’s notions of conversions and treatments were used as a framework to understand the pre-service teachers’ struggles with negotiating movements between the visual and symbolic registers of representation. The findings revealed that many pre-service teachers struggled with identifying the similarity relationship between triangles appearing in various configurations of geometric objects. While some participants were easily able to draw upon the two registers to express the relationships, one student who initially made many errors was only able to discern the necessary relationships with the help of a concrete representation that could be physically manipulated. The study therefore provided an example of how a student’s errors could be used as a learning resource to lead to meaningful learning.",,,Pythagoras,,,,2019-12-13,2019,2019-12-13,,40,1,10,All OA; Gold,Article,"Ubah, Ifunanya; Bansilal, Sarah","Ubah, Ifunanya (Department of Science and Technology Education, University of Johannesburg, Johannesburg); Bansilal, Sarah (Department of Science, Technology and Mathematics Education, University of KwaZulu-Natal, Durban)",,"Ubah, Ifunanya (University of Johannesburg); Bansilal, Sarah (University of KwaZulu-Natal)",12,6,,6.86,https://pythagoras.org.za/index.php/pythagoras/article/download/480/758,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1123363287,39 Education; 3901 Curriculum and Pedagogy; 3903 Education Systems,

This positive association could be specie-specific and can have direct top-down (canopy) or bottom-up (soil) effects as well as indirect effects like higher tolerance against herbivory. The main objective of our study was to determine the positive interaction between the endemic Chilean orchid Bipinnula fimbriata and the nurse shrub Baccharis macraei in the Mediterranean ecosystem of Chile. Methods: To assess the direct and indirect effects of the nurse, we conducted field and greenhouse experiments, respectively. In the field, we performed manipulative experiments assessing the nurse canopy and soil direct effects on the orchid. We measured microclimatic and edaphic variables within and outside nurses, and assessed survival, growth and photochemical efficiency (Fv/Fm) of the orchids. In the greenhouse, we performed experiments assessing the indirect effect of tolerance to simulated herbivory in orchids under nurse and open spaces conditions. We measured survival, flowering percentage, Fv/Fm, total biomass and jasmonic acid of the orchids. Important Findings: We found more soil moisture and nutrients under the nurses, and higher photosynthetically active radiation, soil and air temperature in open spaces. Survival, growth and Fv/Fm were significantly higher in plants under the nurses, showing the top-down effect more importance than the bottom-up effect. In the greenhouse experiment, we found higher survival, Fv/Fm, flowering and biomass in orchids under the nurse treatment, independently of the imposed herbivory. Jasmonic acid was significantly higher in those individuals with herbivory and open spaces condition. We conclude that B. macraei acts as a nurse improving microclimatic and edaphic conditions that result in an increased survival, growth, physiological status and tolerance against herbivory for B. fimbriata present in the Mediterranean Chilean region.",The authors thank Victoria Leiva Peña for her technical assistance in the field and Daniel Zunino and María José Romero for their assistance in the greenhouse.

Although the workbooks were designed as supplementary materials, in some schools they are used as the sole teaching text. Therefore, an analysis of the content coverage of the workbooks is warranted. This article provides such an analysis in terms of additive relation word problems. Aim:  This article aims firstly to expound on the existing literature to propose a comprehensive additive relation word problem typology and secondly to analyse the prevalence of particular word problem types in the foundation phase Mathematics workbooks. Setting:  This research was conducted in South Africa, focusing on additive relation word problems in foundation phase Mathematics workbooks. Methods:  A comprehensive typology of additive relation word problem types was developed based on typologies used in previous studies. All the additive relation word problems in the 2017 Grades 1–3 foundation phase Mathematics workbooks were categorised according to this typology. Results:  In total there were 61 single-step additive relation word problems with numerical answers across the three grades. This is a small number in comparison to other countries. There was also an uneven distribution of problem types, with more problems in the easier subcategories and fewer or no problems in the more difficult subcategories. Conclusion:  This article provides evidence for the need to revise the word problems in the DBE workbooks. It also provides a theoretical framework to use in the revision of the workbooks and in any supplementary teaching material developed for teachers.",,,South African Journal of Childhood Education,,,,2019-03-27,2019,2019-03-27,,9,1,12,All OA; Gold,Article,"Mostert, Ingrid","Mostert, Ingrid (Centre for Education Practice Research, University of Johannesburg, Soweto)",,"Mostert, Ingrid (University of Johannesburg)",5,1,,2.74,https://sajce.co.za/index.php/sajce/article/download/655/946,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1112963574,39 Education; 3903 Education Systems,
224,pub.1123079274,10.3390/met9121295,,,Copper Tailing Flocculation in Seawater: Relating the Yield Stress with Fractal Aggregates at Varied Mixing Conditions,"The implications of physical conditions of the feedwell on the rheological properties of synthetic copper tailings, flocculated in seawater, were analysed. The mixing intensity of flocculation was related to the structural characteristics of the aggregates, and the outcomes were linked to the yield stress of the pulp sediments. Tailings settling assays were conducted by using a 30 mm turbine type stirrer with an in-situ aggregate size characterisation. The structural characteristics of the aggregates were determined by using the focused beam reflectance measurement (FBRM). After a mixing time between the pulp and the flocculant, the sample was allowed to settle for 2.5 h, where the variation of the sediment height was minimal. The sediment was gently removed and subjected to rheological characterisation. The yield stress was measured on an Anton Paar MCR 102 rheometer (ANAMIN Group, Santiago, Chile), with a vane-in-cup configuration. The mixing intensity was related to the characteristics of the aggregates, and the outcomes were linked to the yield stress of the flocculated pulp sediments. More aggressive hydrodynamics deteriorated the structure of the aggregates, promoting the reduction of both its size and the fractal dimension. This brought direct consequences on the rheological properties of the sediments: at higher mixing level, the yield stress was lower. The explanation lies in the structural changes of the aggregates, where at a fixed mixing rate, the yield stress presented a seemingly exponential increase over the fractal dimension. Additionally, correlations were found between the rheological properties with settling rate and aggregate size.",Ricardo I.

213,pub.1122014602,10.3897/neobiota.51.37250,,,Increasing impacts by Antarctica’s most widespread invasive plant species as result of direct competition with native vascular plants,"Biological invasions represent significant economic and conservation challenges, though it is widely acknowledged that their impacts are often poorly documented and difficult to predict. In the Antarctic, one non-native vascular plant species is widespread and studies have shown negative impacts on native flora. Using field “common garden” experiments, we evaluate the competitive impact of the increasingly widespread invasive grass Poa annua on the only two native vascular species of Antarctica, the forb Colobanthus quitensis and the grass Deschampsia antarctica. We focus on interactions between these three plant species under current and a future, wetter, climate scenario, in terms of density of individuals. Our analysis demonstrates Poa annua has the potential to have negative impacts on the survival and growth of the native Antarctic vascular species. Under predicted future wetter conditions, C. quitensis communities will become more resistant to invasion, while those dominated by D. antarctica will become less resistant. Under a recently developed unified scheme for non-native species impacts, P. annua can be considered a species that can cause potentially moderate to major impacts in Antarctica. If current patterns of increased human pressure and regional climate change persist and mitigation action is not taken (i.e. reduction of propagule pressure and eradication or control measures), P. annua is likely to spread in Antarctica, especially in the Antarctic Peninsula region, with significant negative consequences for some of the most remote and pristine ecosystems worldwide. Tighter biosecurity across all operators in the region, improved surveillance for the species, and prompt, effective control actions will reduce these risks.","FONDECYT 11140607 and PII 20150126 Project 4307 from the Australian Antarctic Division NERC We are grateful for assistance from N.

213,pub.1121989542,10.3390/met9101120,,,Viscoelasticity of Quartz and Kaolin Slurries in Seawater: Importance of Magnesium Precipitates,"In this study, the viscoelastic properties of quartz and kaolin suspensions in seawater were analysed considering two distinct conditions: pH 8 and 10.7. Creep and oscillatory sweep tests provided the rheological parameters. An Anton Paar MCR 102 rheometer (ANAMIN Group, Santiago, Chile) was used with a vane-in-cup configuration, and the data were processed with RheoCompassTM Light software (ANAMIN Group, Santiago, Chile). The outcomes were associated with the formation of solid species principally composed of magnesium precipitates. The magnesium in solution reduced in the presence of quartz (68 wt %), from 1380 to 1280 mg/L. Since the difference was not large regarding the solid-free seawater, the disposition of solid complexes at pH 10.7 was expected to be similar. The jump in pH caused both yield stress and viscoelastic moduli to drop, suggesting that the solid precipitates diminished the strength of the particle networks that made up the suspension. For the kaolin slurries (37 wt %), the yield stress raised when the pH increased, but unlike quartz, there was significant adsorption of magnesium cations. In fact, the concentration of magnesium in solution fell from 1380 to 658 mg/L. Dynamic oscillatory assays revealed structural changes in both pulps; in particular, the phase angle was greater at pH 8 than at pH 10.7, which indicates that at more alkaline conditions, the suspension exhibits a more solid-like character.",Ricardo I.

In 2016 a severe bloom of an Alexandrium species occurred, which was notable for its intensity and geographical extent, extending into new areas to the north of the Patagonian fjords including areas along the open Pacific Ocean coast. Given the exceptional nature of this event, we verified the taxonomic classification of the species that generated the bloom and evaluated the influence of the range expansion process on its genetic structure and population diversity. This was achieved by isolating clones collected in 2014 from cyst beds located at the northern limit of its then known distribution, along with clones isolated from the water samples taken during the 2016 bloom. These clones were characterized genetically with LSU rDNA and AFLPs molecular markers. Phylogenetic analyses showed that all clones were aggregated in the Group I of the A. tamarense species complex, which confirmed that A. catenella was the species responsible for the 2016 bloom. High genetic diversity was observed within populations though there were no significant differences between populations. Furthermore, genetic structure showed an isolation by distance relationship among populations, and several analyses consistently indicated a high divergence among the population groups derived from both cysts and vegetative cells. Despite this study not finding the patterns expected for species range expansion (i.e., diversity gradient and/or high population divergence), the genetic diversity and structure indicated that these were influenced by the geographic distance effect and the physical restrictions to gene flow, along with the demographic processes that occurred during the distinct phases of the life cycle of A. catenella.","Special thanks to Dr. Federico Winkler and reviewer for significant comments to manuscript improvement, and to Dr. Matthiew Lee for English review.

The current situation of both countries was reviewed through different sources of information such as technical and legal regulation, projects and executed works, to then validate them in Chile by way of interviews to various professionals in the field of urban and interurban road construction, as well as others belonging to government bodies. Spain has extensive experience on this issue, as it has a culture of recycling and reusing aggregates that has produced excellent results, a situation which was taken into account to compare it to Chile’s reality. The conclusion is that currently, in Chile, although the existence of recycled aggregate use is known, this is not the case on a technical level for professionals in the sector. It lacks a specific government body that is in charge of this issue and does not have appropriate infrastructure for its treatment. The materials with a promising future within the construction sector are the production of crushed granular bases and the creation of low-resistance concretes, which cannot be used, as laws that regulate them are still being drafted.","Adrián Díaz González, Civil Engineer of Civil Works, and the Santiago de Chile University, for their support in conducting this study.",This research received no external funding.,Buildings,,,,2019-06-26,2019,2019-06-26,,9,7,154,All OA; Gold,Article,"Díaz, Marcos; Almendro-Candel, María Belén; Blanco, David; Jordan, Manuel Miguel","Díaz, Marcos (Department of Construction Sciences, Metropolitan Technological University, Dieciocho 390, 8330526 Santiago, Chile); Almendro-Candel, María Belén (Department of Agrochemistry and Environment, Miguel Hernández University of Elche, Avd.

In the industry, the tendency is to incorporate data management and analysis techniques to generate information that helps improve the surface roughness results in machining. A good alternative to improve the surface quality results in the manufacture of metal parts is using predictive models of the surface roughness. In this document, we present work done with experimental data obtained from two high‐speed machining (HSM) machines with different types of tools and cutting conditions, conducted under an experimental design with interest in three of factors commonly studied to generate surface roughness models: tool characteristics, cutting conditions, and characteristics of the machined material. Steel and aluminum alloys were used in the experimentation. The results are contrasted with prior experiences that use the same experimental design but with different soft computing techniques and they are also contrasted with the results of similar previous works. Our results show accuracies ranging from 61.54% to 88.51% on the datasets, which are competitive results when compared with the other approaches. We also find the axial cut‐depth is the most influential feature for the slots datasets and the hardness and diameter of the cutting tool are the most influential features for the geometries datasets.","Acknowledgments The authors want to thank the Centro de Automática y Robótica at CSIC (Spain) for the use of the Kondia machine tool where a part of the experimentation was made.

202,pub.1121832464,10.3389/fmars.2019.00617,,,Dynamics of the Carbonate System Across the Peruvian Oxygen Minimum Zone,"The oxygen minimum zone (OMZ) of Peru is recognized as a source of CO2 to the atmosphere due to upwelling that brings water with high concentrations of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) to the surface. However, the influence of OMZ dynamics on the carbonate system remains poorly understood given a lack of direct observations. This study examines the influence of a coastal Eastern South Pacific OMZ on carbonate system dynamics based on a multidisciplinary cruise that took place in 2014. During the cruise, onboard DIC and pH measurements were used to estimate pCO2 and to calculate the calcium carbonate saturation state (Ω aragonite and calcite). South of Chimbote (9°S), water stratification decreased and both the oxycline and carbocline moved from 150 m depth to 20–50 m below the surface. The aragonite saturation depth was observed to be close to 50 m. However, values <1.2 were detected close to 20 m along with low pH (minimum of 7.5), high pCO2 (maximum 1,250 μatm), and high DIC concentrations (maximum 2,300 μmol kg−1). These chemical characteristics are shown to be associated with Equatorial Subsurface Water (ESSW). Large spatial variability in surface values was also found. Part of this variability can be attributed to the influence of mesoscale eddies, which can modify the distribution of biogeochemical variables, such as the aragonite saturation horizon, in response to shallower (cyclonic eddies) or deeper (anticyclonic eddies) thermoclines. The analysis of a 21-year (1993–2014) data set of mean sea surface level anomalies (SSHa) derived from altimetry data indicated that a large variance associated with interannual timescales was present near the coast. However, 2014 was characterized by weak Kelvin activity, and physical forcing was more associated with eddy activity. Mesoscale activity modulates the position of the upper boundary of ESSW, which is associated with high DIC and influences the carbocline and aragonite saturation depths. Weighing the relative importance of each individual signal results in a better understanding of the biogeochemical processes present in the area.",We wish to thank the crew of the French R/V Atalante during the cruise in the framework of the AMOP project (Activity of research dedicated to the Minimum of Oxygen in the eastern Pacific).

193,pub.1121835839,10.5194/cp-15-1845-2019,,,Centennial-scale precipitation anomalies in the southern Altiplano (18∘ S) suggest an extratropical driver for the South American summer monsoon during the late Holocene,"Abstract. Modern precipitation anomalies in the Altiplano, South America, are closely linked to the strength of the South American summer monsoon (SASM), which is influenced by large-scale climate features sourced in the tropics such as the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) and El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO). However, the timing, direction, and spatial extent of precipitation changes prior to the instrumental period are still largely unknown, preventing a better understanding of the long-term drivers of the SASM and their effects over the Altiplano. Here we present a detailed pollen reconstruction from a sedimentary sequence covering the period between 4500 and 1000 cal yr BP in Lago Chungará (18∘ S; 4570 m a.s.l.), a high-elevation lake on the southwestern margin of the Altiplano where precipitation is delivered almost exclusively during the mature phase of the SASM over the austral summer. We distinguish three well-defined centennial-scale anomalies, with dry conditions between 4100–3300 and 1600–1000 cal yr BP and a conspicuous humid interval between 2400 and 1600 cal yr BP, which resulted from the weakening and strengthening of the SASM, respectively. Comparisons with other climate reconstructions from the Altiplano, the Atacama Desert, the tropical Andes, and the southwestern Atlantic coast reveal that – unlike modern climatological controls – past precipitation anomalies at Lago Chungará were largely decoupled from north–south shifts in the ITCZ and ENSO. A regionally coherent pattern of centennial-scale SASM variations and a significant latitudinal gradient in precipitation responses suggest the contribution of an extratropical moisture source for the SASM, with significant effects on precipitation variability in the southern Altiplano.","This investigation was funded by Fondecyt grant 1181829 and International Cooperation Grant PI20150081.

193,pub.1112845961,10.3390/min9030181,,,"Design of Flotation Circuits Using Tabu-Search Algorithms: Multispecies, Equipment Design, and Profitability Parameters","The design of a flotation circuit based on optimization techniques requires a superstructure for representing a set of alternatives, a mathematical model for modeling the alternatives, and an optimization technique for solving the problem. The optimization techniques are classified into exact and approximate methods. The first has been widely used. However, the probability of finding an optimal solution decreases when the problem size increases. Genetic algorithms have been the approximate method used for designing flotation circuits when the studied problems were small. The Tabu-search algorithm (TSA) is an approximate method used for solving combinatorial optimization problems. This algorithm is an adaptive procedure that has the ability to employ many other methods. The TSA uses short-term memory to prevent the algorithm from being trapped in cycles. The TSA has many practical advantages but has not been used for designing flotation circuits. We propose using the TSA for solving the flotation circuit design problem. The TSA implemented in this work applies diversification and intensification strategies: diversification is used for exploring new regions, and intensification for exploring regions close to a good solution. Four cases were analyzed to demonstrate the applicability of the algorithm: different objective function, different mathematical models, and a benchmarking between TSA and Baron solver. The results indicate that the developed algorithm presents the ability to converge to a solution optimal or near optimal for a complex combination of requirements and constraints, whereas other methods do not. TSA and the Baron solver provide similar designs, but TSA is faster. We conclude that the developed TSA could be useful in the design of full-scale concentration circuits.",The financial support from CONICYT (Fondecyt 1171341 and 1180826) is gratefully acknowledged.,,Minerals,,,,2019-03-15,2019,2019-03-15,,9,3,181,All OA; Gold,Article,"Lucay, Freddy A.; Gálvez, Edelmira D.; Cisternas, Luis A.","Lucay, Freddy A.

193,pub.1115103240,10.3389/fmars.2019.00239,,,How Does the Diversity of Divers Affect the Design of Citizen Science Projects?,"Divers have widely participated in citizen science (CS) projects and are one of the main groups of marine citizen scientists. However, there is little knowledge about profiles of, and incentives for potential divers to join CS projects. To date, most studies have focused on the SCUBA diving industry; nevertheless, there is a diversity of divers, not all using SCUBA, who engage in different activities during their dives. Differences in diver profiles could affect their willingness and ability to contribute to CS. In this study, we compare the diving profile, interests, preferences and motivations to participate in CS of five diver types (artisanal fishermen, recreational divers, instructors, scientific divers, and others). All divers have strong interests in participating in CS projects, with no major differences among diver types. In general, they are interested in a wide variety of themes related to CS but they prefer simple sampling protocols. Divers are motivated to participate in CS to learn about the sea and contribute to science. Some important differences among diver types were found, with artisanal fishermen having significantly more dive experience than other diver types, but less free time during their dives and limited access to some communication channels and technologies. These characteristics make them ideal partners to contribute their local ecological knowledge (LEK) to local CS projects. In contrast, recreational divers have the least experience but most free time during their dives and good access to cameras and communications channels, making them suitable partners for large-scale CS projects that do not require a high level of species knowledge. Instructors and scientific divers are well-placed to coordinate and supervise CS activities. The results confirm that divers are not all alike and specific considerations have to be taken into account to improve the contribution of each diver type to CS. The findings provide essential information for the design of different types of CS projects. By considering the relevant incentives and opportunities for diverse diver groups, marine CS projects will make efficient gains in volunteer recruitment, retention, and collaborative generation of knowledge about the marine environment.",We wish to thank all the divers who participated in this study and the diving clubs and fishing coves who helped us to promote the survey.

To this end, we evaluate the spatial–temporal tourist flow evolution as well as the wind/solar energy potential in Cocachimba, which is located in the Amazonas region of Peru. This is a place that has seen a considerable increase in tourist activity in the past decade. This is a result of its rich flora and fauna, but especially because of the presence of the Gocta waterfall, considered the third highest in the world. Currently, business initiatives associated with a variety of touristic services have been started. However, there is still a lack of infrastructure, which negatively impacts the tourists’ ability to stay overnight. In order to improve the resident-directed services quality and sustainable tourism, we propose the incorporation of sustainable lodging houses that are based, as previously described, on the usage of clean energy sources, which are harmless to the natural environment. To respond effectively to all this, a methodology based on the use of highly reliable sources and databases, statistical analysis, and highly supported physical calculations was used. The study shows that during the peak season there is insufficient lodging. Furthermore, by incorporating sustainable lodging houses, a reduction in fixed costs for the lodging establishments can be reached. We also found that the solar/wind potential possesses the minimal conditions necessary in order to implement heating systems and sustainable electrification based on conventional systems.",The authors thank the National Direction of Research and Development from the Universidad Privada del Norte (DNID)—Perú.

192,pub.1111639839,10.20430/ete.v86i341.354,,,Competencia sindical y disputas laborales. Un análisis aplicado para el caso español,"Antecedentes:  los representantes de los trabajadores, organizados en sindicatos, son los encargados de encarnar la voz colectiva de éstos para defender sus intereses y propuestas en el entorno productivo. La representación de los trabajadores se manifiesta mediante la acción colectiva y su principal herramienta de presión frente a su contraparte —la organización empresarial— es el conflicto. Con él los trabajadores y, especialmente, sus representantes —quienes poseen la capacidad de convocatoria— muestran el poder que ostentan para defender sus intereses. Diversos estudios recientes se han centrado en analizar la relación que existe entre formas de representación laboral y conflicto, en los que destaca empíricamente la existencia de una relación diferente entre ambas a la que podría esperarse a nivel teórico. En este sentido, las evidencias indican que la concentración de la representación laboral en una única organización laboral o sindicato, que hipotéticamente estaría relacionada con una mayor unidad en la representación laboral en el centro de trabajo y, por lo tanto, un mayor poder de convocatoria de los trabajadores a la acción colectiva, no se asocia con un mayor nivel de conflicto laboral. Todos los estudios indican que tal relación inversa entre poder de negociación y confl icto se encuentra asociada al efecto del multisindicalismo y los incentivos que éste genera sobre la competencia sindical. Metodología: el presente estudio aplicado, tras realizar una revisión del marco teórico al uso y ofrecer un panorama de los estudios empíricos más relevantes llevados a cabo, se centra en el caso español y profundiza el análisis del efecto que la competencia entre organizaciones sindicales genera sobre el desarrollo de la conflictividad durante la negociación del convenio colectivo. Para contrastar las tres hipótesis establecidas en el estudio, al defi nir la relación entre el nivel de heterogeneidad en la representación laboral en la negociación colectiva y el confl icto de trabajo, y una vez precisadas las variables correspondientes, se desarrolla el modelo econométrico considerado más adecuado para este análisis, de tipo probabilístico, de respuesta binaria o probit. La base de datos de convenios colectivos del Ministerio de Trabajo y Seguridad Social español suministra la información empírica necesaria para llevar a cabo el modelo de contraste de las hipótesis. Resultados: las evidencias alcanzadas confirman la incidencia positiva y significativa de la rivalidad entre organizaciones laborales sobre el desarrollo de la conflictividad en la negociación colectiva, de modo que el confl icto es empleado como una estrategia de marketing para fortalecer la capacidad de liderazgo de las organizaciones laborales y mantener su reputación (como organización de éxito) frente a sus representados. Así, se constata que existe un efecto negativo y significativo del índice de concentración en la representación laboral, según el cual existe una menor probabilidad de conflicto durante la negociación a medida que la heterogeneidad en dicha representación disminuye. Este resultado se complementa con el obtenido en los modelos que emplean las dos variables que defi nen el tipo de liderazgo existente en la representación laboral. Así, cuando el liderazgo es estable, la probabilidad de confl icto laboral disminuye de forma signifi cativa, y se obtienen también evidencias importantes del proceso contrario cuando el liderazgo es inestable. Conclusiones: lo anterior indica que en una situación en que una organización laboral domina la representación de los trabajadores en la negociación colectiva, la probabilidad de conflicto disminuye y, a contrario sensu, cuando la dispersión en la representación de los trabajadores aumenta, la probabilidad de conflicto también.",,,El Trimestre Económico,,,,2019-01-10,2019,2019-01-10,,86,341,95-125,All OA; Gold,Article,"Benito, Santos M.

It is focused on the effective use of scarce resources, on avoiding harm and maximising good. It is grounded in principles of equity and equality, of accountability and transparency. Given these characteristics, for those of us who work in this field, there is arguably a moral, economic, social and political case for paying closer attention to evidence-informed decision-making ecosystems in the South. Evidence-based policy and implementation, or evidence-informed decision-making in line with the most recent thinking, is often framed from two inter-related but limited perspectives: first, it is viewed as an approach that has originated from ‘developed’ Northern countries, and second, it is conceptualised as a technical intervention. However, there has been a shift in how the approach is conceived, moving away from assumptions that it is an intervention implemented from outside, from the North, for the benefit of the South. As part of this shift, certain initiatives in Africa have gained greater momentum. It is in acknowledging that there are different ways to think (epistemic diversity) about Southern evidence-informed decision-making, that this work has arisen. It seizes on the opportunity to view evidence-informed decision-making in a new light, exploring the evidence ecosystems in the South as systems strongly influenced by, but not defined by, Northern stimuli, including, but not limited to, technical interventions. This work set out to describe the evidence ecosystem in South Africa. In doing so, it finds that the ecosystem is increasingly resilient despite some limitations. It has strong structural foundations, includes many diverse organisations, is supported by not inconsiderable investment, is enabled by growing and significant capacity, contains iterations and innovations, and last but not least, incorporates complexity that gives the ecosystem resilience. The work demonstrates, through its focus on South Africa’s evidence ecosystem, that the global movement has much to learn from the South.","The perspectives offered in this work are those of the authors and do not necessarily reflect the views of the University of Johannesburg nor the South African Department of Planning, Monitoring and Evaluation.

They comprise such phenomena as the creation and usage of neologisms, extentions of meaning, the adoption of loans in the morphological system of Nahuatl and the usage of calques. The material is divided in three parts. The first one focuses on specific traits of the Nahuatl language in which the Guatemalan petitions were composed, taking into account an ongoing discussion among researchers concerning the identification of this language or languages. The second part focuses on the presentation of selected lexical and lexico-syntactic changes in Nahuatl due to the influence of the Spanish language, as compared with similar contact-induced phenomena from Central Mexico and attested within the same time span.

163,pub.1120002213,10.3389/fmars.2019.00444,,,Ocean Climate Observing Requirements in Support of Climate Research and Climate Information,"Natural variability and change of the Earth’s climate have significant global societal impacts. With its large heat and carbon capacity and relatively slow dynamics, the ocean plays an integral role in climate, and provides an important source of predictability at seasonal and longer timescales. In addition, the ocean provides the slowly evolving lower boundary to the atmosphere, driving, and modifying atmospheric weather. Understanding and monitoring ocean climate variability and change, to constrain and initialize models as well as identify model biases for improved climate hindcasting and prediction, requires a scale-sensitive, and long-term observing system. A climate observing system has requirements that significantly differ from, and sometimes are orthogonal to, those of other applications. In general terms, they can be summarized by the simultaneous need for both large spatial and long temporal coverage, and by the accuracy and stability required for detecting the local climate signals. This paper reviews the requirements of a climate observing system in terms of space and time scales, and revisits the question of which parameters such a system should encompass to meet future strategic goals of the World Climate Research Program (WCRP), with emphasis on ocean and sea-ice covered areas. It considers global as well as regional aspects that should be accounted for in designing observing systems in individual basins. Furthermore, the paper discusses which data-driven products are required to meet WCRP research and modeling needs, and ways to obtain them through data synthesis and assimilation approaches. Finally, it addresses the need for scientific capacity building and international collaboration in support of the collection of high-quality measurements over the large spatial scales and long time-scales required for climate research, bridging the scientific rational to the required resources for implementation.","Comments from the two reviewers are gratefully acknowledged.

162,pub.1113374913,10.3390/rs11070869,,,"Beyond Site Detection: The Role of Satellite Remote Sensing in Analysing Archaeological Problems. A Case Study in Lithic Resource Procurement in the Atacama Desert, Northern Chile","Remote sensing archaeology in recent years has emphasized the use of high-precision and high-accuracy tools to achieve the detailed documentation of archaeological elements (drones, LIDAR, etc.). Satellite remote sensing has also benefited from an increase in the spatial and spectral resolution of the sensors, which is enabling the discovery and documentation of new archaeological features and sites worldwide. While there can be no doubt that a great deal is being gained via such “site detection” approaches, there still remains the possibility of further exploring remote sensing methods to analyse archaeological problems. In this paper, this issue is discussed by focusing on one common archaeological topic: the mapping of environmental resources used in the past and, in particular, the procurement of lithic raw material by hunter-gatherer groups. This is illustrated by showing how the combined use of Landsat 8 images and “ground-truthing” via focused field studies has allowed the identification of a number of potential chert sources, the major lithic resource used by coastal groups between 11,500–1,500 cal. BP, in a vast area of the Atacama Desert covering 22,500 km2. Besides discussing the case study, the strength of remote sensing techniques in addressing archaeological questions comprising large spatial scales is highlighted, stressing the key role they can play in the detection and study of specific environmental resources within challenging physical settings.","Luca Sitzia for his geological assistance; the team members involved in field work carried out in the interior desert of Taltal: Ximena Power, Sonia Parra, Ignacio Monroy, Patricio Galarce, Luca Sitzia Carlos Uribe, Valentina Hernández, Catalina Aliste, and Gabriela Marcelo; and Lautaro Núñez for his valuable guidance.",This research was funded by Proyecto Fondecyt 1151203 and Beca CONICYT-PCHA/Doctorado Nacional/2015-21150953.,Remote Sensing,,,,2019-04-10,2019,2019-04-10,,11,7,869,All OA; Gold,Article,"Borie, César; Parcero-Oubiña, César; Kwon, Youngsang; Salazar, Diego; Flores, Carola; Olguín, Laura; Andrade, Pedro","Borie, César (Programa de Doctorado en Antropología UCN-UTA, Universidad Católica del Norte, Calle R.P.

150,pub.1117357827,10.3389/fenvs.2019.00070,,,A Test in a High Altitude Lake of a Multi-Parametric Rapid Methodology for Assessing Life in Liquid Environments on Planetary Bodies: A Potential New Freshwater Polychaete Tubeworm Community,"On our planet, aqueous environments such as deep sea or high-altitude aphotic lakes, subject to present or past volcanic activity and active deglaciation, may provide analogs to the aqueous environments found on such planetary bodies as Europa, Titan or Enceladus. We report here on the methodologies and technologies tested in Laguna Negra, a high altitude lake in the Central Andes, Chile, for exploring and assessing the presence of life within planetary lakes or interior oceans. We adopted a multi-parametric Rapid Ecological Assessment (REA) approach centered around collecting video imagery (by an Underwater Imaging System) and sampling benthic sediments (for sedimentological, biological and geochemical analysis) to depths of 272 m, to complement physico-chemical sampling of the water column and collection of shallow sediments for microbiological analysis (reported in separate publications). This enabled us to classify and assess the apparent status of benthic habitats, based on substrata and environmental characteristics, together with floral and faunal community characteristics and bioturbation artifacts. Video imagery showed that the lower water column was characterized by a variably intense sestonic flux of particles and debris, among which were planktonic organisms such as ostracods, copepods, and possibly cladocerans. Sediment analysis revealed at all depths abundant diatom frustules, mainly of an acidophile pennade diatom Pinnularia acidicola, amid vegetal debris likely originating from littoral macrophytes. Video imagery showed that the lakebed was partly covered by microbial mats and depositional matter and harbored an unexpectedly rich assortment of macrofauna, including sponges, tubificid worms, flatworms, bivalves and crustaceans. Various forms of bioturbation were also encountered, some with the animals in the tracks. Most notably, at the deepest site, a previously undescribed faunal feature was evident, apparently formed by a mat-like community of several layers of what appeared to be polychaete tubeworms, possibly of the family Siboglinidae. It is hypothesized that the hydrothermal activity observed in the region may supply the compounds able to support the deep-water microrganisms from which such tubeworms typically gain sustenance. Such processes could be present on other deep and aphotic liquid-water-bearing planetary bodies.","We thank the Aguas Andinas Company (Santiago, Chile) for providing access to Laguna Negra.

140,pub.1112200120,10.3389/fmars.2019.00031,,,Tropical Pacific Observing System,"This paper reviews the design of the Tropical Pacific Observing System (TPOS) and its governance and takes a forward look at prospective change. The initial findings of the TPOS 2020 Project embrace new strategic approaches and technologies in a user-driven design and the variable focus of the Framework for Ocean Observing. User requirements arise from climate prediction and research, climate change and the climate record, and coupled modeling and data assimilation more generally. Requirements include focus on the upper ocean and air-sea interactions, sampling of diurnal variations, finer spatial scales and emerging demands related to biogeochemistry and ecosystems. One aim is to sample a diversity of climatic regimes in addition to the equatorial zone. The status and outlook for meeting the requirements of the design are discussed. This is accomplished through integrated and complementary capabilities of networks, including satellites, moorings, profiling floats and autonomous vehicles. Emerging technologies and methods are also discussed. The outlook highlights a few new foci of the design: biogeochemistry and ecosystems, low-latitude western boundary currents and the eastern Pacific. Low latitude western boundary currents are conduits of tropical-subtropical interactions, supplying waters of mid to high latitude origin to the western equatorial Pacific and into the Indonesian Throughflow. They are an essential part of the recharge/discharge of equatorial warm water volume at interannual timescales and play crucial roles in climate variability on regional and global scales. The tropical eastern Pacific, where extreme El Niño events develop, requires tailored approaches owing to the complex of processes at work there involving coastal upwelling, and equatorial cold tongue dynamics, the oxygen minimum zone and the seasonal double Intertropical Convergence Zone. A pilot program building on existing networks is envisaged, complemented by a process study of the East Pacific ITCZ/warm pool/cold tongue/stratus coupled system. The sustainability of TPOS depends on effective and strong collaborative partnerships and governance arrangements. Revisiting regional mechanisms and engaging new partners in the context of a planned and systematic design will ensure a multi-purpose, multi-faceted integrated approach that is sustainable and responsive to changing needs.","We wish to acknowledge contributions from M.

122,pub.1115031123,10.1525/elementa.353,,,Geohistorical records of the Anthropocene in Chile,"The deep-time dynamics of coupled socio-ecological systems at different spatial scales is viewed as a key framework to understand trends and mechanisms that have led to the Anthropocene. By integrating archeological and paleoenvironmental records, we test the hypothesis that Chilean societies progressively escalated their capacity to shape national biophysical systems as socio-cultural complexity and pressures on natural resources increased over the last three millennia. We demonstrate that Pre-Columbian societies intentionally transformed Chile’s northern and central regions by continuously adjusting socio-cultural practices and/or incorporating technologies that guaranteed resource access and social wealth. The fact that past human activities led to cumulative impacts on diverse biophysical processes, not only contradicts the notion of pristine pre-Industrial Revolution landscapes, but suggests that the Anthropocene derives from long-term processes that have operated uninterruptedly since Pre-Columbian times. Moreover, our synthesis suggests that most of present-day symptoms that describe the Anthropocene are rooted in pre-Columbian processes that scaled up in intensity over the last 3000 years, accelerating after the Spanish colonization and, more intensely, in recent decades. The most striking trend is the observed coevolution between the intensity of metallurgy and heavy-metal anthropogenic emissions. This entails that the Anthropocene cannot be viewed as a universal imprint of human actions that has arisen as an exclusive consequence of modern industrial societies. In the Chilean case, this phenomenon is intrinsically tied to historically and geographically diverse configurations in society-environment feedback relationships. Taken collectively with other case studies, the patterns revealed here could contribute to the discussion about how the Anthropocene is defined globally, in terms of chronology, stratigraphic markers and attributes. Furthermore, this deep-time narrative can potentially become a science-based instrument to shape better-informed discourses about the socio-environmental history in Chile. More importantly, however, this research provides crucial “baselines” to delineate safe operating spaces for future socio-ecological systems.","We thank Andrés Troncoso for sharing archeological radiocarbon database for central Chile, Colin Cooke for geochemical data from Lagunas Lobato and Pirhuacocha, Lucien Von Gunten for Black Carbon data and Anja Eichler for providing Illimani Cu data.

A compactification approach is performed for the exponential potential and for potentials beyond the exponential one, extending the previous findings in the literature. By using this approach it is possible to describe the finite region of the phase space and the region where the phase-space variables becomes infinity. Furthermore, we present several results concerning the stability of the de Sitter solution in Hořava–Lifshitz cosmology using Center Manifold theory. The advantages of this procedure are unveiled immediately when it is compared with the Normal Forms Calculations presented before in the literature.",This work was funded by Comisión Nacional de Investigación Científica y Tecnológica (CONICYT) through FONDECYT Iniciación 11180126.

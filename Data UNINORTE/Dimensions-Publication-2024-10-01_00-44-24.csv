In order to produce the adsorbents, a cationic surfactant is selected to facilitate the adsorption of the crude oil into the pores of the zeolite and to get the composite, which was activated with controlled thermal treatments (T: 700-800 °C and t: 0.5-1 h) in inert conditions (N2 gaseous). The starting materials, composite and porous carbons were characterized using structural/surface analysis techniques (API Gravity, SARA, IR, XRD, XRF, TGA, Langmuir isotherms, BET and SEM). The results showed that four types of mesoporous carbons were produced with specific surface areas between 70 ± 1 m2/g and 220 ± 3 m2/g, average pore volumes between 0.144 cm3/g and 0.40 cm3/g and average pore widths between 4.9 nm and 8.3 nm. The activation conditions of 800 °C and 1 h allowed to make the carbonaceous material with the best surface characteristics (220 ± 3 m2/g, 0.27 cm3/g, and 4.9 nm). Therefore, it is concluded that under assay conditions employed, the heavy crude oil, as a mixed model (water-oil), from an aqueous environment is a starting material suitable for preparation of ""mesoporous"" carbons.","AcknowledgmentsWe thank the Universidad del Norte and Colciencias for the financial support through doctoral scholarship 2013 (N° UN-OJ-2013-22022), Strategic area “Biodiversidad, Servicios Ecosistémicos y Bienestar Humano” (UN-Code 2013-DI0024) and grant program “Jóvenes Investigadores e Innovadores” 2012, respectively.

Given the expected increased life expectancy, this problem is only likely to worsen, so it has been considered that treatment effects must be examined separately in elderly adults with CAP. Areas covered: In this narrative review, we give an update of the available data of antibiotics for elderly patients with CAP. Clinical features, drug pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, adverse effects, and outcomes differ in CAP depending on patient age. Older age, for example, can affect the effect of specific antibiotic regimens on important CAP clinical outcomes. Current guidelines do not offer specific recommendations for the management of CAP in elderly patients. Expert opinion: Most of our knowledge about the treatment of CAP in elderly patients has been gained from studies in young populations. However, elderly patients with CAP deserve special attention because there are several factors in this population that could influence their response to antibiotic regimens in CAP.",,"This study was supported by Ministerio de Economía y Competitividad, Instituto de Salud Carlos III (grant 11/01106 and 14/00580) - co-financed by European Development Regional Fund ‘A way to achieve Europe’ ERDF, Spanish Network for the Research in Infectious Diseases (REIPI), and the Institut d’Investigació Biomèdica de Bellvitge (IDIBELL), Spain; and Universidad del Norte.

Thus, it is necessary to calibrate these methods to clarify issues such as population variability and accuracy of estimations for the elderly.

This study conducted a blind test of a sample of 277 individuals from two contemporary skeletal collections from Universal and San Pedro cemeteries in Medellin, for which known pre-mortem data support the statistical analysis of results obtained using the four age assessment methods.

This study explored patient needs for educational material appropriate for RA patients in our region through a website. This study includes seven focus groups and semi-structured interviews across 4 countries (Argentina, Chile, Colombia, and Mexico) with 71 RA patients. Transcripts were analyzed by anthropologists using qualitative analysis (QA), resulting in themes and subthemes to be developed. Five themes and over 50 subthemes of interest were identified by patients. Grouped into categories as follows: (1) knowing the disease, (2) living with arthritis, (3) treatment and therapies for RA, (4) psychosocial support, and (5) information for families. A response was written by the team in plain Spanish on patient subthemes of interest including additional areas that the team considered relevant. Three videos for YouTube were produced: on patient-doctor relationships, patients at work, and home and at the clinic. Illustrations in a comic book format on RA diagnosis were created. The educational site on RA of PANLAR can be found at htpp://artritisreumatoide.cl. This project accomplished a comprehensive list of RA patient interests, revealing the complex relationship between the information on the disease, the experience of a chronic disease, and the way in which patients approach, conceive, and manage their disease.

In addition, the overrepresentation of males in crash statistics has been recognized as a pervasive young driver problem. Though progress in road safety evidenced as a stabilization and/or reduction in poor road safety outcomes has been made in developed nations, less-developed nations contribute the greatest road safety trauma, and developing nations such as Colombia continue to experience increasing trends in fatality rates. The aim of the research was to explore sex differences in self-reported risky driving behaviors of young drivers, including the associations with crash involvement, in a sample of young drivers attending university in Colombia.
METHODS: The Spanish version of the Behaviour of Young Novice Drivers Scale (BYNDS-Sp) was applied in an online survey to a sample of 392 students (225 males) aged 16-24 years attending a major university. Appropriate comparative statistics and logistic regression modeling were used when analyzing the data.
RESULTS: Males reported consistently more risky driving behaviors, with approximately one quarter of all participants reporting risky driving exposure. Males reported greater crash involvement, with violations such as speeding associated with crash involvement for both males and females.
CONCLUSION: Young drivers in Colombia appear to engage in the same risky driving behaviors as young drivers in developed nations. In addition, young male drivers in Colombia reported greater engagement in risky driving behaviors than young female drivers, a finding consistent with the behaviors of young male drivers in developed nations. As such, the research findings suggest that general interventions such as education, engineering, and enforcement should target transient rule violations such as speeding and using a handheld mobile phone while driving for young drivers in Colombia. Future research should investigate how these interventions could be tailored specifically for the Colombian cultural context, including how their effects can be evaluated, prior to implementation.",,,Traffic Injury Prevention,,,"Accidents, Traffic; Adolescent; Automobile Driving; Colombia; Female; Humans; Male; Risk-Taking; Self Report; Sex Factors; Students; Universities; Young Adult",2017-08-25,2017,2017-08-25,2018-01-02,19,1,9-17,Closed,Article,"Oviedo-Trespalacios, Oscar; Scott-Parker, Bridie","Oviedo-Trespalacios, Oscar (Queensland University of Technology (QUT), Centre for Accident Research and Road Safety–Queensland (CARRS-Q), Institute of Health and Biomedical Innovation (IHBI), Brisbane, Queensland, Australia; Department of Industrial Engineering, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia; Consortium of Adolescent Road Safety, Birtinya, Queensland, Australia); Scott-Parker, Bridie (Consortium of Adolescent Road Safety, Birtinya, Queensland, Australia; Adolescent Risk Research Unit (ARRU), Sunshine Coast Mind and Neuroscience–Thompson Institute, University of the Sunshine Coast (USC), Birtinya, Queensland, Australia; Sustainability Research Centre (SRC), Faculty of Arts, Business and Law, University of the Sunshine Coast (USC), Birtinya, Queensland, Australia; School of Social Sciences, Faculty of Arts, Business and Law, University of the Sunshine Coast (USC), Birtinya, Queensland, Australia)","Oviedo-Trespalacios, Oscar (Queensland University of Technology; Universidad del Norte; Consortium of Adolescent Road Safety, Birtinya, Queensland, Australia)","Oviedo-Trespalacios, Oscar (Queensland University of Technology; Universidad del Norte; Consortium of Adolescent Road Safety, Birtinya, Queensland, Australia); Scott-Parker, Bridie (Consortium of Adolescent Road Safety, Birtinya, Queensland, Australia; University of the Sunshine Coast; University of the Sunshine Coast; University of the Sunshine Coast)",52,9,2.35,10.06,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1085619350,42 Health Sciences; 4206 Public Health,3 Good Health and Well Being

This work is aimed to investigate the simultaneous removal of three OPs (lindane, chlordane and methoxychlor) from diverse types of systems by employing a native Streptomyces consortium. In liquid systems, a satisfactory microbial growth was observed accompanied by removal of lindane (40.4%), methoxychlor (99.5%) and chlordane (99.8%). In sterile soil microcosms, the consortium was able to grow without significant differences in the different textured soils (clay silty loam, sandy and loam), both contaminated or not contaminated with the OPs-mixture. The Streptomyces consortium was able to remove all the OPs in sterile soil microcosm (removal order: clay silty loam > loam > sandy). So, clay silty loam soil (CSLS) was selected for next assays. In non-sterile CSLS microcosms, chlordane removal was only about 5%, nonetheless, higher rates was observed for lindane (11%) and methoxychlor (20%). In CSLS slurries, the consortium exhibited similar growth levels, in the presence of or in the absence of the OPs-mixture. Not all pesticides were removed in the same way; the order of pesticide dissipation was: methoxychlor (26%)>lindane (12.5%)>chlordane (10%). The outlines of microbial growth and pesticides removal provide information about using actinobacteria consortium as strategies for bioremediation of OPs-mixture in diverse soil systems. Texture of soils and assay conditions (sterility, slurry formulation) were determining factors influencing the removal of each pesticide of the mixture.","AcknowledgementsThe authors gratefully acknowledge financial support of Consejo de Investigaciones de la Universidad Nacional de Tucumán (PIUNT D504), Agencia Nacional de Promoción Científica y Tecnológica (PICT 2013 Nº 0141), Universidad del Norte Santo Tomás de Aquino (UNSTA Nº 580-14) and Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Científicas y Técnicas (PIP 2012 Nº 112.201101–00085).

We reviewed clinical data for GBS cases in Barranquilla and performed a case-control investigation to assess the association of suspect and probable Zika virus disease with GBS.
METHODS: We used the Brighton Collaboration Criteria to confirm reported GBS patients in Barranquilla during October 2015-April 2016. In April 2016, two neighborhood and age range-matched controls were selected for each confirmed GBS case-patient. We obtained demographics and antecedent symptoms in the 2-month period before GBS onset for case-patients and the same period for controls. Sera were collected for Zika virus antibody testing. Suspected Zika virus disease was defined as a history of rash and ≥2 other Zika-related symptoms (fever, arthralgia, myalgia, or conjunctivitis). Probable Zika virus disease was defined as suspected Zika virus disease with laboratory evidence of a recent Zika virus or flavivirus infection. Conditional logistic regression adjusted for sex and race/ethnicity was used to calculate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs).
RESULTS: We confirmed 47 GBS cases. Incidence increased with age (10-fold higher in those ≥60years versus those <20years). We interviewed 40 case-patients and 79 controls. There was no significant difference in laboratory evidence of recent Zika virus or flavivirus infection between case-patients and controls (OR: 2.2; 95% CI: 0.9-5.1). GBS was associated with having suspected (OR: 3.0, 95% CI: 1.1-8.6) or probable Zika virus disease (OR: 4.6, CI: 1.1-19.0).
CONCLUSIONS: Older individuals and those with suspected and probable Zika virus disease had higher odds of developing GBS.
KEY POINTS: We confirmed a Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) outbreak in Barranquilla, Colombia, during October 2015-April 2016. A case-control investigation using neighborhood controls showed an association of suspected and probable Zika virus disease with GBS.","AcknowledgmentsWe are grateful to the patients, family members, and neighborhood controls that participated in this investigation.

The purpose of this study was to analyze within- and between-session reliabilities, inter-rater reliability, standard error of measurement (SEM), minimum detectable change (MDC) and consistency of agreement across raters and sessions of 3D kinematic variables during maximum mouth opening (MMO). Thirty-six asymptomatic subjects from both genders were evaluated on two different days, five to seven days apart. Subjects performed three MMO movements while kinematic data were collected. Intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC), SEM and MDC were calculated for all variables, and Bland-Altman plots were constructed. Jaw radius and width were the most reproducible variables (ICC>0.81) and demonstrated minor error. Incisor displacement during MMO and angular movements in the sagittal plane presented good reliability (ICC from 0.61 to 0.8) and small errors and, consequently, could be used in future studies with the same methodology and population. The variables with smaller amplitudes (condylar translations during mouth opening and closing and mandibular movements on the frontal and transversal planes) were less reliable (ICC<0.61) and presented larger SEM and MDC. Although ICC, SEM and MDC showed less between-session reproducibility than within-session and inter-rater, the limits of agreement were larger in inter-rater comparisons. In future studies care must be taken with variables collected on different days and with mandibular movements in the frontal and transversal planes.",Authors are grateful to Cláudia Maria de Felício for supporting the kinematic analysis and to Fundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de São Paulo for financial support (grant #2014/05276-7).

Research findings from this area indicate that positive, neutral, and negative concepts are associated with upward, midward, and downward locations, respectively, in the vertical plane. The same research area has also indicated that such concepts seem to have no preferential location on the horizontal plane. The approach-avoidance effect consists in decreasing the distance between positive stimuli and the body (i.e. approach) and increasing the distance between negative stimuli and the body (i.e. avoid). Thus, the valence-space metaphor accounts for the mapping of valenced concepts onto the vertical and horizontal planes, and the approach-avoidance effect accounts for the mapping of valenced concepts onto the ""depth"" plane. By using a cube conceived for the study of allocation of valenced concepts onto 3D space, we show in three studies that positive concepts are placed in upward locations and near the participants' body, negative concepts are placed in downward locations and far from the participants' body, and neutral concepts are placed in between these concepts in both planes.","FM-R thanks Daniela Álvarez Lleras for the illustrations of the experimental device and the experimental sequence, Susan Brunner and Rosie Gronthos for proofreading the manuscript, and Alexandra Marmolejo-Losyeva (mañuña) and Iryna Losyeva for their permanent support.",The study was supported by the Swedish Foundation for Humanities and Social Sciences [grant number M14-0375:1].

Methods A case-control study nested within the Grupo Latino Americano De Estudio de Lupus (GLADEL) cohort was conducted. Flare was defined as an increase ≥4 points in the SLEDAI. Cases were defined as patients with at least one flare. Controls were selected by matching cases by length of follow-up. Demographic and clinical manifestations were systematically recorded by a common protocol. Glucocorticoid use was recorded as average daily dose of prednisone and antimalarial use as percentage of time on antimalarial and categorized as never (0%), rarely (>0-25%), occasionally (>25%-50%), commonly (˃50%-75%) and frequently (˃75%). Immunosuppressive drugs were recorded as used or not used. The association between demographic, clinical manifestations, therapy and flares was examined using univariable and multivariable conditional logistic regression models. Results A total of 465 cases and controls were included. Mean age at diagnosis among cases and controls was 27.5 vs 29.9 years, p = 0.003; gender and ethnic distributions were comparable among both groups and so was the baseline SLEDAI. Independent factors protective of flares identified by multivariable analysis were older age at diagnosis (OR = 0.929 per every five years, 95% CI 0.869-0.975; p = 0.004) and antimalarial use (frequently vs never, OR = 0.722, 95% CI 0.522-0.998; p = 0.049) whereas azathioprine use (OR = 1.820, 95% CI 1.309-2.531; p < 0.001) and SLEDAI post-baseline were predictive of them (OR = 1.034, 95% CI 1.005-1.064; p = 0.022). Conclusions In this large, longitudinal Latin American cohort, older age at diagnosis and more frequent antimalarial use were protective whereas azathioprine use and higher disease activity were predictive of flares.","We are grateful to Daniel Villalba and Leonardo Grasso for providing expert assistance with the ARTHROS (version 6.0) software.

Here, we evaluate whether inhibitory control, measured by simple automatized prepotent response (PR) inhibition variables, is a robust discriminant function for the diagnosis of ADHD in children and can be used as an endophenotype for future genetic studies. One hundred fifty-two school children (30.9% female, 67.8% with ADHD) were recruited. The ADHD checklist was used as the screening tool, whilst the DSM-IV Mini International Neuropsychiatry Interview, neurologic interview and neurologic examination, and the WISC III FSIQ test were administered as the gold standard procedure to assert ADHD diagnosis. A Go/No-Go task using a naturalistic and automatized visual signal was administered. A linear multifactor model (MANOVA) was fitted to compare groups including ADHD status, age, and gender as multiple independent factors. Linear discriminant analysis and the receiver operating characteristic curve were used to assess the predictive performance of PR inhibition variables for ADHD diagnosis. We found that four variables of prepotent response reaction time- and prepotent response inhibition established statistically significant differences between children with and without ADHD. Furthermore, these variables generated a strong discriminant function with a total classification capability of 73, 84% specificity, 68% sensitivity, and 90% positive predictive value for ADHD diagnosis, which support reaction times as a candidate endophenotype that could potentially be used in future ADHD genetic research.","We express our highest appreciation to all families enrolled in this study.

METHODS: Patients from GLADEL, a multi-national, multi-ethnic, Latin-American lupus cohort were included. Disease activity was evaluated at baseline with the SLEDAI score. Demographic characteristics (age at diagnosis, gender, ethnicity, marital status, educational level, medical coverage and socioeconomic status) were assessed. Disease duration was defined as the time between the fourth ACR criterion and baseline. Time to criteria accrual was defined as the interval between the first and fourth ACR criterion. Use of glucocorticoids was recorded as the highest dose received before the baseline visit. Antimalarials and immunosuppressive drugs were recorded as use or not use. Univariable and multivariable analysis were performed. Model selection was based on backward elimination.
RESULTS: One thousand two hundred sixty-eight patients were included; 1136 (89.6%) of them were female. Mean age at diagnosis was 29.2 (SD: 12.3) years. Five hundred sixty-five (44.6%) were Mestizo, 539 (42.5%) were Caucasians and 164 (12.9%) were African-Latin-Americans. The mean SLEDAI at baseline was 10.9 (SD: 8.4). Longer time between first and fourth ACR criterion, medical coverage, a dose of prednisone between 15 and 60mg/d, and the use of antimalarials were factors protective of disease activity, while Mestizo and African-Latin-American ethnicities were predictive factors.
CONCLUSIONS: Mestizo and African-Latin-American ethnicities were predictive whereas antimalarial use, medical coverage, and longer time to criteria accrual were protective of higher disease activity early in the disease course.",AcknowledgmentsWe are grateful to Daniel Villalba and Leonardo Grasso for providing expert assistance with the ARTHROS (version 6.0) software.,,Seminars in Arthritis and Rheumatism,,,"Adolescent; Adult; Disease Progression; Female; Glucocorticoids; Humans; Latin America; Lupus Erythematosus, Systemic; Male; Severity of Illness Index; Young Adult",2017-02-02,2017,2017-02-02,2017-10,47,2,199-203,Closed,Article,"Pimentel-Quiroz, Victor R.; Ugarte-Gil, Manuel F.; Pons-Estel, Guillermo J.; Soriano, Enrique R.; Saurit, Verónica; Sato, Emilia I.; Costallat, Lilian T.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Four DAS were defined: remission off-therapy: SLE Disease Activity Index (SLEDAI)=0, no prednisone or immunosuppressive drugs (IS); remission on-therapy: SLEDAI=0, prednisone ≤5 mg/day and/or IS (maintenance); low (L) DAS: SLEDAI ≤4, prednisone ≤7.5 mg/day and/or IS (maintenance); non-optimally controlled: SLEDAI >4 and/or prednisone >7.5 mg/day and/or IS (induction). Antimalarials were allowed in all. Predefined outcomes were mortality, new damage (increase of at least one Systemic Lupus International Collaborating Clinics/American College of Rheumatology (SLICC/ACR) damage index (SDI) point) and severe new damage (increase of at least 3 SDI points). Univariable and multivariable Cox regression models were performed to define the impact of DAS, as time-dependent variable, on these outcomes.
RESULTS: 1350 patients were included, 79 died during follow-up, 606 presented new and 177 severe new damage. In multivariable analyses, remission (on/off-therapy) was associated with a lower risk of new (HR 0.60; 95% CI 0.43 to 0.85), and of severe new damage (HR 0.32; 95% CI 0.15 to 0.68); low disease activity status (LDAS) was associated with a lower risk of new damage (HR 0.66; 95% CI 0.48 to 0.93) compared with non-optimally controlled. No significant effect on mortality was observed.

However, the understanding of the mechanisms by which PM exerts its adverse effects is still incomplete and comes mainly from studies in occupationally exposed populations. The aims of this study were to: (1) evaluate DNA damage in lymphocytes assessing the cytokinesis-block micronucleus cytome assay (CBMN-cyt) parameters; (2) identify aneugenic or clastogenic effects in lymphocytes of exposed populations using CREST immunostaining for micronuclei; (3) evaluate multi-elemental composition of atmospheric particulate matter; and (4) verify relation between the DNA damage and PM2.5 and PM10 levels around the mining area. Analysis revealed a significant increase in micronuclei frequency in binucleated (MNBN) and mononucleated (MNMONO) cells of individuals with residential proximity to open-pit coal mines compared to residents from non-mining areas. Correlation analysis demonstrated a highly significant association between PM2.5 levels, MNBN frequencies and CREST+ micronuclei induction in exposed residents. These results suggest that PM2.5 fraction generated in coal mining activities may induce whole chromosome loss (aneuploidy) preferentially, although there are also chromosome breaks. Analysis of the chemical composition of PM2.5 by PIXE demonstrated that Si, S, K and Cr concentrations varied significantly between coal mining and reference areas. Enrichment factor values (EF) showed that S, Cr and Cu were highly enriched in the coal mining areas. Compared to reference area, mining regions had also higher concentrations of extractable organic matter (EOM) related to nonpolar and polar compounds. Our results demonstrate that PM2.5 fraction represents the most important health risk for residents living near open-pit mines, underscoring the need for incorporation of ambient air standards based on PM2.5 measures in coal mining areas.","The authors gratefully wish to acknowledge the support of the national board of SINTRACARBON for logistic cooperation during the sampling period, to CORPOGUAJIRA and its evaluation, control and environmental monitoring group for the valuable technical and logistic cooperation.

4361,pub.1099647188,10.1016/j.cptl.2017.11.015,29764630,,Faculty motivations to use active learning among pharmacy educators,"INTRODUCTION: Faculty motivations to use active learning have been limited to surveys evaluating faculty perceptions within active learning studies. Our objective in this study was to evaluate the relationship between faculty intrinsic motivation, extrinsic motivation, and demographic variables and the extent of active learning use in the classroom.
METHODS: An online survey was administered to individual faculty members at 137 colleges and schools of pharmacy across the United States. The survey assessed intrinsic and extrinsic motivations, active learning strategies, classroom time dedicated to active learning, and faculty development resources. Bivariate associations and multivariable stepwise linear regression were used to analyze the results.
RESULTS: In total, 979 faculty members completed the questionnaire (23.6% response rate). All motivation variables were significantly correlated with percent active learning use (p < 0.001). Intrinsic motivation demonstrated the highest correlation (r = 0.447) followed by current extrinsic motivations (r = 0.245) and ideal extrinsic motivations (r = 0.291). Variables associated with higher intrinsic motivation included the number of resources used (r = 0.233, p < 0.001) and the number of active learning methods used in the last year (r = 0.259, p < 0.001). Years of teaching experience was negatively associated with intrinsic motivation (r = -0.177, p < 0.001). Regression analyses confirmed the importance of intrinsic and extrinsic motivations in predicting active learning use.
DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that faculty members who are intrinsically motivated to use active learning are more likely to dedicate additional class time to active learning. Furthermore, intrinsic motivation may be positively associated with encouraging faculty members to attend active learning workshops and supporting faculty to use various active learning strategies in the classroom.","The authors wish to thank the following student pharmacists for their contributions to the study involving survey phone calls: Brentney Fields, Razan Khan, and Roubir Moawad.",This work was supported by Marshall University School of Pharmacy Faculty Research Support Program.,Currents in Pharmacy Teaching and Learning,,,"Curriculum; Education, Pharmacy; Faculty, Pharmacy; Female; Humans; Male; Motivation; Schools, Pharmacy; Surveys and Questionnaires; Universities",2017-12-12,2017,2017-12-12,2018-03,10,3,277-284,Closed,Article,"Rockich-Winston, Nicole; Train, Brian C.; Rudolph, Michael J.; Gillette, Chris","Rockich-Winston, Nicole (Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Medical College of Georgia at Augusta University, 1120 15th Street, Augusta, GA 30912, United States); Train, Brian C.

To date, there are no known studies in Colombia that investigate risk factors related to suicidal behavior in a male homosexual population.
OBJECTIVE: The objective of the present study is to investigate the risk factors for suicidal ideation in young men living in Bogota (Colombia) who self-identify as homosexuals.
METHODS: 175 males between 14 and 27 (19.02±2.0) years completed two tests, one for suicidal thoughts and one for internalized homophobia (IH). The snowball non-probability sampling technique was used.
RESULTS: 18.4% reported low suicidal ideation, 24.6% a moderate level and 24% declared a high level of suicidal thoughts. IH scores ranged between the expected minimum and maximum (9-45) (21.54±7). Being sexually abused was the main factor associated with suicidal ideation (OR=4.02; 95%CI, 1.51-10.67; P=0.005). Adolescents were 3 times more at risk of suicidal thoughts than young adults (OR=3.63; 95%CI, 1.35-9.76; P=0.010). High IH scores were twice as likely to experience suicidal thoughts as those with low IH (OR=2.11; 95%CI, 1.22-3.67; P=0.008).

In this regard, fetal membranes have been proposed as a powerful source for obtainment of multipotent stem cells with low immunogenicity, anti-inflammatory properties and nontumorigenicity properties for the treatment of several diseases, including replacing cells lost due to tissue injuries or degenerative diseases. Morpho-physiological data have shown that fetal membranes, especially the yolk sac and amnion play different functions according to the gestational period, which are direct related to the features of the microenvironment that their cells are subject. The characteristics of the microenvironment affect or controls important cellular events involved with proliferation, division and maintenance of the undifferentiated stage or differentiation, especially acting on the extracellular matrix components. Considering the importance of the microenvironment and the diversity of embryonic and fetal membrane-derived stem cells, this chapter will addressed advances in the isolation, phenotyping, characteristics of the microenvironment, and applications of yolk sac and amniotic membrane-derived stem cells for human and veterinary regenerative medicine.","The authors thank the several members from the School of Veterinary Medicine and Animal Science, University of Sao Paulo-USP, for collaboration and technical assistance.",,Advances in Experimental Medicine and Biology,Stem Cell Microenvironments and Beyond,Alexander Birbrair,Amnion; Cell Differentiation; Cell- and Tissue-Based Therapy; Extraembryonic Membranes; Humans; Multipotent Stem Cells; Regenerative Medicine; Stem Cell Niche; Stem Cells; Tissue Engineering,2017-12-05,2017,2017-12-05,2017,1041,,235-244,Closed,Chapter,"Favaron, Phelipe Oliveira; Miglino, Maria Angelica","Favaron, Phelipe Oliveira (Surgery Department, School of Veterinary Medicine and Animal Science, University of Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil); Miglino, Maria Angelica (Surgery Department, School of Veterinary Medicine and Animal Science, University of Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil)","Miglino, Maria Angelica (Universidade de São Paulo)","Favaron, Phelipe Oliveira (Universidade de São Paulo); Miglino, Maria Angelica (Universidade de São Paulo)",2,0,0.1,0.21,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1093154876,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3206 Medical Biotechnology,

Its high mortality and morbidity make it a real clinical challenge.
CASE DESCRIPTION: A 32-year-old woman with a history of relapsing polychondritis, refractory to multiple treatments, with multisystem compromise, imminent risk of death due to severe tracheobronchial damage and difficult ventilatory support, and successful treatment with infliximab.
DISCUSSION AND EVALUATION: Several treatments have been described in the literature, such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, corticosteroids, dapsone, azathioprine, cyclosporine, cyclophosphamide, and methotrexate. However, the cases refractory to conventional therapy may lead to chronicity, irreversibility, and death. As a result, a third-line therapy could improve the prognosis of these patients.
CONCLUSIONS: Biological therapy is a good option for disease control and quality of life improvement. In addition, the physician should consider these treatments to avoid the chronicity and risk of death of these patients.","Acknowledgments Drs.

In response, Morgeson and Humphrey (2006) built the Work Design Questionnaire -WDQ-, an instrument that identifies and measures these dimensions in different work and organizational contexts. This paper presents the instruent's adaptation into Spanish using reliability and validity analysis and drawing on a sample of 1035 Spanish workers who hold various jobs in an array of occupational categories. The total instrument's internal consistency was Cronbach's alpha of .92 and the various scales' reliability ranged from .70 to .96, except for three dimensions. There was initially a difference in the comparative fit of the two versions' factor structures, but the model with 21 work characteristics (motivational -task and knowledge-, social, and work context) showed the highest goodness of fit of the various models tested, confirming previous results from the U.S. version as well as adaptations into other languages and contexts. CFA results indicated goodness of fit of factor configurations corresponding to each of the four major categories of work characteristics, with CFI and TLI around .90, as well as SRMR and RMSEA below .08. Thus it brings to the table a reliable, valid measure of work design with clear potential applications in research as well as professional practice, applications that could improve working conditions, boost productivity, and generate more personal and professional development opportunities for workers.",,,The Spanish Journal of Psychology,,,Adult; Employment; Female; Humans; Male; Occupations; Psychometrics; Reproducibility of Results; Spain; Surveys and Questionnaires,2017-06-09,2017,2017-06-09,2017,20,,e28,Closed,Article,"Ríos, Manuel Fernández; Vielma, Raúl G.

In this article, we describe the difficulties of implementing the program in two poor areas of Lima (Peru) between 2014 and 2016. Specifically, we discuss three ethical challenges faced during the implementation of the program: (a) the existence of a movement of working children that defends the right of children to work; (b) the polarization of some community-based associations and government institutions on how to deal with the problems of working children; and (c) the use of network indicators in the evaluation of the community's level of cohesion. Taking the Code of Ethics of the General Council of Associations of Psychologists in Spain as a guide, we adopted a consensus approach in planning and research design, combining different criteria of value with the participation of different stakeholders. The implementation of the program in Peru gave preference to developing skills in children over changing attitudes in relation to child protection, although the intervention openly declared its aims when engaging institutions and families. Finally, we address how social network research places special ethical demands on conventional ethical standards. Our experience with this project shows the importance of acting as a bridge between different stakeholders and assessing how all of them benefit from the intervention.","This article is based on a project for child labor prevention that was funded by the International Center of the University of Seville.

Our experimental design was composed by two randomized groups: Infected Group (IG) (n = 12) and control group (CG) (n = 6). Ninety-six hours after the inoculation, the presence of immunoglobulins (IgG and IgM) and complement C3 levels, related to erythrocytes and platelets, was assessed. Platelet's microparticles marked by CD61, reticulocytes and reticulated platelets were also quantified. Additionally, fibrinogen, prothrombin time, partially activated thromboplastin time and sera levels of IgG and IgM were assessed. Our results showed that levels of platelet decreased in IG (P < 0.001); as well as, there was presence of IgG and C3 associated with erythrocyte surface in the infected animals (P < 0.01, P < 0.05, respectively). Levels of prothrombin time and Activated Partial Thromboplastin Time were increased, while fibrinogen level was decreased (P < 0.01) in IG. CD61 microparticles were higher (P < 0.05) in IG due to platelet activation. Thus, it was established a positive correlation (P < 0.01) between platelets count and fibrinogen (Figure 3, R = 0.84, P < 0.001).

The majority of these students were nursing, exercise science/physical education and biology majors. With a student survey (student opinion) and student practicum grades as metrics, this study determined whether the introduction of this novel mobile technology improved student grades and aided the students in learning the course material. The results indicated that students' grades improved with the introduction of the iPads, and 78% of the students reported that the iPads facilitated their ability to learn the course material. There was a positive association between frequency of app use and standardized mastery of the course material, as students who used the apps more frequently scored higher and indicated that they felt as though they had learned the material more comprehensively. Owning or having an iPad at home did not have a significant effect on the learning of the material. The general consensus by students was that iPad anatomy apps should be used frequently to better develop student understanding of the course material.

Materials and methods The association of pleuropulmonary manifestations with demographic and clinical features, the predictive factors of their occurrence and their impact on mortality were examined in GLADEL patients by appropriate univariable and multivariable analyses. Results At least one pleuropulmonary manifestation occurred in 421 of the 1480 SLE patients (28.4%), pleurisy being the most frequent (24.0%). Age at SLE onset ≥30 years (OR 1.42; 95% CI 1.10-1.83), the presence of lower respiratory tract infection (OR 3.19; 95% CI 2.05-4.96), non-ischemic heart disease (OR 3.17; 95% CI 2.41-4.18), ischemic heart disease (OR 3.39; 95% CI 2.08-5.54), systemic (OR 2.00; 95% CI 1.37-2.91), ocular (OR 1.58; 95% CI 1.16-2.14) and renal manifestations (OR 1.44; 95% CI 1.09-1.83) were associated with pleuropulmonary manifestations, whereas cutaneous manifestations were negatively associated (OR 0.47; 95% CI 0.29-0.76). Non-ischemic heart disease (HR 2.24; 95% CI 1.63-3.09), SDI scores ≥1 (OR 1.54; 95% CI 1.10-2.17) and anti-La antibody positivity (OR 2.51; 95% CI 1.39-4.57) independently predicted their subsequent occurrence. Cutaneous manifestations were protective of the subsequent occurrence of pleuropulmonary manifestations (HR 0.62; 95% CI 0.43-0.90). Pleuropulmonary manifestations independently contributed a decreased survival (HR: 2.79 95% CI 1.80-4.31). Conclusion Pleuropulmonary manifestations are frequent in SLE, particularly pleuritis. Older age, respiratory tract infection, cardiac, systemic and renal involvement were associated with them, whereas cutaneous manifestations were negatively associated. Cardiac compromise, SDI scores ≥1 and anti-La positivity at disease onset were predictive of their subsequent occurrence, whereas cutaneous manifestations were protective. They independently contributed to a decreased survival in these patients.","We are grateful to Daniel Villalba and Leonardo Grasso for providing expert assistance with the ARTHROS (version 6.0) software.

First, previous studies on the factors that affect QoL of displaced persons including, inter alia, individual factors, traumatic events, situations of escape, and the adaptation of the refugee to host communities and new places of residence are reviewed. Second, the results of three studies carried out in the Atlantic Department (Northern Colombia) are summarized, with quantitative and qualitative data on the process of restoration and adaptation of displaced communities. The first study analyzes the impact of political violence on mental health and social networks on 49 displaced and 50 not displaced young people living in Barranquilla (Palacio and Sabatier in Impacto psicológico de la violencia política en las familias: Salud mental y redes sociales en los desplazados. Ediciones Uninorte, Barranquilla, 2002). The second study explores the social identity construction of families displaced by collective violence that participated in a project of self-construction of housing for food in urban area of Cartagena (Revivir de los Campanos). In this project, which promoted social integration, 100 displaced families worked together to build their own homes. These families were supported both by different governmental institutions and nongovernmental organizations (Correa et al. in Desplazamiento interno forzado, restablecimiento urbano e identidad social. Ediciones Uninorte, Barranquilla, 2009). The third study analyzes the relationship between social networks and QoL of 19 individuals displaced by violence (Palacio and Madariaga in Investigación y Desarrollo 14(1): 86–119, 2006) that live in a suburb of Barranquilla (Pinar del Río). In the conclusion section two main issues are discussed: the dilemma for the restoration and reconstruction of a new life plan (between returning to the place of origin or resettling in a host community), and the need to integrate displaced persons and demobilized armed, with host communities.","The studies were supported by Ecos Nord—France Gouvernement, Colciencias (1215-10-12502) and Universidad del Norte.",,Community Quality-of-Life and Well-Being,Quality of Life in Communities of Latin Countries,Graciela Tonon,,2017-03-12,2017,2017-03-12,2017,,,167-184,Closed,Chapter,"Palacio, Jorge; Maya-Jariego, Isidro; Blanco, Amalio; Amar, José; Sabatier, Colette","Palacio, Jorge (Psychology Department, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); Maya-Jariego, Isidro (Social Psychology Department, Universidad de Sevilla, Seville, Spain); Blanco, Amalio (Department of Social Psychology and Methodology, Faculty of Psychology, Universidad Autónoma de Madrid, Madrid, Spain); Amar, José (Psychology Department, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); Sabatier, Colette (Psychology Laboratory, University of Bordeaux, Bordeaux, France)","Palacio, Jorge (Universidad del Norte)","Palacio, Jorge (Universidad del Norte); Maya-Jariego, Isidro (University of Seville); Blanco, Amalio (Autonomous University of Madrid); Amar, José (Universidad del Norte); Sabatier, Colette (University of Bordeaux)",2,0,,0.52,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1084733556,44 Human Society; 4406 Human Geography,"16 Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions; 3 Good Health and Well Being"

METHODS: Using two semi-structured Web questionnaires, we asked six rehabilitation specialists and six software developers to provide us with their perception regarding the level of importance and the usability of the ontology. From their responses we have identified themes related to perceived and required safety characteristics of the ontology.
RESULTS: Significant differences in the importance level were obtained for the Stroke Disability, VE Configuration, Outcome Measures, and Safety Calibration classes, which were perceived as highly important by rehabilitation specialists. Regarding usability, the ontology was perceived by both groups with high usefulness, ease of use, learnability and intention of use. Concerning the thematic analysis of recommendations, eight topics for safety characteristics of the ontology were identified: adjustment of therapy strategies; selection and delimitation of movements; selection and proper calibration of the interaction device; proper selection of measuring instruments; gradual modification of the difficulty of the exercise; adaptability and variability of therapy exercises; feedback according to the capabilities of the patient; and real-time support for exercise training.
CONCLUSIONS: The rehabilitation specialists and software developers confirmed the importance of the information contained in the ontology regarding motor rehabilitation of the upper limb.

3201,pub.1084430280,10.3233/jad-160940,28304290,,The Efficacy of Emotion Recognition Rehabilitation for People with Alzheimer’s Disease,"BACKGROUND: The ability to recognize emotional expression is essential for social interactions, adapting to the environment, and quality of life. Emotion recognition is impaired in people with Alzheimer's disease (AD), thus rehabilitation of these skills has the potential to elicit significant benefits.
OBJECTIVE: This study sought to establish whether emotion recognition capacity could be rehabilitated in people with AD.
METHODS: Thirty-six participants with AD were assigned to one of three conditions: an experimental group (EG) that received 20 sessions of rehabilitation of emotion recognition and 20 sessions of cognitive stimulation therapy (CST), a control group (CG) that received 40 sessions of CST, and a treatment as usual group (TAU).
RESULTS: A positive treatment effect favoring the EG was found; participants were better able to correctly identify emotions (p = 0.021), made fewer errors of commission (p = 0.002), had greater precision of processing (p = 0.021), and faster processing speed (p = 0.001). Specifically, the EG were better able to identify sadness (p = 0.016), disgust (p = 0.005), and the neutral expression (p = 0.014), with quicker processing speed for disgust (p = 0.002). These gains were maintained at one month follow-up with the exception of processing speed for surprise, which improved.
CONCLUSION: Capacity to recognize facial expressions of emotions can be improved through specific rehabilitation in people with AD, and gains are still present at a one month follow up. These findings have implications for the design of rehabilitation techniques for people with AD that may lead to improved quality of life and social interactions for this population.",,,Journal of Alzheimer's Disease,,,"Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Alzheimer Disease; Cognitive Behavioral Therapy; Depression; Emotions; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Male; Mental Status Schedule; Neuropsychological Tests; Outcome Assessment, Health Care; Recognition, Psychology; Single-Blind Method; Statistics, Nonparametric",2017,2017,,2017,Preprint,Preprint,1-15,Closed,Article,"García-Casal, J Antonio; Goñi-Imizcoz, Miguel; Perea-Bartolomé, M Victoria; Soto-Pérez, Felipe; Smith, Sarah Jane; Calvo-Simal, Sara; Franco-Martín, Manuel","García-Casal, J Antonio (University of Salamanca, Salamanca, Spain.; Department of Research and Development, Iberian Research Psycho-sciences Institute, INTRAS Foundation, Zamora, Spain.); Goñi-Imizcoz, Miguel (Department of Neurology, Burgos University Hospital, Spain.); Perea-Bartolomé, M Victoria (University of Salamanca, Salamanca, Spain.); Soto-Pérez, Felipe (Department of Research and Development, Iberian Research Psycho-sciences Institute, INTRAS Foundation, Zamora, Spain.); Smith, Sarah Jane (School of Dementia Studies, University of Bradford, UK.); Calvo-Simal, Sara (Department of Research, Burgos University Hospital, Spain.); Franco-Martín, Manuel (University of Salamanca, Salamanca, Spain.; Department of Psychiatry and Mental Health, Zamora Regional Hospital, Spain.)",,"García-Casal, J Antonio (University of Salamanca; Department of Research and Development, Iberian Research Psycho-sciences Institute, INTRAS Foundation, Zamora, Spain.); Goñi-Imizcoz, Miguel (University of Burgos); Perea-Bartolomé, M Victoria (University of Salamanca); Soto-Pérez, Felipe (Department of Research and Development, Iberian Research Psycho-sciences Institute, INTRAS Foundation, Zamora, Spain.); Smith, Sarah Jane (University of Bradford); Calvo-Simal, Sara (University of Burgos); Franco-Martín, Manuel (University of Salamanca; Department of Psychiatry and Mental Health, Zamora Regional Hospital, Spain.)",25,6,0.97,5.44,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1084430280,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3202 Clinical Sciences; 3209 Neurosciences; 52 Psychology; 5202 Biological Psychology,3 Good Health and Well Being

METHOD: Quasi-experimental study approach with intervention group. Participants were 62 patients and their caregivers who consulted with a health care institution in the city of Girardot (Colombia). The intervention was carried out for one month, during which, measurements were performed before and after the programme.
RESULTS: Most patients were elderly, diagnosed with diabetes, hypertension or COPD, 35% of them with some degree of dependency. The caregivers were mostly women, between the ages of 35 and 59 years old, domestic caregivers, and responsible for caring for their patients for between 13-24hours a day. At the start of the programme the competency for care was low in both patients and caregivers, after the intervention there was a general increase in care and a statistically significant change. Also, at the beginning, 48% of caregivers had some level of burden, and after the study only 27% reported burden with care.
CONCLUSIONS: The Hospitalisation discharge plan is a strategy that increases the home care competency of the patient and the caregiver, and decreases the caregiver burden.",A los pacientes y sus cuidadores familiares que aceptaron hacer parte de la investigación.

For mechanical systems, one of the challenges during early design stages of these products involves the proper selection of joining methods among their constructive components. A robust joint selection process must consider product requirements, life cycle analysis and eventual procedures for assembly and disassembly. However, the general approach towards a Design-for-Assembly (DFA)/Design-for-Disassembly (DFD) only considers design, manufacturing and in some cases final disposal stage. Additionally, most of the works found in the literature are merely focused on assembly operations, disregarding economic and environmental benefits from optimising disassembly complexity. Herein, a functional characterisation of mechanical joint methods for the assembly and disassembly activities that take place throughout the product life cycle is proposed, focusing on open architecture products. Additionally, a classification of joining methods, a joint complexity metric valuation and a selection process are proposed for the conceptual design stage. The approach integrates both DFA and DFD principles in a formal methodology. The proposed selection roadmap can be implemented to increase product sustainability positively regarding resources optimisation, operational time and costs in reuse, remanufacturing and recycling tasks.",,"This work was financially supported by the Departamento Administrativo de Ciencia, Tecnología e Innovación [National PhD Studies Program 617-2]; Universidad Del Norte and the PhD National Scholarship Colciencias-Uninorte N° 617-2014 [contract identification number UN-OJ-2014-24072] and [contract identification number UN-OJ-2014-26159].",International Journal of Production Research,,,,2017-12-08,2017,2017-12-08,2018-12-17,56,24,7390-7404,Closed,Article,"Mesa, Jaime A.; Illera, Danny; Esparragoza, Iván; Maury, Heriberto; Gómez, Humberto","Mesa, Jaime A.

OBJECTIVE: To characterize the clinical trials related to treatment of metabolic syndrome during the 1980-2015 period.
METHODS: Systematic review of the literature using an ex ante search protocol which followed the phases of the guide Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses in four multidisciplinary databases with seven search strategies. Reproducibility and methodological quality of the studies were assessed.
RESULTS: One hundred and six trials were included, most from the United States, Italy, and Spain, of which 63.2% evaluated interventions effective for several components of the syndrome such as diet (40.6%) or physical activity (22.6%). Other studies assessed drugs for a single factor such as hypertension (7.5%), hypertriglyceridemia (11.3%), or hyperglycemia (9.4%). Placebo was used as control in 54.7% of trials, and outcome measures included triglycerides (52.8%), HDL (48.1%), glucose (29.2%), BMI (33.0%), blood pressure (27.4%), waist circumference (26.4%), glycated hemoglobin (11.3%), and hip circumference (7.5%).
CONCLUSION: It was shown that studies ob efficacy of treatment for metabolic syndrome are scarce and have mainly been conducted in the last five years and in high-income countries. Trials on interventions that affect three or more factors and assess several outcome measures are few, and lifestyle interventions (diet and physical activity) are highlighted as most important to impact on this multifactorial syndrome.",,,Endocrinología Diabetes y Nutrición,,,Anthropometry; Antihypertensive Agents; Clinical Trials as Topic; Combined Modality Therapy; Diet; Europe; Exercise; Hemodynamics; Humans; Hypoglycemic Agents; Hypolipidemic Agents; Life Style; Metabolic Syndrome; Research Design; Retrospective Studies; United States,2017-02-04,2017,2017-02-04,2017-02,64,2,82-91,Closed,Article,"Velásquez, Santiago Cardona; Vivares, Laura Guzmán; Cardona-Arias, Jaiberth Antonio","Velásquez, Santiago Cardona (Grupo de Investigación, Salud y Sostenibilidad, Escuela de Microbiología, Universidad de Antioquia, Medellín, Colombia); Vivares, Laura Guzmán (Grupo de Investigación, Salud y Sostenibilidad, Escuela de Microbiología, Universidad de Antioquia, Medellín, Colombia); Cardona-Arias, Jaiberth Antonio (Escuela de Microbiología, Universidad de Antioquia, Medellín, Colombia; Facultad de Medicina, Universidad Cooperativa de Colombia)","Cardona-Arias, Jaiberth Antonio (University of Antioquia; Cooperative University of Colombia)","Velásquez, Santiago Cardona (University of Antioquia); Vivares, Laura Guzmán (University of Antioquia); Cardona-Arias, Jaiberth Antonio (University of Antioquia; Cooperative University of Colombia)",3,1,0.12,0.68,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1083547458,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3202 Clinical Sciences; 42 Health Sciences; 4206 Public Health,

METHOD: A quasi-experimental study. Evaluation by ad hoc questionnaire (pre and post, and reassessment at 4 months) to all professionals (physicians and nurses) who passed any of the 6 editions of the course: 'Simulation of situations of cardiopulmonary arrest or peri-arrest in hospitalisation units'. Descriptive and inferential statistics.
RESULTS: 133 participants, 16 physicians, and 117 nurses. Before the course started, the level of knowledge was 78.5%, at the end of training it was 94.6% (P<.001), and after 4 months, it was 88% (P<.05). The satisfaction achieved was 91.8% at the end of the course, and subsequently 88.4%; this was significant (P<.05) among the younger professionals, with less experience and with a temporary contract. Eighty one point two percent of the participants expressed that they changed the way they acted during a cardiopulmonary arrest.
CONCLUSIONS: Continuous education in CPA, performed through simulation-debriefing, is consolidated in our field as an effective tool to acquire a suitable level of knowledge that lasts over time. The level of satisfaction achieved was high since this method of learning meets the expectations of the professionals and resembles real care practice.","La autora quiere agradecer la buena predisposición de la Gerencia de Gestión Integrada de Ferrol para llevar a cabo el presente estudio.

2739,pub.1091424746,10.1016/j.rcp.2017.07.003,30651174,,Depresión en el embarazo,"INTRODUCTION: Depression is the most common psychiatric morbidity in pregnancy, affecting more than 13% of pregnant women. Its diagnosis is based on the criteria established by the DSM-5 and the application of validated scales such as the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale. However, there are still errors and shortcomings among healthcare professionals in the recognition, diagnosis and treatment of depression during pregnancy, with the resulting consequences and repercussions on the gestation itself or the foetus.
OBJECTIVE: To present a review of depression in pregnancy, its risk factors, clinical characteristics, complications and treatment.
METHODS: The PubMed and LILACS databases were used to search for manuscripts. Of the 223 articles found, 55 fulfilled the inclusion criteria.
RESULTS: The prevalence of depression in pregnancy in South America is approximately 29% and the most significant risk factors are sexual abuse, pregnancy at an early age and intrafamily violence. Therefore, early diagnosis favours a reduction in risk behaviour, foetal neurodevelopmental disorders and obstetric outcomes.
CONCLUSIONS: Depression in pregnancy is common condition but is underreported as its symptoms are often attributed to the pregnancy itself. The use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor antidepressants, particularly fluoxetine, which has not been associated with teratogenicity, is recommended, in addition to the implementation of non-pharmacological treatment such as psychotherapy, mindfulness and aerobic exercise. Educating healthcare professionals will facilitate the correct diagnosis and treatment of this condition.",,,Revista Colombiana de Psiquiatría (English ed ),,,Depression; Female; Fluoxetine; Humans; Pregnancy; Pregnancy Complications; Prevalence; Psychiatric Status Rating Scales; Risk Factors; Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors,2017-09-03,2017,2017-09-03,2019-01,48,1,58-65,Closed,Article,"Martínez-Paredes, Jhon Freddy; Jácome-Pérez, Nathalia","Martínez-Paredes, Jhon Freddy (Universidad Industrial de Santander, Bucaramanga, Colombia); Jácome-Pérez, Nathalia (Escuela de Medicina, Facultad de Salud, Universidad Industrial de Santander, Bucaramanga, Colombia; Editor Revista Médicas UIS, Bucaramanga, Colombia)","Jácome-Pérez, Nathalia (Industrial University of Santander; Industrial University of Santander)","Martínez-Paredes, Jhon Freddy (Industrial University of Santander); Jácome-Pérez, Nathalia (Industrial University of Santander; Industrial University of Santander)",27,10,2.03,8.55,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1091424746,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3202 Clinical Sciences; 42 Health Sciences; 4204 Midwifery,3 Good Health and Well Being

In this force field each ion has a fixed partial charge and a fixed polarizability and the potential energy is minimised with respect to the ions’ dipole moments at each step of molecular dynamics by iterating them to self-consistency. The potential parameters are obtained by fitting to forces, stresses and energies calculated by density functional theory. The phase transition from perovskite to post-perovskite is predicted to take place at a pressure of 60GPa at zero temperature. The potential reproduces well structural and thermodynamic properties as well as defects formation in a wide range of pressures, and therefore will be useful for the investigation of MgSiO3 based materials in a geophysical context.","AcknowledgmentsCP and NS acknowledge financial support by the European Commission under the EU-FP7-NMP grant 229205 “ADGLASS”.

Una revisión narrativa,"The prescribing of Lithium is common in psychiatric clinical practice. The aim of this study was to identify the most common endocrine side effects associated with this drug and to clarify the pathophysiological basis. A systematic review was conducted in Psycinfo, Embase, PubMed, and Scopus. A computerised search for information was performed using a PICO (patient, intervention, comparative, outcomes) strategy. The main neuroendocrine alterations were reported in kidneys, thyroid and parathyroid glands, pancreas, and the communication pathways between the pituitary and adrenal glands. The pathophysiological mechanisms are diverse, and include the inhibition of the thyroid adenylate cyclase sensitive to the thyroid stimulant hormone (TSH) sensitive adenylate cyclase, which causes hypothyroidism. It also reduces the expression of aquaporin type 2, which is associated with nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, and the loss of the ionic balance of calcium that induces hyperparathyroidism and hypercalcaemia. Other considerations are related to alterations in the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and a decrease in the production of catecholamines. Finally, another side-effect is the glycaemic dysregulation caused by the insulin resistance. Periodical clinical and para-clinical evaluations are necessary. The author proposes an evaluation scheme.","Al Dr. Ricardo Salas Flores Médico-Endocrinólogo del Hospital Regional N.o 6 del Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social en Cd.

The international negotiations presented complexities of various kinds and resulted in an asymmetrical situation between Paraguay and the partner countries (Argentina and Brazil) of hydropower plants (ITAIPU and YACYRETA). The negotiations continued during the construction and operation of the power plants, seeking, at first, to improve the positions of the country that was initially more vulnerable in the negotiations and, above all, making these large projects that implemented state of the art technologies for hydroelectric plants and electrical transmission viable. The systematization of experiences in the negotiations can be used to advance with the regional electrical integration, given that there is still a high hydroelectric potential to be harnessed in the great Rio de la Plata Basin. This potential is shared by countries of the basin and its optimal use may be the basis of a significant integration of national power systems and markets. Thus, the main objective of this project is to systematize the lessons learned in international negotiation processes, with a view to providing elements for future decision making in the area of regional integration processes and initiatives. Methods of geopolitical analysis and techniques of identification and organization of lessons learned were applied to meet the mentioned objective. The results show that the lessons learned can be classified into: i) strategic decision making; ii) strategy planning; iii) strategy implementation; iv) strategy and result monitoring and evaluation; and v) communications and social participation.

In this regard, cellulose nanocrystals (CN), which are needle-shaped nanostructure derived from cellulose-rich resources, are extracted by sulfuric acid hydrolysis of biomass and used as both template and binder for the construction of electrochemical capacitors electrodes. A composite material is synthetized comprising CN and a conjugated electroactive polymer (CEP) to overcome the electrical insulating properties of cellulose as well as to exploit enhanced electrochemical activity by increased electrode surface-area. A one-step in-situ film synthesis protocol is evaluated by performing simultaneous polymerization and film deposition. The effect of proportion of starting components are evaluated through statistical Response Surface Methodology towards optimizing the electrochemical performance. Depending on the mass proportion of the starting components, a conducting network could be created by surface coating of the CEP on the whiskers during polymerization. Electrochemical measurements suggest an increase in specific surface area by at least a factor of two relative to bare CEP as a consequence of the template role of cellulose. Therefore, adjustment of the proposed one-step synthesis parameters allows tuning the material properties to meet specific application requirements regarding electrochemical performance.Copyright © 2017 by ASME",,,,Volume 14: Emerging Technologies; Materials: Genetics to Structures; Safety Engineering and Risk Analysis,,,2017-11-03,2017,2018-01-10,2017-11-03,,,v014t11a032-v014t11a032,Closed,Proceeding,"Illera, Danny; Fontalvo, Victor; Gomez, Humberto","Illera, Danny (Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); Fontalvo, Victor (Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); Gomez, Humberto (Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia)",,"Illera, Danny (Universidad del Norte); Fontalvo, Victor (Universidad del Norte); Gomez, Humberto (Universidad del Norte)",0,0,,0.0,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1100300878,34 Chemical Sciences; 3403 Macromolecular and Materials Chemistry; 3406 Physical Chemistry; 40 Engineering; 4016 Materials Engineering,7 Affordable and Clean Energy

Current users of mobile apps are normally sharing their location which is being stored by the service providers, either for internal use, to be sold later to third party companies, or to be released for public use as open data. The last two uses require the data to be stripped of information of individuals so it cannot allow identification; however, if the location is not altered sufficiently, it still could be used to find a single person. In the literature there are many location privacy protection mechanisms - LPPMs, usually expected to be applied on real time over the location information. This work introduces VoKA, a, offline privacy protection technique that focuses at the moment in which the data is released outside a protected environment, proposing a new aggregation mechanism based on Voronoi diagrams and K anonymity that preserves geographical value of the data like density and geographical distribution. The study uses Twitter data from the Lombardia area of Italy, and compares unaltered data, obfuscated data, grid-based aggregation and VoKA. Results show that VoKA can aggregate data in a more organic manner than grid-based data, and reduces the possibility to identify individuals compared to simple location obfuscation, in geostatistical analysis techniques like entropy and heatmap.",This work is partly founded by Universidad del Norte and the program Sustain-T - Technologies for Sustainable Development from Erasmus Mundus Programme.

That is why process control is one of the main fields to ensure a successful operation. This paper presents the development of an industrial scale drying rate prediction model. The model includes on his structure mass balance equations, drying rate and bulk density equation and an experimental expression that estimates the rate of change in moisture as a function of the dry basis kernel water fraction, Sherwood number, mass transfer Biot number and a proposed non-dimensional temperature -Nt-. The importance of including -Nt- parameter is based on the thermal gradients between the drying air, internal kernel water and the installation environmental conditions. These factors create a distinctive characteristic from other drying rate prediction models because they associate the process with environmental conditions of the location where drying operation takes place.Copyright © 2017 by ASME",,,,Volume 8: Heat Transfer and Thermal Engineering,,,2017-11-03,2017,2018-01-10,2017-11-03,,,v008t10a059-v008t10a059,Closed,Proceeding,"Aldana, Andrés; Guillen, Diego; Bula, Antonio; Sanjuan, Marco","Aldana, Andrés (Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); Guillen, Diego (Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); Bula, Antonio (Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); Sanjuan, Marco (Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia)",,"Aldana, Andrés (Universidad del Norte); Guillen, Diego (Universidad del Norte); Bula, Antonio (Universidad del Norte); Sanjuan, Marco (Universidad del Norte)",0,0,,0.0,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1100300917,40 Engineering; 4004 Chemical Engineering,

This work presents a CFD Multiphysics simulation of a PEM Fuel Cell under different operational conditions in their inlet streams. The simulation was done by using COMSOL Multiphysics® software, and it takes into account the mass transfer of gases in the channels, the porous media and the electrochemistry from reactions in a 5 cm2 active area. From the electrochemical perspective, the relationship between the charge transfer and the overpotentials are taken into account by kinetic expressions. In addition, the ohm’s law is applied in conjunction with the charge transfer to describe the conduction of current in the electrodes and electrolytes. Gas diffusion layers (GDL) along with the catalyst layers are modeled as porous media restricting the electrochemical reaction. As the result of different simulation scenarios representing different operational conditions, the characteristic Polarization Curve of the fuel cell, the dependence between the voltage in the cell, and the demanded current by the load are obtained. A reduction in the electrical potential was evidenced due to the reaction activation potential, the ohmic losses due to the electrical resistance of the materials and the concentration losses as a result of deficiencies in the diffusion of the reactants through the porous medium. Currents distributions and water content are analyzed in order to understand the role of temperature, load, and humidity over the fuel cell performance.Copyright © 2017 by ASME",,,,Volume 6: Energy,,,2017-11-03,2017,2018-01-10,2017-11-03,,,v006t08a067-v006t08a067,Closed,Proceeding,"Fontalvo, Victor; Illera, Danny; Gómez, Humberto; Sanjuan, Marco","Fontalvo, Victor (Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); Illera, Danny (Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); Gómez, Humberto (Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); Sanjuan, Marco (Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia)",,"Fontalvo, Victor (Universidad del Norte); Illera, Danny (Universidad del Norte); Gómez, Humberto (Universidad del Norte); Sanjuan, Marco (Universidad del Norte)",2,1,,0.23,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1100301104,34 Chemical Sciences; 3403 Macromolecular and Materials Chemistry; 40 Engineering,

It requires low error levels in order to reach reliability in electrical analysis. However, the demand for energy has dissimilar profiles variations depending on the type of day, weather conditions and geographical area. For this reason, it is necessary to group those curves showing similar behaviors and characterize them to establish which factors are significant for understanding.

The system is divided into four components: (i) measuring equipment with rainfall and flow rate gauges, datalogging and transmission, (ii) a system for database processing and a web interface, (iii) a numerical rainfall-runoff model in PCSWMM calibrated and validated, and (iv) a reactive early warning model for determining the hazard level, and for making decisions of alertness along the main streets. Twelve (12) rainfall gauges were installed in the city, covering around 150 Km2. The numerical model in PCSWMM was calibrated and validated with rainfall and flow rate data measured in a typical subcatchment of the city. A time of concentration equation was developed from the characteristics of the subcatchment such as slope and length. A pilot urban watershed was selected to test the system, from which hazard alerts every minute with forecasting of up to 40 minutes ahead on the lower parts of the watershed were determined. That time may allow people to make prompt decisions regarding their mobility over the city and reducing accidents caused by flash floods.",,,,World Environmental and Water Resources Congress 2017,,,2017-05-18,2017,2017-05-18,2017-05-18,,,372-382,Closed,Proceeding,"Avila, Leandro; Ávila, Humberto; Sisa, Augusto","Avila, Leandro (Civil Engineer, Instituto de Estudios Hidráulicos y Ambientales – IDEHA, Universidad del Norte, Colombia, .

To reduce energy consumption, it is important to take into account buildings occupants' behavior into account. The difference between simulated, estimated and real power consumption in buildings reflects the need to search for more accurate ways to receive input from the users to better design energy saving policies. This paper presents then an energy saving process that, starting with a survey, classifies users by their job position. Based on the users' behavior, the process tunes the predefined profiles to achieve higher levels of savings without annoying them. We implemented part of the proposed process and statistically verified the existence of profiles, which in the future can be used to create personalized energy saving strategies and mechanisms.

As the Internet of Things emerges many links will be NLOS. However, network protocols are often only evaluated using Line-of-Sight radio channels. Previous simulations of the MACGSP6 (Medium Access Control for Gossip-based Sleep Protocol Version 6) protocol demonstrate packet reception rates exceed 90% for networks of more than 1000 nodes with Line-of-Sight conditions. This paper measures the performance of MACGSP6 using a prototype testbed where all links are NLOS. Results demonstrate that MACGSP6 achieved better Average Packet Loss, Average Duplicate Packets and energy consumption than a controlled flooding protocol. Additionally, MACGSP6 made all degraded paths from nodes to sink appear as one ideal hop to the application layer. Therefore, MACGSP6 is an energy and data efficient protocol for Internet of Things networks which include NLOS links.","AcknowledgmentsThis work was funded by Direction of Research, Development and Innovation (DIDI) at Universidad del Norte through Call for Grants.",,Computers & Electrical Engineering,,,,2017-02,2017,,2017-02,58,,76-87,Closed,Article,"Calle, Maria; Berdugo, Geovanni; Velez, Juan C.; Kabara, Joseph","Calle, Maria (Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Atlantico, Colombia); Berdugo, Geovanni (Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Atlantico, Colombia); Velez, Juan C.

In this work, a review of the typical defectology found in gas transport steel pipeline systems is described. As part of the review, the current status of technologies and techniques implemented for the repair and rehabilitation of pipes in the Oil & Gas industry is presented. Based upon the available solutions, a revision is proposed from the regulations and standards which define the implementation of these type of solutions for the natural gas transport pipelines. A comparative summary that includes mechanized or induced defects on pipes for further study and performance measurement of the implemented solutions is presented. Decision factors to be considered in the selection process are displayed according to a particular gas transportation operator’s requirements and general criteria. These factors take into account the required considerations with respect to the pipe material, effect on environments, skill requirements for installation, the in-service installation capability, and the final selected method.Copyright © 2017 by ASME",,,,Volume 14: Emerging Technologies; Materials: Genetics to Structures; Safety Engineering and Risk Analysis,,,2017-11-03,2017,2018-01-10,2017-11-03,,,v014t14a012-v014t14a012,Closed,Proceeding,"Sanchez, Abraham; Ojeda, Marianella; Gomez, Humberto; Bermejo, Carlos; Medina, Victor; Escorcia, Orlando; Bris, Jorge; Morelo, Alvaro; Maury, Heriberto; Medina, Julio","Sanchez, Abraham (Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); Ojeda, Marianella (Promigas SA ESP, Barranquilla, Colombia); Gomez, Humberto (Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); Bermejo, Carlos (Promigas SA ESP, Barranquilla, Colombia); Medina, Victor (Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); Escorcia, Orlando (Promigas SA ESP, Barranquilla, Colombia); Bris, Jorge (Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); Morelo, Alvaro (Promigas SA ESP, Barranquilla, Colombia); Maury, Heriberto (Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); Medina, Julio (Promigas SA ESP, Barranquilla, Colombia)",,"Sanchez, Abraham (Universidad del Norte); Ojeda, Marianella (Promigas SA ESP, Barranquilla, Colombia); Gomez, Humberto (Universidad del Norte); Bermejo, Carlos (Promigas SA ESP, Barranquilla, Colombia); Medina, Victor (Universidad del Norte); Escorcia, Orlando (Promigas SA ESP, Barranquilla, Colombia); Bris, Jorge (Universidad del Norte); Morelo, Alvaro (Promigas SA ESP, Barranquilla, Colombia); Maury, Heriberto (Universidad del Norte); Medina, Julio (Promigas SA ESP, Barranquilla, Colombia)",2,0,,0.39,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1100300900,40 Engineering; 4005 Civil Engineering,

Such tool would allow to find the most suitable algorithm for a predefined scenario without performing time consuming tests or simulations. The work here is a first approximation to develop the proposed tool, in order to validate the suitability of our approach we choose simple and well-known exploration algorithms and scenarios, but in the future we plan to expand to state-of-the-art algorithms and complex scenarios. A Machine Learning system using supervised learning is proposed as a practical method to predict the desired evaluation metric, such estimation will be used for algorithm comparison instead of the conventional method of performing tests or simulations. Other estimation methods, such as a multivariate regression model and approximation to probability distribution functions, are cumbersome and usually require performing additional experiments to gather further data. For testing and evaluation, we use two sample exploration algorithms based on the principle of two-dimensional random walk and a exploration scenario based on a bi-dimensional rectangular grid.",,,,2017 IEEE 3rd Colombian Conference on Automatic Control (CCAC),,,2017-10-01,2017,,2017-10-01,,,1-6,Closed,Proceeding,"Caballero, L.; Benavides, C.; Percybrooks, W.","Caballero, L.

The proposed implementation works as follows: each model component is surrounded by a local box of radius size r and then, local assimilation steps are carried out in parallel at the different local boxes. Once local analyses are obtained, they are mapped back onto the global domain from which the global analysis state is obtained. Local background error correlations are estimated using the Rao–Blackwell Ledoit and Wolf estimator in order to mitigate the impact of spurious correlations whenever the number of local model components is larger than the ensemble size. The numerical atmospheric general circulation model (SPEEDY) is utilized for the numerical experiments with the T-63 resolution on the BlueRidge cluster at Virginia Tech. The number of processors ranges from 96 to 2048. The proposed implementation outperforms in terms of accuracy the well-known local ensemble transform Kalman filter (LETKF) for all the model variables. The computational time of the proposed implementation is similar to that of the parallel LETKF method (where no covariance estimation is performed) for the largest number of processors.","This work was supported in part by awards NSF CCF-1218454, AFOSR FA9550-12-1-0293-DEF, and by the Computational Science Laboratory at Virginia Tech.",,Cluster Computing,,,,2017-11-24,2017,2017-11-24,2019-01,22,Suppl 1,2211-2221,Closed,Article,"Nino-Ruiz, Elias D.; Sandu, Adrian","Nino-Ruiz, Elias D.

Shielding failure is an important issue in addressing the lightning performance of overhead transmission lines. In this paper an improved method based on the electro-geometric model is proposed to evaluate the shielding failure flashover rate (SFFOR) of transmission lines, considering the influences of landform, lightning polarity and stroke angle. In the improved method, the striking distances to phase conductors, shield wires and ground are properly differentiated by using recent equations developed to take into account other factors not only magnitude of lightning strokes. These factors include height of wires as well as lightning polarity. To reflect the effects of changes in terrain and height of wires on SFFOR, a method for identifying the topography and the relative position among the wires and ground is proposed. A 400-kV double-circuit transmission line section in complex terrain area was taken as example, and the results show that this method can reflect changes of the SFFOR along the span and can be useful to figure out which towers are easy to be struck by lightning along the entire transmission line.

One of the issues that needs careful attention is the heat flux distribution over the central receiver’s surface. It is imperative to maintain receiver’s thermal stresses below the material limits. Therefore, an adequate aiming strategy for each mirror is crucial. Due to the large number of mirrors present in a solar field, most aiming strategies work using a data base that establishes an aiming point for each mirror depending on the relative position of the sun and heat flux models. This paper proposes a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) closed control loop based on a methodology that allows using conventional control strategies such as those based on Proportional Integral Derivative (PID) controllers. Results indicate that even this basic control loop can successfully distribute heat flux on the solar receiver.Copyright © 2017 by ASME",,,,ASME 2017 11th International Conference on Energy Sustainability,,,2017-06-26,2017,2017-08-25,2017-06-26,,,v001t05a011-v001t05a011,Closed,Proceeding,"García, Jesús; Too, Yen Chean Soo; Padilla, Ricardo Vasquez; Vicencio, Rodrigo Barraza; Beath, Andrew; Sanjuan, Marco","García, Jesús (Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); Too, Yen Chean Soo (CSIRO Energy Centre, Mayfield West, Australia); Padilla, Ricardo Vasquez (Southern Cross University, Lismore, Australia); Vicencio, Rodrigo Barraza (Universidad Técnica Federico Santa María, Valparaíso, Chile); Beath, Andrew (CSIRO Energy Centre, Mayfield West, Australia); Sanjuan, Marco (Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia)",,"García, Jesús (Universidad del Norte); Too, Yen Chean Soo (CSIRO Energy Centre, Mayfield West, Australia); Padilla, Ricardo Vasquez (Southern Cross University); Vicencio, Rodrigo Barraza (Federico Santa María Technical University); Beath, Andrew (CSIRO Energy Centre, Mayfield West, Australia); Sanjuan, Marco (Universidad del Norte)",8,2,,2.04,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1093015412,40 Engineering; 4010 Engineering Practice and Education,7 Affordable and Clean Energy

This method is based on the evolution of some rheological properties along time such as the viscosity, the Cross-rate constant and the elastic and viscous modulus of the emulsion. Two concentrated asphalt emulsions (70% of asphalt) have been formulated to study their stability using cationic emulsifiers. Results suggest that emulsions viscosity and consequently the Cross-rate constant decrease over time. The rheological behavior of emulsions evolves from shear-thinning to Newtonian as coalescence takes place. Coalescence was verified by the measure of the droplets size distribution against time using a laser light scattering equipment. This parameter evolves during time and reaches values of about 400 and 900% of increase in the emulsions studied. The elastic and viscous modulus of the emulsions tend also to decrease as long as coalescence occurs and were followed-up in time. In our systems, a drop of about 90% has been calculated as soon as emulsions become unstable. Results of this methodology were compared to those of traditional methods used in industry. Finally, the applicability of this test is conditioned to viscoelastic asphalt emulsions. The minimal requirements of asphalt content were found for one of the emulsions. However, the viscoelasticity of the testing emulsion must be the first parameter to be checked out, and this factor depends on many formulation parameters.","AcknowledgementsThe authors express their gratitude to the Universidad del Norte – Colombia, and to the “Es Tiempo de Volver” program fellowship (656) of COLCIENCIAS (Colombia) for the financial support.",,Construction and Building Materials,,,,2017-11,2017,,2017-11,155,,838-845,Closed,Article,"Mercado, Ronald; Fuentes, Luis","Mercado, Ronald (Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Universidad del Norte, km 5 Antigua Via a Puerto Colombia, Barranquilla, Colombia); Fuentes, Luis (Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Universidad del Norte, km 5 Antigua Via a Puerto Colombia, Barranquilla, Colombia)","Mercado, Ronald (Universidad del Norte)","Mercado, Ronald (Universidad del Norte); Fuentes, Luis (Universidad del Norte)",6,0,,0.57,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1091902902,40 Engineering; 4004 Chemical Engineering,

The network is made up of three sensor nodes located at the corners of a right triangle; a fourth node in the vicinity of the array acts as a base station providing connection to a notebook; the acoustic source is assumed to be within the rectangular area defined by the three sensors. To detect the sound wave, an analogue circuit activated by sound intensity was designed to cause a hardware interrupt to the nodes. The localization uses the method of the Time Difference of Arrivals (TDoA) of the sound wave to each node pair to build an equation system with three hyperbolic equations, and whose solution is the estimated location of the acoustic source. The non-linear system is solved using an optimization-based numerical method. Although the time synchronization error of the implemented WSN is below 10 microseconds, which makes TDoA suitable, other uncertainties, such as in the actual sound speed and the presence of breeze, does systematically influence the results. The localization errors found in experiments in open environments were below 4%. Specifically, for a 10mx10m area, the worst case deviations are below 44cm for the 90% of the measurements. Finally, the WSN uses IRIS nodes (2.4GHz) which were programmed with TinyOS, and the localization algorithm was fully implemented in JAVA.",,,,"2017 CHILEAN Conference on Electrical, Electronics Engineering, Information and Communication Technologies (CHILECON)",,,2017-10-01,2017,,2017-10-01,,,1-6,Closed,Proceeding,"Torres-Herrera, Luis; Vasquez-Monroy, Dainer","Torres-Herrera, Luis (DIEE, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); Vasquez-Monroy, Dainer (DIEE, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia)",,"Torres-Herrera, Luis (Universidad del Norte); Vasquez-Monroy, Dainer (Universidad del Norte)",1,0,,0.23,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1099917624,46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4605 Data Management and Data Science; 4606 Distributed Computing and Systems Software,

The case offers a rare opportunity for assessment because the policy application had a scattered spatial and temporal structure but on an urban agglomeration ruled by a single master plan and revenue collecting authority. The analysis reveals that (a) the relationship between value capture and prices is negative (static neutrality); (b) this result holds under various spatial specifications and controls; (c) the policy is not endogenous to the built output or the spatial distribution of the land prices; and (d) there is no evidence of preemption, a theoretical feature where landowners consider that the policy onset represents a regulatory taking, compelling them to accelerate developing timing (dynamic neutrality).","The author would like to thank Professor James Alm, the two anonymous referees, and Dr. Gene Thorley for their revisions and suggestions.",,Public Finance Review,,,,2017-06-29,2017,2017-06-29,2019-05,47,3,603-622,Closed,Article,"Garza, Néstor","Garza, Néstor (Instituto de Estudios Económicos del Caribe, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia)","Garza, Néstor (Universidad del Norte)","Garza, Néstor (Universidad del Norte)",4,2,,1.56,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1090496437,38 Economics; 3801 Applied Economics; 44 Human Society,15 Life on Land

For this reason, we have used an array of ADCP and a pressure sensor to measure wave parameters and pressure inside and outside of the surf zone during the dry and rainy period in the beaches of Galerazamba and Manzanillo del Mar (both dissipative and eroded beaches) located in the Colombian Caribbean coast. Based on these measurements, we have carried out a spectral analysis in order to identify the frequency components that characterize the wave and its energy; thus, we identified the characteristic frequencies of infragravity waves to finally filter the infragravity signal on each beach in different seasonal periods. Among the results of the Welch spectrum applied to surface elevation time series, we found that, the frequencies’ energy of the sea-swell band decreases due to bottom friction and wave breaking as the wave approaches the shore, while the frequencies’ energy of the infragravity band increases significantly. In addition, for the wavelet analysis, we could observe how the energy of the infragravity band, especially the lowest frequencies gain energy as the waves approaches the coast. Furthermore, based on the infragravity wave obtained from the extreme wave event registered during the field campaign we can conclude that the contribution of this signal is important in the erosion problems presented in the beaches of Galerazamba and Manzanillo del Mar. Finally, these results show the need to realize other studies that allow us to understand deeply, the role of infragravity waves on the morphological changes that occurs in these beaches.","The authors thank to the I+D+I Department of the Universidad del Norte, and the reviewers for the suggestions and constructive comments on an earlier draft of this manuscript.",,Acta Oceanologica Sinica,,,,2017-05-04,2017,2017-05-04,2017-05,36,5,31-43,Closed,Article,"Mario, Conde-Frias; Luis, Otero; Juan, Camilo Restrepo; Juan, Carlos Ortíz","Mario, Conde-Frias (Geosciences Research Group GEO4, Department of Physics, Universidad del Norte, 081007, Barranquilla, Colombia); Luis, Otero (Geosciences Research Group GEO4, Department of Physics, Universidad del Norte, 081007, Barranquilla, Colombia); Juan, Camilo Restrepo (Geosciences Research Group GEO4, Department of Physics, Universidad del Norte, 081007, Barranquilla, Colombia); Juan, Carlos Ortíz (Geosciences Research Group GEO4, Department of Physics, Universidad del Norte, 081007, Barranquilla, Colombia)","Mario, Conde-Frias (Universidad del Norte)","Mario, Conde-Frias (Universidad del Norte); Luis, Otero (Universidad del Norte); Juan, Camilo Restrepo (Universidad del Norte); Juan, Carlos Ortíz (Universidad del Norte)",4,1,,0.41,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1085129905,37 Earth Sciences; 3708 Oceanography,

The effect of impurity distances on ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic ground state in Cu0.042Zn0.958O with GGA scheme has been studied, and compared with the available experimental and theoretical data. Results show that Cu0.042Zn0.958O is ferromagnetic for both the closest and farthest impurity distances, but it is more stable for the closest one. The system is nearly half metallic and room temperature ferromagnetism is expected. When two Zn2+ ions are replaced by two Co2+ ions in Cu0.042Zn0.958O with GGA and GGA+U formalisms, both the local magnetic moment in 3d-Cu and energy difference are reduced. This is in good agreement with the experimental observations, where the room temperature ferromagnetism in Cu0.04Zn0.96O is suppressed when it is doped with Co (4%). When the U parameter for 3d-Cu is considered, the ground state for Cu0.042Zn0.958O system remains ferromagnetic. On the other hand, the ferromagnetic ground state found for Co0.042Cu0.042Zn0.916O changes to antiferromagnetic with both GGA and GGA+U schemes. Results with GGA and GGA+U also display a distortion around the impurity-O4 tetrahedron, enhanced antiferromagnetic interaction between CuCu ion and their surrounding atoms, and charge transfer from Co(3d) to Cu(3d) via O(2p) atoms by substitution of Zn2+ by Co2+ in Cu-doped ZnO. As a result, both the local magnetic moment in 3d-Cu and energy difference of CoxCu0.042Zn1−(x+0.042)O system are reduced.","AcknowledgementsThis work has been carried out with the financial support of Universidad del Norte and Colciencias (Administrative Department of Science, Technology and Research of Colombia) under ”Convocatoria 658 - Convocatoria para proyectos de investigación en ciencias básicas año 2014”.

1711,pub.1084428597,10.3141/2612-01,,,Travel Quality Assessment of Urban Roads Based on International Roughness Index: Case Study in Colombia,"Roughness is the main feature of the pavement surface that defines user comfort. Pavement roughness is generally defined as irregularities in the pavement surface that adversely affect ride quality, specifically user perception of the road condition. This paper highlights the limitations associated with the evaluation and implementation of the international roughness index (IRI) on urban roads. The paper focuses on ( a) roughness evaluation with full-scale profilers and ( b) conditions particular to urban roads—namely, traffic, intersections, and operating speeds. Given that the speed of urban networks is typically less than the 80 km/h used in the IRI quarter-car model, the implementation of the IRI model on urban roads was evaluated. Even though a given pavement surface reported a unique IRI value, user experience of the profile depended on the travel speed. This result was evidence that user perceptions of road condition are highly influenced by travel speed. The results suggested the need to develop a roughness index that captures the unique characteristics of urban roads and can estimate the road condition as perceived by users. For that reason, this research study focused on establishing thresholds for IRI on the basis of the weighted vertical acceleration parameter as an aid to assessing user perception. The proposed method allows the maximum allowable IRI value for a given road to be established on the basis of the road’s operational speed. The results indicated that IRI thresholds agreed with international and local Colombian standards.",,,Transportation Research Record Journal of the Transportation Research Board,,,,2017-01-01,2017,2017-01-01,2017-01,2612,1,1-10,Closed,Article,"Abudinen, Daniel; Fuentes, Luis G.; Muñoz, Juan S.

Students in Colombia usually take the course between the fourth and fifth semester of their academic programs. The course has historically presented high loss rates due to the difficulty of understanding and appropriation of concepts. Consequently, the professor started a project to help students in the course, by using ludic-evaluation methodology. The article presents the most important results of student perception in self-efficacy, engagement and achievement of learning objectives. The a ludic evaluation methodology was applied prior to the first theoretical evaluation in of Thermodynamics course at Universidad del Norte (Barranquilla-Colombia) in three different cohorts (one in 2015 and two in 2016). The study is structured in four phases and includes the interaction with other academic support offered by academic peers within the same university. The first phase occurs two weeks before the application of the theoretical evaluation, and includes ludic-evaluation with a video game to diagnose the level of achievement of the learning objective. The second phase, includes academic peer support and uses the results of the ludic-evaluation, to carry out improvement actions. The third phase performs the theoretical exam.  During the final phase, the professor applies a survey to the students to obtain their perception about the subject, the way they learned and their role as students within the achievement of the learning objective. Results show that students have an open mind to learn and increase their level of engagement to the subject, also improving on the objective results at the end of the course. .",,,eLearning and Software for Education,13th International Conference eLearning and Software for Education,,,2017-04-28,2017,2017-04-28,2017-04-28,2,,234-238,Closed,Proceeding,"Yepesmartinez, Julian","Yepesmartinez, Julian ()",,"Yepesmartinez, Julian ()",1,0,,0.5,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1155722556,39 Education; 3901 Curriculum and Pedagogy; 46 Information and Computing Sciences,
1706,pub.1085869670,10.1007/s00500-017-2670-z,,,Local search methods for the solution of implicit inverse problems,"In this paper, we propose two local search algorithms based on the Tabu Search and the Simulated Annealing methods, respectively, for the solution of implicit inverse problems. In general, the proposed methods work as follows: given a noisy observation and a right-hand side function of a partial differential equation, for each model component a sub-domain is built about it and the corresponding part of observed components in such sub-domain is projected onto a space generated by a pre-defined set of local basis functions. For the projection, the singular value decomposition is applied to the data set in order to discard singular vectors corresponding to small singular values in pursuance of reducing the impact of noise on the projected data. The right-hand side function is then utilized in order to estimate the quality of the projection onto such sub-space. Since different basis functions provide different spaces onto which the data can be projected, the well-known Tabu Search and Simulated Annealing methods are utilized in order to enrich the search space of the optimal set of basis functions. This is the optimal combination of basis functions which minimizes the error during the projection step. After this, the local solutions are mapped back onto the global domain from which the global solution of the inverse problem is approximated. A strength of our proposed method is that no assumption is needed over the measurements to be assimilated. Experimental tests are performed making use of a parabolic partial differential equation and different noise levels for the data error. The results reveal that the use of the proposed implementations can provide accurate estimates in a root-mean-square error sense of the reference solution with even large data errors.","This work was supported by the Applied Math and Computational Science Laboratory (AML-CS) at Universidad del Norte, BAQ, COL.",,Soft Computing,,,,2017-06-06,2017,2017-06-06,2018-07,22,14,4819-4832,Closed,Article,"Nino-Ruiz, Elias D.; Ardila, Carlos; Capacho, Rafael","Nino-Ruiz, Elias D.

Swash oscillations in a microtidal dissipative beach. This paper evaluates the relationship between gravity and infragravity energy with swash oscillations as well as the model's ability to reproduce the transformation of the wave as it approaches the shore on a dissipative beach. For this purpose, numerical experiments were conducted in a dissipative beach from Cartagena, Colombia. Mean free surface measurements were carried out for 2 days in February 2014 by installing a cross-shore array of pressure sensors, as well as a Fourier analysis from these measurements to identify frequency components that characterize the waves and the energy associated with them. To implement the numerical modelling, the SWASH model (The Simulation WAves till Shore is a numerical model that resolves nonlinear shallow-water equations) was set up by using the bathymetric profile of Bocagrande Beach obtained during the field campaign. The results of this numerical modelling enabled the study of the infragravity energy growth mechanism and the evolution of gravity energy as the wave approaches the shore, as well as the relationship between gravity and infragravity energy with swash oscillations. Overall, the results show that the model is able to reproduce the significant wave height and significant wave height associated with infragravity energy; moreover, the model is able to accurately describe processes of energy dissipation and energy transfer. Furthermore, through a spectral analysis applied to the swash oscillations time series it was possible to find that saturation occurs at low-frequency significant swash height and high-frequency significant swash height as the significant wave height increases, since its increase is not linear with respect to the signficant wave height incident.","This study was carried out with support from the Instituto Colombiano para el Desarrollo de la Ciencia y Tecnologa Francisco Jose de Caldas COLCIENCIAS, Grant COLCIENCIAS 03932013 (Proyecto anlisis de las oscilaciones infragravitatorias en la zona de rompientes en las playas micromareales, disipativas y reflejantes).

                    This commentary aims to introduce a collection of articles that highlights the experiences, needs and challenges of vulnerable consumers within a variety of service contexts. As a research collection, the investigations reveal that service researchers have overlooked how service design and processes affect vulnerable consumers.
                  
                  
                    Design/methodology/approach
                    The commentary is a conceptual perspective based on the investigations put forward in this special issue, extant literature and the editors’ perspectives.
                  
                  
                    Findings
                    Many consumers enter service contexts in some type of vulnerable condition. These conditions may include those relating to deafness, hearing impairments, older age, sexual orientation, immigration status and acculturation, participation in sexual exploitation, geographical remoteness, mental health challenges, obesity, natural disasters, language barriers and being the brunt of service provider discrimination.
                  
                  
                    Research limitations/implications
                    Service researchers are encouraged to consider how the service marketing’s foundational theories, frameworks, concepts and axioms generalize among vulnerable consumers.
                  
                  
                    Practical implications
                    Service practitioners need to realize customers often enter service contexts owing to some type of vulnerable condition that influences their expectations and perceptions of service quality.

At present, only two members of the big defensin family have been identified in scallop. In the present work, a cDNA sequence encoding a new big defensin homologue was characterized from the scallop Argopecten purpuratus, namely ApBD1. ApBD1 cDNA sequence comprised 585 nucleotides, with an open reading frame of 375 bp and 5'- and 3'-UTRs of 41 and 167 bp, respectively. The deduced protein sequence contains 124 amino acids with a molecular weight of 13.5 kDa, showing characteristic motifs of the big defensin family and presenting 76% identity with the big defensin from the scallop A. irradians. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that ApBD1 is included into the cluster of big defensins from mollusks. Tissue-specific transcript expression analysis by RT-qPCR showed that ApBD1 was present in all tissues tested from non-immune challenged scallops but it was most strongly expressed in the mantle. The transcript levels of ApBD1 were significantly up-regulated in gills at 24 and 48 h post-injection with the heat-attenuated bacteria Vibrio splendidus. Additionally, immunofluorescence analysis using a polyclonal anti-ApBD1 antibody showed that this protein was abundantly located in epithelial linings of gills and mantle; and also in digestive gland showing ApBD1-infiltrating hemocytes from immune challenged scallops. This is the first time that a big defensin is detected and located at the protein level in a mollusk. These results suggest an important role of ApBD1 in the mucosal immune response of A. purpuratus.","AcknowledgementsWe gratefully acknowledge William Farías for technical assistance, Germán Lira from Laboratorio Central de Cultivos from UCN for scallop procurement and maintenance, Rodrigo Rojas for bacteria procurement, and Mauricio Soler for his support with the edition of the figures.","This study was supported by National Fund of Science and Technology, FONDECYT No 1140849-2014/CEAZA to K.B. and L.M., and by FONDECYT 11150009 to P.S.",Fish & Shellfish Immunology,,,"Animals; Anti-Infective Agents; Defensins; Immunity, Mucosal; Pectinidae; Sequence Analysis, DNA; Up-Regulation; Vibrio",2017-07-06,2017,2017-07-06,2017-09,68,,173-179,Closed,Article,"González, Roxana; Brokordt, Katherina; Cárcamo, Claudia B.; de la Peña, Teodoro Coba; Oyanedel, Daniel; Mercado, Luis; Schmitt, Paulina","González, Roxana (Laboratorio de Fisiología y Genética Marina (FIGEMA), Centro de Estudios Avanzados en Zonas Áridas (CEAZA), Universidad Católica del Norte, 1781421 Coquimbo, Chile); Brokordt, Katherina (Laboratorio de Fisiología y Genética Marina (FIGEMA), Centro de Estudios Avanzados en Zonas Áridas (CEAZA), Universidad Católica del Norte, 1781421 Coquimbo, Chile); Cárcamo, Claudia B.

For this reason, design methodologies are addressed to establish a close relationship between environmental, social and economic impact indicators and product features from early design stages, especially in those features related to its manufacturing. In this paper, the design for manufacturing and assembly—DFMA methodology is adapted to sheet metal enclosure devices, integrating functional and component relationships to minimize particular sustainability indicators such as energy consumption, carbon footprint, number of parts, required amount of material, assembly time and manufacturing costs. Savings with the proposed method are achieved following specific sub-tasks oriented to define new simplified product components, considering changes in manufacturing processes and re-defining mechanical connections between parts. Traditional DFMA approaches consider manufacturing and assembly issues related to a reduction of product complexity and economic savings. The proposed method aims to examine the benefits in life cycle stages such as raw material consumption, service, maintenance, upgrading and end of life—EOL. The methodology is validated through a redesign of a sheet metal industrial clock, in which the sustainability impacts are calculated from a comparison of an existent product vs. a new product development. The implementation of the method in the case study demonstrate reductions of more than 25% in product mass, consumed energy and CO2 footprint, and more than 50% in theoretical assembly time and product complexity. Sustainability indicators of the proposed method are selected from literature analysis and taking into account attributes of sheet metal enclosure devices.","This research has been developed with the support from Cámara de Comercio de Barranquilla (CCB), DST Ltd. http://www.onlinedst.com/and Universidad del Norte within the project: “Conceptual Design of a platform focused on the development of high-value electronic products” (Contract No. UN-OJ-2012-15799).

An estimation using Real Options,"In deregulated markets, Transmission Expansion Planning (TEP) is usually performed by a central network planner seeking to maximize social welfare. In doing that, the network planner commonly follows a traditional project valuation, considering a discounted cash flow (DCF) methodology, although incorporating uncertainty and reliability considerations. Accordingly, once the optimal transmission expansion plan is determined, the network planner frequently auctions the needed investments, obligating the investor to execute the expansion in the fixed (inflexible) terms defined in the bidding process. A key problem is that DCF does not take into account the responses of the planner when uncertainties are resolved because DCF evaluates the project with the information available today. In TEP, managerial flexibility may be valuable because optimal decisions may change over time with the release of new information. Transmission investors may want to defer or expand according to such information. The aim of this article is to estimate the value of adding some flexibility in TEP through real options. In particular, by means of using a real-option approach with binomial trees, we study the benefits for a social network planner of having the option to defer some transmission investments. Our results suggest that incorporating flexibility in TEP may increase social welfare.","The research reported in this paper was partially supported by CONICYT, FONDECYT/Regular 1130781 and 1161112 grants, by CONICYT, FONDECYT/Iniciación 11130647 grant, and by Nucleo Milenio Research Center for Entrepreneurial Strategy Under Uncertainty (NS130028).

Our paper identifies several reasons: nation-building and rock music’s first steps in Latin America, progressive cultural politics, conservative gender norms and a continent dominated by dictatorships when Bowie was becoming a putative ‘world icon’.","Many thanks to the editors for their comments, to our interviewees for their collaboration and to other kind informants: Abeyamí Ortega, Leandro González, Noah Zweig, Gabriel Moreno, Ana Wortman and Claudia Lagos.",,Continuum,,,,2017-07-04,2017,2017-07-10,2017-07-04,31,4,509-518,Closed,Article,"Utman, Jorge Saavedra; Miller, Toby","Utman, Jorge Saavedra (Media and Communications Department, Goldsmiths College, University of London, London, UK); Miller, Toby (Institute for Media and Creative Industries, Loughborough University London, London, UK; Departamento de Comunicación Social y Periodismo, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia; Murdoch University, Australia; School of Journalism, Media and Cultural Studies, Cardiff University, Cardiff, UK)","Utman, Jorge Saavedra (Goldsmiths University of London)","Utman, Jorge Saavedra (Goldsmiths University of London); Miller, Toby (University of London; Universidad del Norte; Murdoch University; Cardiff University)",0,0,,0.0,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1090627641,"36 Creative Arts and Writing; 3603 Music; 47 Language, Communication and Culture",
1648,pub.1084721470,10.1007/s11600-017-0036-7,,,Changes in seasonal streamflow extremes experienced in rivers of Northwestern South America (Colombia),"A measure of the variability in seasonal extreme streamflow was estimated for the Colombian Caribbean coast, using monthly time series of freshwater discharge from ten watersheds. The aim was to detect modifications in the streamflow monthly distribution, seasonal trends, variance and extreme monthly values. A 20-year length time moving window, with 1-year successive shiftments, was applied to the monthly series to analyze the seasonal variability of streamflow. The seasonal-windowed data were statistically fitted through the Gamma distribution function. Scale and shape parameters were computed using the Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) and the bootstrap method for 1000 resample. A trend analysis was performed for each windowed-serie, allowing to detect the window of maximum absolute values for trends. Significant temporal shifts in seasonal streamflow distribution and quantiles (QT), were obtained for different frequencies. Wet and dry extremes periods increased significantly in the last decades. Such increase did not occur simultaneously through the region. Some locations exhibited continuous increases only at minimum QT.","This research was funded by the Universidad del Norte (Dirección de Investigación, Desarrollo e Innovación—DIDI Grant) and the Universidad Pontificia Bolivariana—Sede Medellín (Centro Integral para el Desarrollo de la Investigación—CIDI Grant).",,Acta Geophysica,,,,2017-04-01,2017,2017-04-01,2017-04,65,2,377-394,Closed,Article,"Pierini, J.

These conditions have not been explicitly considered in comparative research on journalists’ work environments, an omission that may obscure important realities of contemporary journalism. We address this gap through analysis of journalist surveys in 62 countries. We confirm the existence of insecure democracies as an empirical phenomenon and begin to unravel their meaning for journalists. We find democracies with uneven democratic performance tend to have more journalist assassinations, which is the most extreme form of influence on work, and that levels of democratic performance, violence, public insecurity and economic inequality significantly shape how journalists perceive various influences in their work environment. Case studies of insecure democracies in Africa and Latin America address why these conditions sometimes (but not always) lead to journalist assassinations and other anti-press violence. They suggest anti-press violence is higher when sub-national state actors intensify criminal violence and when insecurity is geographically and topically proximate to journalists. How journalists’ perceive influences on work are therefore more complex and multidimensional than previous research has suggested. The study concludes by identifying areas for improvement in data collection.","The authors gratefully acknowledge the research assistance of Luca Romero Carcamo, Luís Lemini and Melissa Andrea Gonzáles Medina of the Universidad Iberoamericana-Mexico City and Sean Beckett of Stellenbosch University, South Africa.","The authors are grateful for internal funding grants from the University of Miami Provost’s Research Award and School of Communication; The Universidad Iberoamericana-Mexico City Young Scholars Grant; and The Universidad del Norte (Barranquilla, Colombia).

In this paper, the bender elements system in the centrifuge lab at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute is used to characterize the shear wave velocity and the small strain shear modulus of dry and saturated Ottawa sand. It was found that the shear wave velocity of saturated sand is smaller than that of dry sand having the same relative density. Also, the paper describes an analytical system identification (SI) method that can be used in the absence of bender elements to estimate shear wave velocity from acceleration recordings. The SI and bender elements were found to be in very good agreement with each other confirming the validity of both techniques, which are fully independent.",,,,Geotechnical Frontiers 2017,,,2017-03-30,2017,2017-03-30,2017-03-30,,,92-100,Closed,Proceeding,"El-Sekelly, Waleed; Abdoun, Tarek; Mercado, Vicente","El-Sekelly, Waleed (Lecturer, Dept. of Structural Engineering, Mansoura Univ., 60 EL-Gomhorya St., Mansoura 35516, Egypt, .

Particularly, it analyses the spit that separates the lagoon from the sea, elaborating a diagnostic process that helps to characterize the effect of the coastal infrastructure in morphological changes in a short and medium-term. Elements such as the morphology, the wave climate, the hydrodynamic and the evolution monitoring of coastline are key elements to understand whether a coastal wetland is on equilibrium or in the contrary, its state of vulnerability is such that in the slightest change in physics conditions will produce negative effects by the system instability.Generally, it describes the procedure performed to properly understand the relation between modifications of coastal processes and the response of a coastal environment. It uses numerical and theoretical models to assess the behavior of the waterfront, considering the historical changes that have occurred to ultimately predict variations of the spit as consequence of the establishment of new civil works. Finally, it concludes with this method of analysis that the evaluated study case will be affected by the works of action to be developed for facilitating the navigability conditions of a new port currently under construction in the city of Barranquilla, Colombia.","To coastal engineering group of the Universidad del Norte, integrated by Marianella Bolivar, Alejandra Builes, Ximena Arguelles, Vilma Álvarez y Carlos Ramos.

Industries are adopting policies not only to comply with regulations but also to exercise social responsibility. As a result, academia is making efforts to prepare professionals with the knowledge and skills to facilitate sustainable solutions. Several initiatives to introduce sustainability in engineering education have been reported in the literature. However, the complexity and wide scope of sustainability make the teaching and learning of this subject a challenge. Sustainability can be defined from different perspectives and its balance between environment, economy and social pillars is not always preserved. Additionally, the existing instruments to assess sustainability knowledge are too general and no discipline specific. In a complex topic like this, the knowledge in different disciplines cannot be measured the same. This work presents an approach to develop assessment instruments to assess sustainability knowledge in engineering in a learning module to be introduced in a first year engineering design course. The tools will be designed to evaluate the effectiveness of the module and the performance of the students in the module.",This work was partially supported by by COLCIENICAS through the PhD National Scholarship Program No 617–2 Contract UN-OJ-2014-24072 and by the Engineering Technology and Commonwealth Engineering (ETCE) Research Development Grant (RDG).

As traditional fault detection relies in alarm management system and operator’s expertise, it is paramount to deploy a strategy being able to update its underlying structure and effectively adapting to such process shifts. This feature would allow operators and engineers to have a better framework to address the online data being gathered in dynamic on transient conditions. This paper presents an extended analysis on WARP technique to address the abnormal condition management activities of multiple-state processes deployed in critical natural gas transmission infrastructure. Special emphasis is made on the updating activity to incorporate effectively the operating shifts exhibited by a new operating condition implemented on a fault detection strategy. This analysis broadens the authors’ original algorithm scope to include multi-state systems in addition to process drifting behavior. The strategy is assessed under two different scenarios rendering a major shift in process’ operating conditions related to natural gas transmission systems: A transition between low and high natural gas demand to support hydroelectric generation matrix on severe tropical conditions. Performance evaluation of fault detection algorithm is carried out based on false alarm rate, detection time and misdetection rate estimated around the model update.Copyright © 2017 by ASME",,,,Volume 14: Emerging Technologies; Materials: Genetics to Structures; Safety Engineering and Risk Analysis,,,2017-11-03,2017,2018-01-10,2017-11-03,,,v014t14a013-v014t14a013,Closed,Proceeding,"Pinzón, Horacio; Audivet, Cinthia; Portnoy, Ivan; Consuegra, Marlon; Alexander, Javier; Sanjuán, Marco","Pinzón, Horacio (Promigas S.A.

Its evolutionary history and biogeography is still poorly understood. Contrasting its almost modern pantropical distribution, fossils of Salvinia have been found worldwide, including North America, Europe and Asia. Here, we describe fossils of Salvinia from four Paleogene localities of Colombia. Based on comparative morphological analyses of sterile organs, we describe two new species: Salvinia magdalenensis sp. nov. and Salvinia bogotensis sp. nov and assign the fossils from the other two localities to Salvinia sp. Available fossil data, together with these new records indicate that Salvinia was distributed in tropical latitudes as well as in temperate latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere throughout most of the Cenozoic. Its modern pantropical distribution could be the result of Pleistocene extinction of Salvinia in temperate regions due to global cooling climate trend.","AcknowledgmentsWe thank Milton Rueda from Paleoflora LTDA for his help in processing the palynological samples.

A mathematical model proposed by the authors is updated using the actual trajectory of a pedestrian. The mathematical model is based on the principle that a human’s control capability tries to maintain balance with respect to the pedestrian’s center of mass (CoM), independently of the surface type. In this research, the human is considered as a mass point concentrated at CoM. The parameters of the models are updated using experimental identification of the human walking trajectory on a rigid surface. The proposed measurement technique uses a depth sensor, which enable skeletal tracking of the pedestrian walking on rigid or flexible structures. Experiments were performed using a mobile platform with the time-of-flight commercial camera Microsoft Kinect for Windows 2.0. The velocity of the mobile platform is set to maintain a 1 m separation from the pedestrian in order to provide high resolution. The results of the measurement technique allowed the identification of the human’s CoM trajectory. The results of the model updating process present the probability density function of the parameters which could be used for modeling the CoM’s trajectory of the pedestrian.",,,Conference Proceedings of the Society for Experimental Mechanics Series,"Dynamics of Civil Structures, Volume 2","Juan Caicedo, Shamim Pakzad",,2017-06-03,2017,2017-06-03,2017,,,159-167,Closed,Chapter,"Ortiz, Albert R.; Blachowski, Bartlomiej; Holobut, Pawel; Franco, Jean M.; Marulanda, Johannio; Thomson, Peter","Ortiz, Albert R.

The method is based on a discrete-space version of a Lienard-type model, which describes the fluid behavior in a pipeline only in terms of the flow rate. This latter detail was very useful in designing our method, which was conceived to deal with pipelines solely equipped with flowmeters or in conjunction with pressure sensors, but which are temporarily out of service. The working principle of our methodology is the generation of a set of residuals (each one defined for a specific section of the pipeline) to estimate the position of a leak. The residual near zero will indicate the section where a leak is occurring. The main advantage of our approach is that it does not require pressure measurements, which occurs in most existing methodologies. Thus, to show its potential, we present the results of some tests carried out in simulation.",,,,2017 IEEE 3rd Colombian Conference on Automatic Control (CCAC),,,2017-10-01,2017,,2017-10-01,,,1-6,Closed,Proceeding,"Jiménez-Cabas, Javier; Torres, Lizeth; López-Estrada, Francisco Ronay; Sanjuan, Marco","Jiménez-Cabas, Javier (Departamento de Ingeniería Mecatronica, Universidad Autónoma del Caribe, Barranquilla, Colombia); Torres, Lizeth (Instituto de Ingeniería, Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México, Ciudad de México, México); López-Estrada, Francisco Ronay (Departamento de Ingeniería Electrónica, Instituto Tecnológico de Tuxtla Gutiérrez, Tuxtla Gutirrez, México); Sanjuan, Marco (Departamento de Ingeniería Mecánica, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia)",,"Jiménez-Cabas, Javier (Universidad Autónoma del Caribe); Torres, Lizeth (National Autonomous University of Mexico); López-Estrada, Francisco Ronay (Tuxtla Gutierrez Institute of Technology); Sanjuan, Marco (Universidad del Norte)",2,0,,0.53,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1100766780,40 Engineering; 4015 Maritime Engineering; 46 Information and Computing Sciences,

Stated-preference methods of valuation, which are commonly used in economics, have been criticised because the principle of willingness to pay may exclude low-income earners who do not have the capacity to pay. Deliberative valuation has been advocated as a way to overcome this problem, but deliberation may also be exclusive. In this review, two deliberative valuation frameworks are compared. The first is grounded on the idea of rational discourse that emphasises argument at the expense of other communicative strategies. It seeks to secure inclusion through procedural rules and prerequisites, but fails to address the underlying democratic limitation of argumentation. The second does not rely on the distinction between rational and rhetorical speech, and therefore admits alternative forms of communication. This approach recognises differences in the communicative capacities and practices of those who take part in deliberation, and so is better equipped to improve, though not to guarantee, inclusion.",,,Environmental Values,,,,2017-04-01,2017,2017-04-01,2017-04,26,2,157-176,Closed,Article,"Vargas, Andrés; Alex, Lo; Howes, Michael; Rohde, Nicholas","Vargas, Andrés (Griffith University (Australia) Universidad del Norte (Colombia) Barranquilla, Atlántico, Colombia); Alex, Lo (University of Hong Kong); Howes, Michael (Griffith University); Rohde, Nicholas (Griffith University)","Vargas, Andrés (Universidad del Norte)","Vargas, Andrés (Universidad del Norte); Alex, Lo (University of Hong Kong); Howes, Michael (Griffith University); Rohde, Nicholas (Griffith University)",21,3,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1084429439,44 Human Society; 50 Philosophy and Religious Studies,

The control charts are one of the most common statistical tools used today. They are very useful and powerful tools for monitoring the quality of a process, allowing to observe all phases and variables that occur in the process. Much of the production processes are led by dynamic elements which allow autocorrelated observations and, with this, more costs and false alarms. To address this situation, some implementations of Artificial Neural Networks with X, EWMA and CUSUM control charts, are made for an AR(1) process. The results show that for small shifts, the EWMA chart outperform the X chart, while for large shifts the X chart performed better than the EWMA chart.

In this sense, photovoltaic-wind hybrid energy systems are an attractive solution, especially in places with good sun and wind resources. However, due to the stochastic and intermittent behavior of these sources, it is necessary to analyze systems' reliability. In this paper, a new reliability indicator is proposed, based on the minimum hourly electric power obtained from the wind and solar radiation using a probabilistic approach.

Simulation was performed for a 0.0625l/lculture·min$$0.0625\,l/l_{\mathrm{culture}}\cdot \hbox {min}$$ inlet airflow. Air, water and microalgae velocity contours showed less gas phase present in the downcomer than in the riser, suggesting the necessity of vigorous mixing in the ascendant portion if homogeneous water and solid flow is to be achieved. Air velocity is smaller in the downcomer (shorter velocity vectors) than in the riser. Water velocity vectors point always in the expected direction, down in the downcomer and up in the riser. Microalgae paths, perhaps due to the small size of the microorganisms, follow the water velocity vectors. As there are fewer hydraulic restrictions to the liquid phase in the riser, a large amount of energy is dissipated by gas–liquid interactions. In the downcomer region, the gas phase is almost nonexistent, and bubble collisions are almost nonexistent as well. A quasi-stagnation zone was found at the lower section of the downcomer, showing that the design requires improvement. Finally, the turbulent kinetic energy is larger at the top and middle region of the riser; meanwhile, it is lower at the downcomer. Similar results were observed for the energy dissipation rate.","This paper is the result of the research project Implementation of R &amp; D (Microalgae components) to promote development and technology transfer in the agroindustrial production in Departamento del Atlántico, which is funded by Departamento del Atlántico through resources from Sistema General de Regalías–Fondo de Ciencia, Tecnología e Innovación (Grant no.

In particular, we present a characterization of D-optimal designs for randomly blocked polynomial regression experiments with measurements at baseline (zero) where the experimental settings and the corresponding weights are determined analytically. Surprisingly, the optimal designs within the quantitative predictor are not affected by the intraclass correlation (or, equivalently, the ratio of the variance components), while the proportion of baseline measurements increases smoothly from the optimal weight in a model without block effects to the optimal weights under the assumption that all block effects are nonrandom. Despite this dependence, we show that those limiting designs that are obtained when the intraclass correlation tends to zero or one (or, equivalently, the variance ratio tends to zero or infinity), respectively, are quite robust.",The authors thank the two anonymous reviewers and the editor for their very constructive and helpful comments and also the recommendations that led to the significant improvement of the initial version of this article.,,Journal of Statistical Theory and Practice,,,,2017-12-01,2017,2017-12-01,2017-12,11,4,759-770,Closed,Article,"Cabrera, Jesús Alonso; Schwabe, Rainer","Cabrera, Jesús Alonso (Departamento de Matemáticas y Estadística, Universidad del Norte, KM5 via Puerto Colombia, Barranquilla, Colombia); Schwabe, Rainer (Institute of Mathematical Stochastics, Otto-von-Guericke-Universität Magdeburg, Magdeburg, Germany)","Cabrera, Jesús Alonso (Universidad del Norte)","Cabrera, Jesús Alonso (Universidad del Norte); Schwabe, Rainer (Otto-von-Guericke University Magdeburg)",0,0,,0.0,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1085242357,49 Mathematical Sciences; 4905 Statistics,

1518,pub.1085751274,10.1007/978-3-319-54777-0_26,,,Benchmark Problem for Assessing Effects of Human-Structure Interaction in Footbridges,"Currently, construction tendencies tend to design flexible structures, such as footbridges, slabs and grandstands, due to the increased resistance of new materials and the regulation gap in building codes. These flexible structures are susceptible of excessive vibrations induced by human activities, producing serviceability failures and, sometimes, collapse. It is essential to improve the understanding of the effect of anthropic loads over the structures to mitigate serviceability problems and the risk of structural damage and, therefore, economic and human loses.The Human-Structure Interaction (HSI) involves the effect of human activities over a structure and, simultaneously, the effect of the structure’s dynamics over the humans. The study of the HSI requires participation of multiple disciplines such as biomechanics and structural dynamics, and expertise in numerical modeling and experimental techniques, usually through finite elements and dynamic shakers or shaking tables. Analytical or numerical models are restricted to solve specific problems and, in most cases, they are not sufficiently detailed to simulate the complex behavior of the coupled human-structure system. Besides, experimental techniques required for HSI studies involve specialized instrumentation and equipment, increasing the cost and time to obtain such measurements.Because of the current interest in HSI, integrative projects should be formulated regarding this interdisciplinary problem. In 2015, the Universidad del Valle, in collaboration with Purdue University and the University of South Carolina, built the UV HSI footbridge testbed, a testbed for assessing effects of HSI in footbridges. The footbridge has a total length of 12 m and a total width of 1.2 m. Its structure is a simply supported steel truss with a steel-deck platform. Supports are four load cells, two at each end of the bridge. The first six natural frequencies of the bridge are between 3.86 and 25.54 Hz.The first challenge proposed through the testbed was a Blind Prediction Contest (BPC). Participants of the BPC were encouraged to use their own analytical or numerical HSI models to simulate three different types of experimental tests. The second challenge is a Benchmark problem where experimental data from more than 100 pedestrians walking twice at 10 different frequency gaits are provided. Pedestrians were female and male participants of weights between 50 and 105 kg, and heights between 1.45 and 1.90 m. This paper describes the UV HSI footbridge testbed and the Benchmark problem. Statistical results for the BPC and the Benchmark problem are provided.",,,Conference Proceedings of the Society for Experimental Mechanics Series,"Dynamics of Civil Structures, Volume 2","Juan Caicedo, Shamim Pakzad",,2017-06-03,2017,2017-06-03,2017,,,213-222,Closed,Chapter,"Gómez, S.; Marulanda, J.; Thomson, P.; García, J.

1484,pub.1091085392,10.1016/j.indcrop.2017.08.002,,,Eucalyptus leaf byproduct inhibits the anthracnose-causing fungus Colletotrichum gloeosporioides,"Colletotrichum gloeosporioides is a major anthracnose-causing agent, causing dark spots in important fruit crops such as banana, papaya and mango. Eucalyptus trees and shrubs are native to Australia, but are currently widely distributed. There is evidence that Eucalyptus species display activity against Colletotrichum gloeosporioides. In this work, the antifungal activity of essential oils and ethanolic extracts of three Eucalyptus species cultivated for wood in Colombia (Eucalyptus camaldulensis Dehn., Eucalyptus globulus Labill. and Eucalyptus tereticornis Smith.) was evaluated. Leaf from the three Eucalyptus species was extracted by hydrodistillation and ethanol maceration to yield respectively the essential oil and ethanolic extract, which were tested against C. gloeosporioides Penz., using an agar macrodilution assay. Ethanolic extracts showed stronger inhibition than essential oils. Although the ethanolic extract of E. camaldulensis provided 98% of inhibition at a concentration of 5000mg/L, the ethanolic extract of E. globulus inhibited by 50% at a lower concentration of 500mg/L. The metabolites from essential oils and ethanol extracts were examined respectively by gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (GC–MS) and ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC–MS/MS). Both E. camaldulensis and E. globulus ethanolic extracts may be considered for antifungal formulations and as source of interesting anti-Colletotrichum compounds.",The authors acknowledge Juan Climaco Hio (Corpoica) for the kind gift of the C. gloeosporioides strain.

Therefore, control over surface implant materials and their elastic moduli may be crucial to avoid undesired effects. In this study, surface modification upon cleaning and activation of a low elastic modulus Ti alloy (Ti25Hf21Nb) was investigated. Two different methods, oxygen plasma (OP) cleaning and piranha (PI) solution, were studied and compared. Both surface treatments were effective for organic contaminant removal and to increase the Ti-oxide layer thickness rather than other metal-oxides present at the surface, which is beneficial for biocompatibility of the material. Furthermore, both techniques drastically increased hydrophilicity and introduced oxidation and hydroxylation (OH)-functional groups at the surface that may be beneficial for further chemical modifications. However, these treatments did not alter the surface roughness and bulk material properties. The surfaces were fully characterized in terms of surface roughness, wettability, oxide layer composition, and hydroxyl surface density through analytical techniques (interferometry, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), contact angle, and zinc complexation). These findings provide essential information when planning surface modifications for cleanliness, oxide layer thickness, and surface hydroxyl density, as control over these factors is essential for many applications, especially in biomaterials.","The authors gratefully thank the Ministry of Science and Innovation, Spain MAT2015-67183R, and the Agency for Administration of University and Research Grants of the Government of Catalonia (2014 SGR 1333) for financial support.

In the case of Spanish texts, the might attributed to the white race was shown as having a motive of pride, whereas in the Colombian case, the mixture with Native Americans and blacks tended to be used as an explanation for the ‘weakness’ of Colombians.

In light of their significance and diffusion on a global level, understanding how these regimes emerge is important, especially when they replace democratic or imperfectly democratic regimes such as in the cases examined in this study. What explains the emergence of competitive authoritarian regimes (CARs), particularly when the starting point is democratic or imperfectly democratic? What are the region’s democratic prospects after the emergence of various CARs in the last two decades? Through the comparative analysis of competitive authoritarian attempts in Bolivia, Ecuador, Honduras, Nicaragua, and Venezuela, I argue that the same passages and challenges required to transform a democratic regime into a CAR makes incumbents' features and strategies particularly important, especially the ability to weather potentially lethal institutional crises and limit the legitimacy costs associated with competitive authoritarian manipulations. Incumbents have proved more successful in these challenges and hence in their competitive authoritarian attempts when combining charisma and the elaboration of a democratic discourse including the diffusion of new democratic values.",I would like to thank two anonymous reviewers for their helpful comments.,,Democratization,,,,2017-10-23,2017,2017-10-23,2018-04-03,25,3,504-523,Closed,Article,"Balderacchi, Claudio","Balderacchi, Claudio (Department of Political Science and International Relations, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia)","Balderacchi, Claudio (Universidad del Norte)","Balderacchi, Claudio (Universidad del Norte)",15,6,,7.33,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1092371964,44 Human Society; 4408 Political Science,

These laws were implemented between 2005 and 2012. We evaluate the policy effects on (a) college enrollment, (b) school dropout rates of unauthorized immigrants, and (c) the enrollment of U.S. citizens in higher education. Multivariate triple-differences models are used. We find significant negative effects on the college attendance rates of unauthorized immigrants. Policies have primarily affected recent high school graduates. With regard to dropping out of school, we find no evidence of dynamic effects.

Six combinations, varying proportion of rejuvenator and polymer, were studied. Mechanical and long-term performance was evaluated through laboratory investigations analyzing the physical properties and rheology of the binder and measuring stiffness modulus and permanent deformations (rutting) of recycled asphalt mixes.Outcomes showed that a proper calibration of rejuvenation agent and polymer can enhance the overall durability of high RAP content mixes.

However, it can be associated with significant morbimortality. In recent reports, Candida species and other filamentous fungi have been reported as being aetiological agents. Thermoascus species are ubiquitous, thermophilic fungi, with an anamorph in the Paecilomyces genus. Here we present the first report of fungal peritonitis by Thermoascus crustaceus from Chile.
CASE REPORT: We present the case of an 83-year-old female patient, with a history of cholecystectomy, hernia repair, severe arterial hypertension, hip and knee osteoarthritis and several episodes of peritoneal dialysis with a cloudy exudate. Bacterial cultures were negative. In addition, a history of two months with intermittent fever peaks mainly in the evening was reported. Blood culture bottles inoculated with peritoneal fluid revealed the presence of fungal growth. Morphological and molecular studies allowed us to identify the aetiological agent as Thermoascus crustaceus. An antifungal susceptibility test was performed using the M38-A2 method, developed by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI). The MIC values to amphotericin B, itraconazole, voriconazole and echinochandins were 0.5, 0.25, 0.25 and 0.125μg/ml, respectively. Antifungal treatment with amphotericin B was prescribed, with good patient progress.

We characterize codes whose rank defect and dual rank defect are both zero, and prove that the rank distribution of such codes is determined by their parameters. This extends a result by Delsarte on the rank distribution of MRD codes. In the general case of codes of positive defect, we show that the rank distribution is determined by the parameters of the code, together with the number of codewords of small rank. Moreover, we prove that if the rank defect of a code and its dual are both one, and the dimension satisfies a divisibility condition, then the number of minimum-rank codewords and dual minimum-rank codewords is the same. Finally, we discuss how our results specialize to Fqm$$\mathbb {F}_{q^m}$$-linear rank-metric codes in vector representation.","The authors wish to thank the anonymous referees for suggestions that improved the legibility of the paper.

The active structural acoustic control used consists of applying external forces directly on the structure, so that in the presence of critical frequencies, the linear system remains stable and, in turn, in the presence of non‐critical frequencies, the active control does not alter the system. We consider the problem in the framework of the theory of optimal control and present bi‐dimensional numerical simulations to show the behavior of the scheme in some vibro‐acoustic structures.

In a number of studies, site properties have been identified using one-dimensional analyses. Such analyses uncouple the two-dimensional (horizontal) response of soil deposits, which is inherently coupled. This paper presents a system identification technique that takes into account the coupled two-directional response of soil deposits. The technique employs non-parametric estimates of the shear stresses derived from acceleration records provided by a vertical (downhole) array. A multi-yield surface plasticity approach is used to model the multi-dimensional stress-strain relation. The identification technique is first verified using finite elements computational simulations. This technique was then used to assess the coupled response of the Wildlife liquefaction research site (Imperial Valley, California). The identified shear moduli and shear wave velocities were found to be in a very good agreement with those measured in the field using crosshole seismic testing.",AcknowledgementsThis research was partly supported by the National Science Foundation (NEESR CMS-0830325).

The wealth of polished tools suggests an advanced and large-scale lithic industry. This paper provides context for a collection of over 300 tools collected as surface finds in an area centered on the Gulf of Morrosquillo on the central lowlands, and it is thus dubbed the Morrosquillo assemblage. Using a combination of geologic and archaeological evidence, these tools are traced to the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta, the enclave of the Taironas for 1000 years, where the abundance of high-quality raw materials enabled the development of an impressive lithic industry. Thorough examination of the stone tools revealed that they were mostly utilitarian objects used in a variety of tasks; however, the large numbers of polished tools suggest that the tool makers were as concerned with aesthetic appearance as with utilitarian purposes, and some of the tools were apparently symbols of status. The presence of tools that appear to have been deliberately broken suggest that they probably were used in rituals or offering ceremonies.","The authors are grateful to the many farmers who provided the stone tools and who took time to collect and record the location where they were found; without their contribution this study would not have been possible.

However, a new technique of collagen analysis by soft-ionization mass spectrometry offers a means to access such molecular information from the tropics that are typically regions of greatest worldwide biodiversity. This work explores the application of collagen analyses to remains of a dwarf deer of uncertain ancestry discovered in a ~6000 year old shell-bearing midden on Pedro González Island (Panama). The sub-fossil deer’s tiny size, the extreme cultural modification of >2400 specimens, and the rarity of complete bones and antlers prevented objective identification below Family level. Collagen fingerprinting analyses reveal that both the Pedro González island archaeological deer and an extant small deer on San José Island 8 km away, are closely related but do not have a close affinity with the Central American red brocket deer (Mazama temama Kerr 1792). Using these methods, their closest affinity appears to be with a group of cervids that comprises the North and Central American white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus Zimmerman 1780) and populations of the Amazonian brown brocket deer (M. nemorivaga Cuvier 1817).","The Pearl Island project (2007–2010) was supported by funds from Panama’s Secretaría Nacional de Ciencia, Tecnología e Innovación (SENACYT), the National Geographic Society and the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute’s education programs.

                    The purpose of this paper is to assess alternative economic explanations of buildings’ height in Latin America and Chile, inductively producing a theory about skyscrapers’ height in emerging countries. In the quest for height, global exposure as advertising guides developers located in emerging economies, while ego-building for investors.
                  
                  
                    Design/methodology/approach
                    This paper uses mixed methods triangulation (MMT). Findings with small sample econometrics for 38 cities from 13 different countries are re-interpreted by linguistically analyzing 11 semi-structured interviews with local experts in Santiago.
                  
                  
                    Findings
                    Globalization is the main determinant of skyscrapers height in the Latin American region, its interaction with the need to portray management and technical skills of developer firms, determines a process toward over-construction.
                  
                  
                    Research limitations/implications
                    Because of small sample bias, the quantitative results are not fully reliable, but this is precisely why it makes sense to use MMT.
                  
                  
                    Practical implications
                    Santiago offers a valuable case study because, on the one hand, Chile was the first Latin American country to undertake neoliberal type reforms, as early as 1973. On the other, the tallest Latin American skyscraper is to be completed in this city by 2015. The theory developed, derived from the evidence and the perceptions, has a Global South reach and can open-up an empirical research agenda.

The imbalance between different transport modes suggests a need to promote alternative modalities to strengthen the competitiveness and provide a more sustainable economic development. The goal of this paper is to identify logistics managers’ preferences for freight transport service attributes for the case of Rio Grande do Sul in Brazil, and discuss which transport policies could encourage multimodality and more sustainable uses of available transport infrastructure. In this paper we used the stated preference (SP) technique for collecting data on respondents’ choices among hypothetical options. The experimental design was structured using an Efficient design. Discrete choice models were used to identify the preferences of respondents and discuss some possible sustainable policies that could increase the competitiveness of the region. The model structures studied were: multinomial logit; mixed logit as a special case of random coefficients; mixed logit error components- considering panel effect and mixed logit error components – including possible correlations between attributes of intermodal alternatives. Parameters estimated from the models were used to compute subjective value of time savings, which was Euro/t.h 0.34 (R$/t. h 1.088) for the selected model. The direct and cross elasticity values of the probability of choosing a transport mode for the different attributes studied show that the shippers significantly value the fulfilment of delivery time and cost, suggesting that those attributes are the most important ones in the choice of transport mode in this State of Brazil. Simulation results suggest investments for increasing the reliability of intermodal alternatives are more effective to encourage intermodality than cost reductions. Policies and investments to encourage multimodality should prioritize the increase of intermodal alternatives reliability and combined policies of cost reduction and reliability.",AcknowledgementsThe authors appreciate the support received from Secretaria de Infraestrutura do RS - SEINFRA in the project “Plano Estadual de Logística de Transportes do Rio Grande do Sul – PELT-RS” and the gratitude to Consórcio STE/SD/Dynatest.,,Transportation Research Part A Policy and Practice,,,,2017-08,2017,,2017-08,102,,202-211,Closed,Article,"Larranaga, Ana Margarita; Arellana, Julian; Senna, Luiz Afonso","Larranaga, Ana Margarita (Industrial and Transportation Engineering Department, Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul, Av.

Variables analyzed were total Hg, CH3Hg+, organic carbon, total nitrogen, grain size, and surface area. In soil samples, total Hg levels were the highest in agricultural soil followed by forest soil and pasture (97.3, 87.6, and 77.1 ng g−1, respectively), and CH3Hg+ was lower than 1.7%. Total Hg levels in leaf litter varied between 22.6 and 34.2 ng g−1, and CH3Hg+ was 4.37%. In sediment, Hg (60–180 ng g−1) and CH3Hg+ (<1%) indicate the transport of these contaminants from soils to this compartment and may be associated with soil use and cover. Multiple regressions were used to understand the dispersion of Hg species, and the effect of each variable varied with the landscape, showing that plant cover should not be ignored in investigations related to Hg species retention in a watershed. The landscapes surveyed in the present study clearly influence the quantitative and qualitative distribution of Hg species. On the other hand, anthropic processes associated with changes in soil use did not have any critical effects on the absolute levels of total Hg and CH3Hg+, meaning that the landscapes evaluated seem to represent the background concentration of these chemical species for the evaluated watershed.","The authors thank the Laboratory of Environmental Sciences of the State University of the North of Rio de Janeiro (Laboratório de Ciências Ambientais, LCA, da Universidade Estadual Norte Fluminense, UENF) and Wolfgang C.

Its species may have specialist or generalist pollination systems that show geographic patterns, which are synthesised in the Geographic Dichotomy Hypothesis. Here, we assess this hypothesis in five countries in both tropical and extratropical regions, evaluating the pollinator visitation rate and pollinator identity and abundance. We calculate the Shannon diversity index (H') and evenness (J) and evaluate differences between latitude parameters with a Student t-test. Overall, we found more specialised pollination systems in all tropical sites; the richness, diversity and evenness of pollinators was reduced in comparison to extratropical regions, where the pollination system was generalised. Our results support the geographic dichotomy hypothesis in the cacti of South America, suggesting that environmental factors underlying the latitudinal patterns can help to explain differences in the pollination syndrome between tropical and extratropical regions.","The authors thank the Country Club Cochabamba and the Autonomous Municipal Government of Aiquile for allowing the field experiments, also the Postgraduate Department of the Agronomy Faculty and the Major University of San Simón.

For the design of the state observers, we propose to incorporate the parameters to be estimated into the state vector of Liénard-type models of a pipeline such that the observers can be constructed from the modified models. The proposed optimization algorithms guarantee a prescribed observability degree of the modified models by building an optimal input for the identification. The optimality of the input is defined with respect to the minimization of the input energy, whereas the observability through a lower bound for the observability Gramian, which is constructed from the Liénard-type models of the pipeline.

Variations in sediment lithology suggest large and abrupt changes in precipitation during the last glacial and deglacial periods, and into the early Holocene. We measured stable carbon isotope ratios of total organic carbon and long-chain n-alkanes from the core, the latter representing a largely allochthonous (terrestrial) source of organic matter, to reveal past shifts in the relative proportion of C3–C4 terrestrial biomass. We sought to test whether stable carbon isotope results were consistent with other paleoclimate proxies measured in the PI-6 core, and if extraction and isotope analysis of n-alkanes is warranted. The largest δ13C variations are associated with Heinrich Events. Carbon isotope values in sediments deposited during the last glacial maximum indicate moderate precipitation with little fluctuation. The deglacial was a period of pronounced climate variability, e.g. a relatively warm and moist Bølling–Allerød, but a cool and dry Younger Dryas. Arid periods of the deglacial were inferred from samples with high δ13C values in total organic carbon, which reflect times of greater proportions of C4 plants. These inferences are supported by stable isotope measurements on ostracod shells and relative abundance of grass pollen from the same depths in core PI-6. Similar trends in carbon stable isotopes measured on bulk organic carbon and n-alkanes suggest that carbon isotope measures on bulk organic carbon in sediments from this lake are sufficient to infer past climate-driven shifts in local vegetation.","We thank the following institutions and individuals in Guatemala who provided assistance to this project: Universidad del Valle, Universidad San Carlos, Ministerio de Ambiente y Recursos Naturales, Consejo Nacional de Areas Protegidas, Instituto de Antropología e Historia, Autoridad Para el Manejo y Desarrollo Sostenible de la Cuenca del Lago Petén-Itzá, Wildlife Conservation Society, Alex Arrivillaga, Cathy Lopez, Margaret Dix, Michael Dix, Margarita Palmieri, David, Rosita, and Kelsey Kuhn, and the staff at La Casa de Don David, Lico Godoy, Tony Ortiz, Franz Sperisen, Luis Toruño, Julian Tesucún, Liseth Perez, Melisa Orozco, Silja Ramirez, Gabriela Alfaro, and Jacobo Blijdenstein.

The drain should be established to control leakage of bile and prevent biliary peritonitis, before transferring the patient to a specialist in complex hepatobiliary surgery facility. In patients who are not recognized intraoperatively, the IBDI manifest late postoperative fever, abdominal pain, peritonitis or obstructive jaundice. If there is bile leak, percutaneous cholangiography should be done to define the biliary anatomy, and control leakage through percutaneous biliary stent. The repair is performed six to eight weeks after patient stabilization. If there is biliary obstruction, cholangiography and biliary drainage are indicated to control sepsis before repair. The ultimate aim is to restore the flow of bile into the gastrointestinal tract to prevent the formation of calculi, stenosis, cholangitis and biliary cirrhosis.

Pollen and spores record, which spans for the past ~1930 yr BP, shows that Páramo vegetation has been dominated by Poaceae, Asteraceae, Lycopodiaceae, and Ericaceae. The sub-Andean forest is characterized by Urticaceae and Acalypha (Euphorbiaceae), while the Andean forest by Quercus (Fagaceae), Hedyosmum (Chloranthaceae), and Weinmannia (Cunoniaceae). We observed that aquatic vegetation pollen such as Cyperaceae were abundant, indicating marsh conditions in most of the record. Cold and warm periods, inferred from Páramo and Andean forest elements, respectively, reveal that the warmest periods were registered at ~1000 cal. yr BP (~AD 1016) (‘Medieval Climatic Optimum’) and in the last century, whereas the coldest ones around 1200 cal. yr BP (AD 831) and 650–150 cal. yr BP (AD 1368–1750) (‘Little Ice Age’). The pollen signal suggests that warm periods were dry and cold periods were wet. A comparison of these results with some localities of northwestern Colombia, the Caribbean, and South America was made, displaying variations that reflect regional and/or global climatic phenomena such as Intertropical Convergence Zone and the El Niño Southern Oscillation. In the past 50 years, the decrease in Quercus, Weinmannia and Clusia recovery and the increase in Rumex, Plantago, and Gunnera may reflect human impact derived from livestock, agriculture, and/or firewood.

Despite the apparent initial success of the policy, locally called pico y placa, the problems of congestion and pollution have re-emerged over time. In response, local authorities are considering removing this driving restriction and replacing it with a congestion charge policy, also known as road pricing.To evaluate the impact of the policy implementation on drivers' behaviour, we estimated a hybrid choice model including latent variables. The model was used to analyse the influence of congestion charging policy factors such as tolls and schedules on the modal split during the morning peak hour.The elasticities analysis shows a high tendency of car drivers to change their departure time to avoid paying the toll. A suggested charge of COP 6000 (USD 3.33) and a more extensive charging schedule compared to the current pico y placa schedule reduces the car market share by about 37% which is similar to the car use reduction generated by a two-digit pico y placa policy in the short term.",,,Transport Policy,,,,2017-11,2017,,2017-11,60,,119-130,Closed,Article,"Ramos, Raúl; Cantillo, Víctor; Arellana, Julián; Sarmiento, Iván","Ramos, Raúl (Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Universidad del Norte, Kilómetro 5 Antigua Vía a Puerto Colombia, Barranquilla, Colombia; Strategic Public Transport System in Monteria, Montería Ciudad Amable S.A.S, Carrera 4a.

The results show that formal institutions affect ICT adoption in this group of countries, with government effectiveness having the largest positive effects and regulations the largest negative effects. However, while formal institutions generally affect ICT adoption positively, population and economic growth tend to constrain ICT adoption more in low-income countries than middle-income countries. The results further demonstrate that the effects of ICT adoption on development are comparable to those of domestic credit and foreign direct investment. Ceteris paribus, one may conclude that external factors like foreign aid are more limiting to inclusive development than internal factors. This suggests that developing countries, African countries in this specific case, can enhance their ICT adoption for development by improving formal institutions and by strengthening domestic determinants of ICT adoption. Both represent opportunities for further research.",We thank the editor and one anonymous reviewer for constructive comments on earlier drafts of the paper.,,,Catalyzing Development through ICT Adoption,"Harleen Kaur, Ewa Lechman, Adam Marszk",,2017-06-06,2017,2017-06-06,2017,,,175-203,Closed,Chapter,"Andrés, Antonio Rodrìguez; Amavilah, Voxi; Asongu, Simplice","Andrés, Antonio Rodrìguez (School of Business, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); Amavilah, Voxi (Estrella Mountain College, Phoenix, AZ, USA); Asongu, Simplice (African Governance and Development Institute, Yaoundé, Cameroon; Department of Economics, University of South Africa, P.

The approach proposed is based on the summary of all tasks required to assemble and disassemble a predefined set of modules to generate several product variants, which comprise different working levels or functionalities. The aim of the method is to provide a useful tool to designers in the analysis of product complexity regarding use and further phases in which the assembly and disassembly of modules are required. The benefits and usefulness of the metrics are oriented to enhance the sustainability performance of products through the measurement of complexity in modular systems for the decision-making during the design stage. The reduction of complexity involves significant benefits in all lifecycle phases of product, especially when the user or customer is responsible for many related tasks (maintenance, upgrading, reconfiguration and final disposal of modules). The metrics and their calculation process are illustrated using two case study products.",,This work was supported by COLCIENCIAS through the Ph.D. National Scholarship Program No. 617-2.

The fault process in underground cables is gradual and characterized by a series of sub-cycle incipient faults associated with an arc voltage. These events often are unnoticed and eventually result in permanent faults. This paper presents an incipient fault location formulation for distribution networks with underground cables. Presented formulation is composed by a time-domain system model and parameter estimation strategy. System model derivation considers distribution networks inherent features as unbalanced operation and underground distribution cables capacitive effect. Further, incipient fault characteristics as fault arc voltage are considered. The proposed system model is an overdetermined linear system of equations in which the fault location is estimated through a parameter estimation approach. Parameter estimation is made through a Non-Negative Weighted Least Square Estimator (NNWLSE). Smoothing and curve-fitting procedures are applied to input data aiming to decrease the noise effect. A load current compensation strategy is proposed to reduce its effect in the fault current estimation and a back substitution method is proposed for estimation refinement. Validation is performed using real-life distribution network with underground cable data simulated on ATP/EMTP. Test results are encouraging and demonstrate the method’s potential for real life applications. An average error of 1.95% is obtained when compared with 6.48% derived using the state-of-art.",,,International Journal of Electrical Power & Energy Systems,,,,2017-09,2017,,2017-09,90,,112-123,Closed,Article,"Herrera-Orozco, A.R.; Bretas, A.S.; Orozco-Henao, C.; Iurinic, L.U.; Mora-Flórez, J.","Herrera-Orozco, A.R.

To this end, the enclosed paper discusses the proposed StereoDIC system configuration, introduces the technique for acquiring full-field shape, deformation and strain measurements using 3D Digital Image Correlation (StereoDIC), verifies the proposed technique through high fidelity laboratory and computer simulations and proposes a computational algorithm that automates the calculation of the transfer length using these measurements. Our studies show that the proposed approach is an effective and accurate non-contacting technique for determining the small surface strain fields in full-scale, prestressed concrete beam specimens, providing essential data to reliably estimate the transfer length in prestressed concrete beams.

Its website invites women to share narratives of their experience of street harassment as well as photos of the men who harassed them. We treat Hollaback! as an exemplar of feminist online activism and aim to identify lessons for other feminist online activists and organizations. In particular, we argue that the site’s narrative-image posts provide a powerful means of enacting countervisuality in public spaces. After analyzing 26 narrative-image postings on the Hollaback! website, we identify three collective rhetorical effects of countervisuality: Altering the traditional dichotomy of male/observer and female/observed, enacting feminist rhetorical agency through mobility in public spaces, and generating women’s solidarity through shared experience. We then argue that Hollaback!’s strategy of countervisuality insufficiently enacted the core principles of feminist rhetorical resilience, especially the concept of mêtis.

Beyond the Salar de Uyuni, the largest salt flat in the world, lies a relatively untouched realm of volcanoes and salt lakes. Ancient shorelines from intervals in the Altiplano history, when large lakes were more abundant, may hold important information about a time when the climate in this region was punctuated by much wetter phases before present day aridity took a hold. Previous studies in this region have reconstructed robust chronological timelines for such events and highlight two large lake phases over the last 18 thousand years (the Tauca and Coipasa lake phases); however higher resolution climate data are scarce. Current studies on climate proxies from smaller lakes in southern Bolivia may shed light on some of these higher resolution climate events including El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events. Laminated tufa found around the palaeoshorelines of the West Lípez Lakes is one such proxy, and can be analysed to investigate the potential roles of annual versus shorter‐term climatic variation in the evolving Altiplano climate at the time.",,,Geology Today,,,,2017-05-25,2017,2017-05-25,2017-05,33,3,101-107,Closed,Article,"Clark, Nicola; Wallis, Simon","Clark, Nicola (Graduate School of Environmental Studies, Nagoya University, Chikusa‐ku, Nagoya 464‐8601, Japan); Wallis, Simon (Graduate School of Environmental Studies, Nagoya University, Chikusa‐ku, Nagoya 464‐8601, Japan)",,"Clark, Nicola (Nagoya University); Wallis, Simon (Nagoya University)",1,0,,0.13,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1085589210,37 Earth Sciences; 3702 Climate Change Science; 3705 Geology; 3709 Physical Geography and Environmental Geoscience,13 Climate Action

We focus on recognizing complex activities composed of sequential or simultaneous atomic actions characterized by body motions of a single actor. We tackle this problem by introducing a hierarchical compositional model that operates at three levels of abstraction. At the lowest level, geometric and motion descriptors are used to learn a dictionary of body poses. At the intermediate level, sparse compositions of these body poses are used to obtain meaningful representations for atomic human actions. Finally, at the highest level, spatial and temporal compositions of these atomic actions are used to represent complex human activities. Our results show the benefits of using a hierarchical model that exploits the sharing and composition of body poses into atomic actions, and atomic actions into activities. A quantitative evaluation using two benchmark datasets illustrates the advantages of our model to perform action and activity recognition.",,,Image and Vision Computing,,,,2017-03,2017,,2017-03,59,,63-75,Closed,Article,"Lillo, Ivan; Niebles, Juan Carlos; Soto, Alvaro","Lillo, Ivan (Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile, 4860 Vicuna Mackenna, Santiago, Chile); Niebles, Juan Carlos (Universidad del Norte, Colombia, Stanford University, USA); Soto, Alvaro (Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile, 4860 Vicuna Mackenna, Santiago, Chile)","Lillo, Ivan (Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile)","Lillo, Ivan (Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile); Niebles, Juan Carlos (Universidad del Norte); Soto, Alvaro (Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile)",47,9,,11.94,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1024434766,46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4602 Artificial Intelligence,

The MANOVA performed with all variables and metals, revealed independent effects of fish, tissue and river. In the case of the fish factor, Cu, Cr, Mo and Zn showed statistically higher concentrations in catfish compared with silverside for all tissues and in all rivers (p < 0.05). In the case of the tissue factor, Al, Cr, Fe and Mn had statistically higher concentrations in liver and gills than in muscle (p  < 0.05). For the river effect, the analysis showed higher concentrations of Cr, Mn and Pb in the Cogoti river and the lower concentrations in the Recoleta river. These results suggest that not all metals have the same pattern of accumulation; however, some metals tend to accumulate more in readily catfish, probably due to their benthic habit, and in liver and gill tissue, probably as a result of accumulation from food sources and respiration.","The authors thank T Walter for edition, GS Muñoz for metal analysis, S Scott, R Gauci and C Quezada-Romegialli for help during field work.

Both plasminogen (Pg) and tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA) bind to MBP with high affinity. We investigated the kinetics and mechanisms involved in this process using immobilized MBP and found that Pg activation by t-PA is significantly stimulated by MBP. This mechanism involves the binding of t-PA via a lysine-dependent mechanism to the Lys91 residue of the MBP NH2-terminal region Asp82 -Pro99, and the binding of Pg via a lysine-dependent mechanism to the Lys122 residue of the MBP COOH-terminal region Leu109-Gly126. In this context, MBP mimics fibrin and because MBP is a plasmin substrate, our results suggest direct participation of the Pg activation system on MBP physiology.","This study was supported by a grant from Fondo Nacional de Desarrollo Cientίfico y Tecnolόgico de Chile, FONDECYT No 1130451.",,Biochemical and Biophysical Research Communications,,,Binding Sites; Enzyme Activation; Humans; Kinetics; Lysine; Myelin Basic Protein; Plasminogen; Protein Binding; Protein Domains; Proteolysis; Tissue Plasminogen Activator,2017-06-23,2017,2017-06-23,2017-08,490,3,855-860,Closed,Article,"Gonzalez-Gronow, Mario; Fiedler, Jenny L.; Gomez, Cristian Farias; Wang, Fang; Ray, Rupa; Ferrell, Paul D.; Pizzo, Salvatore V.","Gonzalez-Gronow, Mario (Department of Biological Sciences, Laboratory of Environmental Neurotoxicology, Faculty of Medicine, Universidad Católica del Norte, Coquimbo, Chile; Department of Pathology, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, NC, USA); Fiedler, Jenny L.

Hemoconcentration during maximum exercise in miners with chronic intermittent exposure to hypobaric hypoxia (3800 m). High Alt Med Biol. 19:15-20, 2018.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of maximum exercise on hemoconcentration in miners with chronic intermittent hypobaric hypoxia (CIHH) at 3800 m.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Sixteen miners with CIHH at high altitude (3800 m) were subjected to maximum exercise levels on a cycle ergometer, increasing exercise load by 50 W every 3 minutes at sea level and high altitude (3800 m). During exercise, arterial oxygen saturation and heart rate were measured. Blood samples were taken at each step to measure hemoglobin concentration and hematocrit. Arterial blood oxygen content was also calculated.
RESULTS: At sea level, a decrease in arterial oxygen saturation to 92.1% ± 2.5% was observed at 150 W and the hematocrit, hemoglobin concentration and oxygen content were not altered. At high altitude, arterial oxygen saturation decreased, reaching 88.2% ± 4.9% at 50 W and remained constant during the entire exercise protocol. Hemoglobin concentration and hematocrit increased reaching 16.4 ± 0.9 g/dL and 48.8% ± 1.6%, respectively, at 100 W and were maintained until recovery. Arterial oxygen content was constant during exercise and increased in the recovery period.
CONCLUSION: An increase in hemoglobin concentration during exercise compensates for the decline in arterial oxygen saturation, meanwhile arterial oxygen content remains constant.",,,High Altitude Medicine & Biology,,,Adult; Altitude; Atmospheric Pressure; Exercise; Exercise Test; Heart Rate; Hematocrit; Hemoglobins; Humans; Hypoxia; Mining; Oxygen; Physical Exertion,2017-10-16,2017,2017-10-16,2018-03,19,1,15-20,Closed,Article,"Moraga, Fernando A.; Osorio, Jorge; Calderón-Jofré, Rodrigo; Pedreros, Andrés","Moraga, Fernando A.

1182,pub.1090980924,10.1108/md-08-2016-0597,,,A method for designing strategy maps using DEMATEL and linear programming,"Purpose
                    The purpose of this paper is to propose a quantitative methodology for the identification of the causal relationships between strategic objectives in a strategy map of a balanced scorecard. This is done to face the possible weaknesses described in the literature regarding the causal links and the difficulty in validating the relationships.
                  
                  
                    Design/methodology/approach
                    The proposed method combines the multi-criteria decision-making method called decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL) and an optimization model. DEMATEL is used to establish the importance of the strategic relations between strategic objectives, and the optimization model is used to find the relations that are more “important” and should be included in the strategy map. The method was created by reviewing the existing literature, modeling the problem, and applying it in a company.
                  
                  
                    Findings
                    The most important results of applying this methodological design include that the proposed method maintains the BSC classical structure; it also enables the generation of several alternatives to support the decision-making process in terms of strategic objectives for a better organizational performance.
                  
                  
                    Practical implications
                    The method facilitates the decision-making process by presenting several alternatives of strategy maps according to different levels of organizational criteria. In fact, these alternatives help the organization in focusing on the most important aspects of the strategy map. Consequently, managers may identify where to pay more attention and resources in order to achieve the most important objectives of the company. Hence, this method, as a support for decision makers, enables (and requires) the active participation of senior managers and any kind of decision makers in creating and valuating objectives, relations, constraints, importance, and parameters of the optimization model.
                  
                  
                    Originality/value
                    DEMATEL has been used to design strategy maps. The contribution of the paper is the use of a linear programming model to select those relationships that should be included in the strategy map. It allows manager to focus on those strategic elements that are important from a strategic point of view. The application in a company showed that the contribution is not only theoretical but practical as well.","The authors would like to thank the Department of Industrial Engineering of the University of Santiago of Chile and the Department of Science and Technology of the University of Santiago of Chile (Project DICYT-USACH, No. 060517QLL) for their financial support.

Living highland Andeans show adaptive physiological responses to these conditions through both developmental plasticity and natural selection. Given the longevity of human settlement in this region, these same responses ought to have affected ancient Andeans. This paper tests whether developmental plasticity or natural selection best explains the morphological signatures of adaptations to high-altitude hypoxia in ancient highland Andeans. I compare four groups of skeletons: two groups from lowland regions and two groups from high elevations. Previous work shows that the two highland groups have small bodies and voluminous ribs compared with the lowland groups indicating morphological adaptations to high-altitude environments. This paper compares patterns of intrinsic variation and sexual dimorphism in body size, limb lengths, and rib morphology in highland and lowland groups to test if developmental plasticity or natural selection underlies these morphological differences. The four groups share similar patterns of sexual dimorphism and intrinsic variation in body size and limb lengths. The two highland samples show greater degrees of sexual dimorphism in rib morphology than the lowlanders. Patterns of intrinsic variation in rib morphology do not sort by altitude. Both natural selection and developmental plasticity in response to high-altitude hypoxia likely shaped skeletal morphology in ancient highland Andeans.","AcknowledgementsI thank Bonnie Pitblado and Kurt Rademaker for inviting me to participate in the Society of American Archaeology symposium on the role high altitude landscapes in the peopling of the New World.

Although an abundant literature addresses the relationship between openness and economic growth, the real effect of trade liberalisation is still ambiguous and undetermined. Most previous studies have ignored the selection effects of strict labour regulations on international trade. The main objective of this study is to measure the role of labour regulations in moderating the contribution of trade to economic growth among 30 Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development countries for the period 2006–2013. In doing so, we employ a one-step Generalised Method of Moments system estimation method. Our results reveal that openness to trade does not have a robust and significant effect on growth. However, the interaction of openness with strict labour regulations enhances the contributions of trade to growth.",,,The Economic and Labour Relations Review,,,,2017-12,2017,2023-01-01,2017-12,28,4,555-564,Closed,Article,"Polat, Burçak; Andrés, Antonio Rodríguez","Polat, Burçak (Antalya Science University, Turkey); Andrés, Antonio Rodríguez (VŠB – Technical University of Ostrava, Czech Republic)","Andrés, Antonio Rodríguez (Technical University of Ostrava)","Polat, Burçak (Antalya Science University, Turkey); Andrés, Antonio Rodríguez (Technical University of Ostrava)",0,0,,0.0,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1092965398,38 Economics; 3801 Applied Economics; 3802 Econometrics; 44 Human Society; 4404 Development Studies,8 Decent Work and Economic Growth

Risk assessments provide information on the pressure to which the coastal zone is exposed and its adaptive capacity. In these assessments, it is important to examine interacting physical attributes and socio-economic, conservational and archeological/cultural characteristics. Determination of coastal susceptibility or vulnerability is an important instrument for managers/planners for coastal preservation, protection and development, as vulnerability outcomes provide baseline information and a scientific basis for any envisaged coastal erosion management plan together with mitigation measures under sustainability aspects. This chapter deals with a methodological approach to risk determination of extreme wave impacts. The approach is based on selection and evaluation of three types of variables: i) the forcing variables contributing to extreme wave-induced erosion, ii) dynamic variables that determine the resilience to erosion (susceptibility) and (iii) the vulnerable targets grouped in three different contexts (socio-economic, ecological and heritage). These are combined into two separate indices, the Hazard Index (combining forcing and susceptibility) and the Vulnerability Index, which together constitute the Coastline Risk to Extreme Waves as a single numerical measure of the risk for a given area. Maps generated with this methodology can be used as a guideline contributing to the determination of causes, processes and consequences derived from the extreme waves and associated processes.","This work is a contribution to research groups: “Geology, Geophysics and Marine – Coastal Process”, Universidad del Atlántico (Barranquilla, Colombia), “Coastal and Marine Research Group”, University of Wales Trinity Saint David (Swansea, Wales, UK), “RNM-328”, Universidad de Cadiz (Andalusia, Spain) and “Coastal Oceanography Laboratory”, Federal University of Santa Catarina (Florianopolis, Brazil).",,Coastal Research Library,"Beach Management Tools - Concepts, Methodologies and Case Studies","Camilo M.

Only a small fraction of all studied fish (2.1%; 6 individuals) contained microplastic particles in their digestive tract. Microplastics found were degraded hard fragments and threads, ranging from 1.1 to 4.9 (3.8±SD 2.4) mm in length, and of various colours, which suggests that the planktivorous fish species examined herein did not capture microplastics on the basis of their colour. The low prevalence of microplastic contamination in planktivorous fishes found in this study suggests that the risk of accidental ingestion by these species might be limited in the coastal upwelled waters of the southeast Pacific, perhaps due to small human population and highly dynamic oceanographic processes.","This study was financed with funds from the United Nation Environment Programme-Global Programme of Action (UNEP/SSFA/DEPI/2016/MCEB-GPA/104.M99-32GPL-11207-SB-001034.02.01.08-14AC0003) through the Comisión Permanente del Pacífico Sur (CPPS).

Although personnel scheduling techniques have been extensively studied and successfully applied, previous treatments of scheduling adjustments in response to demand and employee contingencies have not systematically considered all of the relevant issues. After presenting a mathematical specification of the problem, this study develops various algorithms that search for the best adjustments among all available contingency recovery resources, including transfers of multiskilled employees between different store areas. The proposed formulations also permit interaction between the user/decision maker and the affected employees. The underlying objective is to maximize profits, favoring solutions with fewer schedule modifications in order to minimize worker dissatisfaction. Due to the complexity of the basic model, the problem is divided and simplified using two greedy heuristics. Both algorithms can be implemented with real-world size problems and reach good solutions within minutes. Multiskilled employees prove to be an important reserve capacity for recovery of service levels in the face of unexpected variations. Empirical results using real data from a Chilean chain retailer show that in the worst scenario, the proposed model's schedule adjustments reduced lost profits due to unexpected variations by 18%.",AcknowledgementsThe authors would like to thank the anonymous referees for their helpful comments and insights on this paper.

Here, we study the deletion of the cyclic-3',5'-adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) receptor protein (Crp) in Aeromonas salmonicida, the aetiologic agent of furunculosis in marine and freshwater fish. The Crp protein is a conserved global regulator, controlling physiology processes, like sugar utilization. Deletion of the crp gene has been utilized in live attenuated vaccines for mammals, birds and warm water fish. Here, we characterized the crp gene and reported the effect of a crp deletion in A. salmonicida virulent and non-virulent isolates. We found that A. salmonicida Δcrp was not able to utilize maltose and other sugars, and its generation time was similar to the wild type. A. salmonicida ∆crp showed a higher ability of cell invasion compared to the wild type. Fish challenges showed that A. salmonicida ∆crp is ~6 times attenuated in Oncorhynchus mykiss and conferred protective immunity against the intraperitoneal challenge with A. salmonicida wild type. We concluded that deletion of A. salmonicida crp influences sugar utilization, cell invasion and virulence.

We propose a model for scheduling the entry of these non-critical patients into the Emergency Department which may be helpful for the management of the service dealing with the current growing demand for emergency medical care. We hypothesize that a relocation of these non-critical patients in the expected input pattern, initially provided by actual historical data from the hospital, can lead to an improvement in waiting times for all patients, and therefore, to an improvement in the quality of service from the point of view of the service users, as it could avoid long waiting times in the service.

Most existing studies on the effects of pesticides only evaluate agricultural workers. Therefore, this study sought to establish if individuals indirectly exposed to pesticides, such as residents in agricultural areas, also suffer cognitive impairments. Neuropsychological evaluations were carried out on three groups (n=102): agricultural workers directly exposed to pesticides (n=32), individuals living in agricultural areas indirectly (i.e. environmentally) exposed to pesticides (n=32), and an unexposed control group (n=38). The assessed cognitive processes included memory, executive functions, attention, language praxis, and visuoconstruction. The direct exposure group performed significantly lower in executive function, verbal fluency, and visual and auditory memory tests than the indirect exposure group, which, in turn, performed worse than the unexposed group. Even after adjusting for age, gender, and educational level, both exposure groups showed higher rates of cognitive deficit than control individuals. In conclusion, both direct and indirect chronic exposure to pesticides affects cognitive functioning in adults and, consequently, actions should be taken to protect the health of not only agricultural workers, but also of residents in agricultural areas.","Part of this work was supported by FONDEF D09I1057 (S.C., L.Z.V., and F.P.) and FONDECYT 3120231 (L.Z.V.).

This fatal disease for abalone is produced by a rickettsia-like organism (WS-RLO), the bacterium ""Candidatus Xenohaliotis californiensis"". To evaluate the potential of the red abalone (Haliotis rufescens) to improve its resistance to infection by WS-RLO, the additive genetic component in the variation of this trait was estimated. For this, the variation in infection intensity with WS-RLOs and WS-RLOv (phage-infected RLOs) was analyzed in 56 families of full-sibs maintained for three years in a host-parasite cohabitation aquaculture system. A WS-RLO prevalence of 65% was observed in the analysed population; and from the total WS-RLO inclusions 60% were hyperparasited with the phage (WS-RLOv). The decrease in the food ingestion rate was the sole negative effect associated with increasing WS-RLO intensity of infection, suggesting that the high level of WS-RLOv load may have diminished the symptoms of WS disease in the analyzed abalones. The estimated heritabilities were moderate to mid, but significant, varying from 0.21 to 0.23 and 0.36 for WS-RLO and WS-RLOv infections, respectively. This suggests that variation in resistance to infection with WS-RLO may respond to selection in the evaluated red abalone population. Estimated response to selection (G) for the level of infection by WS-RLO indicated that if the 10% of red abalone with the lowest infection level is selected as broodstock, a 90% reduction in the intensity of infection in the progeny can be expected, even with the lowest estimation of heritability (h2=0.21). This strong response would be also due to the large phenotypic variance of this trait. Strong positive correlations, both phenotypic and genotypic, were observed between infection intensities with WS-RLO and WS-RLOv, indicating that selection to increase resistance to one of the types of RLOs will affect resistance in the other in the same direction. This is the first study that demonstrates the existence of additive genetic variation for resistance to WS-RLO in abalone. Consequently, it is possible to increase the resistance to WS-RLO in H. rufescens by selective breeding, which can be an economically attractive and environmentally friendly manner to reduce mortalities and growth effects caused by WS in abalone farms.","AcknowledgementWe are grateful to the Centro de Producción de Abalón de la Universidad Católica del Norte (CPA-UCN) for their invaluable contribution in providing all the necessary facilities required to undertake this study under controlled conditions.

There were two guiding principles to these institutions: moderation and conservation. Moderating institutions should act as buffers between Legislative and Executive Powers to prevent either power encroaching onto the prerogatives of the other. Conservative institutions should undo unconstitutional acts and supervise constitutional order. The article shows Mexicans not only experimented with both types of institution, but also reworked them to create a new moderating instance within the Executive Power.
                  En este ensayo se discuten las instituciones constitucionales mexicanas establecidas en las décadas de 1820 y 1830 para impedir que los poderes de gobierno abusaran de sus facultades. Estas instituciones se construyeron a partir de dos principios: el de moderación y el de conservación. Las instituciones moderadoras debían mediar entre los poderes legislativo y ejecutivo para evitar que uno usurpara las prerrogativas del otro. Las instituciones conservadoras debían revocar los actos constitucionales y supervisar el orden constitucional. Se señala que los mexicanos experimentaron con ambos tipos de institución y, asimismo, crearon un nuevo organismo moderador dentro del poder ejecutivo.",,,Mexican Studies/Estudios Mexicanos,,,,2017-02-01,2017,2017-02-24,2017-02-01,33,1,153-166,Closed,Article,"Andrews, Catherine","Andrews, Catherine (División de Historia Centro de Investigación y Docencia Económicas (CIDE))",,"Andrews, Catherine (División de Historia Centro de Investigación y Docencia Económicas (CIDE))",1,0,,1.5,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1083878329,"43 History, Heritage and Archaeology; 4303 Historical Studies",

The impact of this shift on the family is high, having both an emotional and economic toll. The aim of this paper is to review the main changes that occur in family dynamics for patients with schizophrenia. The article addresses three central themes: (i) changes in the family at the onset of the disorder, (ii) consequences for family members because of their caregiver role, and (iii) family interventions aimed at improving the complex dynamics within the family. After analyzing and discussing these themes, it is observed that despite advances in the field, the viability of taking care of a patient with schizophrenia by the family remains a challenge. Improving care will require commitments from the family, the mental health service system, and local and national governments for greater investments to improve the quality of life of society in general and individuals with schizophrenia in particular.",This research was funded by the Universidad de Tarapacá through Proyecto Mayor de Investigación Científica y Tecnológica UTA n°3732-16 and the Convenio de Desempeño UTA-MINEDUC.,,Current Psychiatry Reports,,,Caregivers; Cost of Illness; Expressed Emotion; Family Relations; Family Therapy; Help-Seeking Behavior; Humans; Interdisciplinary Communication; Intersectoral Collaboration; Mental Health Services; Professional-Family Relations; Prognosis; Quality of Life; Schizophrenia; Schizophrenic Psychology; Social Stigma; Social Support,2017-01-17,2017,2017-01-17,2017-01,19,1,2,Closed,Article,"Caqueo-Urízar, Alejandra; Rus-Calafell, Mar; Craig, Thomas K.

On the other hand, during all those years, no South American country became a part of the “core” of the global trade network. Understanding this context, the present study focuses on the role played by South America in an evolving global trade network, using alternative indicators to those commonly proposed by networks’ theory. We also evaluate South America’s integration efforts represented by four regional trade-blocs: the CAN, the ALBA, the MERCOSUR, and the UNASUR. From the country level, we conclude that Brazil has become a “sub-core” in South America, at the same time that the USA and China compete to gain more influence in the region.

It uses the intergranular strain concept, previously proposed by Niemunis and Herle (1997) to enhance the capabilities of some existing hypoplastic models under cyclic loading. In contrast to its predecessor, the ISA-plasticity presents a completely different formulation to incorporate an elastic locus depending on a strain amplitude. However, it keeps similar advantages and brings other new ones such as the elastic locus and improved simulations of the plastic accumulation upon a number of cycles. In the present article, some numerical investigations are made to evaluate the performance of an ISA-plasticity based model on simulations with repetitive loading. We have chosen to couple the ISA-plasticity with the hypoplastic model by Wolfferdorff to simulate some experiments. At the beginning of the article, the theory of the ISA-plasticity is briefly explained. Subsequently, its numerical implementation is step by step detailed. A semi-explicit algorithm is proposed and some hints are given to allow the coupling with other models. At the end, some simulations of experiments with the Karlsruhe fine sand are shown in which the performance of the model under repetitive loading is evaluated. The behavior of the plastic accumulation is examined upon a number of cycles and some remarks are given about the current investigation.",,,Lecture Notes in Applied and Computational Mechanics,Holistic Simulation of Geotechnical Installation Processes,Theodoros Triantafyllidis,,2017-01-26,2017,2017-01-26,2017,82,,341-362,Closed,Chapter,"Fuentes, William; Triantafyllidis, Theodoros; Lascarro, Carlos","Fuentes, William (University del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); Triantafyllidis, Theodoros (Institute of Soil Mechanics and Rock Mechanics, Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, Karlsruhe, Germany); Lascarro, Carlos (University del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia)","Fuentes, William (Universidad del Norte)","Fuentes, William (Universidad del Norte); Triantafyllidis, Theodoros (Karlsruhe Institute of Technology); Lascarro, Carlos (Universidad del Norte)",10,1,,1.75,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1074197307,40 Engineering; 4005 Civil Engineering; 4019 Resources Engineering and Extractive Metallurgy,
983,pub.1084504328,10.1002/ajpa.23206,28319276,,Comparisons of statistical techniques to assess age‐related skeletal markers in bioarchaeology,"OBJECTIVES: Many authors argue that inconsistencies between studies of skeletal markers are based on different data collection protocols, especially when comparing age-related markers such as osteoarthritis. Less attention is given to the choice of statistical techniques that are used to test the hypotheses associated with the data. This paper addresses how different statistical techniques compare the prevalence of age-related skeletal indicators, specifically osteoarthritis.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Osteoarthritis prevalence was scored in eight postcranial joints in 243 adult individuals from seven prehistoric archaeological sites in Central California, and data was compared between three time periods [Early (4800-2800 BP), Middle (2800-1200 BP), and Late (1200-250 BP)] using commonly used statistical tests: chi-square, Fisher's exact, and odds ratios. In addition, we analyzed the data with tests that are able to take into consideration the effect of age on osteoarthritis prevalence: ANCOVA and Factorial ANOVA. Finally, bootstraps were applied to the data to investigate how fluctuating frequencies, sample size, and age-at-death distributions affected the interpretations resulting from each test.
RESULTS: The results demonstrate that the tests that consider age as a covariate (ANCOVA and Factorial ANOVA) are more efficient in rejecting the null hypothesis when smaller magnitudes of difference are observed between samples, irrespective of sample size, even though osteoarthritis prevalence fails to meet assumptions of normal distribution and homoscedasticity.
DISCUSSION: ANCOVAs or Factorial ANOVAs that incorporate age as a covariate should be considered more often in studies that test different prevalences of age-related osteological markers among past populations.","The authors thank Dr. Tim White, Natasha Johnson, and Dr. Socorro Baez‐Molgado for facilitating access to the research collections at the Phoebe Hearst Museum.

Likewise, the fact that the LMSs do not supply intuitive mechanisms for the customization of the teaching-learning process considering learning styles was also identified.

Pottery, Chronology, and Settlement","This chapter presents new evidence, such as unpublished radiocarbon dating and the analysis of material context elements from sites located in the central sector of Quebrada de Humahuaca, considered in classical proposals as part of the Middle Period (600–900 AD). As a result of these studies, radiocarbon datings were obtained, repositioning Isla manifestations in the interval between the 12th and 14th centuries. This allows the proposal of interpretive schemes about the interrelation of small conglomerates such as La Isla de Tilcara with villages in domestic terraces, given that they were contemporaries according to this new evidence. In this sense, the strong contrast between landscape elements and materiality—mainly ceramics—leads to the formulation of hypotheses concerning the possibility that, after the fall of Tiwanaku and during later times, began the arrival of small groups from the Altiplano towards Quebrada de Humahuaca, a region that did not have a significant population density at that time.","We particularly thank to Armando Mendoza, Presentación Aramayo, Daniel Aramayo, and the staff of the Archeological Deposit of the Museo Arqueológico “Dr. E.

As a result, educational institutions need to prepare students to succeed in this global working environment by providing educational experiences, where the required professional skills can be acquired. The authors have used multinational design projects as a project-based learning activity to prepare students with global competencies. However, as any other learning activity, the pedagogical effectiveness of those projects depends largely on the intrinsic motivation and interest of students. Therefore, the main goal of this paper was to determine the level of motivation of engineering students participating in a multinational collaborative design project, and make a comparison of such indicator based on gender, geographical location, and class standing. For this purpose, a survey based on the intrinsic motivation inventory was administered to students before starting their participation in the multinational project. The data collected provide information in five constructs: interest, perceived competence, pressure, perceived choice, and value. These constructs provide an indication about students’ motivation when undertaking a multinational collaborative project. The engineering design collaboration included students from six different countries, and their responses to the questionnaire were analyzed. A total of 164 responses were considered valid, their responses were statistically analyzed for internal consistency, and proper constructs are selected. Results indicate that there was a high level of motivation to participate in the project, with few significant differences based on geographical location and class standing, not gender. This paper yields good information about students’ interests, beliefs, and feelings when participating in an international collaborative project.","Thanks to Sheila Lascano, Universidad Federico Santa Maria, Chile; Vlad Ivashyn, Penn State Brandywine, USA; Carlos Sacchelli, Universidade Federal Santa Catarina, Brazil; and Jorge Duque, Escuela Politecnica del Litoral, Ecuador, for their contribution with the multinational projects and helping collect the data for this work.",,IEEE Revista Iberoamericana de Tecnologias del Aprendizaje,,,,2017-11-01,2017,2017-12-01,2017-11-01,12,4,218-226,Closed,Article,"Rodriguez, Jorge; Esparragoza, Ivan; Ocampo, Jared R.; Viganò, Roberto","Rodriguez, Jorge (Department of Engineering Design, Manufacturing, and Management Systems, Western Michigan University, Kalamazoo, MI, 49008, USA); Esparragoza, Ivan (School of Engineering Design, Technology and Professional Programs, Pennsylvania State University, State College, PA, 16801, USA); Ocampo, Jared R.

The factors influencing the ingestion of microplastics by fish remain unclear despite their importance to a better understanding of the routes of microplastics through marine food webs. Here, we compare microplastics and planktonic organisms in surface waters and as food items of 20 Amberstripe scads (Decapterus muroadsi) captured along the coast of Rapa Nui (Easter Island) to assess the hypothesis that fish ingest microplastics resembling their natural prey. Sixteen (80%) of the scad had ingested one to five microplastics, mainly blue polyethylene fragments that were similar in colour and size to blue copepod species consumed by the same fish. These results suggest that planktivorous fish, as a consequence of their feeding behaviour as visual predators, are directly exposed to floating microplastics. This threat may be exacerbated in the clear oceanic waters of the subtropical gyres, where anthropogenic litter accumulates in great quantity. Our study highlights the menace of microplastic contamination on the integrity of fragile remote ecosystems and the urgent need for efficient plastic waste management.","We thank Erika Meerhoff for allowing us access to her samples to take the pictures of copepods shown here, Katharina Herzog for the many hours she spent sorting plankton samples, Enrique Hey for capturing the fish, Evelyn Lostarnau for designing the pictures of Fig. 3, Diego F.

952,pub.1092475343,10.1002/ajpa.23346,29090738,,Brief communication: A re‐evaluation of the health index of southern Brazilian shellmound populations,"OBJECTIVES: The southern Brazilian shellmounds provide archaeological evidence of prolonged human activity in the coast from approximately 6000 to 1000 BP. Shellmound building populations exploited the rich coastal estuarine zones, and the human remains recovered from them are important sources of information on health and overall lifestyle of these mid-Holocene groups. Therefore, they were included in the Western Hemisphere Global History of Health project. The shellmounds contribute the highest Health Index in the Western Hemisphere, but these conclusions are based on collections that exclude postcranial remains. Here, we reconstruct the Health Index for one specific shellmound using both cranial and postcranial remains to determine whether the initial studies might misrepresent the relative health of the Brazilian shellmound builders.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The Health Index was calculated for a sample of 18 complete skeletons recovered from the shellmound Porto do Rio Vermelho 02 (Santa Catarina Island, Brazil). The Heath Index was calculated with and without postcranial markers and the results are compared with the Western Hemisphere Global History of Health data.
RESULTS: The Health Index for Porto do Rio Vermelho 02 is lower than the reported average for American series in the Western Hemisphere Global History of Health Project and considerably lower than the original index reported for Brazilian shellmounds. This discrepancy is due to an increased prevalence of infectious disease and low stature.
CONCLUSIONS: Although the Health Index remains a useful comparison statistic, re-evaluation of fragmentary skeletal remains demonstrates the need for caution when applying it to incomplete skeletal series.",,"Funding information Fundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de São Paulo(FAPESP), Grant/Award Number: 04‐01253‐0, 04‐01321‐6, 99‐0670‐7; Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico, Grant/Award Number: 300917‐2010‐4.",American Journal of Biological Anthropology,,,"Adolescent; Adult; Archaeology; Bone and Bones; Brazil; Child; Child, Preschool; Environment; Female; Health Status; History, Ancient; Humans; Infant; Infant, Newborn; Male; Middle Aged; Stress, Physiological; Young Adult",2017-11,2017,2017-11,2018-02,165,2,353-362,Closed,Article,"Hubbe, Mark; Green, Madelyn K.; Cheverko, Colleen M.; Neves, Walter A.","Hubbe, Mark (Department of Anthropology, Ohio State University, 147W 18th Avenue, Columbus, Ohio 43210; Instituto de Arqueología y Antropología, Universidad Católica del Norte, Gustavo Le Paige 380, San Pedro de Atacama 141‐0000, Chile); Green, Madelyn K.

Production of diapausing eggs is frequently observed in monogonont rotifers, previously changing from asexual to partial sexual reproduction (mixis). In despite that zooplankton are frequently used in ecotoxicological assessment because of their sensitivity to various toxicants and their important role in the ecosystems, toxicity evaluations often consider the directly exposed population produced by parthenogenetic reproduction, exclusively. We assessed experimentally effects of exposure to metals on mixis delay and fitness of hatchlings of the rotifer Brachionus plicatilis obtained from a brackish water lagoon with high metal content, especially copper. We show that sub-lethal concentrations of copper affected traits related to sexual reproduction and diapausing egg production in the rotifer. Copper addition did not delay the start of mixis, suggesting that rapid initiation of mixis is promoted in risky environments, according to the hypothesis of mixis as an escape strategy. Higher investment in mixis was obtained when individuals were exposed to metal. Addition of copper negatively affected the hatching success of diapausing eggs and performance of hatchlings. Nevertheless, these effects were greater for individuals formed in non-metal conditions, suggesting an adaptive advantage of populations from natural sediments exposed to copper. These results highlight the ecological and evolutionary consequences of the presence of metals in freshwater environments by modulating diapause adaptive efficacy and the selective process in egg banks.","Authors thank Dr. Manuel Serra for helpful comments that improved the manuscript.

The persons that take on the important work of caring and attending the needs of these people have to modify their life, which could be a burden and could affect their quality of life.AimTo determine the health related quality of life and burden in caregivers of people with neurological disorders.MethodA descriptive correlational, cross-sectional study was conducted using an intentional sample. The information was collected using 4 different tools: sociodemographic variables, Barthel scale, Betty Ferrell, and Zarit scale.ResultsA total of 47 caregivers were included, with a mean age of the patient of 61.1 years (SD 15.36). The mean age of the caregiver was 48.21 years (SD 13.65), and were mainly women (70.2%), and the predominant relationship was wife. It was found that the spiritual and social wellness domains of the quality of life were affected. The overall score of the Zarit scale did not show overload (28.86). There was a correlation between the physical, psychological, and social dimensions of the quality of life, but not with the spiritual. There was also a correlation between burden and the physical and social dimensions.ConclusionsThe caregivers are mainly women, with their quality of life affected in 2 dimensions, and do not show burden. Low correlations were found between the burden and the physical and social dimensions. The aim of health professionals is to offer a comprehensive approach to informal caregivers to mitigate the impact of burden on their quality of life.",AgradecimientosAgradecemos al Hospital Universitario el habernos facilitado la información de sus bases de datos y a los cuidadores principales por su participación.,,Revista Científica de la Sociedad Española de Enfermería Neurológica,,,,2017-01,2017,,2017-01,45,,9-16,Closed,Article,"Ramírez-Perdomo, Claudia Andrea; Salazar-Parra, Yivi; Perdomo-Romero, Alix Yaneth","Ramírez-Perdomo, Claudia Andrea (Enfermera, Especialista en Cuidado Crítico, Magíster en Enfermería, Candidata a Doctora en Enfermería, Universidad de Antioquia, Grupo de Investigación Salud y Grupos Vulnerables, Departamento de Enfermería, Facultad de Salud, Universidad Surcolombiana, Neiva, Huila, Colombia); Salazar-Parra, Yivi (Enfermera, Especialista en Epidemiología, Magíster en Enfermería, Departamento de Enfermería, Facultad de Salud, Universidad Surcolombiana, Neiva, Huila, Colombia); Perdomo-Romero, Alix Yaneth (Enfermera, Magíster en Enfermería, Magíster en Educación, Departamento de Enfermería,FacultaddeSalud,Universidad Surcolombiana)","Ramírez-Perdomo, Claudia Andrea (South Colombian University)","Ramírez-Perdomo, Claudia Andrea (South Colombian University); Salazar-Parra, Yivi (South Colombian University); Perdomo-Romero, Alix Yaneth (Enfermera, Magíster en Enfermería, Magíster en Educación, Departamento de Enfermería,FacultaddeSalud,Universidad Surcolombiana)",6,4,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1074206690,,

In the Americas, previous morphological studies support a scenario of people entering the Americas and dispersing from North America into South America through Meso America, making the Mexican territory the natural funnel through which biological diversity entered South America.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We explore the cranial morphological affinities of three late Holocene Mexican series, in relation to ancient and modern crania from North and South America, Australo-Melanesia, and East Asia. Morphological affinities were assessed through Mahalanobis Distances, and represented via Multidimensional Scaling and Ward's Linkage Cluster analysis. Minimum FST values were also calculated for each series.
RESULTS: Our results show Mexican groups share morphological affinities with the Native American series, but do not cluster together as would be expected. The minimum FST estimates show between-group variation in the Americas is higher than the Asian or Australo-Melanesian populations, and that Mexican series have high between-group variance (FST  = 0.124), compared to the geographically larger South America (FST  = 0.116) and North America (FST  = 0.076).
DISCUSSION: These results show that the Mexican series share morphological affinities with the East Asian series, but maintains high levels of between-group variation, similar to South America. This supports the suggestion that the high phenotypic variation seen the Americas is not a result of its size, as it can be found in more constricted areas, such as the Mexican territory.",The authors thank Meredith Tise for her contribution towards data collection.,,American Journal of Biological Anthropology,,,"American Indian or Alaska Native; Anthropology, Physical; Cephalometry; Female; Human Migration; Humans; Male; Mexico; Racial Groups; Skull",2017-02-20,2017,2017-02-20,2017-05,163,1,75-84,Closed,Article,"Herrera, Brianne; Peart, Daniel; Hernandez, Nicole; Spradley, Kate; Hubbe, Mark","Herrera, Brianne (Department of Anthropology, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio); Peart, Daniel (Department of Anthropology, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio); Hernandez, Nicole (Department of Anthropology, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio); Spradley, Kate (Department of Anthropology, Texas State University, San Marcos, Texas); Hubbe, Mark (Department of Anthropology, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio; Instituto de Arqueología y Antropología, Universidad Católica del Norte, Chile)","Herrera, Brianne (The Ohio State University)","Herrera, Brianne (The Ohio State University); Peart, Daniel (The Ohio State University); Hernandez, Nicole (The Ohio State University); Spradley, Kate (Texas State University); Hubbe, Mark (The Ohio State University; Catholic University of the North)",7,0,0.15,2.89,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1083850390,"43 History, Heritage and Archaeology; 4301 Archaeology; 44 Human Society; 4401 Anthropology",

In this context it has emerged as an important mediator of addiction/satiety pathways associated with alcohol misuse. Consequently, the regulation of the activity of key enzymes in agmatine metabolism is an attractive strategy to combat alcoholism and related addiction disorders. Agmatine results from the decarboxylation of L-arginine in a reaction catalyzed by arginine decarboxylase (ADC), and can be converted to either guanidine butyraldehyde by diamine oxidase (DAO) or putrescine and urea by the enzyme agmatinase (AGM) or the more recently identified AGM-like protein (ALP). In rat brain, agmatine, AGM and ALP are predominantly localised in areas associated with roles in appetitive and craving (drug-reinstatement) behaviors. Thus, inhibitors of AGM or ALP are promising agents for the treatment of addictions.

Cross-sectional survey was conducted with 451 participants. A non-clinical sample of adolescents and young adults between 15 and 25 years responded the MBSRQ and a sociodemographic questionnaire. Factorial analysis identified seven factors and provided empirical evidence that supports the use of these factors to evaluate body perception in Chilean youth. Scores exhibited good reliability in three factors (over 0.80) and acceptable reliability in the other four (over 0.70). Findings suggest that the Spanish MBSRQ was psychometrically sound, with 7 factors which are largely consistent with those identified in the original version and validation study of this scale. These factors possess sufficient internal consistency to make it plausible for use in research and screening with Chilean youth, and potentially useful as an adjunctive measure in the context of clinical decision making.",This study was funded by Comisión Nacional de Investigación Científica y Tecnológica (CONICYT): Fondo Nacional de Desarrollo Científico y Tecnológico (FONDECYT-Regular N° 1140085): “Cambios en la imagen corporal en adolescentes sometidos a cirugía bariátrica”/“Changes in body image in adolescents with bariatric surgery.”,,"Eating and Weight Disorders - Studies on Anorexia, Bulimia and Obesity",,,"Adolescent; Adult; Body Image; Chile; Cross-Sectional Studies; Factor Analysis, Statistical; Female; Humans; Male; Personal Satisfaction; Psychometrics; Reproducibility of Results; Self Concept; Surveys and Questionnaires; Young Adult",2017-07-07,2017,2017-07-07,2019-04,24,2,339-350,Closed,Article,"Cruzat-Mandich, Claudia; Díaz-Castrillón, Fernanda; Pérez-Villalobos, Cristhian E.; Lizana, Paula; Moore, Catalina; Simpson, Susan; Oda-Montecinos, Camila","Cruzat-Mandich, Claudia (Centro de Estudios de la Conducta Alimentaria-CECA-Escuela de Psicología, Universidad Adolfo Ibáñez, Av.

This creates potential problems because some of these images may be used as supporting evidence for different criminal cases. In this paper, algorithms are proposed based on sensor noise and wavelet transforms which can alter the information which is usually employed to find the source of an image, and forge it so that it could point to a different, unrelated device. In the state of art we will show that there are already some algorithms capable of carrying out these manipulations, but they generally need much more and more complex data than our proposal. They also generally need physical access to the camera whose generated images you want to tamper. Our proposal algorithm to destruct the image identifiable data, only needs the picture which will be anonymized. Also, our proposal to forge the image identifiable data only needs a set of photos from the attacker camera, and the picture to be tampered. In particular, it does not need access to the camera that will be falsely linked to the picture. These scenarios are the most common and realistic. The algorithms proposed will help to strengthen existing techniques and develop new forensic approaches for mobile image source identification that will be more robust against attacks.","AcknowledgmentsPart of the heavy computations required for this work were performed in EOLO, part of the HPC for Climate Change of the International Campus of Excellence of Moncloa, funded by both MECD and MICINN.

The persons that take on the important work of caring and attending the needs of these people have to modify their life, which could be a burden and could affect their quality of life.AimTo determine the health related quality of life and burden in caregivers of people with neurological disorders.MethodA descriptive correlational, cross-sectional study was conducted using an intentional sample. The information was collected using 4 different tools: sociodemographic variables, Barthel scale, Betty Ferrell, and Zarit scale.ResultsA total of 47 caregivers were included, with a mean age of the patient of 61.1 years (SD 15.36). The mean age of the caregiver was 48.21 years (SD 13.65), and were mainly women (70.2%), and the predominant relationship was wife. It was found that the spiritual and social wellness domains of the quality of life were affected. The overall score of the Zarit scale did not show overload (28.86). There was a correlation between the physical, psychological, and social dimensions of the quality of life, but not with the spiritual. There was also a correlation between burden and the physical and social dimensions.ConclusionsThe caregivers are mainly women, with their quality of life affected in 2 dimensions, and do not show burden. Low correlations were found between the burden and the physical and social dimensions. The aim of health professionals is to offer a comprehensive approach to informal caregivers to mitigate the impact of burden on their quality of life.",AcknowledgementsWe would like to thank the Hospital Universitario for having provided us with information from their data bases and the primary caregivers for their participation.,,Revista Científica de la Sociedad de Enfermería Neurológica (English ed ),,,,2017-01,2017,,2017-01,45,,9-16,Closed,Article,"Ramírez-Perdomo, Claudia Andrea; Salazar-Parra, Yivi; Perdomo-Romero, Alix Yaneth","Ramírez-Perdomo, Claudia Andrea (Enfermera, Especialista en Cuidado Crítico, Magíster en Enfermería, Candidata a Doctora en Enfermería, Universidad de Antioquia, Grupo de Investigación Salud y Grupos Vulnerables, Departamento de Enfermería, Facultad de Salud, Universidad Surcolombiana, Neiva, Huila, Colombia); Salazar-Parra, Yivi (Enfermera, Especialista en Epidemiología, Magíster en Enfermería, Departamento de Enfermería, Facultad de Salud, Universidad Surcolombiana, Neiva, Huila, Colombia); Perdomo-Romero, Alix Yaneth (Enfermera, Magíster en Enfermería, Magíster en Educación, Departamento de Enfermería, Facultad de Salud, Universidad Surcolombiana, Colombia)","Ramírez-Perdomo, Claudia Andrea (South Colombian University)","Ramírez-Perdomo, Claudia Andrea (South Colombian University); Salazar-Parra, Yivi (South Colombian University); Perdomo-Romero, Alix Yaneth (South Colombian University)",4,1,,1.17,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1090904597,42 Health Sciences; 4203 Health Services and Systems; 4205 Nursing,3 Good Health and Well Being

This strong differentiation between farming and foraging lifestyles is particularly problematic in the archaeology of rockshelter occupations of Northwestern Argentina. Here I interrogate the concepts of wild and domestic and the ideas associated with the role of such plants in people’s lives through an examination of plant remains from these rockshelters. Although I consider the plants present from the hunter–gatherer occupations, I am particularly interested in the “wild” species associated with the societies long-established as agriculturalists and pastoralists that also utilized these spaces. In doing so, we see that wild resources were vitally important, sometimes even more so than domesticated ones, among complex societies from the Formative Period up through Inca rule, and even into the present.","This paper was first written when I attended the Paleoethnobotany Graduate Course with Christine Hastorf, and as a part of a Fulbright Senior Research Scholarship at the Paleoethnobotany Laboratory, University of California at Berkeley (2000–2001). It was originally presented at the SAA meeting at New Orleans (2001) in a session organized by Emily Dean and Kathy Twiss exploring “wild and domestic” but has been enriched, updated and modified for this book. Although new research and publications have emerged in Northwestern Argentina since 2003 the pattern shown in this study has not changed consistently.

Consequently, the current business models are continuously developing, incorporating new trends, new industrial areas, and even new models. In this paper, the authors propose a bi-level optimization model for producer and collection centers to achieve maximum profits of the channel members. In bi-level optimization, collection points are the leaders, and producers are the followers of the strategies taken by the collection points. The profits of the channel members are maximized using General Algebraic Modeling System software. Moreover, Shapley value of game theory approach is applied for coalition of the members in collaborative system, and it is compared with bi-level optimization based on data collected from agro-industry of cocoa. The best way to distribute the profits among the participants is determined by using Microsoft Excel and Java as a programming language. The final results indicate that higher profits are obtained in a collaborative system than in an individual system.","The authors would like to thank the kind collaboration of the people in the technical area as Jos Fabian Vargas and administrative area as Orlando Vargas areas, belonging to the Cocoa Producers Association of Southern Bolivar and Middle Magdalena, located in Southern Santa Rosa, for compiling primary information management and supporting technical visits to the region where market chain participants are.

The scaffolds conformed by nanofibers were prepared from different mixtures of QS and FGS. They were characterized with analytical techniques such as scanning electron microscopy-SEM, infrared spectroscopy-FTIR, X-ray diffraction-XRD, Thermogravimetric Analysis-TGA, Differential Scanning Calorimetry-DSC and Citocompatibility tests, to determine its morphology, functional groups, thermal transitions, and cell viability of the scaffolding QS/FGS. Nanofibers of different diameters of QS/FGS (8-177 nm) were obtained and compared with the fibers of cocoons (22-36μm) and fibroin (7-13 μm). The best scaffolds were achieved from a physical mixture with a weight ratio QS: FGS (1:3) dissolved in trifluoroacetic acid under the following electrospinning parameters. Voltage: 20 kV, injection flow: 0.5 ml/h, needle-collector distance: 12 cm, relative humidity: 28% Temperature: 25 ° C. It was determined that the scaffolding QS/FGS possessed fibers with nanometric diameters less than 200 nm, which allow optimal cell adhesion and thermal stability at the application site, with a view to control the degradation of the scaffold. Thermal analyses, supplemented with RD studies reveal the internal structure of the fibers. Besides Cytocompatibility test on prepared cell scaffolds, it indicates that the integrity requirement was achieved and the necessity to control the pH to achieve an increased cell viability. The results show that nanofibers QS/FGS can be a good candidate for tissue engineering in biomedical applications such as scaffolds.",,,Ingeniería y Competitividad,,,,2017-06-23,2017,2017-06-23,,19,1,134-146,Closed,Article,"Cárdena-Pérez, Yesica C.; Vera-Graziano, Ricardo; Muñoz-Prieto, Efrén d.

AMD was found on all beaches along the entire Chilean coast. Highest percentages of AMD in all surveys were plastics and cigarette butts, which can be attributed to local sources (i.e. beach users). The Antofagasta region in northern Chile had the highest abundance of AMD compared with all other zones. Higher abundances of AMD were found at the upper stations from almost all zones. No significant tendency of increasing or decreasing AMD densities was observed during the 8years covered by our study, which suggests that economic development alone cannot explain temporal trends in AMD densities.","Acknowledgements This study received continuous support from the outreach program of the Chilean Science Foundation EXPLORA-CONICYT. The national litter sampling in 2016 was funded by the U.S. Embassy in Chile, with additional support from the Lighthouse Foundation and the Chilean Millennium Initiative Grant NC 120030. Foremost, though, our sincerest gratitude goes to all the teachers, students and volunteer collaborators who over the years helped to gather the data presented herein.

During two expeditions to the Bay of Bengal and the eastern South Pacific we investigated whether the new, high-speed AVANI trawl (All-purpose Velocity Accelerated Net Instrument) collects similar amounts and types of microplastics as two established scientific trawl designs, the manta trawl and the DiSalvo neuston net. Using a 335 μm net, the AVANI trawl can collect microplastics from the sea surface at speeds up to 8 knots as it ""skis"" across the surface, whereas the manta and DiSalvo neuston trawls must be towed slowly in a less turbulent sea state and often represent shorter tow lengths. Generally, the AVANI trawl collected a greater numerical abundance and weight of plastic particles in most size classes and debris types than the manta trawl and DiSalvo neuston net, likely because these trawls only skim the surface layer while the AVANI trawl, moving vertically in a random fashion, collects a ""deeper"" sample, capturing the few plastics that float slightly lower in the water column. However, the samples did not differ enough that results were significantly affected, suggesting that studies done with these different trawls are comparable. The advantage of the AVANI trawl over traditional research trawls is that it allows for collection on vessels underway at high speeds and during long transits, allowing for a nearly continuous sampling effort over long distances. As local surface currents make sea surface abundance widely heterogeneous, widely spaced short-tow trawls, such as the manta and DiSalvo trawls, can catch or miss hotspots or meso-scale variability of microplastic accumulations, whereas the AVANI trawl, if utilized for back-to-back tows of intermediate distances (5-10 km), can bridge variable wind conditions and debris concentrations potentially reducing variance and provide a greater resolution of spatial distribution.","The authors wish to thank the Biosphere Foundation and Captain Mark Van Thillo for supporting the Bay of Bengal Study and for providing sailing vessel Mir and crew.

The Electric catfish Malapterurus electricus was subjected to study the prevalence and mean intensity of parasitic infections throughout the whole year of 2015. Heavy metals accumulation in host fish and parasites were determined in relation to water quality and sediments of two different sites of Lake Manzala (Manzala and Bahr El-Baqar), Egypt. A total of 100 specimens of Electric catfish were collected and examined for the presence of helminth parasites. Two parasite species were recovered and morphologically identified. These were cestoda Electrotaenia malapteruri and nematode Dujardinnascaris malapteruri. Heavy metal analysis in water and sediments showed that measured heavy metals in Bahr El-Baqar were found in risky levels higher than permissible limits and Manzala site. Sediments were found to contain a higher level of metals than water samples. Heavy metals accumulation in recovered parasites and their host were also determined and showed significantly higher concentrations in parasites compared to their host tissues. According to bioconcentration factors, E. malapteruri showed that highest accumulation rate for all recorded elements up to 302. Essential elements like Cu and Fe were found in significantly higher concentrations in D. malapteruri, whereas E. malapteruri accumulated elements Cd, Pb, Ni, Mn, Zn and Ca to a significantly higher degree. Accordingly, the ratios (C[D.malapteruri]/C[E. malapteruri]) for most essential elements were higher than 0.5. Therefore, fish cestodes can be regarded as useful bio-indicators more than nematodes when evaluating the environmental pollution of aquatic ecosystems by heavy metals.",,,Acta Parasitologica,,,"Animals; Catfishes; Cestoda; Egypt; Environmental Monitoring; Fish Diseases; Geologic Sediments; Lakes; Metals, Heavy; Nematoda; Water; Water Pollutants, Chemical",2017-04-18,2017,2017-04-18,2017-06-01,62,2,319-335,Closed,Article,"Abdel-Gaber, Rewaida; Abdel-Ghaffar, Fathy; Shazly, Mohamed Abdallah; Morsy, Kareem; Quraishy, Saleh Al; Mohamed, Sanna; Mehlhorn, Heinz","Abdel-Gaber, Rewaida (Zoology Department, Faculty of Science, Cairo University, Cairo, Egypt); Abdel-Ghaffar, Fathy (Zoology Department, Faculty of Science, Cairo University, Cairo, Egypt); Shazly, Mohamed Abdallah (Zoology Department, Faculty of Science, Cairo University, Cairo, Egypt); Morsy, Kareem (Zoology Department, Faculty of Science, Cairo University, Cairo, Egypt); Quraishy, Saleh Al (Zoology Department, College of Science, King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia); Mohamed, Sanna (Zoology Department, Faculty of Science, Cairo University, Cairo, Egypt); Mehlhorn, Heinz (Parasitology Institute, Düsseldorf University, Düsseldorf, Germany)","Abdel-Gaber, Rewaida (Cairo University)","Abdel-Gaber, Rewaida (Cairo University); Abdel-Ghaffar, Fathy (Cairo University); Shazly, Mohamed Abdallah (Cairo University); Morsy, Kareem (Cairo University); Quraishy, Saleh Al (King Saud University); Mohamed, Sanna (Cairo University); Mehlhorn, Heinz (Heinrich Heine University Düsseldorf)",8,2,0.19,1.52,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1085042676,"30 Agricultural, Veterinary and Food Sciences; 3005 Fisheries Sciences",

Across ministries, regional governments, universities, schools and environmental protection agencies, seemingly unexpected consequences have emerged out of the implementation of performance measurement and evaluation regimes within public organizations. Formal compliance to legally binding evaluation procedures, judicially-sanctioned managerial accountability and lack of cross-agency coordination coupled with long-standing cultural separations among evaluators are some of the ambiguities associated with a performance-based governance system within Italian public administration. Building upon the 'new governane theory,' and qualitative fieldwork, I explore the political consequences of evaluation and performance measurement for possible improvements.

This formulation is based on a state variable, called the intergranular strain, which is related to the strain recent history. The location of the intergranular strain can be related to the strain amplitude, information which is used to improve the model for the simulation of cyclic loading. The present work proposes an ISA-plasticity-based model for the simulation of saturated clays and features the incorporation of a viscous strain rate to enable the simulation of the strain rate dependency. The work explains some aspects of the ISA-plasticity and adapts its formulation for clays. At the beginning, the formulation of the model is explained. Subsequently, some comments about its numerical implementation and parameters determination are given. Finally, some simulations are performed to evaluate the model performance with two different clays, namely a Kaolin clay and the Lower Rhine clay. The simulations include monotonic and cyclic tests under oedometric and triaxial conditions.

An Approach Based on Data Analytics Applications and Social Media Contents,"230This chapter provides a first attempt to analyze and understand the social media use of the concept “entrepreneurship” in Latin America. In this chapter, we use the analytics methods to study the data available and provided by individuals in the social media. The data available online has been used to study the online exchange of resources between individuals, groups, or organizations, to locate patterns revealing actors, nodes, relationships, and their connections. Latin America is a region that has a very active conversation around entrepreneurship; at first glance the conversation has a clearly neutral and positive sentiment around it. This study found a relationship between entrepreneurship and the category of social entrepreneurship in Latin America. Social entrepreneurship, in countries such as Chile, Venezuela, and Colombia, does not refer to a philanthropic activity, but indicates how people can be an agent of change from this type of entrepreneurial activity, helping to solve global problems, to inspire optimism, and to collaborate, especially in countries with serious problems of poverty. This chapter provides a first attempt to analyze and understand the social media use of the concept ""entrepreneurship"" in Latin America. Throughout the years, the concept of entrepreneurship has been inevitably associated with the activities of business creation and self-employment, which is not the most accurate definition of the term. Entrepreneurship implies the pursuit of opportunity, evaluation, and exploitation of opportunities and the set of individuals who discover, evaluate, and exploit them. It is widely acknowledged that communication has definitely changed and the influence of Internet and social media on people and on the organizations' ability to interact and communicate are visible in all areas of society. The chapter provides an attempt to analyze entrepreneurship in Latin America by the use of analytics and social listening on the data available provided by individuals in the social media. Latin America is a region that has a very active conversation around entrepreneurship; at first glance the conversation has a clearly neutral and positive sentiment around it.",,"The figure of angel investors is found when angels offer financing entrepreneurs in Colombia or Mexico saying: “Do you know why I will finance your company?” Or “Undertake startup venture funding.” Mentors announce: “Inclusive Business Program develops with IDB Masisa”; “We want to help and support the successful development of your enterprise account with us!”; “We continue supporting your entrepreneurial ideas—Wayra; Fundación Impulsar from Argentina trains young entrepreneurs through mentoring and economic orientation”; “HubBOG offers acceleration Startups and Campus program in academia and investment” or “co working for new digital companies and invite entrepreneurs to let them know their venture registering it and then receive information on opportunities for Colombian State support.” The funding by the government is reflected indirectly in messages like the one about the Law for the Promotion of Corporate Finance “crowdfunding startup undertake Mexico.” On the other hand, organizations such as Banca Comunitaria process microcredit for venture, entrepreneurship, and encourages organization and citizen participation. Our findings have shown that #emprendimiento is often used in publications related with the search for funding sources that may well be the formal and informal options of risk capital, the public calls of seed capital or certain emergent funding alternatives, such as crowdfunding and bootstrapping.

La población de estudio fueron alumnos de 3 carreras técnicas de una institución de educación pública del estado de Jalisco, México. La muestra estuvo compuesta por 988 alumnos. Las variables predictoras contempladas en el estudio fueron el clima escolar, el ajuste escolar, la victimización en la escuela, la insatisfacción con la imagen corporal y la depresión, además del sexo. El instrumento para medir el estrés académico fue el Inventario de Estrés Académico (IEA) desarrollado por Hernández, Polo y Pozo (1996). En materia de resultados y mediante un análisis de regresión lineal múltiple se construyeron 2 modelos predictivos: el primero fue de situaciones generadoras de estrés y el segundo, de respuestas de estrés; en el primer caso se identificaron como variables predictoras el apoyo familiar, la ayuda del profesor, los problemas de ajuste a la escuela, la victimización relacional, la insatisfacción con la imagen corporal y la depresión y, en el segundo, la depresión, la insatisfacción con la forma corporal y el sexo. Se sugiere que en estudios posteriores se incluyan otras características que pudieran explicar en mayor medida la presencia de situaciones generadoras de estrés y se confirme la influencia de las variables mencionadas.AbstractThe aim of this study is to identify psychosocial predictors of academic stress in secondary school students. The study population were students of three technical academic programmes at a public education institution in the state of Jalisco, Mexico. The sample consisted of 988 students. The predictive variables included in the study were school atmosphere, school adjustment, school victimisation, dissatisfaction with body image, depression and gender. The instrument for measuring academic stress was the Academic Stress Inventory (ASI) developed by Hernández, Polo & Pozo (1996). In terms of results and through a multiple linear regression analysis, two predictive models were constructed, the first comprising ‘Stress-generating situations’ and the second ‘Stress responses’. In the first case, family support, teacher help, school adjustment problems, relational victimisation, dissatisfaction with body image and depression were identified as predictors. In the second, depression, dissatisfaction with body image and gender were identified as predictors. It is suggested that further studies should include other characteristics that could better explain the onset of stress-generating situations and confirm the influence of the mentioned variables.",,,Ansiedad y Estrés,,,,2017-01,2017,,2017-01,23,1,20-26,Closed,Article,"Caldera-Montes, Juan Francisco; Reynoso-González, Oscar Ulises; Gómez-Covarrubia, Neismy Janette; Mora-García, Olga; Anaya-González, Brenda Bianey","Caldera-Montes, Juan Francisco (Centro Universitario de Los Altos, Universidad de Guadalajara, Tepatitlán de Morelos, Jalisco, México); Reynoso-González, Oscar Ulises (Centro Universitario de Los Altos, Universidad de Guadalajara, Tepatitlán de Morelos, Jalisco, México); Gómez-Covarrubia, Neismy Janette (Centro Universitario de Los Altos, Universidad de Guadalajara, Tepatitlán de Morelos, Jalisco, México); Mora-García, Olga (Centro Universitario de Los Altos, Universidad de Guadalajara, Tepatitlán de Morelos, Jalisco, México); Anaya-González, Brenda Bianey (Colegio de Estudios Científicos y Tecnológicos del Estado de Jalisco, Tepatitlán de Morelos, Jalisco, México)","Reynoso-González, Oscar Ulises (University of Guadalajara)","Caldera-Montes, Juan Francisco (University of Guadalajara); Reynoso-González, Oscar Ulises (University of Guadalajara); Gómez-Covarrubia, Neismy Janette (University of Guadalajara); Mora-García, Olga (University of Guadalajara); Anaya-González, Brenda Bianey (Colegio de Estudios Científicos y Tecnológicos del Estado de Jalisco, Tepatitlán de Morelos, Jalisco, México)",11,4,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1084058140,,

This chapter highlights the particularities of Colombia’s SSC policy. Some of its drivers are similar to those of other countries and can be traced to economic improvement (i.e. it has become a middle-income country) and growing interest in using SSC as a tool to increase regional and international influence as an emerging power. Others, however, are more atypical and are linked to the fact that Colombia has long been considered a “problem country”—given its prolonged armed conflict and drug trafficking problem—and now is trying to convert to being a model provider of “best practices”1 in development sectors.",,,International Political Economy Series,South-South Cooperation Beyond the Myths,"Isaline Bergamaschi, Phoebe Moore, Arlene B.

APAP implements its detection algorithm as “dynamic pre-processor” of Snort. By working together, a highly effective system to known attacks (by passing Snort rules) and equally effective against new and unknown attacks is obtained. APAP consists of two phases: training and detection. During training, a statistical model of legitimate network traffic through the techniques Bloom filter and n-grams is created. Then results obtained by analyzing a dataset of attacks with this model are compared. Consequently, a set of rules able to determine whether a payload corresponds to malware or otherwise legitimate traffic is obtained. During detection, monitored traffic is passed by the Bloom filter which is created in the training phase, and the obtained results are compared with rules. Training requires two datasets: a collection of habitual and legitimate traffic and samples of malicious traffic. This approach offers various improvements compared with similar proposals. The most outstanding is a new method for filling Bloom filters and thereby building usage models. The implementation of a rule system based on Ks speeds up decision-making.

That relationship is valid when the study area fulfils certain characteristics: a) there should be no downward moisture fluxes in an unsaturated zone, b) the soil composition in terms of both, the different horizon materials and their corresponding thermal and hydraulic properties, must be as homogeneous and isotropic as possible, c) flat and regular topography, and d) steady state groundwater temperature with a spatially homogeneous temperature distribution. A night time Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) image and temperature field measurements are used to test the validity of the relationship between LST and ∆Zuz at the Pampa del Tamarugal, which is located in the Atacama Desert (Chile) and meets the above required conditions. The results indicate that there is a relation between the land surface temperature and the unsaturated zone thickness in the study area. Moreover, the field measurements of soil temperature indicate that shallow aquifers dampen both the daily and the seasonal amplitude of the temperature oscillation generated by the local climate conditions. Despite empirically observing the relationship between the LST and ∆Zuz in the study zone, such a relationship cannot be applied to directly estimate ∆Zuz using temperatures from nighttime thermal satellite images. To this end, it is necessary to consider the soil thermal properties, the soil surface roughness and the unseen water and moisture fluxes (e.g., capillarity and evaporation) that typically occur in the subsurface.","AcknowledgementsThis research was financially supported by the Anillo Project ACT1203 of CONICYT (Chile), CONICYT-PCHA/Doctorado Nacional/2016-21161345 Ph.D. grant to H.U. and CONICYT-PCHA/Doctorado Nacional/2015-211509515 PhD grant to J.U.

Research examining South American skeletons >8000 cal BP has revealed differences in cranial morphology between early and late Holocene populations, which may reflect distinct migration events and/or populations. However, genetic, cultural, and some skeletal data contradict this model. Given these discrepancies, this study examines ∼9000 years of prehistory to test the hypothesis that Early skeletons have a distinct cranial morphology from later skeletons.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using 3D digital models, craniofacial landmarks, and geometric morphometric analyses, we compared Early Holocene crania (n = 4) to later Chilean samples (n = 90) frequently absent in continental assessments of craniofacial variation. PCA, Mahalanobis distances, posterior and typicality probabilities were used to examine variation.
RESULTS: Two of the earliest skeletons from northern Chile show clear affinities to individuals from later sites in the same region. However, the hypothesis cannot be rejected as one Early individual from northern Chile and one individual from inland Patagonia did not always show clear affinities to coastal populations.
DISCUSSION: Biological affinities among northern populations and other regions of Chile align with genetic and archaeological data, supporting cultural and biological continuity along the Pacific Coast. In Patagonia, archaeological data are in accordance with skeletal differences between the Early inland steppe individual and coastal populations. This study incorporates 3D methods and skeletal datasets not widely used in assessments of biological affinity, thus contributing to a critical body of research examining the ancient population history of western South America.","The authors also wish to express their gratitude to the Museo La Serena, American Museum of Natural History, Museo Gustavo Le Paige, Museo Arqueológico San Miguel de Azapa Universidad de Tarapacá, and the Centro de Investigación en Ecosistemas de la Patagonia, Coyhaique in Chile for permission to analyze the osteological collections used in this research.

This syndrome is a hormonal imbalance induced by tributyltin (TBT) which have been used in antifouling paints formulation. The present study aimed to perform an integrated environmental assessment of imposex and butyltin (BT) contamination using surface sediments and tissues of Thaisella chocolata (an edible gastropod) from northern Chile. The results showed imposex incidence in 11 out of 12 sites. In the most contaminated sites, which are areas under the influence of maritime activities, and also used for fishing and aquaculture, RPLI were over 60 and VDSI over 4 (high incidence of sterile females). Exceptionally high contamination levels and evidences of fresh inputs of tributyltin (TBT) were detected along the studied area. TBT levels above 300 and 90ngSng-1, respectively, were recorded in sediments and edible gastropod tissues of 6 sites. Thus, a daily ingestion of 90 to 173g of T. chocolata foot (4 to 8 organisms) from the most contaminated sites will certainly lead to the consumption of BT exceeding the tolerable daily intake recommended by European Food Safety Authority. It is reasonable to consider that human risk is even higher if daily consumption of additional seafood is considered. Moreover, some contaminated sites were located within the marine reserve ""Isla Grande Atacama"", indicating that even marine protected areas are under the influence of TBT contamination. These findings suggest that current levels of TBT in the studied area are sufficient to induce harmful effects on the environment and constitutes a potential threat to seafood consumers. Thus, national regulatory actions toward environmental protection and food safety of local populations are still mandatory, even after 8years of the TBT global ban by IMO.","AcknowledgementY.

In this study, we want to assess how users make decisions with the help of the tools provided by social media. In order to do so, we simulate a physician rating website in which participants had to choose one physician among four options in a task of 20 trials. For this, we used a choice-based conjoint design, which allowed us to experimentally observe which features of social media have more impact on the decisions of the participants. Furthermore, personal characteristics of the participants, such as executive functions, cognitive styles, and personality traits, were measured. We found that the subjective features of social media, such as the comments and ratings provided by other users, have a greater impact on the decision of the participants when compared with the objective characteristics such as experience or specialty. Regarding the personal characteristics, we found that the executive functions cognitive flexibility and categorization were higher for those participants who preferred objective features (e.g. availability, specialty, experience of the physician) than for those participants who preferred subjective features. The results of the current study help understand how users make decisions with social media tools.

One of the main and representative species growing in these páramos is the genus Espeletia, known as frailejones. There is a lack of knowledge of Espeletia ecophysiology, maybe due to its unusual anatomical modifications and the specific climatic conditions of these ecosystems. Therefore, it is important to determine the relationships between the anatomical modifications of Espeletia, its physiological functioning, and its contribution to the ecohydrologic functioning of páramos. Consequently, we studied the physiology of frailejones in two Colombian páramos, focused on the identification of conductive tissues inside the stems, calculated the age, and measured sapflow, using the heat ratio method. Results show that Espeletia spp. have a central pith that increases with height, as the size of secondary xylem decreases. Frailejones respond quickly to the changing conditions of weather factors controlling transpiration such as solar radiation, temperature, and fog presence. However, although environmental factors favor transpiration, the sapflow tends to decrease—a particular behavior of the Espeletia transpiration processes—since this occurs chaotically over time, including sapflow at night. The transformation of sapflow velocity to depth of water in a basin shows that the water lost through their transpiration is very low, which contributes to the high runoff ratio of páramo ecosystems. For the first time, we determine by radiocarbon the real ages of three E. hartwegiana, and their mean growth rates to range between 3.8 and 6.9 cm year−1.","The authors thank the Colombian administrative department of the science, technology, and innovation COLCIENCIAS for funding the research project “Estudio ecohidrológicos de los páramos y los bosques alto andinos, naturales e intervenidos: Análisis de la vulnerabilidad y adaptabilidad al cambio climático” in the call for a bank of eligible projects in CT&amp;i 569—2012, in which this study was framed.

The transmitter and the relay harvest energy from the environment and use it exclusively for transmitting data. A data arrival process is assumed at the transmitter. At the relay, a finite data buffer is used to store the received data. We consider a realistic scenario in which the EH nodes have only local causal knowledge, i.e., at any time instant, each EH node only knows the current value of its EH process, channel state, and data arrival process. Our goal is to find a power allocation policy to maximize the throughput at the receiver. We show that because the EH nodes have local causal knowledge, the two-hop communication problem can be separated into two point-to-point problems. Consequently, independent power allocation problems are solved at each EH node. To find the power allocation policy, reinforcement learning with linear function approximation is applied. Moreover, to perform function approximation two feature functions which consider the data arrival process are introduced. Numerical results show that the proposed approach has only a small degradation as compared to the offline optimum case. Furthermore, we show that with the use of the proposed feature functions a better performance is achieved compared to standard approximation techniques.",,,IEEE Transactions on Green Communications and Networking,,,,2017-08-17,2017,2017-08-17,,1,3,309-319,Closed,Article,"Ortiz, Andrea; Al-Shatri, Hussein; Li, Xiang; Weber, Tobias; Klein, Anja","Ortiz, Andrea (Communications Engineering Laboratory, Darmstadt, Germany); Al-Shatri, Hussein (Communications Engineering Laboratory, Darmstadt, Germany); Li, Xiang (Institute of Communications Engineering, University of Rostock, Rostock, Germany); Weber, Tobias (Institute of Communications Engineering, University of Rostock, Rostock, Germany); Klein, Anja (Communications Engineering Laboratory, Darmstadt, Germany)",,"Ortiz, Andrea (Communications Engineering Laboratory, Darmstadt, Germany); Al-Shatri, Hussein (Communications Engineering Laboratory, Darmstadt, Germany); Li, Xiang (University of Rostock); Weber, Tobias (University of Rostock); Klein, Anja (Communications Engineering Laboratory, Darmstadt, Germany)",50,3,,15.96,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1085511354,40 Engineering; 4006 Communications Engineering; 46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4613 Theory Of Computation,7 Affordable and Clean Energy

These sites date to the final moments of the Early Formative period (ca. 400 cal B.C.–cal A.D. 200). The data presented here indicate that both sites were ceremonial in function and used for periodic rituals by travelers. There was a repeated arrangement of different ritual offerings, including food stuffs, local and foreign objects, and some very high-valued handicrafts. We report the results of a number of analyses using taxonomic, technological, stylistic, iconographic, and archaeometric approaches. The obtained data represent a significant advance in our understanding of ritual practices in the Formative period of the Tarapacá region, particularly those carried out by the people who traded goods during this time.

This leads to questions regarding how these environments were colonized by the first waves of humans that reached them during the late Pleistocene. Based on previous research, and aided by human behavioral ecology principles, we assess hunter-gatherer behavioral strategies in the Andean highlands during the late Pleistocene and early Holocene. Specifically, we formulate three mobility strategies and their archaeological expectations and test these using technological and subsistence evidence from the six earliest well-dated highland sites in northern Chile. Our results suggest that all of the studied sites were temporarily occupied for hunting, processing animals, and toolkit maintenance. The sites also exhibit shared technological features within a curatorial strategy albeit with different occupation intensities. From this evidence, we infer that the initial occupations of the highlands were logistical and probably facilitated by increased local resource availability during a period of environmental amelioration.","Funding for this study was provided by FONDECYT projects 1120454, 1130808, 3140008, 3130668, and CIHDE CONICYT-REGIONAL R07K1001, CONICYT’s PIA Anillo project code SOC1405, FONDAP #1511009 to CR2, ICM P05-002 and PFB-23 to the Institute of Ecology and Biodiversity.

In this situation, scour can occur at the downstream side of the groynes. An estimate of the discharge can be obtained by using known relations for submerged weirs and for free-discharge weirs, depending on the flow situation. A discrepancy exists between the different methods of calculating the equilibrium scour depth for submerged vanes using relations for slender bridge piers. This is mainly due to the fact that hardly any experimental data are available for situations with submerged vanes. The presence of the guiding dam will cause changes in the flow profile of both water and sediment.

This paper concentrates on the concept of “startups” and attempts to present a more comprehensive view of this phenomenon. Also, the focus of this paper is on investigating enterprising communities and the startup ecosystem in Iran.   Design/methodology/approach The existing literature is carefully reviewed, definition and views are explored and the story of this phenomenon is told from the formation to the exit stage. The author elaborates the existing stages and challenges of startups in Iran. To do so, 65 tech startup founders are interviewed. Semi-structured interviews (SI) were based on previous studies mentioning the lifecycle of the startups, and were fully recorded. Moreover, secondary sources of data (SS) were used to support the findings.   Findings The paper classifies the extant theories of startups in two levels, i.e. macro level, and micro and meso levels. Also, it defines some steps for the formation of startups and studies the Iranian startup ecosystem. Last but not the least the paper contributes to the startup ecosystem of Iran which is changing disruptively, especially in the last couple of years.   Research limitations/implications Findings of this research shed light on the existing ecosystem of startups in Iran, which is rarely studied in previous research. Lack of enough evidence in the existing literature of startup ecosystem in Iran was the most significant limitation of the research which increased the need for more investigation and elaboration.

The Jejenes Formation represents the glacial to postglacial fill of the Quebrada Grande palaeofjord carved in the Eastern Precordillera. The succession has been subdivided into five stages, the youngest of which suggests a previously unrecognised glacial event for this locality. Six productive levels for palynology were found within proglacial strata, and in the base and top of the succeeding interglacial stage. Palynoassemblages are characterized by poorly preserved trilete spores and monosaccate pollen grains along with a large amount of terrestrial phytoclasts. Main species indicating the Raistrickia densa-Convolutispora muriornata SubZone (DMa SZ) are Vallatisporites ciliaris, Cristatisporites rollerii, C. stellatus, C. chacoparanensis, C. inconstans and monosaccates such as Circumplicatipollis plicatus. This DMa SZ is estimated as Serpukhovian/Bashkirian and characterizes the glacial-related Guandacol Formation and equivalents units of the western Paganzo Basin. A tuffaceous level in the proglacial unit, bearing platyspermic seeds, plant remains and palynomorphs, yielded first-cycle volcanic zircons that were analysed by SHRIMP. An absolute age of 321.3 ± 5.3 Ma confirms a Bashkirian age for the main postglacial transgression in the Paganzo Basin, and offers a novel calibration for the palynoassemblages of DMa SZ that occurs elsewhere in Western Argentina.","AcknowledgementsThis work is part of a research project supported by BG Brazil E&amp;P Ltda. entitled “Carboniferous deglacial record in the Paraná Basin and its analogue in the Paganzo Basin of Argentina: Impacts on reservoir predictions” undertaken at the Universidade do Vale do Rio dos Sinos (UNISINOS), Brazil, in partnership with Universidad Nacional de San Juan, and University of Aberdeen, United Kingdom; and with funds from Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Científicas y Técnicas CONICET PIP 0305 (2011-2013).

It charts shifting alliances between the latter and Guajiro alaulayus (leaders) – who were related by blood or marriage – in the 1760s and 1770s, and between alaulayus and the captains of non-Spanish ships. It argues that conflict and competition among alaulayus determined the contours and limits of such alliances. Conflict and competition among alaulayus, in turn, was fueled by perceived violations of Guajiro law concerning property rights, principally cattle rustling, as well as by conflicts over access to key Atlantic ports. Thus Guajiro kinship, law, property relations, trade, and politics dictated the terms, extent, and success of Spanish engagement, missionary as well as martial. Spanish presence was contingent on the goodwill of one or more Guajiro alaulayus, whose power derived in part from the broader Atlantic trade networks in which they participated, and constrained Spanish imperialism. This view rejects conflict and competition among European imperial agents as the chief determinants of indigenous autonomy. Native peoples such as the Guajiros shaped the course of European empires as much as they were shaped by them. This chapter sets the scene of interaction between humans and nature in a place where European political and social power was weak to non-existent, and colonial Atlantic trade networks provided the basis of indigenous wealth, prestige, and political power. It narrates the history of Capuchin missions and describes the rise of Cecilio Lopez Sierra as a mediator between Spanish power in the Lower Guajira and the alaulayus of the Upper Guajira. The chapter analyzes Guajiro insurgency in the Lower Peninsula in the late 1760s and early 1770s, the basis of peace agreements with the Spanish in 1773, and the unraveling of those agreements during the failed counterinsurgency campaigns in the Upper Guajira from 1775 to 1777, and concludes with the aftermath in the 1780s. The de-centralized nature of power and authority, which was built into Guajiro kinship structures, led to a patchwork of micro-territories and micro-sovereignties.","The author would like to thank the participants in conferences and seminars at the University of Pittsburgh, Rutgers University, Northwestern University, the New School, Vanderbilt University, and New York University, as well as Michael A.

The robot’s goal in an autonomous exploration task is to create a complete, high-quality map of an unknown environment as quickly as possible. This implicitly requires the robot to maintain an accurate estimate of its pose as it explores both unknown and previously observed terrain in order to correctly incorporate new information into the map. Our utility function simultaneously considers uncertainty in both the robot pose and the map in a novel way and is computed as the difference between the Shannon and the Rényi entropy of the current distribution over maps. Rényi’s entropy is a family of functions parameterized by a scalar, with Shannon’s entropy being the limit as this scalar approaches unity. We link the value of this scalar parameter to the predicted future uncertainty in the robot’s pose after taking an exploratory action. This effectively decreases the expected information gain of the action, with higher uncertainty in the robot’s pose leading to a smaller expected information gain. Our objective function allows the robot to automatically trade off between exploration and exploitation in a way that does not require manually tuning parameter values, a significant advantage over many competing methods that only use Shannon’s definition of entropy. We use simulated experiments to compare the performance of our proposed utility function to these state-of-the-art utility functions. We show that robots that use our proposed utility function generate maps with less uncertainty and fewer visible artifacts and that the robots have less uncertainty in their pose during exploration. Finally, we demonstrate that a real-world robot using our proposed utility function is able to successfully create a high-quality map of an indoor office environment.",,,Autonomous Robots,,,,2017-08-12,2017,2017-08-12,2018-02,42,2,235-256,Closed,Article,"Carrillo, Henry; Dames, Philip; Kumar, Vijay; Castellanos, José A.","Carrillo, Henry (Escuela de Ciencias Exactas e Ingeniería, Universidad Sergio Arboleda, Bogotá, Colombia); Dames, Philip (Department of Mechanical Engineering, Temple University, Philadelphia, PA, USA); Kumar, Vijay (GRASP Laboratory, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA); Castellanos, José A.

A solution modeled and simulated using a CAD/CAE software based on MEF, is proposed. Gait analysis, patient and prosthesis weights and materials sold in the country, are the criteria considered. The prototype is printed in ceramic powder to evaluate the functionality. Using a 3-axes CNC milling (ROMI D 800) and a wire cutter (EDM CHMER) the model is manufactured. A testing of engineering based on prosthesis efficiency, degree of adaptability and resistance of materials, are made. Finally, the device was tested using a patient previously chosen. The results are that a knee prosthesis for transfemoral amputation is obtained for a 900 N weight patient using an appropriate material.

The idea behind this work is to improve the accuracy in estimating the robot position with respect to systems currently used, which are based on deterministic odometry models. The mainstreaming of sensor fusion involves working with probabilistic mathematical models, which are much better suited to deal with the dynamics of complex environments. A small differential mobile robot with two accelerometers, two odometers and a gyroscope which provide the necessary data to update the estimates provided by the motion model is used. The fusion process is performed using an extended Kalman filter that requires the movement model, the measuring model of the sensors and the set of sensory measurements available in each time instant. The results indicate that the sensor fusion system is more accurate than the reference odometry system. A quantitative analysis shows that in all evaluated cases, the system reports a 38% improvement in estimating the endpoint and 27% in the accuracy over the entire trajectory.","Thanks to the Colombian Polytechnic Jaime Isaza Cadavid for the support provided and especially to Professor Gustavo Acosta Amaya for his valuable contribution as a tutor.

The magnitude of the genotype by environment interaction (GEI) together with heritability (h2) accounts for this aspect. Despite the economic significance of abalones and the interest in genetic improvement programs for their cultivation, only one previous study has reported GEI estimations for this group of mollusks. The objective of the present study was to estimate h2 and the existence of GEI for growth traits of Haliotis rufescens cultivated in Chilean farms with different environmental and management conditions. A total of 2 cohorts (2007 and 2009) of 50 and 42 families of full sibs (FS), respectively, were used. Replicates of each FS family of the 2007 cohort were distributed in two farms in the northern region of the country and were evaluated after 1 and 2years of cultivation. For the 2009 cohort, replicates of each family were distributed in a farm in the northern region and a farm in the southern region of the country. The estimated h2 values were significant for all traits, with the length and width of the shell and total weight varying primarily by cohort between 0.22–0.62, 0.16–0.58 and 0.40–0.53, respectively. The genetic correlations (rG) between traits were all higher than 0.82. The expected correlated responses for improving the total weight using the shell length as a selection criterion predict a selection gain (14–51%) similar to what would be obtained by selecting directly for weight (16–51%) in all environments examined. Thus, indirect selection by shell length and the direct use of total weight as a selection criterion would yield similar effects in terms of the increase in weight. High rG, not significantly different from 1, were observed for the analyzed traits between replicates of the families in any of the farms compared, both within the northern region and between the northern and southern regions of the country. These high rG were indicative of non-significant GEI for the analyzed traits. Therefore, results suggest that one selective breeding program could provide improved red abalone for the industry in Chile with consistent results between farms located in different environments.Statement of relevanceAbalones are one of the most important mollusks in aquaculture due to their commercial value in international markets, especially in Asia; as such there are several efforts to develop abalone breeding programs in different countries. In this work we addressed a critical aspect for a selective breeding program, which is to know whether responses of productive traits are similar in different environments. Considering that the magnitude of the genotype by environment interaction (GEI) together with heritability (h2) accounts for this aspect, we estimated these genetic quantitative parameters for growth traits (total mass, shell length and width) in two cohorts of the red abalone, Haliotis rufescens, cultivated throughout Chile. Results indicated that the application of selection by the shell length at age of harvest has the greatest potential for improving the production of H. rufescens. These improvements are practical (ease and accuracy in measurement), have indirect effects on the objective trait of selection (weight), and consist of a trait that is not significantly affected by genotype-environment interactions. In addition, the results obtained suggest that a single selective breeding program would be sufficient for the red abalone industry in Chile, as the response to selection of traits associated with growth would be similar in different environments. Red abalone is naturally distributed in California and Baja California coasts, and this information can be especially useful in planning breeding programs also in the west coast of USA and México.","AcknowledgementsWe are grateful to the abalone aquaculture companies Live Seafood Chile S.A.

436,pub.1085283680,10.1287/trsc.2016.0721,,,School Bus Routing with Stochastic Demand and Duration Constraints,"The school bus routing problem (SBRP) is crucial because of its impact on economic and social objectives. A single bus is assigned to each route, picking up students and arriving at the school within a specified time window. SBRP aims to find the fewest buses needed to cover all of the routes while minimizing the total travel distance and meeting required constraints. We propose a mathematical formulation responding to the overbooking policies applied in a real-world school district. According to our empirical studies, the probability of a student riding a bus varies from 22% to 77%, opening the opportunity to overbook the buses to improve utilization of their capacity. However, SBRP with overbooking has not attracted much attention in previous studies. In this work, overbooking is modeled via chance constrained programming. Additionally, to account for the uncertainty of the total travel time of the buses, a constraint limiting the probability of being late to school is also proposed in this paper. As a result of the NP-hard nature of the problem, a cascade simplification algorithm is proposed to partition the multiple stage SBRP problems into multiple multi-depot and one-school subproblems that are solved sequentially, where the results for one are data inputs for the next. Furthermore, we develop column-generation-based algorithms to solve the scheduling problem, and different instances of the problem are examined. Our computational experiments on a real-world school district demonstrate desirable cost savings in terms of the total number of buses used.",,,Transportation Science,,,,2017-11,2017,,2017-11,51,4,1349-1364,Closed,Article,"Caceres, Hernan; Batta, Rajan; He, Qing","Caceres, Hernan (Department of Industrial and Systems Engineering, University at Buffalo, Buffalo, New York 14260; and Department of Industrial Engineering, Universidad Católica del Norte, 1270709 Antofagasta, Chile); Batta, Rajan (Department of Industrial and Systems Engineering, University at Buffalo, Buffalo, New York 14260); He, Qing (Department of Industrial and Systems Engineering, University at Buffalo, Buffalo, New York 14260; and Department of Civil, Structural, and Environmental Engineering, University at Buffalo, Buffalo, New York 14260)",,"Caceres, Hernan (University at Buffalo, State University of New York; Catholic University of the North); Batta, Rajan (University at Buffalo, State University of New York); He, Qing (University at Buffalo, State University of New York)",40,8,,9.27,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1085283680,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3509 Transportation, Logistics and Supply Chains",

The amount of water used to form the samples changed with the compositions and varied from 27 wt %, composition with 0 w t% of grog, to 21.8%, composition with 20 wt % of grog in an experiment. The samples were dried until constant weight and then fired at 970°C in an industrial Hoffmann furnace. The XRD pattern of the grog shows quartz and micaceous mineral as the most important crystalline mineral constituents, with a small kaolinite peak indicating that the original firing temperature of the brick waste, from which the grog was produced, was not high enough for a complete dehydroxylation. The chapter concludes that the grog addition tends to decrease the high plasticity of the clay by placing it inside the optimal extrusion field of the prognostic diagram. The grog decreased the dried linear shrinkage and slightly increased the fired shrinkage of the ceramic. The final result was a significant decrease in the shrinkage of the ceramic, due to tits non‐plastic characteristic.",,,Ceramic Engineering and Science Proceedings,Developments in Strategic Ceramic Materials II,"Waltraud M.

Further, it illustrates the role of degradative enzymes, metabolic pathways of degradation, toxicity of metabolites, and the factors regulating the pesticide degradation. In view of persistence of synthetic pesticides, scientists have discovered suitable microbes, such as bacteria, fungi and algae (naturally occurring or genetically engineered) over the years. After successful trials under laboratory and field conditions, these microbes are being used to degrade chemical pesticides in agriculture. As of now 2.56 billion kg of chemical pesticides is used every year to protect agricultural fields against pest attack. These technologies have been found to be highly effective, eco-friendly and cost-effective without disturbing the agro-ecosystems. As this book contains review articles contributed by various researchers from different countries whose work demonstrates recent advances in microbial degradation of pesticides, it will serve as a ready reckoner and also a valuable quick reference guide for scientists, academicians, cultivators and industrialists alike.",,,Environmental Science and Engineering,,Shree Nath Singh,,2017,2017,,2017,,,,Closed,Edited Book,,,,,21,1,,2.07,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1049013137,41 Environmental Sciences; 4105 Pollution and Contamination,2 Zero Hunger

Improperly enclosed stockpiles of Pb concentrates can cause dust emissions, subsequent pollution of the soil and environmental risk. The aim of this work was to study Pb form, distribution and immobilization (by using eggshell and seashell) in an industrial arid soil near a storage area of Pb mineral concentrates in northern Chile. High amounts of sulfur (S; 9900 mg kg−1) and Pb (6530 mg kg−1) were found in the polluted soil. The energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy analysis revealed a lead sulfide (PbS: galena). Metallic Pb particles, which were between 41 and 46 µm, were identified in the soil. After eggshell and seashell (20%) were applied, the soil pH increased from 6.0 to 7.84 and 8.07, respectively. In the studied soil, the leaching test showed a 59 mg L−1 average Pb extractable concentration. After 240 days, extractable Pb by toxicity characteristics leaching procedure decreased to 4.79 mg L−1 (93.3%) with the application of seashell at 20% compared with a decrease of 33.33 mg L−1 (53.6%) using eggshell. Pb in the polluted soil was mainly found in the exchangeable fraction (66%), followed by the reducible (24%), residual (7%) and oxidizable (6%) fractions. According to the risk assessment code, the contaminated soil before treatment was classified as very high risk. Adding eggshell (20%) and seashell (20%) decreased the exchangeable fractions to 39 and 35%, respectively. Applying these liming materials achieved Pb immobilization in the soil, but the soil remained in the high environmental risk category. We conclude that the application of seashell waste, resulting from high aquaculture activity, opens an interesting window to the treatment of contaminated arid soils.","This work was supported by the Laboratory of Membrane Technology, Environment and Biotechnology, Department of Chemical Engineering of at the Catholic University of The North, Chile.

This paper aims to validate an adaptation of the DeLone and McLean information systems success model in the context of a learning management system. Furthermore, this study means to prove (1) the necessity of segmenting students in order to fit the model more accurately and (2) the impact of other new Internet tools on students’ perceptions with regard to learning management systems. Partial least squares has been used to analyse the measurement and the structural model. Subsequently, the Finite Mixture Partial Least Squarestechnique has been employed to examine unobserved heterogeneity and to find users’ segments. The results of this research indicate that to segment between two groups of students is especially useful in order to improve the understanding of the success of a learning management system. This segmentation is made according to the importance which the students attribute to the new Internet tools to support their learning.",,,Interactive Learning Environments,,,,2017-02-19,2017,2017-02-19,2018-01-02,26,1,135-147,Closed,Article,"Arenas-Gaitán, Jorge; Rondán-Cataluña, Francisco Javier; Ramírez-Correa, Patricio E.","Arenas-Gaitán, Jorge (Department of Business Management and Marketing, University of Seville, Seville, Spain); Rondán-Cataluña, Francisco Javier (Department of Business Management and Marketing, University of Seville, Seville, Spain); Ramírez-Correa, Patricio E.

It provides an onomastic analysis of grief names, which are used to express anger and frustrations. The culture, tradition and rituals of expressing grief differ from culture to culture. Name giving can take different forms depending on the circumstances in which the child is born. The study of naming falls under onomastics, which among others consists of personal names, place names, geographical names and grief names. The study is qualitative in nature. Two research techniques, namely interviews and observations were used for data collection. The study shows that nowadays Vatsonga no longer give their children grief names as was customary.",,,The Journal of Social Sciences,,,,2017-07-17,2017,2017-07-17,2017-12-02,51,1-3,47-52,Closed,Article,"Babane, M.

The region has a rich and singular biotic history. The collection of works included in the volume –originally presented at the Second Academic Meeting of the NZWG-ICAZ – describes some of the instances of the diverse interactions of human and faunal populations in such a setting and the particular properties characterizing the derived archaeofaunal record. Understanding the zooarchaeological imprint of human insertion and evolution in this context represents an opportunity for improving our knowledge on the many ways modern humans have dealt with the colonization of the whole globe, and on the varied forms of organization they assumed within such diverse environments. The topics covered in this volume shed light on different and complementary aspects of the state ofthe art in zooarchaeological research in the Neotropics, and reveal how much Neotropical zooarchaeology has been growing in the past few decades. Several chapters focus on marine resources, covering a broad range of the diversity found in the Neotropical coastal environments. Another set of chapters deals primarily with inland Neotropical animals –including terrestrial, riverine/estuarine and avian faunas– and also with varying societal organizations. Natural formation processes in Neotropical environments are also dealt with in this collection of works. Finally, Neotropical faunas also entail unique methodological challenges, and some chapters provide new information from this perspective. Altogether, these contributions help grasp how unique human-animal interactions have been in the Neotropics, and yet how much can be learnt from them even for other settings and other times.",,,,,"Mariana Mondini, A.

Spectral confirmation of photometric exoplanet candidates discovered by the “Kepler” mission,"We present the results of spectroscopic confirmation of exoplanet candidates from the “Kepler” space mission catalog. We used the NES spectrometer of the 6-m Russian BTA telescope to investigate the Doppler variability of the radial velocities of the host stars of KOI-974.01, KOI-2687.01/02, and KOI-2706.01. According to the derived upper limits, KOI-2706.01 has a mass significantly smaller than 12 Jupiter masses, which directly indicates its planetary nature. We show that KOI-2687.01 and KOI-2687.02, which have Earth-size or white dwarf-size radii according to photometric data, cannot be white dwarfs, and are therefore exoplanets. Radial velocity analysis for KOI-974, an F-type star, has shown noticeable variations with a half-amplitude of 400 ms−1, which correlate poorly with the phase of its orbital rotation. This can indicate a presence of other massive planets in the system, with orbits closer or farther from the host star than the orbit of KOI-974.01, or a low mass star in a distant outer orbit. Using the method of synthetic spectra, we obtained more accurate atmospheric parameter and radius estimates for all the program host stars, which, in turn, allowed us to refine the radii of the studied exoplanet candidates.",,,Astrophysical Bulletin,,,,2017-07,2017,2017-09-09,2017-07,72,3,330-336,Closed,Article,"Gadelshin, D.

Often, the dissatisfaction with the political leaders stems from economic disparities in income and opportunity, political corruption, authoritarian government rule, and a lack of educational opportunity. Notable examples include the Arab Spring that began in 2010 in Tunisia and spread throughout Arab countries and the Occupy Wall Street protest in 2011 in the United States that highlighted economic inequalities around the world. Can protests promulgated by social media and enacted by the young lead to democratic dialogue between political leaders and a country’s youth? The chapter considers this question in the context of the #FeesMustFall protest movement in South Africa. Specifically, the chapter describes the competing narratives offered in the news reporting about the social media-facilitated protests beginning in mid-October 2015 culminating at the end of October when President Jacob Zuma agreed not to raise college fees and including the subsequent protests in reaction to President Zuma’s announcement.",,,Springer International Handbooks of Education,Encyclopedia of Coastal Science,"Charles W.

The alteration, and subsequent restoration, of wetland habitats remain key issues among coastal scientists. These topics are introduced through case studies and pilot programs that are designed to better understand the best practices of trying to save what is left of these fragile ecosystems. Local approaches, as well as national and international efforts to restore the functionality of marsh systems are summarily approached and evaluated by their efficacy in producing resilient reclamations in terms of climate-smart habitat conservation. The outlook of this work is global in extent and local by intent. Included here in summarized form are professional opinions of experts in the field that investigate the crux of matter, which proves to be human pressure on coastal wetlandenvironments. Even though conservation and preservation of these delicate environmental systems may be coming at a later date, many multi-pronged approaches show promise through advances in education, litigation, and engineering to achieve sustainable coastal systems. The examples in this book are not only of interest to those working exclusively with coastal wetlands, but to those also working to protect the surrounding coastal areas of all types.",,,Coastal Research Library,,"Charles W.

Thermophilic leaching enrichments were obtained and identified from a high altitude solfataric pound in Lirima hot springs in the Chilean Altiplano. This ecosystem is characterized by hot underground freshwaters, enriched in sulfur compounds showing pH from neutral to acidic. Microbial diversity has been scarcely explored here, and preliminary results demonstrate that hydrothermal pounds are represented by thermophilic anaerobic and acidophilic taxa. Thermophilic leaching cultures in shake flasks were obtained using ferrous iron and pyrite as energy source. The presence of Bacteria and Archaea in oxidizing enrichments was determined by PCR amplification of 16S rRNA genes. A preliminary analysis of microbial diversity using massive sequencing revealed that Bacteria were more abundant than Archaea in both enrichments. Specifically for the iron-oxidizing culture, the majority of the sequences clustered within the Proteobacteria phylum (79%). Among Proteobacteria, the proportion of Betaproteobacteria (42.2%) and Gammaproteobacteria (21.27%) was much higher than that of Alphaproteobacteria (15.5%). Within the Betaproteobacteria class, the most frequent genus was Leptothrix-like. Similar results were obtained for the pyrite oxidizing culture. Interestingly, this study shows the presence of microorganisms close to the Leptothrix genus under low pH conditions (1.7-2.8) and their capacity to grow at high temperatures with ferrous iron or pyrite as sole energy source",,,Solid State Phenomena,,,,2017-08,2017,2017-08,2017-09-25,262,,526-530,Closed,Article,"Barahona, Sergio; Cortés, Johanna; Hengst, Martha; Dorador, Cristina; Remonsellez, Francisco","Barahona, Sergio (Universidad Católica del Norte, Laboratorio de Bioprocesos y Medio Ambiente, Departamento de Ingeniería Química, Antofagasta, Chile); Cortés, Johanna (Universidad Católica del Norte, Laboratorio de Ecología Molecular y Microbiología Aplicada, Departamento de Ciencias Farmacéuticas, Antofagasta, Chile); Hengst, Martha (Universidad Católica del Norte, Laboratorio de Ecología Molecular y Microbiología Aplicada, Departamento de Ciencias Farmacéuticas, Antofagasta, Chile); Dorador, Cristina (Centre for Biotechnology and Bioengineering (CeBiB), Antofagasta, Chile); Remonsellez, Francisco (Universidad Católica del Norte, Laboratorio de Bioprocesos y Medio Ambiente, Departamento de Ingeniería Química, Antofagasta, Chile)",,"Barahona, Sergio (Catholic University of the North); Cortés, Johanna (Catholic University of the North); Hengst, Martha (Catholic University of the North); Dorador, Cristina (Centre for Biotechnology and Bioengineering (CeBiB), Antofagasta, Chile); Remonsellez, Francisco (Catholic University of the North)",1,0,,0.1,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1091304598,40 Engineering; 4016 Materials Engineering,7 Affordable and Clean Energy

Because some books use the Newtonian kinetic energy and others use the total relativistic energy (including the rest energy), the non-relativistic limit of the relativistic phase velocity differs from the Newtonian phase velocity, which can be confusing for many students. This paper proposes expressing the phase velocity by first subtracting the rest energy from the relativistic energy before imposing the usual de Broglie relations. In addition to providing the corresponding Newtonian phase velocity, it also provides a relativistic Schrödinger equation which intuitively reduces to the non-relativistic Schrödinger equation in the appropriate regime. The problem of the equivalence between the relativistic Schrödinger equation and the Klein–Gordon equation is also addressed by using arguments which can be understood by undergraduate students.","The author wishes to thank Professor Julio M Yáñez of Universidad Católica del Norte (Antofagasta, Chile) for his interest and time spent in many fruitful discussions.",,European Journal of Physics,,,,2017-04-18,2017,2017-04-18,2017-07-01,38,4,045402,Closed,Article,"Mundarain, Douglas","Mundarain, Douglas (Departamento de Física, Universidad Católica del Norte, Casilla 1280, Antofagasta, Chile)",,"Mundarain, Douglas (Catholic University of the North)",5,1,,2.53,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1084947636,51 Physical Sciences; 5103 Classical Physics,

Spatial and temporal description of the microbial community could be relevant for better comprehension of copper extraction process and help in the development of operative procedures to improve the metal extraction. We performed metagenomics and high-throughput sequencing of 16S rRNA genes analyses on samples from Escondida mine bioleaching heap and laboratory columns tests. Archaeal community structure in samples was assessed using three pairs of Archaea-specific primers, and results were highly depending on the primers pairs used. Similarly, three pairs of Bacteria-specific primers were used to assess the bacterial community. Moreover, according to the metagenomics analysis, At. thiooxidans, F. acidarmanus, Leptospirillum spp., Acidiphilium sp.

345,pub.1084213001,10.1111/hic3.12375,,,The everyday politics of being a student in South Africa: A history,"Abstract Over the past year, student protests under the banners #RhodesMustFall and #FeesMustFall have swept South Africa, demanding the “decolonization” of curricula and greater educational access. This article contextualizes these protests, drawing on a vibrant historiography on student politics under apartheid (1948–1994). In scholarship produced during the antiapartheid movement, it often seemed that the history of student protests was the history of education. The study of resistance has remained integral to the field. Yet, over the past decade, how historians look at student politics has been changing. First, we look at the spaces of politics differently. We move beyond familiar narratives of student resistance because we look beyond the campuses that played emblematic roles in the making of African nationalism and antiapartheid struggle. New vantage points enable us to see different political actors. These youth asked diverse questions about their lives and about the purpose and form of schooling in an unequal society, and they expressed these questions through strategies that included but were not limited to school strikes. Their questions arose out of daily struggles around issues of race, gender, sexuality, and class—struggles that resonate with the concerns of student activists today.",,,History Compass,,,,2017-03-10,2017,2017-03-10,2017-03,15,3,,Closed,Article,"Healy‐Clancy, Meghan","Healy‐Clancy, Meghan (Bridgewater State University)","Healy‐Clancy, Meghan (Bridgewater State University)","Healy‐Clancy, Meghan (Bridgewater State University)",3,1,,4.51,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1084213001,"43 History, Heritage and Archaeology; 4303 Historical Studies",4 Quality Education

Most of these tailings are fine-grained residues with low copper content (0.1-0.8%) and include toxic compounds, such as heavy metals, arsenic, and flotation reagents, among others. Another hazard is the generation of acid mine drainage (AMD) due to biological oxidation of tailings. On the other hand, low-grade ore is challenging the mining industry to commercially produce copper.The main objective of this work was to assess the use of flotation tailings and low-grade ore to produce a biologically-produced copper sulfide, as a product for further pyrometallurgical or fine chemistry processing. Low-grade ore and flotation tailings were first agglomerated at different proportions and leaching tests were performed in 1m columns, using either industrial or synthetic raffinate solution. Then, the PLS solution obtained from the column tests was subjected to selective precipitation of copper by using biogenic hydrogen sulfide (H2S) generated by a mixed culture of neutrophilic sulfate reducing bacteria (SRB), enriched from sediments of Caracarani river (located at 4,600 m over sea level in northern Chile).Over 91% of the copper soluble present in the PLS was recovered as copper sulfide in 28 days, while ferrous iron, other metals and arsenic remained in solution. Analysis performed by XRD confirmed the presence of copper in the precipitate (58% as covellite). This work demonstrates the possibility to apply bioleaching and bio-precipitation technologies to treat tailings and low-grade copper ore to produce a high quality copper sulfide.",,,Solid State Phenomena,,,,2017-08,2017,2017-08,2017-09-25,262,,202-206,Closed,Article,"Zepeda, Víctor J.; Nancucheo, Ivan; Guillen, Milton; Becerra, Enrique; Escuti, Camila; Cautivo, Dina; González, Daniella; Colipai, C.; Demergasso, Cecilia; Galleguillos, Pedro A.","Zepeda, Víctor J.

Employing various protest-treatment techniques, we estimate the mean WTP for reducing current risks of theft and robbery by 50% to range between £38 and £220; for WTA, they are between £351 and £2,175. Higher values for robbery reflect people’s aversion to the violence implicit in this type of crime. The annual value of avoiding a statistical case of crime ranges between £7,011 for theft and £90,087 for robbery. WTP-WTA ratios range from 1:4.8 to 1:16.9 and are influenced by type of crime and elicitation method. In turn, these results support the economic sense of a pre-emptive crime policy that prevents, rather than compensates for, crime occurrence.","We would like to thank participants at seminars at the Catholic University of the North, Chile.","This work was supported by the Alumni Fund at University of Bath, UK; CONICYT, Programa POSTDOCTORADO [under grant number 3160521 to M.P.]; and the Institute for Research in Market Imperfections and Public Policy, ICM IS130002, Ministerio de Economía, Fomento y Turismo de Chile [to M.P.].",Oxford Economic Papers,,,,2017-11-08,2017,2017-11-08,2018-04-01,70,2,468-484,Closed,Article,"Hernández, José Ignacio; Hunt, Alistair; Pazzona, Matteo; Lavín, Felipe Vásquez","Hernández, José Ignacio (School of Business and Economics, Universidad del Desarrollo, Chile); Hunt, Alistair (Department of Economics, University of Bath, Santiago, Chile;); Pazzona, Matteo (Department of Economics, Diego Portales University, Avenida Santa Clara 797, Huechuraba, Santiago, Chile; and Institute for Research in Market Imperfections and Public Policy (MiPP), Avenida Republica 779, Santiago, Chile;); Lavín, Felipe Vásquez (School of Business and Economics, Universidad del Desarrollo and Research Nucleus on Environmental and Natural Resource Economics (RS130001), Universidad de Concepción, Chile)","Pazzona, Matteo (Diego Portales University; Department of Economics, Diego Portales University, Avenida Santa Clara 797, Huechuraba, Santiago, Chile; and Institute for Research in Market Imperfections and Public Policy (MiPP), Avenida Republica 779, Santiago, Chile;)","Hernández, José Ignacio (Universidad del Desarrollo); Hunt, Alistair (Department of Economics, University of Bath, Santiago, Chile;); Pazzona, Matteo (Diego Portales University; Department of Economics, Diego Portales University, Avenida Santa Clara 797, Huechuraba, Santiago, Chile; and Institute for Research in Market Imperfections and Public Policy (MiPP), Avenida Republica 779, Santiago, Chile;); Lavín, Felipe Vásquez (University of Concepción)",6,2,,2.11,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1091791096,38 Economics; 3801 Applied Economics; 3802 Econometrics; 3803 Economic Theory,

Although school attendance is poor among blacks, it is higher among African girls than among boys. No volume on the status of black women, especially one that includes a discussion of black women in developing countries, would be complete without a discussion on the status of black women under apartheid, in South Africa. This is especially true since the 1984-85 period marked a resurgence of world resistance to apartheid. If the weaknesses in the South African economy are considered, the position of black women in South Africa is seen as more parallel to the position of other women in developing countries. The impacts of apartheid on black South African women are myriad.

336,pub.1090718626,10.1093/mnras/stx1784,,,On the ancient field blue straggler HR 5455,"We report the discovery of HR 5455 as an ancient field blue straggler that upon Roche lobe overflow from its evolved companion, now a white dwarf, has been rejuvenated to a MBS = 1.32 ± 0.05 M⊙ bright F6V source with a purported age of τ ≃ 1.7 Gyr. The unequivocal evidence for HR 5455 being instead a τ ≃ 12 Gyr old Population II star arises from its low iron-to-magnesium abundance ratio, and is supported by its kinematics, the lack of lithium and a companion mass MWD = 0.49 ± 0.09 M⊙ from the P = 1086 ± 77 d Hipparcos astrometric orbit, which is in perfect agreement with the Rappaport et al. period–white dwarf mass relation. Like the F7V star 49 Lib that we recently disclosed as an ancient field blue straggler in a similar context, HR 5455 is also a very metal-rich source at [Mg/H] = +0.19 and [Fe/H] = −0.10. Unlike 49 Lib, however, only the white dwarf progenitor mass is directly constrained to MWD,progenitor = 1.06 ± 0.02 M⊙. In case of a conservative mass transfer, which in analogy to the 49 Lib system appears likely, a blue straggler progenitor mass MBS,progenitor = 0.75 M⊙ would follow.",Based on observations with the MPG 2.2 m telescope at the European Organisation for Astronomical Research in the Southern hemisphere under ESO programme 099.A-9022(A).

For this investigation, a helical coil steam generator of IRIS design is selected due to availability of its design parameters in literature. Steam generator model is developed in RELAP5/Mod 4.0. At first, steady state simulation has been performed for this model and results are found in good agreement with the IRIS design data. In order to evaluate the behavior of steam generator under accidental conditions, transient analysis has also been performed. Steam generator performance is assessed for two transients, namely, feed line break (FLB) and loss of flow accident (LOFA). Exponential losses of secondary side pressures (inlet and outlet) are considered for FLB, whereas an exponential loss of primary flow rate is considered for LOFA.

The emergence of cells in this range of Rayleigh numbers and their evolution as Ra increases is numerically studied using the network simulation method. The influence of the height and length of the rectangular domain, H and L, which define the aspect ratio and the particular Ra below critical, give rise to singular scenarios of irregular cells whose development decreases from the lateral boundaries − where the first rolls emerge − towards the center.

Violation of media ethics strongly characterizes Croatian media. Hate speech, disrespect of privacy, manipulation, sensationalism and abuse of children’s rights are an everyday reality. Established instruments of media accountability, such as press councils and ombudsmen, have not been developed in Croatia and thus do not have any significant influence on the media environment.

Results of measurements of electronic energy loss for few keV protons and deuterons interacting with multi-walled carbon nanotubes are presented. Analyses of the energy loss distributions, for both type of ions, show a particular shape which is due to the cylindrical geometry of the nanotubes. These distributions can be explained in detail by a Monte Carlo simulation program that includes elastic and inelastic processes and the geometrical properties of the nanotubes. The electronic energy loss values obtained from this study are proportional to the ion velocity, but are lower than the corresponding values for amorphous carbon. This indicates that the ion-nanotube interaction is affected by the electronic and crystalline structure of the nanotubes. Comparisons with experimental values for different types of C targets and with recent theoretical calculations were also done.

For the exoplanetWASP-32b, we detected a significant variation of intensity and equivalent width in the Hα spectral line of the parent star at the time of a transit. The equivalent width of the line during transit is by 8–10% larger than outside the planet passage. Residual intensity in the core of the line reveals the following tendency: the line is by 10–15% deeper inside transit than outside it. Observations with the long-slit spectrograph of the Crimean Astrophysical Observatory at the 2.6-m ZTSh telescope also showed a transit event in the Hα line, although, with a smaller amplitude and shape inverted in relation to the data from the 6-m telescope. While in the observations with the BTA the Hα line becomes deeper during the transit, in the ZTSh observations, the residual intensity of the Hα line decreases during the transit. Reducing and analysis of the archive data of WASP-32b observations with the HARPS spectrograph also confirm the Hα line modulation at the time of the transit. The observed data give evidence of the envelope in WASP-32b filling the Roche lobe and a comet-like tail of changing geometry and orientation relative to the observer. These changes determine different depths and shapes of the Hα spectral line at the time of transits.",,,Astrophysical Bulletin,,,,2017-01,2017,2017-02-23,2017-01,72,1,67-72,Closed,Article,"Grauzhanina, A.

Compared with oC80-MgB2C2 and oP10-MgB2C2 phases, the theoretically predicted hP5-MgB2C2 and tI20-MgB2C2 phases show an intriguing three-dimensional (3D) sp3 B-C bonded network, instead of original 2D sp2 B-C layers, which has been confirmed with the analysis of their structures and partial densities of states. The phase transitions of oC80-MgB2C2 → oP10-MgB2C2, oP10-MgB2C2 → hP5-MgB2C2, and hP5-MgB2C2 → tI20-MgB2C2 occur at 4.6 GPa, 18.9 GPa, and 247.5 GPa, respectively, which have been determined according to the examination of enthalpy differences curves. Electronic band structure calculations suggest that the oC80-MgB2C2, oP10-MgB2C2 and hP5-MgB2C2 phases are indirect band gap semiconductor, while the tI20-MgB2C2 phase changes to direct band gap semiconductor.","The work was financially supported by the Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 11647007), the Natural Science Basic Research plan in Shaanxi Province of China (Grant No. 2016JM106), the Education Committee Natural Science Foundation in Shaanxi Province of China (Grant No. 16JK1049), the Scientific Research Program in Baoji City of China (Grant No. 16RKX1-15), and the Baoji University of Arts and Sciences Key Research (Grant No. ZK16067).",,Journal of Applied Physics,,,,2017-05-18,2017,2017-05-18,2017-05-21,121,19,195102,Closed,Article,"Zheng, Baobing","Zheng, Baobing (College of Physics and Optoelectronic Technology, Nonlinear Research Institute, Baoji University of Arts and Sciences, Baoji 721016, China)",,"Zheng, Baobing (Baoji University of Arts and Sciences)",4,1,,0.83,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1085440740,51 Physical Sciences; 5104 Condensed Matter Physics,

All phases were synthesized using the sol-gel process. X-ray powder diffraction (PXRD), Raman spectra, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), absorption spectra, photoluminescence spectra (PL) and decay curves were used to characterize the resulting phosphors. The results of PXRD indicate the existence of solid solution for all phases, in which the Er3+ cations effectively replace the Ti4+ sites at low concentrations and both sites Ba2+ and Ti4+ at high concentrations.When exciting with 1500nm laser radiation, the spectra are dominated by a strong emission band at 980nm (4I11/2→4I15/2) and a weak red emission at 660nm (4F9/2→4I15/2).In order to understand the mechanism of the infrared-to visible up-conversion process, the decay curves of the emission at 980nm by exciting at 1500nm and 800nm were analyzed; these results show that the process is in good agreement with a GSA/ESA mechanism.The dependence of the three different emissions (IR (980nm), green (550nm), and red (660nm)) as a function of the pump power of the incident laser was also studied.","AcknowledgmentsThe authors acknowledge Conicyt-Chile for the financial support (Anillo Grant ACT 1204).

Sports are responsible for significant carbon footprints through stadium construction and energy use, player and spectator travel, and media coverage. The impact of sports on climate change is further compounded by sponsorship deals with gas and petroleum industries—imbuing those extractive corporations with a positive image by embedding them within the everyday pleasure of sport. Toby Miller argues that such activities amount to “greenwashing”. Scrutinizing motor racing, association football, and the Olympics, Miller weighs up their environmental policies, their rhetoric of conservation and sustainability, and their green credentials.

In this manuscript the Nyquist-I pulse, called exponential linear pulse (ELP), is evaluated in the time and frequency domain using different evaluation tools and compared with other existing pulses. The eye diagram is simulated in presence of time sampling errors and the approximated average bit error rate (BER) is computed considering the ideal and truncated version of the pulses. Finally, the spectral energy distribution and spectral regrowth of the pulses are presented for comparison purposes. Numerical results show that the ELP outperforms other existing pulses in terms of the eye diagram opening and BER, evaluated for various symbol timing errors and roll-off factors. However, the good performance of the ELP in the time domain is at the expenses of introduction of out-of-band radiation compared to the traditional Raised Cosine pulse; therefore, a trade-off between BER and out-of-band radiation exists.","The authors acknowledge the financial support of the Project FONDECYT Iniciacion, Grant No. 11160517, and FONDECYT Postdoctoral Grant No. 3170021.

The first party randomly sends coherent states (CS) or single-photon-added coherent states (SPACS) to the second party. The latter sends back the same state it received. Both parties decide which kind of states they are receiving by detecting or not a photon on the received signal after displacement operations. The first party must determine whether its sent and received states are equal; otherwise, the case must be discarded. We are going to show that an eavesdropper provided with a beam splitter gets the same information in any of the non-discarded cases. The key can be obtained by assigning 0 to CS and 1 to SPACS in the non-discarded cases. This protocol guarantees keys’ security in the presence of a beam splitter attack even for states with a high number of photons in the sent signal.

In Chile, Sphaeriidae is represented by 11 species belonging to the genera Musculium, Pisidium and Sphaerium. In this study, the nuclear DNA content (or 2C-value) of Musculium argentinum (d’Orbigny, 1835) and Pisidium llanquihuense Ituarte, 1999 was estimated for the first time. Musculium argentinum showed a 2C-value of 3.7 ± 0.38 pg, whereas P. llanquihuense showed a 2C-value of 3.57 ± 0.36 pg. These 2C-values are within the range previously reported for Sphaeriidae (2.35–5.7 pg), which includes diploids and polyploids, amounting to 13 of the species examined around the world.

El objetivo es analizar la asociación entre sintomatología y patología lumbopélvica y SMT, entregando una nueva arista al síndrome que podría significar alternativas preventivas y terapéuticas. Materiales y métodos Se realizó un estudio transversal retrospectivo entre los años 2016-2017 con pacientes diagnosticados de SMT en un grupo de apoyo de dicha patología. Se realizó un análisis estadístico demográfico con prueba t de Student y prueba Chi-cuadrado de Pearson. Se calcularon los riesgos relativos crudo y ajustado con regresión logística binaria para evaluar la relación entre SMT y sintomatología y patología lumbopélvica. Resultados Un total de 277 pacientes (134 casos y 143 controles) fueron satisfactoriamente incluidos en el estudio. La edad promedio de los casos fue de 40 años (±12,3), y de 36 (±13,5) años en los controles. Ambos grupos consisten predominantemente en mujeres caucásicas. La obesidad estuvo presente en el 36,6% de los casos y en el 22,4% de los controles. El riesgo relativo crudo se calculó para determinar la asociación entre SMT y la sintomatología de la extremidad estudiada, evidenciando diferencias significativas entre los grupos para las variables de edad, peso y altura. Se calculó riesgo relativo ajustado identificando riesgo significativo de presentar sintomatología lumbopélvica, de extremidad inferior y ambas categorías juntas siendo estos de 3,02 (1,75-5,22), 11,5 (6,4-20,5) y 9,83 (5,5-17,6), respectivamente. El riesgo relativo de presentar patología lumbopélvica en contexto de SMT fue de 3,4 (1,9-6,1) Conclusión El SMT se encuentra predominantemente en mujeres con un promedio de edad ubicado en la cuarta década de la vida. Existe una asociación significativa entre la presencia de SMT y la sintomatología de extremidad inferior y lumbopélvica, no clásicamente descrito en el síndrome. Además, el riesgo de tener una patología lumbopélvica en contexto de SMT es significativo. Abstract Objectives May-Thurner syndrome (MTS) is classically associated with left lower limb symptomatology and thrombotic events in young women. Our objective is to assess the association between lumbo-pelvic pathology and symptomatology and MTS providing a new perspective to the syndrome in the hopes to provide preventive and therapeutic alternatives. Materials and methods A cross-sectional study was performed between 2016-2017 with a MTS patient's support group. Statistical analysis was performed with t-Student's test, Pearson's chi-squared test to provide a socio-demographic analysis of the groups. Raw odds ratio and adjusted odds ratio with binary logistic regression were calculated to assess the risk relation between MTS and lower extremity and lumbo-pelvic symptomatology and pathology. Results Two hundred and seventy-seven patients (134 cases and 143 controls) were successfully included in the study. Mean age of the cases group was 40 years (±12.3), and 36 (±13.5) years for the controls. Both groups consisted of predominantly white/Caucasian females. Obesity was present in 36.6% of cases and 22.4% of the controls. Raw OR was calculated to determine association between MTS and the studied symptomatology identifying significative differences among the groups for the clinical variables of age, weight and height. The OR was adjusted identifying significant risk of presenting lumbo-pelvic symptomatology, lower limb symptomatology and the two previous categories together, identifying risks of 3.02 (1.75-5.22), 11.5 (6.4-20.5) and 9.83 (5.5-17.6) respectively. The OR of presenting lumbo-pelvic disease in the context of MTS was 3.4 (1.9-6.4). Conclusion MTS is predominantly found in women with a mean of age of 40 years old. There is a significant association between MTS presence and lower limb and lumbo-pelvic symptomatology, not classically associated with the syndrome description. Also, the risk of having a lumbo-pelvic disease in the context of MTS is significant.",Agradecimientos Nos gustaría agradecer a los miembros del grupo de apoyo de pacientes con síndrome de May-Thurner.,,Angiología,,,,2017-11,2017,,2017-11,69,6,342-347,Closed,Article,"Argaluza, M.I.

However, the dependency among nested callbacks, known as callback hell, can make it difficult to understand and maintain them, which will eventually mix concerns. Unfortunately, current solutions for JavaScript do not fully address the aforementioned issue. This paper presents Sync/cc, a JavaScript library that uses continuations and aspects to allow developers to write handlers that need nested callbacks in a synchronous style, preventing callback dependencies. Unlike current solutions, Sync/cc is modular, customizable, and succinct because it does not require special and scattered keywords, code refactoring, or adding ad-hoc implementations like state machines. In practice, our proposal uses a) continuations to only suspend the current handler execution until the asynchronous operation is resolved, and b) aspects to apply continuations in a non-intrusive way.",,,,Proceedings of the Symposium on Applied Computing,,,2017-04-03,2017,2017-04-03,2017-04-03,,,1245-1250,Closed,Proceeding,"Leger, Paul; Fukuda, Hiroaki","Leger, Paul (Universidad Católica del Norte, Chile); Fukuda, Hiroaki (Shibaura Institute of Technology, Japan)",,"Leger, Paul (Catholic University of the North); Fukuda, Hiroaki (Shibaura Institute of Technology)",2,0,,0.65,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1090742921,46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4612 Software Engineering,

These V-band observations revealed significant variability in the classical highly magnetized white dwarf GRW+70◦8247 with a likely period from several days to several dozen days and a half-amplitude of about 0.m 04. Our observations also revealed the variability of the well-known white dwarf GD229. The half amplitude of its photometric variability is equal to about 0.m 005, and the likely period of this degenerate star lies in the 10–20 day interval. This variability is most likely due to the rotation of the stars considered.We also discuss the peculiarities of the photometric variability in a number of other white dwarfs.

Tsietsi Mashinini: The Forgotten Warrior of South Africa's Liberation Struggle,"Tsietsi Mashinini symbolises youth resistance to racism and imperialism after he heroically led the June 16 1976 Soweto student uprisings that defied South Africa's apartheid government. Subsequently, the United Nations condemned apartheid as a crime against humanity, but Tsietsi became a political exile at the tender age of 19. In exile, he formed the South African Youth Revolutionary Council (SAYRCO) together with his comrades from the Soweto Students Representative Council (SSRC) that was banned by Pretoria in 1977 along with numerous other organisations. Ironically, Tsietsi's individual and collective legacy is underplayed or ignored in contemporary South Africa. His illustrious role has only grudgingly been recognised long after South Africa achieved liberal democracy in 1994. Yet Tsietsi's heroism and legacy inspired the students that he led when confronting the apartheid system. Like Tsietsi, thousands left the country to join the anti-apartheid liberation struggle. Thus, his activities remain etched deeply in their minds whenever they reflect on his legacy annually during the 1976 uprising's anniversary, now called Youth Day. Others put increasing pressure on apartheid at home until it relinquished power through negotiations. This article examines Tsietsi Mashinini's legacy and his contribution to South Africa's freedom struggle based on a review of the literature, historical records and media reports, theoretical reflection guided by Rational Choice Theory and Game Theory, and an analysis of the awards given to freedom struggle stalwarts and other South African luminaries. It concludes with observations on Tsietsi Mashinini's legacy, with the author's contention that his legacy—underplayed or ignored—will forever haunt post-1994 South Africa's democracy.",,,African Historical Review,,,,2017-07-03,2017,2018-06-14,2017-07-03,49,2,22-47,Closed,Article,"Maphunye, Kealeboga J.","Maphunye, Kealeboga J.

In this work the issue of recording and reading data using the magnetic vortex of nanodisks is addressed. By using the polarity and chirality properties of the magnetic vortex it may be possible to store information in binary or nonbinary form. Nevertheless, as in any storage system, information can be altered by the presence of noise, and therefore it is necessary to incorporate error control coding. In this regard, here we analyse the behaviour of the proposed system using Turbo coding and Low Density Parity Check (LDPC) coding in order to correct errors in the writing and reading process in nanoparticles. Simulations were performed for the binary case considering the polarity of the magnetic vortex to store information. This, because it appears to be the first workable level in the short term, before reaching practical implementations involving the simultaneous control of polarity and chirality to store non-binary data.",,,IEEE Latin America Transactions,,,,2017-06-27,2017,2017-06-27,,15,7,1238-1243,Closed,Article,"Perez, J.

The meaning of the word, however, has evolved with the advancement of technology. Adjectives such as digital, intelligent, and smart have been prefixed to ‘city’, to reflect the evolution. In this study, we pose the question: What makes a ‘Smart City’, as opposed to a traditional one? We review and synthesize multiple scientific studies and definitions, and present a unified definition of Smart City—a complex concept. We present the definition as an ontology which encapsulates the combinatorial complexity of the concept. It systematically and systemically synthesizes, and looks beyond, the various paths by which theory and practice contribute to the development and understanding of a smart city. The definition can be used to articulate the components of a Smart City using structured natural English. It serves as a multi-disciplinary lens to study the topic drawing upon concepts from Urban Design, Information Technology, Public Policy, and the Social Sciences. It can be used to systematically map the state-of-the-research and the state-of-the-practice on Smart Cities, discover the gaps in each and between the two, and formulate a strategy to bridge the gaps.",,,Lecture Notes in Computer Science,Electronic Government,"Marijn Janssen, Karin Axelsson, Olivier Glassey, Bram Klievink, Robert Krimmer, Ida Lindgren, Peter Parycek, Hans J.

We analyzed articles and reviews from InCites™ database published by six complex innovation systems. We found scale-invariant properties in the complex innovation systems which were analyzed. These properties are evidenced in the power law correlation between complex innovation systems’ citation-based impact and their size with a scaling exponent α ≈ 1.19 ± 0.01. The results suggest citations to a complex innovation system tend to increase 21.19 or 2.28 times when the system doubles its size over time. These scale-invariant emergent properties are a common property of a complex innovation system. These properties can be quantified using the parameters of scale-invariant correlation. These parameters can be used to formulate measures and models useful for informing public policy about scale-invariant emerging properties of a complex innovation system, making comparisons of citation impact between complex systems of vastly different sizes, evaluating citation impact of complex innovation systems according to their size, long range planning, and elaborating rankings across complex innovation systems.","We thank Professor J.

The ferrite NPs were synthesized using the Massart-assisted microwave hydrothermal treatment. All the NPs exhibited the spinel structure with a formula such as MxFe3−xO4, where M = Co or Mn, and x runs from 0.21 to 1.14. The changes in the stoichiometry caused different effects on the physical properties as well on the As(III) adsorption capacity of the NPs. The adsorption data were fitted in very good agreement with the Freundlich model. It was concluded that As(III) was better attracted to ferrimagnetic cobalt ferrite NPs, given that the arsenic removal was significantly higher than that exhibited by superparamagnetic manganese-substituted ferrite NPs.","This work was former financially supported by PRODEP “Apoyo a la Incorporación de Nuevos PTC 2014,” DAIT/2014/09, SEP-CONACYT CB-2010-157232, and SEP-CONACYT CB-2012-01-181592.

In particular, the earth surface displacement caused by earthquakes, volcanoes and tsunamis can manifest as ionospheric plasma perturbations. We investigate the coseismic induced ionospheric total electron content (TEC) perturbations following the Mw 8.3 Illapel thrust earthquake that occurred on September 16, 2015. The continuous global positioning system (GPS) data at 48 sites from Centro Sismológico Nacional and International GNSS Service GPS networks have been used in this study. The nearest GPS site recorded the ionospheric response 10 min after the occurrence of this earthquake. The maximum vertical coseismic induced TEC amplitude is ~1.4 TECU, and the perturbations are pronounced in the northern region of the epicenter and confined to less than ~1500 km radius. The average horizontal acoustic wave velocity has been determined as ~1260 m/s. We also observed acoustic resonance recorded by PRN 12 at 4.3 mHz corresponding to the first overtone of acoustic mode and lasting for about 30 min. In this study, we present characteristics of GPS derived ionospheric plasma perturbations following Illapel earthquake.",The authors thank the Centro Sismolo´gico Nacional (CSN) and FONDECYT N° 1151175 for making available the GPS data.

We assessed the effects of the presence of opposite-sex conspecifics on adult crab spacing at a low density to infer potential mate acquisition behaviors. Adult crabs held in all-male, all-female, and mixed-sex treatments were observed twice daily over five days to determine nearest-neighbor (NN) distances and relative activity. Males in the mixed-sex treatment with the shortest NN distances (NN1) were most commonly (1) closest to females, and, when compared to NN1 males in the all-male treatment, were (2) closer to their NN and (3) had lower activity levels. Female movement did not differ between treatments. Percent ovigerous females at the end of trials were higher in the mixed-sex treatment, reflecting mating activity, which when observed, involved inter-molt females. Mate guarding, rather than pure-searching behavior, was the mating behavior most consistent with observed spacing and movement patterns.","This project was funded by the Graduate Program of the University of Charleston, SC at the College of Charleston.

Turbulent flocculation was performed on a detachable cylinder using the plunger method to promote efficient and controlled mixing. The suspensions were prepared at natural pH (between 5.8–6.0) with salinities in the range 0–0.5M NaCl. Once a suspension was prepared, it was allowed to settle for 2.5h, during which time the variation in sediment height was small. The sediment was removed with minimal disturbance and subjected to stress growth or creep-recovery tests on a rheometer operated in control rate and control stress modes, respectively. Kaolinite suspensions in the presence of flocculant and salt in concentrations larger than a small although critical concentration (NaCl 0.001M) exhibit an inverse relationship between yield stress and settling rate with salt concentration, and direct relationship between shear strain and salt concentration. It is concluded that the particle network becomes denser and the crosslinking weaker with increasing salt. At the critical concentration of 0.001M NaCl, flocculation is best, the initial settling rate and yield stress are the highest, and shear strain the lowest. The response of the floc network to salinity changes is the result of two mechanisms competition: (i) charge screening of both anionic particles and flocculant by salt counterions, and (ii) shielding of the active sites on the flocculant by salt cations that causes the polymer to fold into compact structures adopting balled-up conformations. The first mechanism promotes flocculation while the second supresses flocculation.",AcknowledgementsAuthors thank INNOVA CORFO Projects CSIRO Chile 10CEII-9007.

However, conceptions of multilingualism are still narrowly construed within the aegis of a oneness ideology that characterized the European enlightenment period (Ricento, T., Journal of Sociolinguistics, 4(2):196–213, 2000). Within this framework, languages are treated in isolation and as autonomous sets of skills that are taught and learned in linear and sequential fashion to avoid one language from being contaminated by the other. Yet the cultural value systems that predate European colonialism in South Africa assumed an interdependent worldview of plurality and fluid linguistic system between people of different language varieties. This chapter describes inherent tensions between Afrocentric and Eurocentric ideological notions of multilingualism and bilingual education through a historical overview of South African multilingualism from the precolonial era till the new sociopolitical dispensation. Using the pervasive African humanism concept of being, referred to as ubuntu, and a translanguaging framework (García, O., Bilingual Education in the 21st century: A global perspective. Miden: Wiley/Blackwell, 2009; García, O., & Li Wei, Translanguaging: Language, bilingualism and education. New York: Palgrave Macmillan, 2014), which recognizes alternation of languages as a norm in contemporary societies, the chapter couches the view that a reorientation of multilingual and bilingual education toward the African value system of ubuntu will be a catalyst for restoring social justice for the people whose languages were historically denigrated to the lowest social status. In the end, it offers insights on rethinking the South African multilingual space to accommodate fluid discursive resources where interdependence is highly valued over independence of language systems.",,,Encyclopedia of Language and Education,Bilingual and Multilingual Education,"Ofelia García, Angel M.

With the aim of evaluating evolutionary consequences of polyploidy, we analyzed the morphological variability of 103 adults of L. chiliensis from separated geographic areas using both traditional and geometric morphometry in order to visualize shape and size differences in individuals with different ploidy. The results indicated that Liolaemus chiliensis is morphologically variable; a significant effect was observed for the interaction term of the three factors tested: sex, ploidy and locality. From the analysis, females exhibited higher values of axilla groin distance than males. There were also morphological differences in mosaic and triploid organisms with respect to the sympatric and allopatric diploids in the dorsal shape of the head, and the presence of intermediate phenotypes of triploids and mosaic lizards with sympatric males and females associated with the axilla groin distance. Results showed that there are morphological differences between polyploid and diploid organisms with both traditional and geometric approaches, suggesting evolutionary trend to differentiation; future research is needed to assess the underlying ecological and genetic mechanisms related to this phenomenon.","We thank S.

However, the geomorphological stage during which the main mineralisation occurs is still under debate. Here, we present 24 new thermochronological data from Cenozoic intrusives and compare them with the evolution of supergene mineralisation from the Centinela Mining District in the Atacama Desert. Our results indicate a two‐step cooling path: a rapid Late Eocene exhumation followed by a slow denudation. Previously published supergene mineralisation ages cluster after the main Upper Oligocene exhumation period. Ours is the first study that establishes the relationship between exhumation and supergene processes on the scale of a single mining district.

All of the sites are located in the Puna de Atacama (Northern Chile) along the 14 km Tulan transect, between the head of Tulan ravine (ca. 3000 m.a.s.l.) and the border of the Salar de Atacama (2317 m.a.s.l.). Our aim is to understand how the space was used by hunter‐gatherers and early herders from the beginning of camelid domestication to the consolidation of herding practices. Isotopic analyses were complemented with osteometric data in order to correlate changes in animal size and isotopic values with the initiation of animal husbandry. Isotopic and osteometric results show less variability of δ 13 C and δ 15 N values during the Late Archaic and Tarajne Phase, whereas variability is higher during the Early Formative. We postulate that during the latter period, there was more widespread use of hunting and herding spaces along the Tulan ravine, including areas above 3000 m.a.s.l. as result of more consolidated herding practices, while the highlands were used as a complementary space to hold livestock near ritual sites and residential settlements.

Twenty-two first-year students participated in focus group discussions (FGDs) and semi-structured individual interviews. Thematic and interpretative analyses suggested shifts in the students’ levels of well-being: high before, low during, and increased after the induction programme. Low levels of well-being were linked to experiences of fear, feeling disrespected, and disillusionment with university life, leaders, and a perceived loss of autonomy, independency and social-relatedness. An increase in well-being was associated with social integration, support, the ability for self-reflection and perspective taking. Wellbeing is a relational and collective matter which is embedded in broader contexts. Therefore, historical legacies of oppression and inequality should be challenged through constructive debate, involving previously neglected voices intentionally; and creating opportunities for the expression of students’ needs and growth potential",,,Africa Education Review,,,,2017-07-07,2017,2017-07-07,2017-10-02,14,3-4,20-35,Closed,Article,"Chigeza, Shingairai; de Kock, Johannes H.; Roos, Vera; Wissing, Marie P.","Chigeza, Shingairai (Africa Unit for Transdisciplinary Health Research, North-West University, South Africa); de Kock, Johannes H.

In the present study, two AOPs (ultrasound+O3 and solar/O3; with and without H2O2) were compared in terms of landfill leachate depuration, specific energy consumption, and associated reagent and operational costs. Solar/O3/H2O2 attained 59.7% color elimination and 34.4% chemical oxygen demand (COD) abatement, while ultrasound+O3/H2O2 achieved 41.5% color elimination and 33.8% COD abatement. A novel adsorption pretreatment based on activated carbon (1g/L) obtained from coffee waste was also investigated, resulting in 68.5% COD abatment and 56.8% color elimination. When adsorption pretreatment was followed by the solar/O3 AOP, maximum color (58.3%) and COD (70.8%) removals were obtained. The least energy-demanding treatment was solar/O3/H2O2, which required 0.011Wh/mg of COD removed. Higher operating costs were associated with adsorption pretreatment, followed by ultrasound and H2O2 use. Finally, using solar energy resulted in substantial reduced energy costs. In conclusion, the results of this study support the industrial-scale application of ozonation combined with H2O2 and solar energy as a technically and economically feasible method for treating and reusing landfill leachate.","AcknowledgementsThe authors acknowledge the financial support of the Chilean Education Ministry (MICINN), under the project FONDECYT (No. 11140219) and the Central Laboratory for Marine Aquaculture of the Marine Sciences Department at the Universidad Católica del Norte for equipment support.

Participants were 260 individuals who were divorced or separated. The FDAS–SF included 22 of the original 100 items, and its factorial structure was evaluated using exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis. Instead of the 6 original subscales proposed by its author, the structure that showed the best fit to the data was composed of 5 subscales: self-worth, disentanglement from the ex-partner, anger, grief, and social trust. The social self-worth subscale was excluded. Reliability analyses revealed good internal consistency of the subscales and adequate convergent validity with depression, anxiety, stress, and life satisfaction. Given the psychometric properties of this short version, it can be concluded that the FDAS–SF can be used in the Chilean context to evaluate the adjustment to divorce and separation.",,This research was funded by a research grant from the National Fund for Scientific and Technological Development of the Government of Chile (FONDECYT 1150044) to Monica Guzmán-González.

Deviants from this empirical relation are to a large extent identified as formerly known or new blue straggler stars. We report in particular the striking case of the Population II star HD 159062, whose barium overabundance is difficult to explain without wind accretion of s-process material from a former asymptotic giant branch (AGB) primary that very likely survived as a white dwarf companion. The weak but significant barium enhancement that we measure for HR 3578 and 104 Tau also suggests that both may be accompanied by faint degenerate companions. If confirmed through precision astrometry or direct imaging observations, this would mean a very efficient method to uncover ancient stellar remnant companions around solar-type stars.","Based on observations collected at the Centro Astronómico Hispano Alemán (CAHA) at Calar Alto, operated jointly by the Max-Planck Institut für Astronomie and the Instituto de Astrofísica de Andalucía (CSIC).

A maximum slip amounted to 10.4 m in the shallow part of the seismic source region centered 72 km northwest of the epicenter and generated a following tsunami inundated along the coast. In a gross sense, the rupture front propagated almost unilaterally to northward from the hypocenter at <2 km/s, however, in detail the spatiotemporal slip distribution also showed a complex rupture propagation pattern: two up-dip rupture propagation episodes, and a secondary rupture episode may have been triggered by the strong high-frequency radiation event at the down-dip edge of the seismic source region. High-frequency sources tends to be distributed at deeper parts of the slip area, a pattern also documented in other subduction zone megathrust earthquakes that may reflect the heterogeneous distribution of fracture energy or stress drop along the fault. The weak excitation of high-frequency radiation at the termination of rupture may represent the gradual deceleration of rupture velocity at the transition zone of frictional property or stress state between the megathrust rupture zone and the swarm area.","Teleseismic waveforms and the strong motion data from the networks; Antarctic Seismographic Argentinean Italian Network (AI), Canadian National Seismograph Network (CN), GEOSCOPE (G), Global Telemetered Seismograph Network (USAF/ USGS, GT), Global Seismograph Network (GSN - IRIS/IDA, II), Global Seismograph Network (GSN - IRIS/USGS, IU), and Red Sismologica Nacional (C1) are downloaded through the IRIS-DMC.

The number of these articles that were published through collaboration accounts for 69%. In general, the scaling exponent of multi-authored articles, both international and domestic, increases over time while the exponent of single-authored papers decreases. The citation impact and collaboration patterns exhibit a power law correlation with a scaling exponent of 1.34 ± 0.02. Citations to multi-authored articles increased 21.34$$2^{1.34}$$ or 2.53 times each time the number of multi-authored papers doubled. The Matthew Effect is stronger for multi-authored papers than for single-authored. The scaling exponent for the power law relationship of domestic multi-authored papers was 1.35 ± 0.02.

In particular, iron–nickel–copper–cobalt sulphides undergo continual oxidation within a roasting or smelting operation, followed by batch oxidation within the converting operation, thus producing iron-free Bessemer matte (or blister copper, in the case of copper smelters); this semi-finished product undergoes further processing to produce nickel, copper and cobalt products, and to recover precious metals. The juncture between continuous smelting and batch converting is often an appropriate focus for the earliest phases of DES development, since it is typically a major bottleneck within nickel and copper smelters; later phases may include increasing levels of detail for auxiliary unit operations, as well as plant logistics. Moreover, DES can support matte-slag chemistry, including Gibbs free energy balances to determine the iron speciation within the slag. DES is therefore capable of linking the fundamentals of oxidation reactions to the intricacies of plant dynamics.",,"Funding for the current work has been provided by the Chilean government, through its FONDECYT – Iniciación program for young researchers (Project No. 11140078).",Canadian Metallurgical Quarterly,,,,2017-10-09,2017,2017-10-09,2018-01-02,57,1,70-79,Closed,Article,"Navarra, A.; Valenzuela, F.; Cruz, R.; Arrancibia, C.; Yañez, R.; Acuña, C.","Navarra, A.

The kelp Durvillaea antarctica (Phaeophyceae) is abundant in the intertidal in this region. Two morphotypes, one with elongated-cylindrical (“morphotype EC”) and one with laminar (“morphotype L”) blades, have been collected from a wave-protected site at the Strait of Magellan and the wave-exposed shores of the isolated Otway Sound. Morphometric and physiological (by chlorophyll fluorescence) analyses showed significant differences between the two morphotypes regarding the morphology, the maximum electron transport rates (ETRmax), and the chlorophyll c concentration. These morphological and physiological differences can be linked to their hydrodynamic environment. The presence of two different species in the region of Magallanes based on the measured parameters is discussed. This study may be useful for future genetic and biotechnological investigations and draws attention to D. antarctica as a species of commercial value among the marine resources of Chile.","The authors of the present study are grateful to the financial support by the FONDECYT grants 1131023-FT (“Long-distance dispersal of macroalgae at high latitudes-floating kelp rafts capacity of nature under conditions along a latitudinal”) and 1140940-AM (“Macroalgal adaptive radiation: potential links to the diversity of ecological niches in the ecoregion Magellan and Antarctic”) of Chile’s National Council for Research in Science and Technology (CONICYT).

This chapter aims to compare levels of social well-being between female and male host national and immigrant emerging adults in Spain. We also analysed the role of perceived collective efficacy and social networks for immigrants’ perceptions of discrimination and social well-being. A sample of 232 young immigrants from Latin America, Africa, and Romania living in Spain, as well as their 49 host national counterparts, filled in a questionnaire measuring perceived personal and group discrimination, ethnic and host support networks, collective efficacy, and social well-being. We found that young Romanian females reported higher social contribution compared to young host national females. Also, young Romanian females reported higher social acceptance compared to their African counterparts. Among males, host support networks, low perceived group discrimination, and collective efficacy were positively associated with immigrants’ social well-being. In contrast, among females, co-ethnic support networks, low perceived group but also personal discrimination was linked to social well-being. Perceived collective efficacy and host (but not co-ethnic) support networks were negatively related with perceived discrimination and thus positively associated with young immigrants’ social well-being. Together, this chapter expands research on social well-being across ethnic minorities.","This research was supported by the following Research Grants: MICINN (PSI2008-02689/PSIC/PSI2014-51923-P), GIC07/113-IT-255-07, as well as by a Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation Predoctoral Fellowship Program Grant awarded to Magdalena Bobowik: AP2008-01980.",,Cross-Cultural Advancements in Positive Psychology,Well-Being of Youth and Emerging Adults across Cultures,Radosveta Dimitrova,,2017,2017,2018-01-03,2017,12,,157-171,Closed,Chapter,"Bobowik, Magdalena; Basabe, Nekane; Wlodarczyk, Anna","Bobowik, Magdalena (Department of Social Psychology and Methodology of Behaviour Sciences, Psychology Faculty, University of the Basque Country, Avenida Tolosa 70, 20018, San Sebastián, Spain); Basabe, Nekane (Department of Social Psychology and Methodology of Behaviour Sciences, Psychology Faculty, University of the Basque Country, Avenida Tolosa 70, 20018, San Sebastián, Spain); Wlodarczyk, Anna (Escuela de Psicología, Universidad Católica del Norte, Chile Avda.

In the wake of the subalternist turn ""decolonial option"", has installed itself as the ubiquitous mode of postcolonial Latin Americanist thought in recent decades. Setting aside the inconsistencies and limitations inherent to the development of decolonial metaphysics allows the authors to approach the remaining two variants that have also developed as a result of the subalternist turn in postcolonial thinking on and in Latin America since the 1990s.

Preliminary models have been proposed for relating the microbial succession in bioleaching heaps with the activity of different CO2 fixation pathways. The increase of internal heap temperature during bioleaching improves the rate of chalcopyrite dissolution. However, it also negatively affects CO2 and O2 availability, consequently the microbial community changes and only the best adapted microorganisms are capable of growing under the limiting conditions. In this work we attempt to elucidate how microbiological succession proceeds in a semi-industrial bioleaching column test system, with emphasis in determining the identity of the microorganisms participating and the metabolic dynamics of carbon fixation pathways. In silico reconstruction of the carbon fixation metabolisms based on available genomes and the gene expression studies using microarray and RNA-seq were performed. The physicochemical conditions and the metallurgical parameters were also included in the analysis. Although the investigation is based on a non-homogeneous system - which leads to some seemingly contradictory data - the results showed a clear change in the structure of the microbial community as well as in the expression of pathways for CO2 fixation, as the column test progressed. These changes were directly related to two factors, the temperature inside column and the CO2 availability. The gene expression analyses confirmed the temporal distribution of microorganisms as a function of the temperature and the different pathways for CO2 fixation. The evidences obtained here support the fact that low CO2 availability becomes an important asset to the microbial population survival and growth promotion in the bioleaching environments. The determination of the expression level of the key genes is a good opportunity to improve a sound understanding of the high temperature bio-assisted heap leaching of chalcopyrite and to optimize the technology.","This work was performed under the auspices of the project FONDEF-IT13I20042C from CONICYT, Chile.

These failures were either due to inadequate awareness of the fishing communities on the proposed protocols, and/or little attention paid by the government during the colonial period on the importance of lake fisheries. After independence of the riparian states, each country developed her own approach, but based on the findings of research and recommendations from Lake Victoria Fisheries Organization (LVFO). Lately, through the LVFO and especially under the Lake Victroria Environmental Management Project (LVEMP), more concrete and harmonised fisheries management programmes have been developed. In Tanzania, the evolution of the management of fisheries can be divided into four major historical periods: The pre-colonial period, the colonial period, the state-owned economy period (1961–1985) and the liberalised economy period (after 1986). This chapter summarises all the events that took place during these four major periods. It also discusses the results and proposes the way forward. In particular, the chapter emphasises the threats to the lake fisheries resources and other aquatic living organisms arising from effluent discharges from towns and the agricultural areas surrounding the lake.

This document describes two innovative strategies applied to teach software engineering (SE) at two universities in Chile. Teaching experiences are part of our ongoing effort to improve the current teaching-learning strategies of SE in the mentioned universities. In this paper, we describe our teaching experiences using both problem-based learning (PBL) and an agile software engineering methodology, to achieve learning outcomes and to improve students’ participation during classes. We present two ways to correlate the activities of a software project; these activities are tasks of a software methodology and an active learning strategy based on PBL. The strategies used to verify the accomplishment of these goals are also detailed.","The authors thank the collaboration of SMEs of the region of Maule, Chile, for their disposition to support the development of software projects and the professional development of UCM students during these years.

Evidence from a hedonic valuation approach,"Since Roback’s seminal work (J Polit Econ 90(6):1257–1278, 1982), the literature on hedonic prices has evaluated the role of amenities in equilibrating regional differentials in nominal wages and prices. While these studies generally find evidence for traditional amenities and disamenities in developed countries, there remains little research on how characteristics such as violence affect the equilibrium in less developed countries. This article explores violence and other local characteristics as an amenity or disamenity for Mexico and employs the hedonic wage and rent theory proposed by Roback. This research uses a multilevel estimation technique using data from the Mexican Household Income and Expenditure Survey, along with other information from the municipal and state levels. This article finds evidence to suggest that illegal earning opportunities outweigh crime disamenity by inhabitants of some traditional drug-trafficking regions, because such crime appears to be the modus vivendi in those regions in a way that does not reduce economic performance.","The research was supported by the project “Estudio de la Competitividad: Regiones, Economía y Sociedad” funded by the Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología (CONACYT)—Instituto Nacional de Estadística y Geografía (INEGI) sectorial fund 2012–2014.

The research performed in the region of Antofagasta, Chile, is based on an interpretive paradigm, with discursive analysis. Twenty-eight people were interviewed based on the category of conflicts and tensions in money negotiations. Findings include that among older women and men, money appears to be masculinized and associated with an illusion of empowerment of women, exacerbating the androcentric sex/gender model. In their discourses, some women express their progress toward relationships of greater equity. Couples must deal with gender conflicts when negotiating money. Even though women manage the family’s money, it’s not considered their money; therefore, they don’t feel free to use it and must account to the man. In this power game and in negotiating, the model of romantic love prevails, the couple’s public and private position, and a neoliberal culture that promotes high levels of consumption.",,,Affilia,,,,2017-01-23,2017,2017-01-23,2017-08,32,3,344-358,Closed,Article,"Silva-Segovia, Jimena; Lay-Lisboa, Siu","Silva-Segovia, Jimena (Universidad Católica del Norte, Antofogasta, Chile); Lay-Lisboa, Siu (Universidad Católica del Norte, Antofogasta, Chile)","Silva-Segovia, Jimena (Catholic University of the North)","Silva-Segovia, Jimena (Catholic University of the North); Lay-Lisboa, Siu (Catholic University of the North)",3,0,,1.2,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1074189998,44 Human Society; 4405 Gender Studies; 4410 Sociology,5 Gender Equality

245,pub.1035044626,10.1016/j.comptc.2016.11.008,,,Evolution of the structural and electronic properties of small alkali metal-doped aluminum clusters,"The atomic arrangement of Aln and AlnM clusters (n=2–14, M=Li, Na o K) was determined by combining both the basin hopping (BH) algorithm using the Gupta potential, and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The BH yielded hundreds of structures that were refined by DFT using the PBE framework, and Ahlrichs-VDZ basis sets. Anions, neutrals and cations of Aln and AlnM clusters were calculated by DFT resulting in a set of ground state structures. These structures were considered for studying different stability criteria such as binding energy, dissociation energy, second-order difference of energies, and HOMO-LUMO gaps. Furthermore, the calculated ionization potential, and electron affinity of the clusters yielded values comparable to the experimental ones. A further bonding analysis of the clusters was carried out by the quantum theory of atoms in molecules (AIM) and by using the electronic localization function (ELF). Based on the stability criteria, we determinate the following clusters as relative stable against neighbors: Al7+, Al13−, Al2M−, Al4M−, Al6M−, and Al13M. Except by the Al4M− clusters, all clusters are closed shell structures and they follow the jellium model predictions. The high relative stability of the Al4M− clusters was attributable to their aromaticity. Moreover, AIM and ELF results revealed that when the size of the clusters increases then the transition from covalent to metallic AlAl bonding emerges. Otherwise, in the case of AlnM clusters, it was found that the nature of AlM bonds is modified with the size, from metallic for Al2M− to ionic when their size increases.",AcknowledgementsKOAM thanks the Conacyt sponsorship.

However, per capita ecosystem engineering rates displayed by burrowers are variable, and thereby contribute to enhancing local biotic and abiotic variability. Lacking in current understanding of processes influencing variability in ecosystem engineering rates by burrowers and consequent feedbacks to assemblages are interactions occurring between burrowers and their burrow-symbionts. In this paper, we quantify behavioural responses of burrowing sandprawns (Callichirus kraussi: Crustacea: Axiidea) to burrow symbionts (Betaeus jucundus: Crustacea: Alpheidae) using controlled laboratory experiments. We demonstrate that sandprawns display discrete behaviours in response to B. jucundus with distinct levels of tolerance. Such variability in tolerances of sandprawns to B. jucundus is consistent with the idea that the outcomes of symbiotic relationships are variable, depending on processes that shift the costs and benefits involved for partners. Importantly, these discrete tolerances were associated with significant changes to time spent by sandprawns on ecosystem engineering activities (sediment turnover, burrow irrigation) with intolerant sandprawns increasing sediment turnover rate by 50% and decreasing irrigation by 30%. In a second experiment seeking to determine if variability in sandprawn responses to B. jucundus could be due to differences in sandprawn sexes, we demonstrate that male and female sandprawns respond differently to the presence of B. jucundus, with differences in time spent on ecosystem engineering in the presence of B. jucundus. Taken collectively, our results highlight the complex behaviours occurring within burrows in marine sediments and their potential to influence ecosystem activities of burrowers.","AcknowledgementsWelly Qwabe is thanked for assistance in the field.

An analysis for US states and counties using a multilevel approach,"The extensive literature on economic convergence has explored a wide variety of ways of measuring convergence in addition to finely tuning and improving the applicable econometric techniques. However, very few contributions analyze the relevance of the spatial level of analysis. Our hypothesis is that studying the convergence at the level of large regions (states) could conceal intraregional heterogeneity. This hypothesis is consistent with the New Economic Geography framework, which highlighted core-periphery patterns at the local level. However, this polarization mechanism may become difficult to identify with aggregated data or neoclassical dynamics operating at the same time. This paper proposes a multilevel approach to study this question. It allows the identification of possible heterogeneous local patterns of behavior within regions. It is applied to the US economy in a hierarchy of two levels: states and counties. The results show high intraclass correlation, indicating significant variance within states. An overall pattern of convergence is observed in line with previous results, although some states present internal patterns of divergence or significant changes in the rate of convergence.","Funding was provided by H2020 European Research Council (Grant No. UE-16-726950-IMAJINE); Secretaría de Estado de Investigación, Desarrollo e Innovación (Grant No. MINECO-13-ECO2013-48161-R); Dirección General de Investigación Científica y Técnica (Grant No. FPU Program).",,The Annals of Regional Science,,,,2017-02-13,2017,2017-02-13,2017-05,58,3,623-640,Closed,Article,"Díaz Dapena, Alberto; Rubiera Morollón, Fernando; Paredes Araya, Dusan","Díaz Dapena, Alberto (Regional Economics Laboratory - REGIOlab, University of Oviedo, Oviedo, Spain); Rubiera Morollón, Fernando (Regional Economics Laboratory - REGIOlab, University of Oviedo, Oviedo, Spain); Paredes Araya, Dusan (Universidad Católica del Norte, Antofagasta, Chile)","Rubiera Morollón, Fernando (University of Oviedo)","Díaz Dapena, Alberto (University of Oviedo); Rubiera Morollón, Fernando (University of Oviedo); Paredes Araya, Dusan (Catholic University of the North)",3,0,,1.17,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1083805567,38 Economics; 3801 Applied Economics,

Genetic/phenotypic changes of invasive plants along elevation help to understand mechanisms of the presumed resistance of mountain ecosystems to invasion. Aims: To assess genetic variability and phenotypic plasticity along an elevation gradient of Eschscholzia californica in the Andes, central Chile. Methods: Eleven microsatellites were used to describe the genetic structure and the allelic diversity individuals, distributed at three elevations and two sites. We assessed the number of flowers per plant, floral biomass, leaf area, number of leaves, vegetative biomass and plant height of plants at each elevation. Results: Genetic diversity as genetic structure did not decrease with elevations. Plant height and flower numbers decreased while leaf number and vegetative biomass increased with elevation. The ratio of the number of flowers to vegetative biomass, decreased significantly with elevation. Conclusions: Strong genetic differences among elevations and similar genetic diversity along elevation do not suggest dispersal limitation to higher elevation. Reduction of reproductive and vegetative traits concomitantly with an increase of the reproductive cost suggests reproductive stress with increasing elevation, reducing the invasiveness of this species to higher elevation.","We thank R Gauci and L Carrasco for helping with the genetic analysis, R Zuñiga for the field work and E.

Three tsunami survey teams covered approximately 700 km of the Pacific coast. The teams surveyed the area, recording 83 tsunami flow depth and runup measurements. The maximum runup was found to be 10.8 m at only one small bay, in front of the inferred tsunami source area. However, it was observed that runup in other locations rarely exceed 6 m. Tsunami runup was larger than those of the 2014 Pisagua event, despite the similar earthquake magnitude. Moreover, tsunami arrival times were found to be shorter than those of previous tsunamis along the Chilean subduction zone. Numerical simulations of the tsunami event showed a good agreement with field data, highlighting that tsunami arrival time and the spatial variation of the tsunami amplitudes were strongly influenced by the bathymetry, coastal morphology and the slip distribution of the causative earthquake.","The authors would like to thank CONICYT (Chile) for its FONDAP 15110017, and FONDECYT 11140424 grants as well as FB0821 grant.

Most ‘homelands’ never achieved full spatial consolidation and their constituent parts were interspersed with white-owned farming areas and small towns. Some ‘homelands’ incorporated peri-urban zones of cities whose centres remained in South Africa proper. The term bantustans, with its dismissive reference to apparently inconsequential central Asian republics, gained purchase – though ironically a number of these regions later won independence with the breakup of the Soviet Union. The ‘homelands’ were characterised as amongst the most oppressed zones, housing the most impoverished people: Transkei In Dependence, as one student pamphlet punned.

Bioconcentration Factor (BCF) and Translocation Factor (TF) were estimated to evaluate the plant species potential for phytoremediation. The results show that A. nummularia presents high TF values on untreated tailings for Pb and Zn; on tailings treated with CaCO3/compost for Mn, Fe, Pb and Zn, and on tailings treated with CaCO3/compost/mycorrhizae only for Zn. P. tamarugo presents high TF values on the untreated tailings for Pb and Zn; and on tailings treated with CaCO3/compost for Mn. S. molle presents high TF values on untreated tailings for Cu, Mn, Pb and Zn; on the tailing treated with CaCO3/compost for Mn and Zn, and on the tailing treated with CaCO3/compost/mycorrhizae for Mn and Pb. High TF values show that the plants studied under the specific characteristics of the treated or untreated tailings, present the potential of being used for phytoextraction. Regarding the BCF, the experiments showed values lower than 1 for all the metals, except for Cd, which for A. nummularia developed in the amended tailing, presented potential characteristics of a hyperaccumulator. This metal even had in general BCF values higher than 1 and TF lower than 1, which shows the potential of the three evaluated species as phytostabilizers for Cd. Regarding the effect of the amendments, the untreated tailing presented lower removal efficiency than the tailings treated with CaCO3/compost (T1) and CaCO3/compost/mycorrhizae (T2). On the other hand, no significant difference was found between treatments T1 and T2.","AcknowledgmentsThis study was conducted in the framework of a CORFO-INNOVA project (08CM01-05), titled “Integrated development of magneto-chemical technologies and phytotechnologies applied to the remediation of heavy metals in the development of mining environmental liabilities”.",,Journal of Geochemical Exploration,,,,2017-11,2017,,2017-11,182,,210-217,Closed,Article,"Lam, Elizabeth J.; Cánovas, Manuel; Gálvez, María E.; Montofré, Ítalo L.; Keith, Brian F.; Faz, Ángel","Lam, Elizabeth J.

The sedimentary infilling is accurately described in the main landforms such as alluvial fans, alluvial terraces and landslides in the current valley floor where twenty-six 14C AMS samples were picked up. The 14C age data indicate that the aggradation in the uppermost part of the valley immediately postdates the glacial retreat at ∼15,000 14C years cal. B.P. and spans the whole Holocene starting at 11 ka. B.P. and finishing about 2 ka B.P. The main sources for lateral inputs are debris flows from tributary catchments in the portion where the river is embedded in between 1000 and 2000 m a.s.l as well as catastrophic landslides. Additionally, an extensive detailed geomorphological mapping is provided to discuss the meaning of the ages together with an assessment of where the samples came from. Finally, the dataset and field criteria provided in this work contribute to better perform paleoclimatological interpretations for the semiarid fluvial systems of northern Chile. These interpretations usually consider the increased influence of the westerlies during the Holocene and the span of time that the paraglacial response delivers glacigenic sediments into the system.","AcknowledgementsThis research was funded by the INNOVA-CORFO project: Evaluación Hidrogeológica de la Cuenca del Río Huasco, con Énfasis en la Cuantificación y Dinámica de los Recursos Hídricos Superficiales y Subterráneos, and by the ANILLO project ACT 1203 of the CONICYT of the government of Chile.

This mechanism included a circular failure in completely decomposed granodiorite at the bottom of an unstable area pushing on a block of granodiorite. This first block induced subsidence and failure of a wedge of highly decomposed granodiorite, which pushed a slender block below it, causing it to topple. This toppling block eventually pushed a lower block that slid out of the slope. In this rather complex mechanism, completely weathered rock interacted with rock blocks and ultimately produced a small landslide of around 1500 m3 of material. Our study highlights the need to consider the possibility of a complex failure mechanism when analysing rock slope instability. It also highlights the role of toppling in some part of a rock mass prone to instability. When a slender block located in the middle of an initially stable slope experiences a small amount of force, for instance, due to water pressure, that causes it to topple, all the weight is transmitted to the block immediately below the slender block, inducing a greater force that can render the entire area unstable.","The authors thank the Spanish Ministry of the Economy, Industry and Competitiveness for partial funding of this study, awarded under Contract Reference No. BIA2014-53368-P, partially financed by means of ERDF funds.

Nonetheless, alternative modes often require additional equipment and processing capacity, hence an associated capital expenditure. Moreover, the concentrator designs are often based on preliminary geological data, and are therefore subject to uncertainty. The current paper describes how stochastic mine planning algorithms may be extended to quantify the net present value (NPV) of alternative operational modes in mineral processing plants, under geological uncertainty. In particular, the Variable Neighbourhood Descent method of Lamghari et al. (2014) was originally developed for open-pit mine planning, and has now been adapted to evaluate concentrator operational modes. Sample computations are presented.","AcknowledgementsFunding for the current work is provided by the Chilean Government, through its FONDECYT—Iniciación program for young researchers (Project No. 11140078).

Satellite images and national agriculture censuses were used for a quantitative analysis of land use changes from 1974 to 2005, and a nutrient export coefficient approximation was used to determine long-term changes in annual loads. Several eutrophication indicators (water, sediment and autotrophic communities) were assessed seasonally in the lagoon basins during 2005 and 2006. The areal annual load of nutrients exported to the lagoons increased over time. Population and extensive livestock ranching were the most important nutrient sources, while agriculture is increasing in importance. Buffer effects of riparian forests on eutrophication indicators were observed in contrast to the wetlands surrounding the lagoons, which seem to be acting as a source of nutrients. Catchment size was inversely related to most eutrophication indicators. Afforestation and agriculture were found not to directly impact eutrophication indicators, however, catchments with larger agricultural areas showed higher concentrations of suspended solids, which may indicate the export of particulate nutrients. Salinity was inversely related to most eutrophication indicators, suggesting that the manipulation of the sand bar of the lagoons is a critical management issue. Sediment-related eutrophication indicators were more sensitive to changes in land uses and covers, in contrast with the more variable water column indicators, suggesting their potential use as enduring indicators. This research provides a rapid and integral assessment for qualitatively linking catchment changes with eutrophication indicators in coastal environments, which can easily be replicated to track pollutants in locations that lack standardized monitoring programs needed for more complex catchment modeling approaches.","Dr. Carlos Perdomo provided nutrient export coefficients applicable to our region and land uses in the study area.

These smelters apply a common set of chemical reactions: copper-iron sulfides are blasted with oxygen-enriched air, sending the iron into a slag phase and the sulfur into the offgas. Moreover, conventional copper smelters exhibit similar operational dynamics: a smelting furnace operates continually, feeding into an alternating set of converters that produce batches of blister copper. The thermochemical and operational commonalities of copper smelters are integrated within the DES framework. This serves as a common basis to begin evaluating the system dynamics of individual smelters. For complex problems, the simulation framework should be developed in phases, incorporating feedback from different personnel who have complementary perspectives.

In order to advance our understanding of multiple stressor effects, we evaluated the potential costs in the population growth rate derived from the sub-lethal effect of exposure to the pesticide methamidophos and from the expression of morphological defenses front to predation risk, in the rotifer Brachionus calyciflorus. Costs were evaluated both in the organisms that were exposed to the stressors and in their offspring. Our hypotheses were (1) plastic morphological defenses under exposure to pesticides have fitness costs, which may be transmitted from the parental to the filial generation, and (2) interactive effects between pesticides and predation are dependent of the mother’s age. Our results indicate that pesticide exposure increased the costs, expressed as reduction in population growth rate, generated by the induction of defenses. Interestingly, these costs were detected only in the offspring of the treated organisms and were depended on the age of the mother. This indicates that the sub-lethal effects of predation were increased by pesticide pollution. This study provides experimental evidence of the transgenerational costs of phenotypic plasticity linked to interaction of natural and anthropic stressors.","I.H.-F. acknowledges a Doctoral scholarship from Comisión Nacional de Investigación Científica y Tecnológica (CONICYT-PCHA/Doctorado Nacional/2015-211521).

It was also found that the results tend to be more scattered for smaller sample diameters. We also found an apparent correlation between Young’s modulus and sample diameter. It was not possible to draw any clear conclusions regarding the variability in Poisson’s ratio with sample size. With respect to crack initiation and crack damage stresses, the behaviour of the tested samples also indicates a reverse effect.

Currently, the Chilean production of macroalgae is based mainly on the exploitation of natural populations. This study analyzed the potential for a private investor to undertake the culture of macroalgae as a means of addressing this depletion. The analysis indicated two species of macroalgae showed the greatest potential for farming in northern Chile, viz., Chondracanthus chamissoi and Lessonia trabeculata. The business model considers the acquisition of ropes (branch lines) with attached seedlings, the cultivation of the macroalgae in the ocean, and the subsequent sale of the wet biomass harvested at market prices. The culture technology evaluated was the long-line system under a program of multiple overlapping cohorts. For the baseline model, C. chamissoi had a negative net present value (NPV), and for a private investor, the cultivation of this species would not be profitable. Conversely, the NPV for L. trabeculata was positive, and increasingly so after 5.5 years of cultivation, as the income begins to cover the expenses. Sensitivity analysis showed that very significant productivity improvements would be needed for C. chamissoi cultivation to become a new source of income in northern Chile.","We would like to thank Maria Cristina Marin-Riffo (Universidad Católica del Norte, Chile) and Ximena Fuentes (Aquaservicios, Chile) for their valuable contributions to this research.",,Journal of Applied Phycology,,,,2017-10-14,2017,2017-10-14,2018-04,30,2,1135-1147,Closed,Article,"Zuniga-Jara, Sergio; Soria-Barreto, Karla","Zuniga-Jara, Sergio (Escuela de Ciencias Empresariales, Universidad Católica del Norte, Larrondo, 1281, Coquimbo, Chile); Soria-Barreto, Karla (Escuela de Ciencias Empresariales, Universidad Católica del Norte, Larrondo, 1281, Coquimbo, Chile)","Zuniga-Jara, Sergio (Catholic University of the North)","Zuniga-Jara, Sergio (Catholic University of the North); Soria-Barreto, Karla (Catholic University of the North)",11,4,,1.41,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1092228907,31 Biological Sciences; 3108 Plant Biology,

Enhancing building performance simulation by including the urban heat island effect,"Cities are dissipative structures. As such, cities generate heat, a phenomenon known as urban heat island (UHI). Even though the UHI is one of the most relevant effects of urbanization on urban climate, up-to-date methodologies to include it in the estimation of buildings’ energy consumption are still scarce. During the last 30 years, different methods and software have been developed to measure a thermal building's demand. Building performance simulation is commonly used to calculate heating and cooling demand. However, such techniques do not adequately include the urban heat island effect, which could have an extreme impact on a building's energy consumption. In fact, building operation is doubly connected with the urban environment: on the one hand, buildings generate heat that warms up the environment, and on the other hand, the urban environment alters building performance by the influence of UHI. In this paper, a methodology to incorporate the UHI effect in building performance simulation is proposed. Urban weather data were downscaled at the urban morphology building level to estimate the cooling demand of different types of residential buildings. The global energy penalty for the whole residential building stock was estimated in four South American Pacific coastal cities. The results indicate that when UHI is incorporated, an increase in energy demand between 15% and 200% can be expected. These results challenge the validity of current assessments performed in absence of the UHI effect. At the same time, these results open up the discussion for the inclusion of urban planning measures aiming at reducing the UHI effect on a building's energy demand.","AcknowledgementsThis work was done thanks to the financial support of the projects “FONDECYT 11140578” awarded by CONICYT (Chile), “Prometeo 006-2015” awarded by SENESCYT (Ecuador), “DIUV 53/2013” and “DIUV 52/2013” awarded by the University of Valparaíso (Chile).

Dwindling resources, external demands for accountability, and increased competition for market share, have resulted in efficiency measures and increased demand for performativity. Executive leadership techniques that crept into universities during the early 1980s, referred to as ‘managerialism’ or ‘executivism’, are now widely practised. The increased focus on managerialism in the last decade has resulted in collegial crises and heightened conflicts between academics and administrators. The emergence of ‘executive deanship’ in South African higher education about a decade ago was in keeping with international trends and local demands for efficiency and performativity. With specific reference to the universities in the Gauteng province, this paper argues that the blanket introduction of executive deanship (referred to as executivism) appears not to have contributed to the envisaged operational efficiency, performance, and effectiveness, as initially claimed. Rather than fostering an enabling and empowering environment, it has added new layers of complexity to deanship pointing to a potential crisis in the advancement of the academic project. The position of dean is now more management oriented and allows little or no room for strategic intellectual and academic leadership.",,,Oxford Review of Education,,,,2017-12,2017,2017-12,2018-05-04,44,3,275-290,Closed,Article,"Seale, Oliver; Cross, Michael","Seale, Oliver (University of the Witwatersrand, South Africa); Cross, Michael (University of Johannesburg, South Africa)","Cross, Michael (University of Johannesburg)","Seale, Oliver (University of the Witwatersrand); Cross, Michael (University of Johannesburg)",7,3,,3.59,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1093118757,"39 Education; 3902 Education Policy, Sociology and Philosophy",4 Quality Education

We use empirical data to provide initial insights into the changing racial profiles of academic staff bodies across age, gender and rank and then summarise our findings into a transformation ‘scorecard’ which provides an indication of how all racial groups in the country are performing in terms of their representation in higher education. Initial results indicate that most academics in South Africa are middle-aged (between 35 and 54) but an ageing trend is evident, particularly among white academics. In terms of gender, males marginally outnumber females, although we estimate an equitable distribution to be attained within the next 5 years. Significantly, the data indicate that there is an upwards trajectory of black African academics across all rankings from 2005 to 2015 and a concomitant downward trajectory of white academics across all rankings. Both Indian and coloured academics most closely represent their national population representation. Our transformation ‘scorecard’ indicates that the demography of academic staff at higher education institutions in South Africa is changing and will continue to change in the future, particularly within the next 20 years if current trends continue.",,,Higher Education,,,,2017-10-13,2017,2017-10-13,2018-07,76,1,145-161,Closed,Article,"Breetzke, Gregory D.; Hedding, David W.","Breetzke, Gregory D.

This tectonic province is characterized by a thick-skinned structural style showing evidence of tectonic inversion and basement-involved compressive structures. Field data, U-Pb geochronological and apatite fission track data were used to unravel partially the tectonic history of the area. Previous U-Pb ages of synorogenic deposits exposed on the flanks of basement-core anticlines indicate that Andean deformation started probably during Late Cretaceous with the tectonic inversion of Triassic and Jurassic half-grabens. New U-Pb ages of the synorogenic Quebrada Seca Formation suggest that this deformation continued during Paleocene (66-60 Ma) with the reverse faulting of pre-rift basement blocks. The analysis of new apatite fission-track data shows that a rapid and coeval cooling related to exhumation of the pre-rift basement blocks occurred during Eocene times. This exhumation event is interpreted for first time in the Chilean Frontal Cordillera and it could have occurred simultaneously with the propagation of basement-involved structures. The age of this exhumation event coincides with the Incaic orogenic phase, which is interpreted as the most important to the Central Andes in terms of shortening, uplift and exhumation.","AcknowledgmentsThis work has been supported by the research project “The crustal structure and timing of deformation along the Chilean flat-slab subduction segment (27°–29°S), Central Andes”, funded by the Fondo Nacional de Desarrollo Científico y Tecnológico (Fondecyt), Chile (grant 3140557).

In the US for example, which faced global criticism for its foreign policy during the “war on terror,” militaristic images are commonplace at sporting events. The growing global phenomenon of conflating sport with war calls for closer analysis. This critical, interdisciplinary and international book seeks to identify intersections of sport and militarism as a means to interrogate, interrupt and intervene on behalf of democratic, peaceful politics. Viewing sport as a crucial site in which militarism is made visible and legitimate, the book explores the connections between sport, the military and the state, and their consequent impact on wider culture. Featuring case studies on sports such as association football, baseball and athletics from countries including the US, UK, Germany, Canada, South Africa, Brazil and Japan, each chapter sheds new light on the shifting significance of sport in our society. This book is fascinating reading for all those interested in sport and politics, the sociology of sport, communication studies, the ethics and philosophy of sport, or military sociology.",,,,,Michael L.

The Lagoa Santa Karst generated the largest collection to date of human skeleton remains dating to early Holocene and, as such, called the attention of different researchers interested in the discussions about the origins and dispersion of the first human groups of the New World. In particular, the study of the Lagoa Santa skulls has called the attention of generations of researchers due to its unique morphological characteristics when compared to most of the Native American groups studied so far. In this chapter, we review briefly the most important phases of study of the Lagoa Santa skeletal remains, which begins with the typological descriptions of the material during the nineteenth century and the role it played in discussing the antiquity of humans in the Americas and ends with modern studies that investigate the origin of the biological diversity of early Americans in the context of evolutionary theories. This review illustrates the difficulty of reconstructing the initial millennia of human presence in the Americas and shows how there is still no consensus about the origins of the high morphological diversity that is observed in the continent during the Holocene.",,,,Archaeological and Paleontological Research in Lagoa Santa,"Pedro Da-Gloria, Walter A.

The physico-chemical characterization of the mine tailings under study indicated that the substrate required conditioning to support a phytoremediation system. In this respect, organic and inorganic amendments and mycorrizhal fungi were added to the substrate. Three treatments were designed to assess the effects of the amendments through an analysis of variance.Results and discussionIndicators of plant growth and development were measured weekly, and concentrations of Cd, Cu, Fe, Mn, Pb, Al, and Zn in roots of tailing-grown plants and substrate were measured at the end of the experiment.ConclusionsThe results were used to determine the bioconcentration factor (BCF), which demonstrated that both species act as excluders of Fe, Mn, Pb, Al, and Zn. In addition, it was found that both species present characteristics of potential accumulators of Cu.","This study was conducted in the framework of a CORFO-INNOVA project (08CM01-05), titled “Integrated development of magneto-chemical technologies and phytotechnologies applied to the remediation of heavy metals in the development of mining environmental liabilities.”",,Journal of Soils and Sediments,,,,2017-09-30,2017,2017-09-30,2018-06,18,6,2203-2216,Closed,Article,"Lam, Elizabeth J.; Gálvez, María E.; Cánovas, Manuel; Montofré, Ítalo L.; Keith, Brian F.","Lam, Elizabeth J.

This study examined the effects of season and seaweed origin on the carrageenans produced by the isomorphic phases of the red alga Chondracanthus chamissoi collected during winter and summer from two localities in the SE Pacific Ocean (northern-central Chile). Results were compared with those from other carrageenan-producing seaweeds, and a random forest analysis was carried out with the carrageenan contents reported for Gigartinales in order to determine the principal variables influencing carrageenan yields. The mean carrageenan contents of C. chamissoi ranged from 15.2 to 42.1% DW. Higher yields were observed in gametophytes than in tetrasporophytes, and in samples collected in summer than in winter. Seaweeds from the site close to a local upwelling center had more carrageenans than those from a more distant site. The chemical composition of the carrageenans of C. chamissoi varied only between phases. Carrageenan contents reported for Gigartinales vary from 5.4 to 75.5% DW. The random forest model showed a large accuracy explaining variation in carrageenan yields (pseudo-r2 = 0.63), where genus was ranked as the most important factor, followed by biogeographical origin, solar radiation, nitrate concentrations, and temperature. Considering that the understanding of the genetic basis of carrageenan biosynthesis is limited, our analysis highlights the need for experimental studies examining the effects of taxon and geographical origin in these polysaccharides as a strategy for improving both carrageenan quality and quantity through strain selection.","Financial support for this study was provided by Fondecyt 1131082 to M.T, FIC-R BIP 30137720-0 to N.P.C., and Ph.D Grant CONICYT 21130402 to K.V.

This work describes the experimental behavior of a solar water heating system combined with floating covers and photovoltaic cells. Two similar ponds were used for holding water, one heated and the other unheated. The heated pond featured a coil containing an enclosed circulating fluid heated by solar heat collectors. To minimize water evaporation the exposed surfaces of the two ponds were covered by floating elements with photovoltaic cells on top to supply energy for water pumping and to power auxiliary devices of the system. Predicted daily average water temperature values determined from a heat and mass transfer model using experimental meteorological data over eight months of continuous operation were in very good agreement with measured data.The pond with floating covers water evaporation reduction was greater than 90% with respect to an uncovered pond. Also the photovoltaic cells placed on the floating cover generated up to 68 Wp/m2 equivalent to electric power.

225,pub.1091689764,10.1080/1034912x.2017.1368460,,,Inclusion of Students with Disabilities in South African Higher Education,"Globally, few students with disabilities progress to higher education. This is mostly due to avoidable barriers they face as they navigate different educational structures from lower levels. Even for those few students who make it to higher education, they continue to face challenges. A qualitative study was carried out at the University of the Free State and the University of Venda. Fourteen students with disabilities took part in this research that was aimed at exploring their academic and life experiences. This article interrogates the inclusion of students with disabilities at two South African universities. This article is timely as South Africa has initiated the development of a national policy framework on disability in the post-school education and training systems. It highlights some of the areas where inclusive policies should pay attention in an effort to fully cater for the needs of students with disabilities.",,"Students have varied socio-economic backgrounds. All six participating students (black) at UniVen were being funded by external funds through various government initiatives. This is to be applauded, as funding is one of the main reasons many prospective students do not make it to university (De Beer & Mason, 2009; Letseka, Cosser, Breier, & Visser, 2010). Only two of all the participating students (white & coloured)3 were self-financing their studies. While funding is made available to enable students to study, in some cases students were not pursuing the degree programmes of their choices. For example, Toni was enrolled for an LLB degree but is not studying law:I wanted to study Law but I ended up doing Bachelor of Arts in Human Resources Management. They offered me LLB but I changed because of financial implications. I am funded by the Department of Labour and they (the department officials) told me that they were not funding Law studies. So I switched programmes as a result of the funding. (Toni, partially sighted, UniVen)Bachelor of Arts in Human Resources Management was not Toni’s first choice of programme. While funds have enabled Toni to access university education, his choice of programme of study was limited as a result of the financial conditions. By focusing on what he actually values (the Law degree), we are able to identify an injustice that was done regardless of him getting funding. However, it should be noted that with other funders (e.g. National Student Financial Aid Scheme), students are free to choose any degree programme. Although Toni is still enrolled, there might be others who faced similar conditions of being forced to do a certain programmes due to the funding arrangements and in the process fail to cope and drop out of university. When students like Toni drop out or fail their courses, they are often blamed and regarded as under-prepared for university education. From Toni’s case, it is clear that the higher education system through some of its partners, is not well-prepared for diverse students. This subtle disadvantage brought about by the funding arrangement and the educational system is overlooked and not reported. Besides limiting the options of courses available to students with disabilities, some funding regimes are also conditional, based on satisfactory performance in coursework. This is a fair condition, but if, for example, Toni struggles, which is possible because he was prepared to study Law and not Human Resources, the bursary is withdrawn. Students are expected to pass regardless of other challenges they may be facing, even those beyond their control. On another point, Pat’s educational costs are covered by a bursary that caters for her registration, tuition, study materials, accommodation and health needs. However, the bursary does not take into account that Pat is a single parent, taking care of her child.I depend only on the bursary for all my needs and I have a baby to take care of also. I have to take half of my bursary money and buy stuff for my baby. It is challenging for me. (Pat, albinism, UniVen)Even with the help of her (widowed, unemployed) mother, who takes care of the child during the semesters, Pat struggles financially. What is evident here is the concentration by funding arrangements on giving assistance without paying attention to the varied financial needs of students. Furthermore, at times the disbursement of these funds is delayed. When I was at UniVen for data collection, I observed one student with disabilities compiling the names of students with disabilities who had not yet received their grants. While students with disabilities will be struggling with funding issues, other students will be proceeding with their studies. Besides these constrains regarding finances, the space for students with disabilities to create meaningful relations with their peers is limited. The concept of inclusion is not straightforward. Superficial forms of inclusion may actually lead to exclusion. This is why all of Sayeed’s critique of the concept of inclusion and the capabilities approach are important in our analysis of the opportunities and freedoms available to students with disabilities. As an example, in South Africa, students with disabilities continue to be admitted to higher education institutions and receive disability related funding only if they meet certain academic standards. Students with disabilities who fail to reach the required academic threshold are deregistered (excluded) even if their failure might be as a result of an unchanging and hostile higher education environment. This supports the point raised by Sayed et al., mentioned earlier of the failure of current inclusive imperatives to articulate the relationships and interplay between different forms of difference. Physical inclusion or access into higher education is obviously important, if students with disabilities cannot get into higher education institutions in the first place, they cannot have access to teaching and learning. However, inclusion is a multi-layered issue encompassing other aspects. A failure to provide needed resources at the right time is an injustice as this puts students with disabilities at a disadvantage, as their work is disrupted resulting in failing exams. Failing in higher education shatters not only the dreams and visions for all students, but also for their families who hope that their children’s education is a route out of poverty. There is much more that needs to be done to help all students to succeed in higher education. Universities should embed disability equity programmes within the broader inclusion frameworks and funding schemes should also take into consideration the specific context of each student. While higher education has the potential to equip students challenge negative perceptions of their impairment and alter their self-concept through social capital formation (Brabazon, 2015; Papasotiriou & Windle, 2012), students reported fairly limited social networks and social relations at university. The contribution of these universities to social capital is weak, as most barriers are connected to physical restrictions and subtle forms of exclusion related to attitudes towards disability. This lack of social network and social capital nurturing is problematic, as previous research suggests that support from fellow students is crucial to train students to persist with their studies (Papasotiriou & Windle, 2012). For the creation of inclusive higher education, programmes that promote tolerance and appreciation of diversity among all students should be implemented. The capabilities approach helps us understand and evaluate social justice by directing our attention not only to the educational outcomes, but also exploring the processes that lead to the different inclusive results. In doing this, it is possible to unearth programmes and practices designed to help students with disabilities that are actually achieving the opposite. Some policies and practices designed and sanctioned by universities can by themselves exclude and perpetuate injustices. Attempts to tackle injustices against students with disabilities in higher education should not only focus on overtly discriminatory practices but also have appreciation for other subtle manifestations of intolerance. For example, the absence of social facilities for students with disabilities at UniVen and restricting students who use wheelchairs to senior residences at UFS could be as a result of paying little attention to inclusion imperatives raised by Sayed et al. (2003). The arrangements support Sayed’s (2003) concern that not all forms of inclusion are good as the principle of making students ‘fit’ into an existing system seems to be applied here and it elides the differences among students with disabilities. This is a form of social injustice. While students who use wheelchairs are being ‘included’ at the university, they encounter antisocial environment in which choices are made for them regarding appropriate residence. This inevitably reduces students with disabilities’ contact with peers and lecturers, and ultimately, opportunities for them to create meaningful relationships with the wider university community will be severely hampered. One of the consequences of this imperative is that students with disabilities in higher education will be considered as the other who need to change, while the nature and functioning of universities, bearing legacies of the apartheid system, which have the potential of perpetuating structural and ideological barriers for people with disabilities, receives little attention in policy deliberations. Even if students with disabilities at UniVen were able to access other students’ residences, the set-up of separating them from the rest of the students perpetuates social exclusion. This analysis is important in drawing our attention to the fact that inclusion could be a form of ‘window-dressing’ without any fundamental changes to the exclusionary behaviour towards students with disabilities. The opportunity for education constitutes not just a means of achieving learning outcomes but also a space for social interaction, individual development and psychosocial support (Trani, Bakhshi, Bellanca, Biggeri, & Marchetta, 2011). As such, various programmes are required to improve inclusion of students with disabilities at universities from residences to the classes. A socially just higher education matters: it provides the foundation for social networks and social relations that nurture personal and professional strategies needed when confronted by social challenges. Access came out as an important element in the realisation of an inclusive and just higher education. However, access should not only be seen in terms of gaining entry into to higher education, but needs to be viewed in terms of participating equitably in all spheres of higher education, including in social activities and in teaching and learning. Factoring these into conceptualisation of access will enable us to identify, understand and address the challenges faced by students with disabilities. South African research literature and media report a great deal on the under-preparedness of students from secondary schools into higher education. Whilst not denying that some students are under-prepared in other ways when they enrol for higher education, these findings challenge simply blaming students. Expansive-oriented policies as opposed to one-dimensional ones are needed to promote staff awareness on disability issues, promote responsive and inclusive pedagogy. Findings highlight both diversity and heterogeneity within students with disabilities. These differences, which are acknowledged by the capabilities approach help us understand the complexities around inclusion concept raised by Sayed et al. (2003). For example, the assessment method preferred by Carla places Joe at a disadvantage (the opposite is also true). This confirms the importance of looking at disability from the expansive lens such as that of the capabilities approach, which recognises heterogeneity and emphasises the creation of opportunities and freedoms for all people to do what they value, and then work to put the conditions in place to remove the ‘unfreedoms’. When we focus on the opportunities and freedom of each student we avoid the dilemma of difference-either giving some people little attention or labelling them and stigmatising them. Caution should be taken when attending to the needs of students with disabilities, as their needs are different and treating them as a single group disadvantages others. Joe and Carla are not against the assessments modes they highlight, but worry about what each method entails for them: the hassle of finding books in the library for someone with visual impairment, and managing group dynamics for someone with dyslexia. Universities need to create dynamic inclusive support structures and environments, and design curricula that consider multiple users from the start in order to create a variety of learning opportunities. A university is not neutral: it can either promote or inhibit social justice. Findings show that the gap between institutional intent to attend to inclusion and widen participation of students with disabilities and reality can be wide. In Toni’s case the supervisor is doing a great job in supervising and giving comments, yet he is ignorant about the effects of how he is presenting the comments. For Musa, he is being unfairly judged based on his handwriting. In a socially just system, alternative arrangements would be provided. There is an absence of key support. Students have different endowments owing to various social, economic and political factors. It becomes apparent that being ‘able to negotiate risk, to persevere academically, to be responsive to educational opportunities and adaptive to constraints’ (Walker, 2006) need to be promoted in and through higher education. Data calls for a review of assessments method within a diverse student population. The scale and number of dropouts of students, including students with disabilities, tell us that such failures cannot be solely individualised. At a national level, concrete guidelines are needed to inform universities on how to deal with disability matters. This does not require a ‘wish-list’ of ideas. Instead, proper policies that state e.g. how a student with a specific disability ought to be accommodated within a university, or issues of alternative assessment methods (currently left open in South Africa), are required as a matter of urgency.

Samples were collected from four distinct areas (from 23° to 53° S) along the coast of Chile, in the spring of 2014. Lanthanides were confirmed in all samples and were found over a range of 0.0001–7.62 mg kg−1 dry weight, in agreement with concentrations found in non-polluted areas around the world. The concentrations of elements varied among species, phyla, and, in some cases, by geographical distribution, highlighting the importance of local factors on lanthanide distribution. The central and northern zones of Chile contained higher concentrations of lanthanides (in total of all samples with 10.69 and 10.41 mg kg−1 dry weight, respectively), although the northern samples comprised only one third of the number of samples from the central zone. The pristine area at the extreme south of Chile also contained lanthanides in macroalgal biomass, at a total concentration of 4.77 mg kg−1 dry weight. Species with the highest concentrations of these metals were the brown alga Colpomenia sinuosa (7.62 mg kg−1 dry weight) and the red macroalga Gracilaria chilensis (2.92 mg kg−1 dry weight), followed by Corallina officinalis var. chilensis, and Pyropia sp. Cerium was normally the main lanthanide (2.99 mg kg−1 dry weight) followed by lanthanum (1.34 mg kg−1 dry weight) and/or neodymium (1.61 mg kg−1 dry weight). This is the first publication that exclusively covers the distribution of these economically important metals in Chilean marine biota. We suggest that the brown alga C. sinuosa could have potential as a bioindicator of lanthanides.","This study was supported by the Long-term Research Development Project no.

The persistence of floating seaweeds is determined by the balance between their acclimation potential and the environmental pressures at the sea surface. Solar radiation is the most important inducer of physiological stress, varying in intensity throughout the day and the year. Therefore photoinhibition and subsequent recovery can change depending on the daily radiation dose and season. The bull kelp Durvillaea antarctica is one of the most common floating seaweeds in the southern oceans, including New Zealand, Chile, and most subantarctic islands. Herein, daily cycles of maximum quantum yield (Fv/Fm), photoinhibition and recovery levels were examined in microcosm experiments with floating D. antarctica throughout the year, focusing on the blade side exposed to solar radiation (sunny vs shadow side). Also, the effect of simulated wave action (blade turnover) and ultraviolet radiation (UVR) on photoinhibition and recovery of Fv/Fm was evaluated. Significant differences in maximum quantum yield were observed between blade sides, with lowest values on the sun-exposed side, especially during noontime and spring/summer months. Phlorotannins and pigments were measured during seasons with the most intense solar radiation (late spring, early summer), when Fv/Fm values were lowest. Phlorotannin, but not pigment concentrations, differed between sunny (lower concentration) and shadow blade sides (higher concentration) and throughout the daily cycle. Both blade sides had similar photoinhibition and recovery levels when blades were constantly turned over. Absence of UVR favoured the recovery capacity of Fv/Fm in both blade sides, suggesting that the photorecovery potential of floating kelps depends on the environmental conditions that kelp rafts face at the sea surface (e.g. cloudy vs sunny days, intense seawater movement and splashing vs calm sea conditions). The results confirm that photobiological stress is more severe during summer and on continuously sun-exposed blade sides, thereby damaging the blades and suppressing the floating time of D. antarctica.","We thank Laurent de Vriendt, Anita Fricker, Ivan Hinojosa, David Jofré, Steffi Meyer, Leonardo Miranda, José Pantoja, David Pfender and Jeanette Werner for their help during field collections and lab experiments.

New approaches to this history have suggested that some undertook educational initiatives that broke with the dominant apartheid model. Bophutatswana’s Primary Education Upgrading Programme (PEUP) was such an initiative. This article focuses on the actors, origins, aims and practices of the programme and assessments by contemporaries and its strengths and weaknesses. Using documentary evidence on the project, interviews with its initiators and participants in the programme, as well as assessments by contemporaries at the time, it argues that the project involved a contradictory alliance of conservative Bantustan leaders and Christian liberals. The project drew on progressivist, child-centred ideas borrowed from Europe and the United Kingdom but these were encased within the broader ethnic apartheid project and served a legitimatory purpose. PEUP included both innovative aspects within the context of Bantu Education but also continuities with its broader ethnic purposes. Miserly budgets, Bantustan politics, and limitations specific to progressivism ultimately undermined the success of the PEUP.

225,pub.1091916110,10.1002/joc.5292,,,Rainfall along the coast of Peru during strong El Niño events,"ABSTRACT While, climatologically, most areas of the Peruvian Pacific region do not experience precipitation, they can be affected by heavy rain and flooding during strong El Niño events with severe socio‐economic impacts. Only four strong El Niño events took place within the last five decades (1972/1973, 1982/1983, 1997/1998 and 2015/2016) which led to significant rainfall events in the northern part of Peru. Here a detailed analysis of the evolution of precipitation during these events was performed using gauge records from 1964 to 2016 from a network of 145 meteorological stations located along the Peruvian Pacific region. Through empirical orthogonal function analysis, the rainfall anomalies variability is interpreted as resulting from the combination of a meridional see‐saw mode (North–South) (Ep mode) and a zonal see‐saw mode (East–West) (Cp mode) that represent, respectively, 34 and 21% of the explained variance. It is shown that the extreme 1982/1983 and 1997/1998 El Niño events have a dominant projection on the Ep mode that has a strong loading in the northern region, while the 1972/1973 and 2015/2016 El Niño events have a relatively weak projection onto the Ep mode (about ten times less at the peak rainy season than the extreme events) and mostly project onto the Cp mode. Also, it is shown that while all events are associated with positive rainfall anomalies in the northern part of Peru which is accounted for by the Ep mode, the evolution of rainfall anomalies along the Cp mode exhibits a significant dispersion. This suggests that the impact of strong El Niño events on the highlands along the coast cannot solely be inferred from the magnitude of the sea surface temperature anomalies in the central equatorial Pacific. Overall, our study illustrates the nonlinearity of the ENSO teleconnection on the rainfall along the coast of Peru during strong El Niño events.","This work was supported by Peruvian Ministry of Education (MINEDU‐PRONABEC, scholarship).

Apacheta and Aguilucho volcanoes, northern Chile, formed a volcanic complex with known fumaroles and geothermal potential. Among the products resulting from the evolution of the Apacheta-Aguilucho Volcanic Complex (AAVC), a new volcanoclastic deposit has been recognized towards the eastern flank of the volcanic complex. This deposit is constituted by fragments of andesitic-to-dacitic lava and hydrothermally altered lava blocks. These fragments, which reach up to 5m in diameter, form geomorphological structures such as hummocks, levées and ridges. Using these geomorphological characteristics, the distribution of the main lithological facies (or lithofacies), and fragment features (jigsaw cracks and impact marks), we proposed that this deposit was generated by a debris avalanche. This debris avalanche was triggered by partial collapse of an ancestral volcanic edifice occurred between 100 and 700ka. The collapse of the AAVC ancestral edifice was influenced by hydrothermal alteration and the extensional tectonic setting that characterize the Cerro Pabellon Dome area. The mobility of the avalanche, and the genesis of the main geomorphological features associated with the deposit, are related to fragmentation of material during avalanche genesis and movement.","Acknowledgments Authors thank Dr. Lucia Capra and an anonymous reviewer for helpful comments.

Based on evidence from university classrooms and the result of an initial measurement, the genetic decomposition designed by Dubinsky and Lewin for this concept was reformulated, introducing and defining the basis step in the PMI as a mental process. Using this reformulated genetic decomposition, the productions of four university students are analysed in order to support or refute the constructions it proposes. The results show that the reformulated genetic decomposition is viable and that the inclusion of the basis step as a mental process was seen in the cognitive model of the PMI shown by the students.

To that end, aquaculture articles, published in peer-reviewed journals using the Web of Science, Scopus, and ScienceDirect databases were collected. This article provides an approximate minimum profitability for new aquaculture feasibility studies according to the type of aquaculture marine commodities, the project type, and the location or country. The results show that the average WACC was 10.6%; this rate was significantly higher a) for algae than for crustaceans, mollusks, and fish; and b) for projects installed in developing countries than for developed countries.

Among the ongoing debates surrounding the peopling of South America, there has been a great deal of focus on the cranial shape of prehistoric populations on this continent, which some researchers have described as having two distinct forms. The cranial shape of early Holocene Paleoamericans, which predate approximately 8000years BP, has been categorized as dolichocephalic (long-headed), while late Holocene populations have been generally described as brachycephalic (round-headed), despite more recent assessments that examine variation with a higher level of precision. Although more detailed analytical approaches to investigating craniofacial variation are available, researchers still categorize South American crania as having these two head shapes. These distinctions in head shape have been used to infer multiple origin models, some of which contend that the dolichocephalic population was biologically distinct and later replaced by brachycephalic individuals. In contrast, genetic studies infer a common ancestral origin among all prehistoric South American populations. Given discrepancies between genetic and cranial data, our study tests the hypothesis that Holocene populations consist of two cranial morphologies that coincide with the early and late Holocene periods. Using high-resolution 3D models generated from a laser surface scanner, cranial indices for 95 individuals from western South America dating from the Early, Middle, and Late periods were analyzed, most of which have been excluded from cranial assessments in South America. Our results show that the majority of crania analyzed in this study have an intermediate (mesocephalic) head shape, spatiotemporal variability, and no clear transition from dolichocephaly to brachycephaly during the Holocene. By re-examining the relevance of these categories that are determined through the calculation of the cranial index, and general morphological descriptions (long and narrow or short and wide skulls) that coincide with them, our research offers valuable insight into the ongoing debates centered on the colonization of South America. Given our results, we propose that caution should be used when referring to the terms “dolichocephalic” and “brachycephalic” head shapes and the general morphological descriptions for these terms to categorize early and late Holocene South American populations.","The authors extend their gratitude to the Editor, Christopher Hunt, Efthymia Nikita, and two anonymous reviewers, whose comments improved the quality of this manuscript.

Most search engines base their algorithms on a resource's text or popularity, requiring teachers to navigate the results until they find an appropriate resource. This makes searching for resources a tedious and cumbersome task. Specialized repositories contain resources that are annotated with metadata that aim to facilitate the discovery of quality resources. Nevertheless, the abundance and variety of content make searching a complex task. Recommender systems can assist teachers in finding the proper content by determining clusters of similar users and inferring users interest in a resource, assembling clusters of similar resources, or a mix of both. Probabilistic model-based (PMB) techniques, on the other hand, make it possible to classify resources into more than one cluster with various degrees of probability. In this paper, we used recommender systems and PMB techniques to analyze a dataset produced by primary and secondary level teachers over the course of four years and under natural conditions. We found that a hybrid recommendation, the Collaborative Topic Regression (CTR) technique, performs better than other approaches despite the high sparseness of the dataset. In addition, learning resources annotated with curriculum metadata had a positive impact on recommender's accuracy whereas free-text or other metadata negatively impacted the results.",This research was supported by the UC-Fundacion Chile ERAR: Evaluating Digital Learning Resources for Potential Recommendation project.

213,pub.1091477462,10.1007/s00704-017-2263-x,,,Hydroclimatic change disparity of Peruvian Pacific drainage catchments,"Peruvian Pacific drainage catchments only benefit from 2% of the total national available freshwater while they concentrate almost 50% of the population of the country. This situation is likely to lead a severe water scarcity and also constitutes an obstacle to economic development. Catchment runoff fluctuations in response to climate variability and/or human activities can be reflected in extreme events, representing a serious concern (like floods, erosion, droughts) in the study area. To document this crucial issue for Peru, we present here an insightful analysis of the water quantity resource variability of this region, exploring the links between this variability and climate and/or anthropogenic pressure. We first present a detailed analysis of the hydroclimatologic variability at annual timescale and at basin scale over the 1970–2008 period. In addition to corroborating the influence of extreme El Niño events over precipitation and runoff in northern catchments, a mean warming of 0.2 °C per decade over all catchments was found. Also, higher values of temperature and potential and actual evapotranspiration were found over northern latitudes. We chose to apply the Budyko-Zhang framework that characterizes the water cycle as a function of climate only, allowing the identification of catchments with significant climatic and anthropogenic influence on water balance. The Budyko-Zhang methodology revealed that 11 out of 26 initial catchments are characterized by low water balance disparity related to minor climatic and anthropogenic influence. These 11 catchments were suitable for identifying catchments with contrasting change in their hydroclimatic behavior using the Budyko trajectories. Our analysis further reveals that six hydrological catchment responses can be characterized by high sensitivity to climate variability and land use changes.",The authors would like to thank SENAMHI (Meteorological and Hydrological Service of Peru) for providing complete hydrometeorological raw dataset.

Although the reproductive cycle of P. monodon has been described, the relationship between this key biological process and the variability of the OMZ has not been comprehensibly addressed neither for P. monodon nor for other OMZ resident species. In this study a set of 14 quasi-monthly oceanographic cruises carried out between June 2010 and November 2011 were conducted over the continental shelf off Coquimbo (30°S) to investigate the temporal variability of: i) dissolved oxygen concentration, temperature and chlorophyll-a at relevant depths ii) the presence and proportion of occurrence of P. monodon ovigerous females and juveniles from benthic trawls; iii) the presence of different stage larvae in the plankton, and iv) similar biological data for other species from the OMZ and shallower depths crustaceans. During summer months oxygen levels and bottom temperature were lower than in winter, while chlorophyll-a concentration was maximum in summer coinciding with an active (but not maximum) upwelling season. P. monodon maximum egg carrying occurred in winter during periods of increased oxygenation. Egg carrying females were never found at depths where oxygen concentration was below 0.5mlL−1, while over 50% of the autumn and spring cohorts of juveniles occurred at oxygen concentrations below that level. The depth range occupied by ovigerous females was more restricted than the rest of the population and their depth of occurrence followed the variability of the upper OMZ. The larval release period of OMZ resident species extends over late winter and spring, and its main peak precedes that of coastal species (spring) and the spring-summer chlorophyll-a maximum. We propose that for OMZ resident species, brood carrying during warmer and more oxygenated conditions in the adult benthic environment, might favor embryonic development, so OMZ seasonal variability could be acting as a selective pressure to synchronize reproductive periods.","AcknowledgementsThe authors thank the INNOVA-CORFO 07CN13IXM-150 for providing biological and oceanographic data.

The dissolution of valuable species by heap leaching is strongly dependent on the design and operating variables, so the study of the influence of these variables on recovery and their optimization for the best performance are attractive tasks for the development of the mining industry. In this work, a methodology is developed that enables the planning and design of leaching systems. This methodology uses a proposed superstructure and a mathematical model to analyze the system behavior and determine the optimal design and operating conditions. The model was generated with a Mixed Integer Nonlinear Programming (MINLP) approach and solved by different solvers under GAMS® software (General Algebraic Modelling System). The Spatial Branch-and-Bound (SBB) solver obtained the global optimum in the shortest times. Based on a case of study for copper leaching, it is demonstrated that the procedure allows achieving optimal design and operational conditions.","J.O., E.D.G, and L.C. thank CONICYT and Regional Government of Antofagasta by their funding to the Project Anillo ACT1201 Atacama Seawater Project, through the PIA program and the Innovation for Competitiveness fund.",,Mineral Processing and Extractive Metallurgy Review,,,,2017-01-23,2017,2017-01-23,2017-05-04,38,3,180-192,Closed,Article,"Hernández, Isis F.; Ordóñez, Javier I.; Robles, Pedro A.; Gálvez, Edelmira D.; Cisternas, Luis A.","Hernández, Isis F.

This disparity in mating systems coupled with wide differences in host ecology provides opportunities to study the effect of environmental conditions on the social behavior of marine organisms. In this study, we tested the prediction that symbiotic crustaceans inhabiting relatively large and abundant host species are promiscuous rather than monogamous. The host traits above constraint host monopolization and favor host-switching behaviors by males individuals and, thus, ultimately drive promiscuity as a mating system in symbiotic crustaceans. As a model system we used Dissodactylus crinitichelis, a small ‘pea-crab’ that inhabits the relatively large and abundant sand dollar Encope emarginata. We described the population distribution of D. crinitichelis at two intertidal localities in Sergipe, Brazil, and conducted laboratory experiments to infer the mating system of this species. Dissodactylus crinitichelis inhabit sand dollars as adult heterosexual pairs more frequently than expected by chance alone, but these heterosexual pairs did not exhibit size-assortative pairing. Sexual dimorphism was reversed in D. crinitichelis, with males attaining smaller average body sizes than females but exhibiting more elaborated weaponry (male > female claws). These findings disagree with expectations for monogamous symbiotic crustaceans. Laboratory experiments demonstrated that male and female crabs switch among host individuals rather frequently and heterosexual pairs retrieved from the field did not remain together for long times. Our results argue against social monogamy and in favor of promiscuity in D. crinitichelis. Our study supports the notion that host abundance and large body size (relative to that of symbiotic guests) favor promiscuity in symbiotic crustaceans.",The authors are grateful to Dr. Sinara Maria Moreira for her help during fieldwork and experimental observations and to Dr. Leandro de Sousa Souto for help with some of the statistical analyses.

A common approach to study bacterial successional dynamics is to survey the trajectories and patterns that follow bacterial community assemblages; however early successional stages have received little attention. To elucidate how soil type and chemical amendments influence both the trajectories that follow early compositional changes and the architecture of the community bacterial networks in soil bacterial succession, a time series experiment of soil microcosm experiments was performed. Soil bacterial communities were initially perturbed by dilution and subsequently subjected to three amendments: application of the pesticide 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid, as a pesticide-amended succession; application of cycloheximide, an inhibitor affecting primarily eukaryotic microorganisms, as a eukaryotic-inhibition bacterial succession; or application of sterile water as a non-perturbed control. Terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) analysis of the 16S rRNA gene isolated from soil microcosms was used to generate bacterial relative abundance datasets. Bray-Curtis similarity and beta diversity partition-based methods were applied to identify the trajectories that follow changes in bacterial community composition. Results demonstrated that bacterial communities exposed to these three conditions rapidly differentiated from the starting point (less than 12h), followed different compositional change trajectories depending on the treatment, and quickly converged to a state similar to the initial community (48–72h). Network inference analysis was applied using a generalized Lotka-Volterra model to provide an overview of bacterial OTU interactions and to follow the changes in bacterial community networks. This analysis revealed that antagonistic interactions increased when eukaryotes were inhibited, whereas cooperative interactions increased under pesticide influence. Moreover, central OTUs from soil bacterial community networks were also persistent OTUs, thus confirming the existence of a core bacterial community and that these same OTUs could plastically interact according to the perturbation type to quickly stabilize bacterial communities undergoing succession.","Work funded by CONICYT to the Centre of Applied Ecology and Sustainability, grant FB 0002-2014.",,Applied Soil Ecology,,,,2017-11,2017,,2017-11,120,,44-54,Closed,Article,"Rodríguez-Valdecantos, Gustavo; Manzano, Marlene; Sánchez, Raimundo; Urbina, Felipe; Hengst, Martha B.; Lardies, Marco Antonio; Ruz, Gonzalo A.; González, Bernardo","Rodríguez-Valdecantos, Gustavo (Facultad de Ingeniería y Ciencias, Universidad Adolfo Ibáñez, Santiago, Chile; Center of Applied Ecology and Sustainability (CAPES), Santiago, Chile); Manzano, Marlene (Facultad de Ciencias Biológicas, Institute of Ecology and Biodiversity, Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile, Santiago, Chile); Sánchez, Raimundo (Facultad de Ingeniería y Ciencias, Universidad Adolfo Ibáñez, Santiago, Chile); Urbina, Felipe (Facultad de Ingeniería y Ciencias, Universidad Adolfo Ibáñez, Santiago, Chile); Hengst, Martha B.

It is spoken by about ten million speakers in Botswana, South Africa, Zimbabwe and Namibia. Setswana, because of its widespread use in Botswana, has been accepted as a national and official language in policy and practice. In South Africa, it is one of the 11 national and official languages. In the pre-independence South Africa, it was a national and official language of Bophuthatswana. The Zimbabwean constitution recognises Setswana as an official language, while the Namibian constitution indicates Setswana as a national ethnic language. With these regional legal and policy recognitions, Setswana is increasingly intervening in administrative and social spheres as the language of interethnic communication and a facilitator in the political spheres. It is one of the languages that have been selected for purposes of development and promotion by the African Academy of Languages (ACALAN), an arm of the Social Affairs Commission of the African Union. The ACALAN believes that African languages that have wide geographical spread and are used across borders can improve communication, enhance trade and facilitate enjoyment of cultural ties. The development of Setswana can be explained from history. It was the first southern African language to be codified and used in the missionary Bible translation and missionary education. From the early 1800s, Setswana has had a steady development with much of the work on the language done by the missionaries and travellers. This chapter discusses the different domains of Setswana use, its dialectal varieties and the degree of its codification.",,,,The Social and Political History of Southern Africa's Languages,"Tomasz Kamusella, Finex Ndhlovu",,2017-11-24,2017,2017-11-24,2018,,,187-221,Closed,Chapter,"Otlogetswe, Thapelo; Chebanne, Andy","Otlogetswe, Thapelo (University of Botswana, Gaborone, Botswana); Chebanne, Andy (University of Botswana, Gaborone, Botswana)","Otlogetswe, Thapelo (University of Botswana)","Otlogetswe, Thapelo (University of Botswana); Chebanne, Andy (University of Botswana)",1,1,,0.8,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1092897736,"47 Language, Communication and Culture; 4703 Language Studies; 4704 Linguistics",4 Quality Education

There are only hypersaline lakes such as those in the Tibetan Plateau where carnallite [KCl·MgCl2·6H2O] precipitates. Given that the purpose of common saltworks is to obtain NaCl, the halitic stage is not exceeded. By contrast, saltworks extracting lithium by solar evaporation reach more advanced stages of brine evolution and saline precipitation. In the Salar de Atacama saltworks, with a relative humidity commonly below 30% (monthly average), salts precipitate following a sequence of halite [NaCl], sylvite [KCl], carnallite and bischofite [MgCl2·6H2O] and display a useful model of evolution similar to that which gave rise to MgSO4-free potash deposits in the past. Prismatic-acicular gypsum [CaSO4·2H2O], the main accessory mineral, is transformed into a less hydrated calcium sulfate, probably anhydrite [CaSO4], during carnallite precipitation. Mineral crystal size and annual sedimentary thickness of each paragenesis are compared with those in ancient potash deposits. The behavior of sylvite and carnallite as cements is observed at the onset of their precipitation in ponds where both minerals coexist with previous halite. Millimeter cyclicity due to day-night thermal variations is observed in these saltworks, whereas cm- and mm-cyclicities have been interpreted in ancient sites as annual (regular) and intra-annual (irregular), respectively. Conditions similar to those existing at the Salar de Atacama were necessary to preserve carnallite, which is commonly the most evolved mineral in the ancient deposits. The development of potash deposits in the South Pyrenean Foreland Basin and the Rhine Graben, near the Eocene-Oligocene boundary, is attributed to global aridity and cooling and to the basin restriction associated with a decrease in the ocean level caused by the spread of the Antarctic ice cap.","AcknowledgmentsThe authors are grateful to the Rockwood Lithium GmbH company (Sociedad Chilena del Litio at the time of sampling) for permits and assistance received in the field.

We used a suite of sampling methods (light attraction and airlift devices) to evaluate the variability of larval, post-larval and macrobenthic assemblages associated with kelp forests (Lessonia trabeculata) in Central Chile (30° to 33°S). Pelagic collections identified two assemblages: early-life stages and emerging macrobenthos, with the later contributing three quarters to the total abundance regardless of the source of illumination (permanent or flashing). Field experiments showed that moon phases affected the structure and composition of the samples. Surveys carried out during new moon showed the highest abundances and taxonomic richness of emergent assemblages. However, species composition varied in both assemblages depending on the moon phase. Although the pelagic assemblages collected at sites with contrasting upwelling intensity did not show differences in community structure, differences in composition were evident for early-life stages. The relationship between pelagic and benthic collections indicated that four decapod crustaceans were represented at both larval and early juvenile stages; however, only the high abundances and densities of Paraxanthus barbiger allowed for estimations of benthic-pelagic coupling. For this species, larval abundances and benthic juvenile densities demonstrated contrasting local and regional patterns, suggesting a decoupling between pelagic and benthic environments. These findings highlight the differential variability in smaller components of kelp forests, but also suggest that post-settlement processes may be driving biological interactions through these highly productive and complex environments.","The authors would like to thank several people who provided logistical support.

Although the development of infrastructure and tourist services has increased for the beaches in northern Chile associated with coastal urban centers, these beaches have not implemented strategies to evaluate and help guide sustainable use. We used different indices to describe the seven state tourist beaches of the Región de Coquimbo. For most of the beaches, based on the Conservation Index (CI) and the Recreation Index (IR), a priority use of an ""intensely recreational"" character was recommended because of the low potential for conservation. Similarly, most of the beaches showed high levels of urbanization (IU). According to the Beach Quality Index (BQI), the quality of the beaches was assessed at an intermediate level. The application of these indices identified shortcomings in the levels of tourism infrastructure and security offered to users. The function of beaches to protect against natural events was extremely poor, likely because of changes to the beach dune ridges. The incorporation of assessment tools that integrate different indicators to help organize information, prioritize actions, and facilitate decision-making in the sustainable management of tourist beaches is strongly recommended for northern Chile.",The authors would like to acknowledge Rafael Sardá and two anonymous reviewers for valuables suggestions that greatly improved the manuscript.

The formation of such nested craters has been commonly interpreted as vent migration. Here, we present an additional mechanism that may explain the geometry of nested craters at volcanoes. Láscar Volcano, the most active volcano of the Central Volcanic Zone in the Chilean Andes, hosts ENE-WSW trending summit craters that are partially overlapping (nested). Details on the evolution and interaction between the different craters remain unclear.To create a robust dataset, Terrestrial Laser Scanner (TLS) data were collected at the summit of Láscar in 2013. The resulting topographic data set, consisting of more than 15 million data points with centimetre sampling, allows visualising almost the complete eastern edifice of the volcano's summit. From the TLS data, a Digital Elevation Model (DEM) and a slope map were generated allowing us to create a lineament map and quantify the observed morphological and structural features. To further improve our understanding of the processes responsible for the formation of the craters and geomorphology, we designed sandbox analogue models. Results suggest that one of the craters is a ‘parasite’ crater, formed as a consequence of ongoing activity in the adjacent crater. Our data suggest that the nested craters have all been modified since the last major eruption in 1993, by near surface effects associated with cooling, compaction and gravitational sliding of the crater floor infill. As the active crater deepens, the adjacent inactive crater extends and partially slumps towards the active one. Understanding the structural development of these nested craters is relevant for assessing potential future eruption sites, thus making Láscar a dynamic target for a detailed morphology study. These findings may similarly be applied to other volcanoes, where nested craters have developed.","AcknowledgmentsThis work (EDZ and NR) was supported by the Helmholtz Alliance Remote Sensing and Earth System Dynamics(HGF EDA).

The contributors to this volume illustrate how one can bridge differences between the natural and social sciences through the more socially-focused interpretations of botanical datasets. The chapters in this volume draw on a diversity of plant-derived datasets, macrobotanical, microbotanical, and molecular, which contribute to general paleoethnobotanical practice today. They also carefully consider the contexts in which the plant remains were recovered. These studies illustrate that the richest interpretations come from projects that are able to consider the widest range of data types, particularly as they aim to move beyond simple descriptionsof food items and environmental settings. The authors in this volume address several themes including: the collection of wild resources, the domestication of crops and spread of agriculture, the role of plant remains in questions regarding domestic life, ritual, and gender as well as the broader implications of a socially-engaged paleoethnobotany. These studies point a path forward for the constantly evolving field of paleoethnobotany, one that is methodologically rigorous and theoretically engaged. Together, these papers shed light on ways in which the specialized analysis of plant remains can contribute to theory building and advancing archaeological understanding of past lifeways.",,,,,"Matthew P.

However, these traditional spatial inequality measures like the Theil index do not distinguish among different locational situations. On the other hand, when analyzing the spatial decomposition of inequality, it is usual to express global inequality as a weighted sum of inequality values calculated for population subgroups (within component) plus the contribution arising out of differences among subgroup means (between component). Nevertheless, it is unclear whether the reported within and between contributions have been driven primarily by specific factors related to the spatial level of research or by neighborhood factors. The present paper has two main objectives. The first consists into propose a simple way to measure the role of the geographical position in economic inequality. The second aim is to provide an approach to decompose global inequality into its within-country and between-country components assessing which part of these components could be related to neighborhood factors. The proposals are illustrated for the case of European countries. Inequality within each of the countries and inequality between countries can be filtered of neighborhood components, showing inequality components related to specific (local) factors. For a considered spatial level, this exploratory approach can highlight the relevance of future place-based policies versus policies able to support and promote regional neighborhoods.","We thank the editor and two anonymous referees for their comments.

While environmental contamination is widespread, there are several reasonable intervention points present as the material flows through society and the environment, from initial production to deep-sea microplastic sedimentation. Plastic passes through the hands of many stakeholders, with responsibility for environmental contamination owned, shared, or rejected by plastic producers, product/packaging manufacturers, government, consumers, and waste handlers.The contemporary debate about solutions, in a broad sense, largely contrasts the circular economy with the current linear economic model. While there is a wide agreement that improved waste recovery is essential, how that waste is managed is a different story. The subjective positions of stakeholders illuminate their economic philosophy, whether it is to maintain demand for new plastic by incinerating postconsumer material or maintain material efficacy through recycling, regulated design, and producer responsibility; many proposed solutions fall under linear or circular economic models. Recent efforts to bring often unheard stakeholders to the table, including waste pickers in developing countries, have shed new light on the life cycle of plastic in a social justice context, in response to the growing economic and human health concerns.In this chapter we discuss the main solutions, stakeholder costs, and benefits. We emphasize the role of the “honest broker” in science, to present the best analysis possible to create the most viable solutions to plastic pollution for public and private leadership to utilize.",MT was supported by the Chilean Millennium Initiative (grant NC120030).,,The Handbook of Environmental Chemistry,Freshwater Microplastics,"Martin Wagner, Scott Lambert",,2017-07-21,2017,2017-07-21,2018,58,,273-298,Closed,Chapter,"Eriksen, Marcus; Thiel, Martin; Prindiville, Matt; Kiessling, Tim","Eriksen, Marcus (5 Gyres Institute, Los Angeles, CA, USA); Thiel, Martin (Facultad Ciencias del Mar, Universidad Católica del Norte, Larrondo 1281, Coquimbo, Chile; Millennium Nucleus Ecology and Sustainable Management of Oceanic Island (ESMOI), Coquimbo, Chile; Centro de Estudios Avanzados en Zonas Áridas (CEAZA), Coquimbo, Chile); Prindiville, Matt (Upstream Policy Project, Damariscotta, ME, USA); Kiessling, Tim (Facultad Ciencias del Mar, Universidad Católica del Norte, Larrondo 1281, Coquimbo, Chile)","Eriksen, Marcus (5 Gyres Institute, Los Angeles, CA, USA)","Eriksen, Marcus (5 Gyres Institute, Los Angeles, CA, USA); Thiel, Martin (Catholic University of the North; Millennium Nucleus Ecology and Sustainable Management of Oceanic Island (ESMOI), Coquimbo, Chile; Centro de Estudios Avanzados en Zonas Áridas (CEAZA), Coquimbo, Chile); Prindiville, Matt (Upstream Policy Project, Damariscotta, ME, USA); Kiessling, Tim (Catholic University of the North)",77,24,,10.08,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1092861584,41 Environmental Sciences; 4104 Environmental Management,12 Responsible Consumption and Production

The importance of the use of seawater in mining is highlighted in the introduction, then the main characteristics of seawater are reviewed, especially its potential effects on its use in mining. Subsequently, the consumption of seawater in Chile, especially in the regions located in the Atacama Desert, is analyzed based on statistics developed by Cochilco (Chilean Copper Commission). Later, the alternatives for the use of seawater and the distribution system are considered. The effect of seawater on the sulfide minerals flotation, the sulfide copper minerals leaching, and Caliche leaching is analyzed. We can conclude that the use of seawater has been increasing in Chile, which is already a reality, but there are challenges and opportunities that arise from the need to use seawater as a water resource.",,"The authors thank CONICYT and the Regional Government of Antofagasta for their funding through the PAI program, Project Anillo ACT 1,201.

Chile: Tracking the influence of the upper crustal Altiplano-Puna Magma Body","Subduction-related magmas that erupted in the Central Andes during the past 10Ma are strongly affected by crustal assimilation as revealed by an increase in 87Sr/86Sr isotope ratios with time that in turn are correlated with increased crustal thickening during the Andean orogeny. However, contamination is not uniform and can be strongly influenced locally by crustal composition, structure and thermal condition. This appears to be the case along the NW-SE San Pedro - Linzor volcanic chain (SPLVC) in northern Chile, which straddles the boundary of a major zone of partial melt, the Altiplano_Puna Magma Body (APMB). Herein we report 40Ar/39Ar ages, compositional and isotope data on lavas from the SPLVC that track the influence of this zone of partial melting on erupted lavas with geochronological and geochemical data. Ages reported here indicate that SPLVC has evolved in the last 2M.y., similar to other volcanoes of the Western Cordillera (e.g. Lascar, Uturuncu, Putana). 87Sr/86Sr ratios increase systematically along the chain from a minimum value of 0.7057 in San Pedro dacites to a maximum of 0.7093–0.7095 for the Toconce and Cerro de Leon dacites in the SE. These changes are interpreted to reflect the increasing interaction of SPLVC parental magmas with partial melt within the APMB eastwards across the chain. The 87Sr/86Sr ratio and an antithetic trend in 143Nd/144Nd is therefore a proxy for the contribution of melt from the APMB beneath this volcanic chain.Similar 87Sr/86Sr increases and 143Nd/144Nd decreases are observed in other transects crossing the boundary of the APMB. Such trends can be recognized from NW to SE between Aucanquilcha, Ollagüe, and Uturuncu volcanoes, and from Lascar volcano to the N-S-trending Putana-Sairecabur-Licancabur volcanic chain to the north. We interpret these isotopic trends as reflecting different degrees of interaction of mafic parental melts with the APMB. High 87Sr/86Sr, and low 143Nd/144Nd reveal zones where the APMB is thicker (~20km) and more melt-dominated (~25% vol. partial melt) while lower 87Sr/86Sr, and higher 143Nd/144Nd reveal thinner marginal zones of the APMB where lower contents of partial melt (<10% vol) involves reduced interactions. The lowest Sr-isotope ratios, and higher Nd-isotope ratios (where available) occur in magmas erupted outside the APMB (e.g. San Pedro, Lascar and Aucanquilcha volcanoes), indicating a diminished influence of crustal partial melts on parental mafic magmas. These geochemical parameters provide a useful tracer for the extent and significance of crustal partial melt bodies in magma genesis in the Central Andes.","AcknowledgmentsAuthors thank Dr. Robert B.

A pioneer in the application of X-ray fluorescence spectrography to the analysis of geological materials, his radical ideas about magma genesis, still the subject of vigorous debate, have dominated and largely determined the global directions of subsequent research on granites. His restite model, the recognition that most granite magmas move bodily away from their source regions as a mixture of melt and solid residual material, the progressive separation of which determines the magma composition, underlies his tenet that granites are images of their source. His consequent recognition, with Allan White, that there are two fundamentally different types of granite magma, I-type (derived from igneous sources) and S-type (derived from weathered sedimentary sources), each with its distinctive evolutionary path and associated mineralization, continues to underpin research into granites worldwide, and the search for granite-related mineral deposits.",,,Historical Records of Australian Science,,,,2017-08-31,2017,2017-08-31,2017,28,2,146,Closed,Article,"Williams, Ian S.; Campbell, Kenton S.W.","Williams, Ian S.

Whether these fiscal arrangements translate into a higher allocation of public goods in these economies remains yet unclear. We analyze the effects that local mineral taxation has on the provision of public goods in mining communities using Chile as a case study. We examine the effects of a non-distortionary tax on local concessions using a panel of 345 local governments between 2009 and 2014. To identify the effect, we compare the benefits of the tax on mining localities using two counterfactual groups of non-mining localities. We control for time-invariant and time-variant unobservable factors through both a fixed-effects and an instrumental variable fixed-effects estimator. Results show that the mineral tax increases the provision of only two out of four indicators of public goods. Further evidence suggests that local mineral taxation crowds out other local taxes.","We thank seminar participants at Michigan State University, REAL University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Latin American Environmental Energy Economics Workshop at the Centro de Investigación y Docencia Económica CIDE, the North American Regional Science Association, and two anonymous referees for their valuable comments and suggestions that helped to improve this work.

A study at Cuvieri Cave has allowed new insights into the dynamics and evolution of these types of sedimentary facies and their relation to the nearby landscape. The cave is located in the Lagoa Santa Karst, eastern Brazil, and contains fossiliferous deposits of Pleistocene–Holocene age at the base of three vertical pits near the cave entrance. Facies analysis was applied to sediments to understand sedimentation process, and sediments were described according to their morphology, grain-size, micromorphology, chemical composition, paleontological content and age. Results indicate that all deposits present a soil-like aspect and although they record several depositional conditions, sedimentary structures and textures are similar among different facies. As such, facies were defined by a combination of matrix color, degree of cementation and sedimentological characteristics. Additionally, abundance of fauna remains, their taxonomic composition (extant vs extinct), completeness, and degree of individuals' articulation was evaluated. Differences between facies were produced by two main factors: (i) change in source area and transport route (from the epikarst to doline colluviation and back to epikarst) and (ii) change in type of sediment cover injected, from doline fed soils, followed by talus debris and finally soils from modern epikarst. The change in both factors is related to the landscape evolution, mainly with the development and progressive enlargement and deepening of the nearby doline. Additionally, the change in the type of sediment cover injected could also be related to climatic evolution. The complex evolution of Cuvieri Cave sediments occurred over at least the last 300kyr and is marked by periods in which entrance opening allowed the incorporation of vertebrate (both extinct and extant) remains into the sediment. Detailed multidisciplinary field and laboratory analyses are essential in unraveling the long history of sedimentation in caves, providing a framework in which multiple events of sediment input and erosion can be correctly interpreted and related to the evolution of the landscape.","We are deeply indebted to José Hein for supporting us in our field seasons at his property.

Evaluating environmental awareness and action on coastal litter in Chile,"Coastal litter is a source of environmental, economic and health-related problems in many parts of the world, but local responses are not necessarily related to the severity of the impacts. In particular, it is unclear how environmental perception of community members and government bodies relate to active engagement on coastal pollution. The present study analyses the coastal litter situation and evaluates the willingness of citizens to engage at four sites (three regions of mainland Chile, and Easter Island; henceforth Rapa Nui) that feature differences in culture, economy sectors and landscape characteristics. Data on coastal litter were obtained from citizen science campaigns and assessments of large litter accumulations on beaches and rocky shores. The willingness to engage was evaluated qualitatively, considering municipal planning documents and the perception of residents on coastal litter and general waste management. We found very large quantities of litter in northern Chile, posing a hazard to marine wildlife and human health, and moderate quantities in the other regions. The region with the most severe case of coastal pollution does not feature the highest engagement, possibly a result of underlying factors such as an unsustainable economy and few possibilities for the population to connect with the natural environment. On mainland Chile, municipal engagement is low to moderate while on Rapa Nui there exist integrated waste-management strategies that address coastal pollution. Inhabitants of Rapa Nui seem to have a better conduct in the coastal environment (picking up litter, littering less), and show more engagement in waste-reduction strategies (recycling, volunteering for beach clean-ups). We suggest that the unique cultural history of the island, a landscape that allows meaningful interaction with nature and an economy based on sustainable tourism and high international visibility facilitates engagement on environmental issues. We advise managers to consider respective underlying variables, to create environments that allow contact with nature (e.g. public access to parks), and to encourage bottom-up initiatives, preferably by local actors (e.g. by promoting already engaged individuals or organisations).","AcknowledgementsWe thank Soledad Narváez for valuable insights from Rapa Nui and are grateful to her, Oscar Pino and Vivian Macaya for help in conducting the questionnaire.

The literature increasingly focuses on identifying incentives and barriers within universities, but is largely limited to contexts in Europe and the USA, and favours individual over institutional determinants. The paper contributes by situating university–industry linkages within the total pattern of academic interaction with external actors, in diverse types of institutions. Empirically, it extends the literature to investigate trends in an immature national system of innovation in a late developing economy context, South Africa. The analysis maps the heterogeneity of academic engagement, focusing on firms, through principal component analysis of an original dataset derived from a survey of individual academics. It concludes that the incentives that drive academics and that block university–industry interaction in contexts like South Africa, are strongly related to universities’ differentiated nature as reputationally controlled work organisations, and to the ways in which they balance and prioritise their roles in national development.","The research was funded by a Grant from the National Research Foundation (NRF), South Africa.",,The Journal of Technology Transfer,,,,2017-01-02,2017,2017-01-02,2017-08,42,4,884-908,Closed,Article,"Kruss, Glenda; Visser, Mariette","Kruss, Glenda (Education and Skills Development, Human Sciences Research Council, Private Bag X9182, 8000, Cape Town, South Africa); Visser, Mariette (Education and Skills Development, Human Sciences Research Council, Private Bag X9182, 8000, Cape Town, South Africa)","Kruss, Glenda (Human Sciences Research Council)","Kruss, Glenda (Human Sciences Research Council); Visser, Mariette (Human Sciences Research Council)",46,14,,16.21,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1006032098,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3507 Strategy, Management and Organisational Behaviour",

We control the system by considering boundary controls, for the velocity vector and angular velocity of rotation of particles, on parts of the boundary of the flow domain. On the remaining part of the boundary, we consider mixed boundary conditions for the vector velocity (Dirichlet and Navier conditions) and Dirichlet boundary conditions for the angular velocity. We analyze the existence of a weak solution obtaining the fluid density as a scalar function in terms of the stream function. We prove the existence of an optimal solution and, by using the Lagrange multipliers theorem, we state first-order optimality conditions. We also derive, through a penalty method, some optimality conditions satisfied by the optimal controls.","Exequiel Mallea-Zepeda was supported by proyecto UTA-Mayor, 4735-16. Élder J.

Changing temperature and pCO2 conditions may have significant implications for the shellfish farming socio-ecological system. In order, to setup the basis for understand the impact of both environmental variables, in this study, we investigated the combined effects of changing temperature and pCO2 on the physiological rates and histopathology of scallops Argopecten purpuratus farmed in Tongoy Bay, an area permanently influenced by coastal upwelling. Juvenile scallops were reared at two pCO2 levels (400 and 1000μatm) and two temperatures (14 and 18°C). After 18d of experimental exposure, growth, metabolic and clearance rates increased significantly at high temperature but independent of pCO2 level, indicating a positive effect of warming on the physiological processes associated with energy acquisition. However, ingestion rates of scallops showed a synergistic interactive effect when exposed to both stressors. Increased pCO2 also impacts the health of A. purpuratus through atrophy in the digestive gland. These results suggest that, the presence of trade-offs in energy allocation during upwelling-induced stress (low temperature and high pCO2) can impact growth, metabolism, ingestion rates and health status of scallops cultured in Tongoy Bay. But, less severe response to high pCO2 levels, suggest that natural variability in upwelling areas may promote acclimation and adaptation potential in this farmed scallops.","AcknowledgementsWe thank Pamela Tapia and Christian Tapia at Invertec–Ostimar Hatchery and fieldwork facilities.

191,pub.1085297043,10.1016/j.ijrmms.2017.03.009,,,Triaxial strength and deformability of intact and increasingly jointed granite samples,"Triaxial strength tests were performed on artificially jointed standard-size granite specimens with two sub-vertical and three sub-horizontal (2+3) joints. A fully servo-controlled press was used to load the samples and attain residual strength. These tests add to an existing test database for intact and artificially jointed (1+2 joints) samples of the same rock. The main parameters from each test were used to analyse tendencies, in particular, changes in elasticity and peak and residual strength in line with increased jointing. Peak strength and apparent Young's modulus decreased from the intact to the jointed specimens, reflecting a tendency analogous to that deriving from the use of classification systems to characterize rock masses. Mohr-Coulomb and Hoek-Brown failure criteria were fit to peak and residual strength tests results. In the case of the Hoek-Brown criterion, it seems that an equivalent of the geological strength index (GSI), which reflects structure at the specimen scale, could be of use in estimating the decrease in strength of increasingly jointed samples. Residual strength envelopes were practically the same for the intact and jointed specimens. Our results for granite would suggest that the so-called rock mechanics scale effect at large (i.e. the relevant change in material properties from rock samples at lab scale to that of the rock mass including the occurrence of natural discontinuities at the engineering work scale), is more due to structure (number, orientation, spacing and features of occurring joints), than to sample scale effect (i.e. the variation in properties when testing different size, from a few mm to some decimetres, unjointed intact rock samples at the laboratory).","The authors thank the Spanish Ministry of the Economy, Industry and Competitiveness for partial funding, awarded under Contract reference no.

191,pub.1091289437,10.1002/jqs.2980,,,Late Quaternary environmental dynamics in the Atacama Desert reconstructed from rodent midden pollen records,"ABSTRACT   In the past two decades, much has been learned about the late Quaternary climate history of the Atacama Desert with some details still unclear about the seasonality, timing and extent of wet and dry phases. Modern climate studies reveal that, far from exhibiting a unique pattern, seasonal precipitation originates from many sources and mechanisms. For the last 16 ka, we attempt to sort out these complexities in pollen records from four fossil rodent midden series spanning 22°–25°S in northern Chile. Widespread wet conditions prevailed during the late Pleistocene and early Holocene, particularly between 13 and 9 ka, evidenced by <400 m lowering of pollen zones (plant communities) compared to today. Regional differences in the timing and magnitude of this displacement may be related to the prevailing source (tropical/extra‐tropical) or mode (NNW/SE) of tropical precipitation through time. Wet conditions persisted well into the early Holocene, lasting ∼1–1.5 ka longer than previously suggested. The pollen record suggests extreme drying ∼8 ka, possibly associated with a northward shift of the Inter Tropical Convergence Zone, tracking minimum insolation values at subtropical latitudes during the austral summer. The establishment of conditions similar to today happened ∼4 ka.

Following a structural and multilevel empirical approach, we test whether both sets of variables explain the variation of individual wages, self-employed earnings, and the propensity of being in independent work. The results indicate that while most of the variation in these three outcomes is explained by individuals’ traits, place-related variables account for a non-negligible share of spatial variation. Second, as suggested by occupational choice theories, the propensity of being in self-employment positively correlates with larger expected earning differentials, but only in the case of employers. This, along with other results, suggests that while employers seem to choose their occupational status, own accounts in Chile seem to respond to factors pushing them into self-employment.","The authors want to thank SBEJ Associate Editor, Dr. Michael Fritsch, two anonymous reviewers, Miguel Atienza, and participants at the PRSCO conference 2015 for their helpful comments and suggestions.

The objective of the review is to discover whether customary law has been integrated into the mainstream of the legal system and, if so, in what form. The paper undertakes this task by analysing key judicial decisions and law reform initiatives that have had an impact on women’s rights, against the background of the protections that the Constitution gives to cultural rights. Using the notion of ‘living law’ as the point of departure, the paper concludes that the cause of integration has not been well-served by either the judiciary or the legislature, both of which have shied away from protecting the deep values embedded in customary law by deferring too readily to western notions that have found their way into the Constitution. The paper concludes by calling for a different approach that is more sympathetic to the values underpinning customary law even where, as sometimes happens, these have been obscured by practices that appear inimical to the Bill of Rights.",,,South African Journal on Human Rights,,,,2017-01-02,2017,2017-04-14,2017-01-02,33,1,1-24,Closed,Article,"Nhlapo, Thandabantu","Nhlapo, Thandabantu (Department of Private Law, University of Cape Town, Rondebosch, South Africa)","Nhlapo, Thandabantu (University of Cape Town)","Nhlapo, Thandabantu (University of Cape Town)",9,4,,9.12,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1093086714,48 Law and Legal Studies; 4803 International and Comparative Law; 4804 Law In Context; 4807 Public Law,"16 Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions"

Previous studies indicate a high presence of seaweeds from the genus Gelidium attached to floating bull kelp Durvillaea antarctica (Chamisso) Hariot. Herein, we analyzed the phylogeographic patterns of Gelidium lingulatum (Kützing 1868) and G. rex (Santelices and Abbott 1985), species that are partially co-distributed along the Chilean coast (28°S–42°S). A total of 319 individuals from G. lingulatum and 179 from G. rex (20 and 11 benthic localities, respectively) were characterized using a mitochondrial marker (COI) and, for a subset, using a chloroplastic marker (rbcL). Gelidium lingulatum had higher genetic diversity, but its genetic structure did not follow a clear geographic pattern, while G. rex had less genetic diversity with a shallow genetic structure and a phylogeographic break coinciding with the phylogeographic discontinuity described for this region (29°S–33°S). In G. lingulatum, no isolation-by-distance was observed, in contrast to G. rex. The phylogeographic pattern of G. lingulatum could be explained mainly by rafting dispersal as an epiphyte of D. antarctica, although other mechanisms cannot be completely ruled out (e.g., human-mediated dispersal). The contrasting pattern observed in G. rex could be attributed to other factors such as intertidal distribution (i.e., G. rex occurs in the lower zone compared to G. lingulatum) or differential efficiency of recruitment after long-distance dispersal. This study indicates that rafting dispersal, in conjunction with the intertidal distribution, can modulate the phylogeographic patterns of seaweeds.","This study was financed by the following grants: CONICYT/FONDECYT 1131082 to MT, F.

The case of Chile's large north,"Industrial clusters last if they can maintain over time the competitive advantages arisen from external economies and joint actions developed in the cluster itself. The trend towards relocation of activities outside the cluster, in other geographical areas, may be restrained by a number of inhibiting factors or barriers relating to the exit or abandonment of the cluster, such as the sense of belonging to the cluster, the density of the network of relationships established, the existence of shared norms and values, and the institutional framework of the cluster. Thus, the greater the presence of these factors is, the lower companies’ trend to leave the cluster will be. This paper analyses the cluster perpetuation model, based on the calculation of the probability of activity relocation, applied to the Antofagasta (Chile) mining cluster, using a multiple binary logistic regression.",,,Resources Policy,,,,2017-12,2017,,2017-12,54,,176-188,Closed,Article,"Pezoa-Fuentes, Claudia; Vidal-Suñé, Antoni","Pezoa-Fuentes, Claudia (Administration Department, Faculty of Economics and Administration, Universidad Católica del Norte, Av.

Among the moderate events, two classes are considered consisting in the Eastern Pacific (EP) El Niño events and Central Pacific (CP) events. We first show that the observed SST variability across moderate El Niño events (i.e. inter-event variability) is largest in the far eastern Pacific (east of ~ 130°W) in the Austral winter prior to their peak, which is associated to either significant warm anomaly (moderate EP El Niño) or an anomaly between weak warm and cold (moderate CP El Niño) as reveals by the EOF analysis of the SST anomaly evolution during the development phase of El Niño across the El Niño years. Singular value decomposition (SVD) analysis of SST and wind stress anomalies across the El Niño years further indicates that the inter-event SST variability is associated with an air–sea mode explaining 31% of the covariance between SST and wind stress. The associated SST pattern consists in SST anomalies developing along the coast of Ecuador in Austral fall and expanding westward as far as 130°W in Austral winter. The associated wind stress pattern features westerlies (easterlies) west of ~ 130°W along the equator peaking around June–August for EP (CP) El Niño events. This air–sea mode is interpreted as resulting from a developing seasonal Bjerknes feedback for EP El Niño events since it is shown to be associated to a Kelvin wave response at its peak phase. However equatorial easterlies east of 130°W emerge in September that counters the growing SST anomalies associated to the air–sea mode. These have been particularly active during both the 1972 and the 2015 El Niño events. It is shown that the easterlies are connected to an off-equatorial southerly wind off the coast of Peru and Ecuador. The southerly wind is a response to the coastal SST anomalies off Peru developing from Austral fall. Implications of our results for the understanding of the seasonal ENSO dynamics and diversity are discussed in the light of the analysis of two global climate models simulating realistically ENSO diversity (GFDL_CM2.1 and CESM).","B.

We present a case study of the El Tesoro Central exotic-Cu deposit located in the Atacama Desert of northern Chile. This deposit consists of two mineralized bodies hosted within Late Cenozoic gravels deposited in an arid continental environment dominated by alluvial fans with sub-surficial ponded water bodies formed at the foot of these fans or within the interfan areas. Both exotic-Cu orebodies mostly consist of chrysocolla, copper wad, atacamite, paratacamite, quartz, opal, and calcite. The most commonly observed paragenesis comprises chrysocolla, silica minerals, and calcite and records a progressive increase in pH, which is notably influenced by evaporation. The results of stable isotope analyses (δ13C and δ18O) and hydrogeochemical simulations confirm that evapoconcentration is the main controlling factor in the exotic-Cu mineralization at El Tesoro Central. This conclusion complements the traditional genetic model based on the gradual neutralization of highly oversaturated Cu-bearing solutions that progressively cement the gravels and underlying bedrock regardless of the depositional environment. This study concludes that in exotic-Cu deposits formed relatively far from the source, a favorable sedimentary environment and particular hydrologic and climatic conditions are essential to trap, accumulate, evapoconcentrate, neutralize and saturate Cu-bearing solutions to trigger mineralization. Thus, detailed sedimentological studies should be incorporated when devising exploration strategies in order to discover new exotic-Cu resources, particularly if they are expected to have formed relatively far from the metal sources.",We thank Antofagasta Minerals S.A. and its personnel for their cooperation and assessment during the field work.

There has been a debate whether or not the so-called “wind drop-off”, that is a shoreward decrease of the surface wind speed near the coast, can act as an effective forcing of upwelling through Ekman pumping. Although the wind drop-off has been simulated by high-resolution atmospheric models, it has not been well documented due to uncertainties in the scatterometry-derived wind estimates associated with land contamination. Here we use the along-track altimetry-derived surface wind speed data from ENVISAT, Jason-1, Jason-2, and SARAL satellites, to document the spatial variability of the mean wind drop-off near the coast as estimated from the inversion of the radar backscattering coefficient. The data are first calibrated so as to fit with the scatterometer observations of previous and current satellite missions (QuikSCAT, ASCAT). The calibrated data are then analyzed near the coast and a wind drop-off scale is estimated. The results indicate that the wind drop-off takes place all along the coast, though with a significant alongshore variability in its magnitude. Differences between products are shown to be related both to the differences in repeat cycle between the different altimetry missions and to the peculiarities of the coastline shape at the coastal latitudes of the incident tracks. The relative contribution of Ekman pumping and Ekman transport to the total transport is also estimated indicating a comparable contribution off Chile while transport associated to Ekman pumping is on average ~1.4 larger than Ekman transport off Peru. Despite the aliasing effect associated with the weak repetitivity of the satellite orbit and the high frequency variability of the winds in this region, the analysis suggests that the seasonal cycle of the surface winds near the coast could be resolved at least off Peru.","AcknowledgementsO.

We revisit the paper by Cassandro et al. [J. Math. Phys. 46, 053305 (2005)] where they extend to the case α∈[0,ln3ln2−1) the result of the existence of a phase transition by using a Peierls argument given by Fröhlich and Spencer [Commun. Math. Phys. 84, 87–101 (1982)] for α=0. The main arguments of Cassandro et al. [J. Math. Phys. 46, 053305 (2005)] are based in a quasi-additive decomposition of the Hamiltonian in terms of hierarchical structures called triangles and contours, which are related to the original definition of contours introduced by Fröhlich and Spencer [Commun. Math. Phys. 84, 87–101 (1982)]. In this work, we study the existence of a quasi-additive decomposition of the Hamiltonian in terms of the contours defined in the work of Cassandro et al. [J. Math. Phys. 46, 053305 (2005)]. The most relevant result obtained is Theorem 4.3 where we show that there is a quasi-additive decomposition for the Hamiltonian in terms of contours when α∈[0,1) but not in terms of triangles. The fact that it cannot be a quasi-additive bound in terms of triangles lead to a very interesting maximization problem whose maximizer is related to a discrete Cantor set. As a consequence of the quasi-additive bounds, we prove that we can generalise the [Cassandro et al., J. Math. Phys. 46, 053305 (2005)] result, that is, a Peierls argument, to the whole interval α∈[0,1). We also state here the result of Cassandro et al. [Commun. Math. Phys. 327, 951–991 (2014)] about cluster expansions which implies that Theorem 2.4 that concerns interfaces and Theorem 2.5 that concerns n point truncated correlation functions in Cassandro et al.

162,pub.1085743174,10.1002/2016jc012614,,,Vertical energy flux at ENSO time scales in the subthermocline of the Southeastern Pacific,"Abstract The question of how energy is redistributed in the ocean has renewed the interest for the processes leading to midlatitude subthermocline variability at low frequency. Here we investigate a process that has been disregarded although potentially relevant for climatic studies dealing with the planetary energy budget. The focus is on the Southeastern Pacific where an efficient oceanic teleconnection takes place, linking the remote surface equatorial momentum forcing with the subthermocline through the vertical propagation of low‐frequency long‐wavelength extratropical Rossby waves (ETRW). A high‐resolution model is used to document the vertical energy flux associated with ETRW at interannual to decadal time scales. The analysis of a long‐term (1958–2008) simulation reveals that the vertical energy flux can be interpreted to a large extent as resulting from the coastally forced ETRW as far south as 35°S, so that heat content variability can be predicted along theoretical trajectories originating from the coast below the thermocline. It is shown that the vertical energy flux associated with the El Niño Southern Oscillation forms beams below the thermocline that account for a large fraction of the total vertical energy flux at interannual time scales. Extreme El Niño events are the dominant contributor to this flux, which is hardly impacted by mesoscale activity. The energy beams experience a dissipation processes in the ocean below 1000 m that is interpreted as resulting from vertical turbulent diffusion. Our results suggest that the ETRW at ENSO time scales are strongly dissipated at the surface but still can modulate the heat content in the deep ocean of the Southeastern Pacific.

150,pub.1048337109,10.1108/intr-12-2013-0258,,,Creating identification with brand communities on Twitter,"Purpose
                    Companies are now using social network sites (SNSs) within their marketing and brand-building activities. Twitter is the preferred SNS for creating brand communities, which offer companies many advantages. The purpose of this paper is to examine how individuals manage their competing needs for being affiliated (operationalized as personal and communal-brand connections) and for being seen as distinctive (operationalized as need for uniqueness (NFU)) when they are members of brand communities on Twitter. The authors have also analysed which type of brand community is able to achieve the balance between both needs, enhancing identification with the brand community.
                  
                  
                    Design/methodology/approach
                    A total of 318 valid responses were collected from three camera brand communities on Twitter. Messages (“tweets”) which included a link to an online questionnaire were sent to community members via Twitter. The authors examine the proposed model using structural equation modelling.
                  
                  
                    Findings
                    The authors demonstrate that consumers can satisfy their need for affiliation in brand communities created in Twitter. However, consumers can only reach a balance between the need for affiliation and the need for distinctiveness in brand communities built around niche brands. In contrast, the two needs work in opposition to shape identification in brand communities of big brands.
                  
                  
                    Originality/value
                    Optimal distinctiveness theory is used as a theoretical background for proposing how the antecedents of identification with the brand community enhance brand loyalty, with reference to the conflict between the individual’s needs for both distinctiveness and affiliation. Consumers’ identification with the brand community is proposed as a mediator to achieve brand loyalty in brand communities. Consumers reach this balance in brand communities built around a niche brand, where individuals with high NFU feel a high identification with the brand community. For big brands, as consumers’ NFU increases, their identification with the brand community and brand loyalty decreases.","This research was supported by the grant ECO2012-35766 from the Spanish Ministry of Economics and Competitiveness and by the Fundación Séneca-Agencia de Ciencia y Tecnología de la Región de Murcia (Spain), under the II PCTRM 2007-2010.",,Internet Research,,,,2017-02-06,2017,,2017-02-06,27,1,21-51,Closed,Article,"López, Manuela; Sicilia, María; Moyeda-Carabaza, Alberto Alejandro","López, Manuela (Escuela de Ciencias Empresariales, Universidad Catolica del Norte Sede Coquimbo, Coquimbo, Chile); Sicilia, María (Department of Marketing, University of Murcia, Murcia, Spain); Moyeda-Carabaza, Alberto Alejandro (Department of Marketing, University of Murcia, Murcia, Spain)","López, Manuela (Catholic University of the North)","López, Manuela (Catholic University of the North); Sicilia, María (University of Murcia); Moyeda-Carabaza, Alberto Alejandro (University of Murcia)",48,6,,13.26,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1048337109,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3503 Business Systems In Context; 3506 Marketing",11 Sustainable Cities and Communities
140,pub.1090903884,10.1111/bre.12258,,,"Supergene and exotic Cu mineralization occur during periods of landscape stability in the Centinela Mining District, Atacama Desert","Abstract  The Centinela Mining District ( CMD ), Atacama Desert (northern Chile), includes several mid‐late Eocene porphyry Cu deposits that contains supergene mineralization and provides access to a record of gravel deposits that host syn‐sedimentary exotic Cu mineralized bodies. By studying these gravels, we reconstruct the unroofing history and constrain the geomorphological conditions that produced supergene and exotic Cu mineralization. We present an integrated study based on stratigraphic and sedimentological data, lithology clast counts, 40 Ar/ 39 Ar and U/Pb ages from interbedded tuff layers and U/Pb detrital zircon geochronology data. To relate the gravel deposition episodes to the timing of the supergene mineralization, we provide in‐situ and exotic supergene mineral ages (40Ar/39Ar and K‐Ar). Six gravel units were deposited between the mid‐Eocene and the mid‐Miocene. The Esperanza gravels were deposited concurrently with the emplacement of porphyry Cu deposits at depth. The subsequent Tesoro I, II and III and Atravesado gravels register the unroofing of these deposits, from the advanced argillic zone to the sericitic and prophylitic hypogene zones. The Arrieros gravels register landscape pediplanation, that is, denudational removal and wear of the landscape to base level on a relatively stable tectonic regime, occurring roughly contemporaneous with supergene activity. The supergene mineral ages of the CMD define a time span ( ca . 25–12 Ma) during which most of the supergene ages cluster in northern Chile. This time span corresponds with a period of warm and humid climate conditions in the southern hemisphere. We conclude that landscape pediplanation favours supergene mineralization and helps preserve the former supergene mineralized zones from significant erosion. Low erosion rates during pediplanation may constitute a necessary condition for the efficiency of the supergene processes in such semi‐arid climate.","The present study was funded by FONDECYT Project No. 1121041, Antofagasta Minerals S.A. and the LMI‐COPEDIM project (IRD, France).

130,pub.1085962397,10.4324/9781315542720,,,"Money and the Governance of Punishment, A Genealogy of the Penal Fine","iMoney is the most frequently used means in the legal system to punish and regulate. Monetary penalties outnumber all other sanctions delivered by criminal justice in many jurisdictions, imprisonment included. More people pay fines than go to prison and in some jurisdictions many of those in prison are there because of failure to pay their fines. Therefore, it is surprising how little has been written in the Anglophone academic world about the nature of money sanctions and their specific characteristics as legal sanctions. In many ways, legal innovations related to money sanctions have been poorly understood. This book argues that they are a direct consequence of the changing meaning of money. Considering the ‘meaninglessness’ of modern money, the book aims to examine the history of changing conceptions in how fines have been conceived and used. Using a set of interpretative techniques sensitive to how money and freedom are perceived, the genealogy of the penal fine is presented as a story of constant reformulation in response to shifting political pressures and changes in intellectual developments that influenced ideological commitments of legislators and practitioners. This book is multidisciplinary and will appeal to those engaged with criminology, sociology and philosophy of punishment, socio-legal studies, and criminal law.ii iii",,,,,,,2017-06-26,2017,2017-06-26,,,,,Closed,Monograph,"Faraldo-Cabana, Patricia","Faraldo-Cabana, Patricia ()",,"Faraldo-Cabana, Patricia ()",7,1,,4.27,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1085962397,44 Human Society; 4402 Criminology; 48 Law and Legal Studies; 4804 Law In Context; 4805 Legal Systems,"16 Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions"

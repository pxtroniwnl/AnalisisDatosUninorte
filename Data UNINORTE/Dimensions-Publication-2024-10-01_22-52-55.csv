We conducted a brief review that synthesizes the available evidence and provides a judgment on the consistency of the association between risk factors and a composite end-point of severe-fatal covid-19. Additionally, we also conducted a comparability analysis of risk factors across 17 studies. We found evidence supporting a total of 60 predictors for disease severity, of which seven were deemed of high consistency, 40 of medium and 13 of low. Among the factors with high consistency of association, we found age, C-reactive protein, D-dimer, albumin, body temperature, SOFA score and diabetes. The results suggest that diabetes might be the most consistent comorbidity predicting disease severity and that future research should carefully consider the comparability of reporting cases, factors, and outcomes along the different stages of the natural history of covid-19.","To the contribution of a team of medical professionals that conducted part of the data extraction: Laura Acosta Camargo, Moises Molina Fuentes, John David Rodriguez and Juan Carlos Pantoja.",Funding.

Adults answered a version of the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-10) modified for COVID-19 (PSS-10-C), with Cronbach alpha equal to 0.86. In total, 406 individuals aged between 19 and 88 years (M = 43.9; SD = 12.4) agreed to participate in the survey: 61.8% were females, 90.6% had a university degree, 44.1% were health professionals, and 45.7% considered public health policies for preventing the spread of the disease inconsistent with scientific recommendations. PSS-10-C scores ranged from 0 to 36 (M = 16.5; SD = 7.3); 58 individuals (14.3%) scored for high perceived stress (cut-off point = 25). The inconsistency between policies and scientific evidence was significantly related to high perception of stress associated with COVID-19 (OR = 2.36; 95%CI: 1.32-4.20), after adjusting for gender. We concluded that the study group presented the prevalence of perceived stress associated with COVID-19 at high levels, arising from the inconsistent strategies developed by health authorities in view of scientific recommendations. Further researches must address the psychosocial aspects of epidemics.","The authors thank the University of Magdalena, Santa Marta, Colombia, for supporting the project.",,Cadernos de Saúde Pública,,,"Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; COVID-19; Colombia; Coronavirus Infections; Cross-Sectional Studies; Evidence-Based Medicine; Faculty; Female; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Health Personnel; Health Policy; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Prevalence; Psychological Distress; Stress, Psychological; Students; Surveys and Questionnaires; Young Adult",2020,2020,2020,2020,36,5,e00090520,All OA; Gold,Article,"Pedrozo-Pupo, John Carlos; Pedrozo-Cortés, María José; Campo-Arias, Adalberto","Pedrozo-Pupo, John Carlos (Universidad del Magdalena, Colombia); Pedrozo-Cortés, María José (Pontificia Universidad Javeriana, Colombia); Campo-Arias, Adalberto (Universidad del Magdalena, Colombia)",,"Pedrozo-Pupo, John Carlos (University of Magdalena); Pedrozo-Cortés, María José (Pontificia Universidad Javeriana); Campo-Arias, Adalberto (University of Magdalena)",142,32,8.98,46.06,https://www.scielo.br/j/csp/a/g37L7PydxnYQdQkFmLT5xGt/?lang=en&format=pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1128150515,42 Health Sciences; 4203 Health Services and Systems,3 Good Health and Well Being

In the highly conductive regime, ferromagnetic metals have been the focus of past research. Here, we report a giant extrinsic AHE in KV3Sb5, an exfoliable, highly conductive semimetal with Dirac quasiparticles and a vanadium Kagome net. Even without report of long range magnetic order, the anomalous Hall conductivity reaches 15,507 Ω-1 cm-1 with an anomalous Hall ratio of ≈ 1.8%; an order of magnitude larger than Fe. Defying theoretical expectations, KV3Sb5 shows enhanced skew scattering that scales quadratically, not linearly, with the longitudinal conductivity, possibly arising from the combination of highly conductive Dirac quasiparticles with a frustrated magnetic sublattice. This allows the possibility of reaching an anomalous Hall angle of 90° in metals. This observation raises fundamental questions about AHEs and opens new frontiers for AHE and spin Hall effect exploration, particularly in metallic frustrated magnets.","We acknowledge C. Cacho, T.

Artisanal and Small-scale Gold Mining (ASGM) has been identified as the most important anthropogenic source of Hg at a global scale and an important route of human exposure to Hg. In this context, this study assessed total Hg (THg) in blood, urine and hair, and methylmercury (MeHg) in human hair samples from 238 participants with occupational exposure to Hg in the most relevant ASGM communities of Colombia. Mercury concentrations in different biological matrices were related to several variables of interest such as age, gender, body mass index, fish consumption, exposure time, and specific occupational activities, such as amalgamation and amalgam burning. The median values of THg in blood (3.70 µg/L), urine (4.00 µg/L) and hair (1.37 mg/kg), and hair MeHg (1.47 mg/kg) for all participants were below permissible concentrations set by WHO. However, about 40% of the miners showed Hg concentrations in blood, urine and/or hair above the WHO thresholds. In all the biological matrices studied, miners burning amalgams showed significantly higher concentrations than miners who did not burn amalgams, with values 7-, 7-, and 8-fold higher in blood, urine and hair, respectively. A multiple linear regression model revealed that burning amalgam and fish consumption were significant predictors of Hg exposure in miners. Miners from Guainía had the highest concentrations in urine and hair, most likely due to the high manipulation and burning of amalgam, and a high fish consumption. In contrast, miners from Caldas showed the lowest Hg concentrations in all the biomarkers because they do not manipulate or burn amalgam, as well as reporting the lowest fish consumption. Our study also highlighted that gold miners exposure to Hg depends on their work practices. Therefore, the implementation of a health education programme on gold mining strategies is required, especially in Guaina, Vaupés, Córdoba, and Antioquia departments.","This study was performed in the framework of several projects: the (MME) GGC N° 223 - 2015 (UPME) CI-002-2015, funded by the Ministry of Mines and Energy, the Mining and Energy Planning Unit (UPME), and the University of Córdoba, and the Inter-administrative Agreement N° 407 - 2016, financed by the Ministry of Health and Social Protection, the National Health Institute and the University of Córdoba.",,Environment International,,,Animals; Colombia; Environmental Monitoring; Gold; Humans; Mercury; Mining; Occupational Exposure,2020-11-09,2020,2020-11-09,2021-01,146,,106216,All OA; Gold,Article,"Calao-Ramos, Clelia; Bravo, Andrea G; Paternina-Uribe, Roberth; Marrugo-Negrete, José; Díez, Sergi","Calao-Ramos, Clelia (Universidad de Córdoba, Carrera 6 No. 76-103, Montería, Córdoba, Colombia.); Bravo, Andrea G (Environmental Chemistry Department, Institute of Environmental Assessment and Water Research, IDAEA-CSIC, E-08034 Barcelona, Spain.); Paternina-Uribe, Roberth (Universidad de Córdoba, Carrera 6 No. 76-103, Montería, Córdoba, Colombia.); Marrugo-Negrete, José (Universidad de Córdoba, Carrera 6 No. 76-103, Montería, Córdoba, Colombia.

To develop novel natural composites with satisfactory properties, less common NLFs should also be investigated. Among these, the Cyperus malaccensis (CM), a type of sedge fiber, is already used in simple items like ropes, furniture, and paper, but has not yet been investigated as composite reinforcement for possible engineering applications. Therefore, the present work evaluated for the first time the properties of novel epoxy composites incorporated with 10, 20, and 30 vol.% of CM sedge fibers. Tensile, Izod-impact, and ballistic impact tests were performed, as well as Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy and thermal analysis of the composites. Results disclosed a decrease (-55%) in tensile strengths as compared to the neat epoxy. However, the elastic modulus of the 30 vol.% sedge fiber composite increased (+127%). The total strain and absorbed ballistic energy did not show significant variation. The Izod impact energy of the 30 vol.% composite was found to be 181% higher than the values obtained for the neat epoxy as a control sample. An increase in both stiffness and toughness characterized a reinforcement effect of the sedge fiber. The thermal analysis revealed a slight decrease (-15%) in the degradation temperature of the CM sedge fiber composites compared to the neat epoxy. The glass-transition temperatures were determined to be in the range of 67 to 81 °C.","The authors wish to thank the support to this investigation by the Brazilian agencies: CNPq, CAPES, FAPERJ, the Navy Research Institute (IPQM) for the thermal analyses conduction, the laboratory of applied mechanics at EEIMVR/UFF for conducting the composites tensile tests, and the Natural Fibers Laboratory at the State University of the North Fluminense Darcy Ribeiro (UENF) for conducting the impact tests.",This research received no external funding.,Polymers,,,,2020-08-08,2020,2020-08-08,,12,8,1776,All OA;

The ultrasound in water treatment resulted in cellular swelling and small impact on texture. Differently, the ultrasound in ethanol and ethanol treatments modified both carrot microstructure (cell wall modifications of parenchymatic tissue) and macrostructure (shrinkage and resistance to perforation). Pre-treatments with ultrasound in ethanol and ethanol improved the drying kinetics, reducing the processing time (~50%) and the energy consumption (42-62%). These pre-treatments also enhanced rehydration, whose initial rate and water retention were higher than the control. In addition, the carotenoid content was preserved after drying, for all the treatments. Any impact on shrinkage was observed. A mechanistic discussion, based on structural modification (microstructure and macrostructure) and physical properties of water and ethanol, was provided. As conclusion, this work not only described positive aspects of combining the technologies of ultrasound and ethanol as pre-treatments to convective drying, but also proposed mechanisms to explain the phenomena.","The authors are grateful to the São Paulo Research Foundation (FAPESP, Brazil) for funding the project n° 2019/05043-6 and the GR Carvalho post-doctoral fellowship (2018/17844-0); this study was financed in part by the “Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior – Brazil (CAPES)” – Finance Code 001, through the KC Santos M.Sc. scholarship; to the National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq, Brazil) for the JS Guedes M.Sc. scholarship (131235/2020-6) and the productivity grant of PED Augusto (306557/2017-7); and to the Fondo Nacional de Desarrollo Científico, Tecnológico y de Innovación Tecnológica (FONDECYT, Peru) from the ‘‘Consejo Nacional de Ciencia, Tecnología e Innovación Tecnológica” (CONCYTEC, Peru) for funding the project n° 409-2019-FONDECYT.",,Ultrasonics Sonochemistry,,,Daucus carota; Kinetics; Physical Phenomena; Sonication; Water,2020-08-05,2020,2020-08-05,2021-01,70,,105304,All OA; Gold,Article,"Santos, Karoline Costa; Guedes, Jaqueline Souza; Rojas, Meliza Lindsay; Carvalho, Gisandro Reis; Augusto, Pedro Esteves Duarte","Santos, Karoline Costa (Department of Agri-food Industry, Food and Nutrition (LAN), Luiz de Queiroz College of Agriculture (ESALQ), University of São Paulo (USP), Piracicaba, SP, Brazil); Guedes, Jaqueline Souza (Department of Agri-food Industry, Food and Nutrition (LAN), Luiz de Queiroz College of Agriculture (ESALQ), University of São Paulo (USP), Piracicaba, SP, Brazil); Rojas, Meliza Lindsay (Dirección de Investigación y Desarrollo, Universidad Privada del Norte (UPN), Trujillo, Peru); Carvalho, Gisandro Reis (Department of Agri-food Industry, Food and Nutrition (LAN), Luiz de Queiroz College of Agriculture (ESALQ), University of São Paulo (USP), Piracicaba, SP, Brazil); Augusto, Pedro Esteves Duarte (Department of Agri-food Industry, Food and Nutrition (LAN), Luiz de Queiroz College of Agriculture (ESALQ), University of São Paulo (USP), Piracicaba, SP, Brazil; Food and Nutrition Research Center (NAPAN), University of São Paulo (USP), São Paulo, SP, Brazil)","Augusto, Pedro Esteves Duarte (Universidade de São Paulo; Universidade de São Paulo)","Santos, Karoline Costa (Universidade de São Paulo); Guedes, Jaqueline Souza (Universidade de São Paulo); Rojas, Meliza Lindsay (Private University of the North); Carvalho, Gisandro Reis (Universidade de São Paulo); Augusto, Pedro Esteves Duarte (Universidade de São Paulo; Universidade de São Paulo)",83,52,4.42,8.62,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ultsonch.2020.105304,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1129879932,40 Engineering; 4004 Chemical Engineering,

The selected papers covered in this review must meet two mandatory requirements: (1) the reported products should be obtained via a multicomponent reaction; (2) the reported products should be biologically actives or at least tested for any biological property. Given the diversity of synthetic approaches utilized in MCRs, the highly diverse nature of the biological activities evaluated for the synthesized compounds, and considering their huge structural variability, much of the reported data are organized into concise schemes and tables to facilitate comparison, and to underscore the key points of this review.","D.I. thanks Universidad del Norte for partial financial support of this work.

Based on current models of climate change, reduction in precipitations and in turn, increase in the soil salinity will be a sharp constraint for crops productivity worldwide. In this context, root fungi appear as a new strategy to improve plant ecophysiological performance and crop yield under abiotic stress. In this study, we evaluated the impact of the two fungal endophytes Penicillium brevicompactum and P. chrysogenum isolated from Antarctic plants on nutrients and Na+ contents, net photosynthesis, water use efficiency, yield and survival in tomato and lettuce, facing salinity stress conditions. Inoculation of plant roots with fungal endophytes resulted in greater fresh and dry biomass production, and an enhanced survival rate under salt conditions. Inoculation of plants with the fungal endophytes was related with a higher up/down-regulation of ion homeostasis by enhanced expression of the NHX1 gene. The two endophytes diminished the effects of salt stress in tomato and lettuce, provoked a higher efficiency in photosynthetic energy production and an improved sequestration of Na+ in vacuoles is suggested by the upregulating of the expression of vacuolar NHX1 Na+/H+ antiporters. Promoting plant-beneficial interactions with root symbionts appears to be an environmentally friendly strategy to mitigate the impact of climate change variables on crop production.",We acknowledge the logistic support of the Chilean Antarctic Institute (INACH).

This spontaneous Hall effect, found more than a century ago, has been understood in terms of the time-reversal symmetry breaking by the internal spin structure of a ferromagnetic, noncolinear antiferromagnetic, or skyrmionic form. Here, we identify previously overlooked robust Hall effect mechanism arising from collinear antiferromagnetism combined with nonmagnetic atoms at noncentrosymmetric positions. We predict a large magnitude of this crystal Hall effect in a room temperature collinear antiferromagnet RuO2 and catalog, based on symmetry rules, extensive families of material candidates. We show that the crystal Hall effect is accompanied by the possibility to control its sign by the crystal chirality. We illustrate that accounting for the full magnetization density distribution instead of the simplified spin structure sheds new light on symmetry breaking phenomena in magnets and opens an alternative avenue toward low-dissipation nanoelectronics.","We acknowledge discussions with M.

One of the most conspicuous type of symbiosis is the endophyticism. This interaction has been noted to play a role in the adaptation of the native vascular plant Colobanthus quitensis to the stressful environments of Antarctica, characterized by low temperatures and extreme aridity. Projections of climate change for this ecosystem indicate that abiotic conditions will be less limiting due to an increase in temperature and water availability in the soil. Due to this decrease in stress induced by the climate change, it has been suggested that the positive role of fungal endophytes on performance of C. quitensis plants would decrease. In this study, we evaluated the role of endophytic fungi on osmoprotective molecules (sugar production, proline, oxidative stress) and gene expression (CqNCED1, CqABCG25, and CqRD22) as well as physiological traits (stomatal opening, net photosynthesis, and stomatal conductance) in individuals of C. quitensis. Individual plants of C. quitensis with (E+) and without (E-) endophytic fungi were exposed to simulated conditions of increased water availability (W+), having the current limiting water condition (W-) in Antarctica as control. The results reveal an endophyte-mediated lower oxidative stress, higher production of sugars and proline in plants. In addition, E+ plants showed differential expressions in genes related with drought stress response, which was more evident in W- than in W+. These parameters corresponded with increased physiological mechanisms such as higher net photosynthesis, stomatal opening and conductance under presence of endophytes (E+) as well as the projected water condition (W+) for Antarctica. These results suggest that the presence of fungal endophytes plays a positive role in favoring tolerance to drought in C. quitensis. However, this positive role would be diminished if the stress factor is relaxed, suggesting that the role of endophytes could be less important under a future scenario of climate change in Antarctica with higher soil water availability.",We thank Instituto Antártico Chileno (INACH) and the Chilean Navy for logistics and field support.

Fatty acids were quantified using gas-chromatography coupled with flame ionization detection (GC-FID), and the distribution of different fatty acids within lipid classes (neutral and polar lipids) was achieved after oil extraction using the Folch method and separation of lipid classes via solid-phase extraction for further GC-FID analysis. Red cusk-eel was the fish species with the lowest content of both EPA and DHA (40.8 and 74.4 mg/100 g, respectively) whereas mackerel contained the highest amount (414.7 and 956.0 mg/100 g for EPA and DHA, respectively). Sea squirt was the shellfish species with the highest content of EPA and DHA (375.0 and 165.7 mg/100 g, respectively) whereas the lowest amount of EPA + DHA was found in Chilean abalone (63.6 mg/100 g). PUFA were mostly found in neutral or polar lipids depending on the studied species. Indexes used to discuss the nutritional quality of lipids (PUFA/SFA, n-6/n-3 ratio and the hypocholesterolemic/hypercholesterolemic fatty acid index) were calculated and reported in the manuscript.

It comprised 122 boys and 122 girls, aged between16 and 29, living in the neighbourhood are: Viñedo Viejo, Las Nieves and Fuentes Claras. These three residence zones are markedly different in terms of socioeconomic composition. The questionnaire included the following information: socioeconomic characteristics (sex, age, educational level, employment status, residence zone), an assessment of health (health problems, diagnosis and medication in the last 2 weeks) and HRQOL (WHOQOL-BREF dimensions: mental health; physical health; social relations; and environment). ANOVA and four regression models were used to assess the role, direction and intensity of educational level on HRQOL.ResultsThe results show that the higher the level of education, the better the level of HRQOL. The biggest impact of education was on the mental health dimension, but this influence was modulated by sex and residence zone. The value of the interaction of education and residence zone was more significant than educational level alone. HRQOL of girls is more sensitive to education, being a student and residence zone than the HRQOL of boys.ConclusionsThe dimensions of HRQOL are influenced by educational level. The influence is greatest among girls and the youngest members of the poorest area of the district. Public authorities should contemplate the development of an equitable education system from the beginning of the life cycle as a public health strategy.",Not applicable.,"FundingMinisterio de Economía y Competitividad (CSO2017–82110-R)Gobierno de Aragón-Universidad de Zaragoza (Grupo de Referencia en Investigación, BYCS S16_17R) Ministerio de Economía y Competitividad (CSO2017–82110-R) Gobierno de Aragón-Universidad de Zaragoza (Grupo de Referencia en Investigación, BYCS S16_17R)",Health and Quality of Life Outcomes,,,"Adolescent; Adult; Cross-Sectional Studies; Economic Status; Female; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Health Status; Humans; Male; Quality of Life; Sex Distribution; Spain; Surveys and Questionnaires; Young Adult",2020-06-16,2020,2020-06-16,2020-12,18,1,187,All OA; Gold,Article,"Gil-Lacruz, Marta; Gil-Lacruz, Ana Isabel; Gracia-Pérez, María Luisa","Gil-Lacruz, Marta (Department of Psychology and Sociology, Health Science Faculty, Domingo Miral s/n, 50009, Zaragoza, Spain); Gil-Lacruz, Ana Isabel (Department of Management, School of Engineering and Architecture, C.

Specifically in the academic context, it is relevant to analyze its levels due to its impact on performance and learning. There are factors that affect the said stress including, among others, self-efficacy, and emotional intelligence. The purpose of this study is to analyze how emotional intelligence and perceived self-efficacy affect student stress. In order to show this influence, two complementary methodologies are implemented: the structural equation models (SEMs) and the comparative qualitative analysis (QCA). A total of 477 students (85% of women) from a private University of Valencia participated in the study, with ages ranging from 18 to 53 years old (M = 21.57, SD = 3.68). The assessment instruments used were as follows: Emotional Intelligence Scale (TMMS-24) to measure emotional intelligence; General Self-Efficacy Scale (GSS) to measure self-efficacy; and Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) to measure stress. The results in the SEM endorse the hypotheses that emotional clarity and self-efficacy are negatively related to stress and positively related to emotional attention (EA), explaining 25% of the variance. The QCA results show that none of the variables is a necessary condition for inducing stress. Nevertheless, different combinations of these variables are sufficient conditions to explain 35% of the high stress levels. The most important combination over high stress levels seems to be the interaction between high levels of EA and low levels of self-efficacy. Regarding the low levels of perceived stress, there are sufficient conditions to explain 50% of them. Mainly, the most important interaction is between low levels of self-efficacy and low levels of EA. The comparison of both methodologies enables the broadening of new horizons at the methodological level applicable to different contexts.",,,Frontiers in Psychology,,,,2020-03-13,2020,2020-03-13,,11,,295,All OA; Gold,Article,"Navarro-Mateu, Diego; Alonso-Larza, Lucía; Gómez-Domínguez, María Teresa; Prado-Gascó, Vicente; Valero-Moreno, Selene","Navarro-Mateu, Diego (Department of Educational Psychology and Special Educational Needs, Faculty of Psychology, Teaching and Educational Sciences, Catholic University of Valencia, Valencia, Spain); Alonso-Larza, Lucía (Department of Educational Psychology and Special Educational Needs, Faculty of Psychology, Teaching and Educational Sciences, Catholic University of Valencia, Valencia, Spain); Gómez-Domínguez, María Teresa (Department of Educational Psychology and Special Educational Needs, Faculty of Psychology, Teaching and Educational Sciences, Catholic University of Valencia, Valencia, Spain); Prado-Gascó, Vicente (Department of Social Psychology, Faculty of Psychology, University of Valencia, Valencia, Spain); Valero-Moreno, Selene (Department of Personality, Assessment and Psychological Treatments, Faculty of Psychology, University of Valencia, Valencia, Spain)","Gómez-Domínguez, María Teresa (Valencia Catholic University Saint Vincent Martyr)","Navarro-Mateu, Diego (Valencia Catholic University Saint Vincent Martyr); Alonso-Larza, Lucía (Valencia Catholic University Saint Vincent Martyr); Gómez-Domínguez, María Teresa (Valencia Catholic University Saint Vincent Martyr); Prado-Gascó, Vicente (University of Valencia); Valero-Moreno, Selene (University of Valencia)",37,18,2.65,8.93,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2020.00295/pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1125610911,52 Psychology; 5205 Social and Personality Psychology,

The use of immortalized cell lines simplifies procedures but only allows partial development through one round of parasite invasion and intracellular replication. We have assessed the suitability of Madin-Darby Bovine Kidney (MDBK) cells to support qualitative and quantitative studies on sporozoite invasion and intracellular development of Eimeria tenella. Analysis of parasite ultrastructure by transmission electron microscopy and serial block face-scanning electron microscopy proved the suitability of the system to generate good quality schizonts and first-generation merozoites. Parasite protein expression profiles elucidated by mass spectrometry corroborated previous findings occurring during the development of the parasite such as the presence of alternative types of surface antigen at different stages and increased abundance of proteins from secretory organelles during invasion and endogenous development. Quantitative PCR (qPCR) allowed the tracking of development by detecting DNA division, whereas reverse transcription qPCR of sporozoite- and merozoite-specific genes could detect early changes before cell division and after merozoite formation, respectively. These results correlated with the analysis of development using ImageJ semi-automated image analysis of fluorescent parasites, demonstrating the suitability and reproducibility of the MDBK culture system. This systems also allowed the evaluation of the effects on invasion and development when sporozoites were pre-incubated with anticoccidial drugs, showing similar effects to those reported before. We have described through this study a series of methods and assays for the further application of this in vitro culture model to more complex studies of Eimeria including basic research on parasite cell biology and host-parasite interactions and for screening anticoccidial drugs.",The authors wish to thank Dr. Louise Hughes (Oxford Brookes University) for operation of the SBF-SEM system.

However, the specific role of frontal structures in planning is unclear. We used a novel and ecological task, that allowed us to separate the planning period from the execution period. The spatio-temporal dynamics of EEG recordings showed that planning induced a progressive and sustained increase of frontal-midline theta activity (FMθ) over time. Source analyses indicated that this activity was generated within the prefrontal cortex. Theta activity from the right mid-Cingulate Cortex (MCC) and the left Anterior Cingulate Cortex (ACC) were correlated with an increase in the time needed for elaborating plans. On the other hand, left Frontopolar cortex (FP) theta activity exhibited a negative correlation with the time required for executing a plan. Since reaction times of planning execution correlated with correct responses, left FP theta activity might be associated with efficiency and accuracy in making a plan. Associations between theta activity from the right MCC and the left ACC with reaction times of the planning period may reflect high cognitive demand of the task, due to the engagement of attentional control and conflict monitoring implementation. In turn, the specific association between left FP theta activity and planning performance may reflect the participation of this brain region in successfully self-generated plans.","Acknowledgments This research was financially supported by the doctoral scholarship program Becas de Doctorado Nacional, año 2015 of CONICYT 21150295, by FONDECYT regular grant 1180932, and the Institut Universitaire de France (IUF).

However, little is known about the use of this methodology in the field and the ways in which mixed methods studies have been reported. The purpose of this methodological review was to examine the characteristics, methodological features and reporting quality of mixed methods articles published in palliative care research. The authors screened all articles published in eight journals specialized in palliative care between January 2014 and April 2019. Those that reported a mixed methods study (n = 159) were included. The Good Reporting of a Mixed Methods Study (GRAMMS) criteria were used to assess reporting quality. Findings showed that 57.9% of the identified studies used a convergent design and 82.4% mentioned complementarity as their main purpose for using a mixed methods approach. The reporting quality of the articles generally showed a need for improvement as authors usually did not describe the type of mixed methods design used and provided little detail on the integration of quantitative and qualitative methods. Based on the findings, recommendations are made to improve the quality of reporting of mixed methods articles in palliative care.",The authors would like to acknowledge the help of Dick Edelstein in editing the final manuscript.,"This review was carried out with the support of a José Castillejo Grant (JC2018-00273) from the Spanish Ministry of Education awarded to Sergi Fàbregues to visit the Mixed Methods Program (Department of Family Medicine, University of Michigan).

One of the main challenges the country faces today is the presence of a great number of mine tailings containing heavy metals, such as Cu, Cr, Ni, Zn, Pb, As, Cd, and Fe, which make up a potential risk for the population. This study is intended to develop a methodology for determining tailings requiring urgent treatment in Chile, based on risks associated with heavy metals. Geochemical data from 530 Chilean tailings were compared to the Dutch norm and the Canadian and Australian soil quality guidelines for residential use. Additionally, criteria about residents and water bodies were used, considering a 2-km area of influence around tailings. To do this, QGIS (Böschacherstrasse 10a CH-8624 Grüt (Gossau ZH),Zurich, Switzerland), a geospatial tool, was used to geolocate each deposit, considering regions, communes, rivers, lakes, and populated areas. To evaluate potential ecological contamination risks, Hakanson's methodology was used. Results revealed the presence of 12 critical tailings in Chile that require urgent treatment. From the 530 tailings evaluated, 195 are located at less than 2 km from a populated area and 154 at less than 2 km from a water body. In addition, 347 deposits require intervention: 30 on Cu, 30 on Cr, 13 on Zn, 69 on Pb, 138 on As, 1 on Cd, and 5 on Hg.","The authors are thankful to “Rapid Implementation Projects—Pilot Scaling”, Universidad Católica del Norte, Engineering Project 2030, 16ENl2-71940, for the financial support of this project.","This research was funded by “Rapid Implementation Projects—Pilot Scaling”, Universidad Católica del Norte, Engineering Project 2030, 16ENl2-71940.",International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health,,,"Australia; Canada; Chile; Environmental Monitoring; Metals, Heavy; Soil Pollutants; Switzerland",2020-06-01,2020,2020-06-02,2020-06-01,17,11,3948,All OA; Gold,Article,"Lam, Elizabeth J.; Montofré, Italo L.; Álvarez, Fernando A.; Gaete, Natalia F.; Poblete, Diego A.; Rojas, Rodrigo J.","Lam, Elizabeth J.

We present an archeological discovery and meta-analysis that challenge the man-the-hunter hypothesis. Excavations at the Andean highland site of Wilamaya Patjxa reveal a 9000-year-old human burial (WMP6) associated with a hunting toolkit of stone projectile points and animal processing tools. Osteological, proteomic, and isotopic analyses indicate that this early hunter was a young adult female who subsisted on terrestrial plants and animals. Analysis of Late Pleistocene and Early Holocene burial practices throughout the Americas situate WMP6 as the earliest and most secure hunter burial in a sample that includes 10 other females in statistical parity with early male hunter burials. The findings are consistent with nongendered labor practices in which early hunter-gatherer females were big-game hunters.","M. Aldenderfer (UC Merced), C. Darwent (UC Davis), L.

However, no evaluation has assessed cable cars' impact from a health perspective. TransMiCable in Bogotá, Colombia, provides a unique opportunity to (1) assess the effects of its implementation on the environmental and social determinants of health (microenvironment pollution, transport accessibility, physical environment, employment, social capital, and leisure time), physical activity, and health outcomes (health-related quality of life, respiratory diseases, and homicides); and (2) use citizen science methods to identify, prioritize, and communicate the most salient negative and positive features impacting health and quality of life in TransMiCable's area, as well as facilitate a consensus and advocacy-building change process among community members, policymakers, and academic researchers. Methods: TrUST (In Spanish: Transformaciones Urbanas y Salud: el caso de TransMiCable en Bogotá) is a quasi-experimental study using a mixed-methods approach. The intervention group includes adults from Ciudad Bolívar, the area of influence of TransMiCable. The control group includes adults from San Cristóbal, an area of future expansion for TransMiCable. A conceptual framework was developed through group-model building. Outcomes related to environmental and social determinants of health as well as health outcomes are assessed using questionnaires (health outcomes, physical activity, and perceptions), secondary data (crime and respiratory outcomes) use of portable devices (air pollution exposure and accelerometry), mobility tracking apps (for transport trajectories), and direct observation (parks). The Stanford Healthy Neighborhood Discovery Tool is being used to capture residents' perceptions of their physical and social environments as part of the citizen science component of the investigation. Discussion: TrUST is innovative in its use of a mixed-methods, and interdisciplinary research approach, and in its systematic engagement of citizens and policymakers throughout the design and evaluation process. This study will help to understand better how to maximize health benefits and minimize unintended negative consequences of TransMiCable.","We are grateful to Paola Martinez, Natalia Merchán, and Karen Fajardo for their work on data entry and data cleaning.

In addition, a snowball strategy was used. Literature reviews (LRs) of experimental and quasi-experimental studies were included. The identified interventions and outcomes were categorized based on the recommendation by the Cochrane group in “Effective Practice and Organization of Care”. The quality of the included LRs was evaluated using the AMSTAR 2 tool.ResultsFour thousand ninety-five articles were identified, of which 97 were included in the synthesis of evidence. Most of the studies included focused on the general population, vulnerable populations and minority populations. The subjects of general health and healthy lifestyles were the most commonly addressed. According to the classification of the type of intervention, the domain covered most was the delivery arrangements, followed by the domain of implementation strategies. The most frequent group of outcomes was the reported outcome in (clinical) patients, followed by social outcomes.ConclusionThe strategies that facilitate the reduction of health inequalities must be intersectoral and multidisciplinary in nature, including all sectors of the health system. It is essential to continue generating interventions focused on strengthening health systems in order to achieve adequate universal health coverage, with a process of comprehensive and quality care.",Not applicable.,FundingPan American Health Organization.

Methods: We compared the cognitive performance of 187 elderly subjects who were illiterate (controls n = 60; MCI n = 64; dementia n = 63). Neuropsychological measures included the RUDAS-PE, Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), INECO Frontal Screening (IFS), and Pfeffer Functional Activities Questionnaire (PFAQ). The results were compared to a neuropsychological evaluation (gold standard), including use of Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) scores. Results: We found a Cronbach's alpha was 0.65; Spearman's correlation coefficient was 0.79 (p < 0.01). The area under the receiver operating characteristics curve for the RUDAS to discriminate dementia from MCI was 98.0% with an optimal cut-off <19 (sensitivity 95%, specificity 97%); whereas, to differentiate MCI and controls was 98.0% with an optimal cut-off <23 (sensitivity 89%, specificity 93%).

The parasite infects macrophages where they can replicate intracellularly. Furthermore, they modulate host immune responses by using virulence factors (lipophosphoglycan, glycoprotein-63, and others) that promote survival inside the cells. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) released by parasites are important for cell-cell communication in the proinflammatory milieu modulating the establishment of infection. However, information on the ability of EVs from different Leishmania species to modulate inflammatory responses is scarce, especially from those species causing different clinical manifestations (visceral vs. cutaneous). The purpose of this study was to compare macrophage activation using EVs from three Leishmania species from New World including L. infantum, L. braziliensis, and L. amazonensis. EVs were released from promastigote forms, purified by ultracentrifugation and quantitated by Nanoparticle Tracking Analysis (NTA) prior to murine macrophage exposure. NTA analysis did not show any differences in the EV sizes among the strains. EVs from L. braziliensis and L. infantum failed to induce a pro-inflammatory response. EVs from both L. infantum WT and LPG-deficient mutant (LPG-KO) did not show any differences in their interaction with macrophages, suggesting that LPG solely was not determinant for activation. On the other hand, EVs from L. amazonensis were immunomodulatory inducing NO, TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-10 via TLR4 and TLR2. To determine whether such activation was related to NF-κB p65 translocation, THP-1 macrophage cells were exposed to EVs. In the same way, only EVs from L. amazonensis exhibited a highly percentage of cells positive for NF-κB. Our results suggest an important role of EVs in determining the pattern of immune response depending on the parasite species. For L. infantum, LPG was not determinant for the activation.",,"Funding.

With this work it is intended to establish the background of the instrumentation and control methods of automatic wheelchairs and prototypes, as well as a classification in each category. To this end a search of specialised databases was carried out for articles published between 2012 and 2019. Out of these, 97 documents were selected based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria. The following categories were proposed for these articles: (a) wheelchair instrumentation and control methods, among which there are systems that implement micro-electromechanical sensors (MEMS), surface electromyography (sEMG), electrooculography (EOG), electroencephalography (EEG), and voice recognition systems; (b) wheelchair instrumentation, among which are found obstacle detection systems, artificial vision (image and video), as well as navigation systems (GPS and GSM). The results found in this review tend towards the use of EEG signals, head movements, voice commands, and algorithms to avoid obstacles. The most used techniques involve the use of a classic control and thresholding to move the wheelchair. In addition, the discussion was mainly based on the characteristics of the user and the types of control.

Various applications arise daily in order to improve the quality of life and to promote an improvement in the treatments of patients at home that suffer from different pathologies. That is why there has emerged a line of work of great interest, focused on the study and analysis of daily life activities, on the use of different data analysis techniques to identify and to help manage this type of patient. This article shows the result of the systematic review of the literature on the use of the Clustering method, which is one of the most used techniques in the analysis of unsupervised data applied to activities of daily living, as well as the description of variables of high importance as a year of publication, type of article, most used algorithms, types of dataset used, and metrics implemented. These data will allow the reader to locate the recent results of the application of this technique to a particular area of knowledge.",This work was partially supported from the REMIND Project from the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation program under the Marie Skłodowska-Curie grant agreement No. 734355.,European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation program under the Marie Skłodowska-Curie grant agreement No. 734355.,Sensors,,,Activities of Daily Living; Algorithms; Cluster Analysis; Humans; Quality of Life,2020-05-09,2020,2020-05-09,,20,9,2702,All OA; Gold,Article,"Colpas, Paola Ariza; Vicario, Enrico; De-La-Hoz-Franco, Emiro; Pineres-Melo, Marlon; Oviedo-Carrascal, Ana; Patara, Fulvio","Colpas, Paola Ariza (Department of Computer Science and Electronics, Universidad de la Costa CUC, Barranquilla 080002, Colombia;, edelahoz@cuc.edu.co); Vicario, Enrico (Department of Information Engineering, University of Florence, 50139 Firenze, Italy;, enrico.vicario@unifi.it); De-La-Hoz-Franco, Emiro (Department of Computer Science and Electronics, Universidad de la Costa CUC, Barranquilla 080002, Colombia;, edelahoz@cuc.edu.co); Pineres-Melo, Marlon (Department of Systems Engineering, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla 081001, Colombia;, pineresm@uninorte.edu.co); Oviedo-Carrascal, Ana (Faculty of Engineering in Information and Communication Technologies, Universidad Pontificia Bolivariana, Medellín 050031, Colombia;, ana.oviedo@upb.edu.co); Patara, Fulvio (Department of Information Engineering, University of Florence, 50139 Firenze, Italy;, enrico.vicario@unifi.it)","Colpas, Paola Ariza (University of the Coast); Patara, Fulvio (University of Florence)","Colpas, Paola Ariza (University of the Coast); Vicario, Enrico (University of Florence); De-La-Hoz-Franco, Emiro (University of the Coast); Pineres-Melo, Marlon (Universidad del Norte); Oviedo-Carrascal, Ana (Pontifical Bolivarian University); Patara, Fulvio (University of Florence)",42,21,1.79,11.23,https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/20/9/2702/pdf?version=1589276531,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1127533640,46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4605 Data Management and Data Science,

Study protocol, recruitment and selected baseline data","OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects of early management of hyperglycaemia with antidiabetic drugs plus lifestyle intervention compared with lifestyle alone, on microvascular function in adults with pre-diabetes.
METHODS: Trial design: International, multicenter, randomised, partially double-blind, placebo-controlled, clinical trial.
PARTICIPANTS: Males and females aged 45-74 years with IFG, IGT or IFG+IGT, recruited from primary care centres in Australia, Austria, Bulgaria, Greece, Kuwait, Poland, Serbia, Spain and Turkey.
INTERVENTION: Participants were randomized to placebo; metformin 1.700 mg/day; linagliptin 5 mg/day or fixed-dose combination of linagliptin/metformin. All patients were enrolled in a lifestyle intervention program (diet and physical activity). Drug intervention will last 2 years. Primary Outcome: composite end-point of diabetic retinopathy estimated by the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study Score, urinary albumin to creatinine ratio, and skin conductance in feet estimated by the sudomotor index. Secondary outcomes in a subsample include insulin sensitivity, beta-cell function, biomarkers of inflammation and fatty liver disease, quality of life, cognitive function, depressive symptoms and endothelial function.
RESULTS: One thousand three hundred ninety one individuals with hyperglycaemia were assessed for eligibility, 424 excluded after screening, 967 allocated to placebo, metformin, linagliptin or to fixed-dose combination of metformin + linagliptin. A total of 809 people (91.1%) accepted and initiated the assigned treatment. Study sample after randomization was well balanced among the four groups. No statistical differences for the main risk factors analysed were observed between those accepting or rejecting treatment initiation. At baseline prevalence of diabetic retinopathy was 4.2%, severe neuropathy 5.3% and nephropathy 5.7%.
CONCLUSIONS: ePREDICE is the first -randomized clinical trial with the aim to assess effects of different interventions (lifestyle and pharmacological) on microvascular function in people with pre-diabetes. The trial will provide novel data on lifestyle modification combined with glucose lowering drugs for the prevention of early microvascular complications and diabetes.

These studies, coming from different lines of research, have proposed diverse explanatory mechanisms to explain the positive social and psychological effects of collective gatherings. In the present article, we focus on one of these mechanisms, known as collective effervescence, emotional communion, emotional entrainment, or perceived emotional synchrony (PES). First, we briefly discuss current conceptions of the emotional states and experience during collective gatherings and what they bring to the definition of PES. We close this point by proposing an integrative definition of PES. Second, structural validity of the original PES scale is examined. Third, incremental validity of PES is examined in two longitudinal studies, particularly with respect to well-being. Finally, we propose an integrative short form of the PES Scale, which measures antecedents and behavioral effects of collective effervescence.",We wish to express our deepest appreciation to all participants.,"Funding.

Lack of appropriately trained personnel is a major contributor to the gap in access to wheelchairs. Assistive technology provision is one of the core competencies of occupational therapists. The goal of this study was to assess the current wheelchair provision knowledge of final year occupational therapy students in Colombia as measured by the International Society of Wheelchair Professionals Basic Wheelchair Service Knowledge Test. A total of 83 students from 7 universities took the test. None of the students met the 70% passing threshold. The highest scores were in the assessment domain while the lowest in the fitting and user training domains. These results suggest that the current wheelchair provision education received in these programs do not meet the World Health Organization guidelines on appropriate wheelchair provision. The implementation of strategies to improve current wheelchair provision education in Colombian occupational therapy programs is granted.","The International Society of Wheelchair Professionals provided the test at no cost to students or universities, which was possible thanks to a partnership between the University of Pittsburgh and the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) through a multi-year, $2.3 million sub-award. This award aims to develop the new International Society of Wheelchair Professionals, a global network to help professionalize the wheelchair sector through advocacy, standards, research, and training.

Mental health problems in youth often continue into adulthood if not diagnosed or treated in time.MethodsThe Sistema de Evaluación de Niños y Adolescentes (SENA) [Child and Adolescent Evaluation System] was used to evaluate mental health indicators in a sample of students in Northern Chile. Two age-appropriate versions of the assessment were applied to a total sample of 5043 students, which included an elementary education sample of 1953 schoolchildren from fourth grade through sixth grade (ages 8 to 13 years), and a Secondary School sample of 3090 schoolchildren from seventh grade (the last year of elementary school) through the last year of Secondary school (senior high school) (ages 12 to 19 years). For each group, the version of the assessment used was determined by the students’ grade level. Both samples included municipal, government-subsidized, and private schools.ResultsIn this student population, depression, anxiety, and behavioral disorders were the main mental health problems identified, and indicators revealed a progressive increase in cases over the years, coinciding with the global epidemiological scenario. Males showed a greater presence of externalizing behaviors related to mental health problems associated with aggression and defiant behavior. However, females showed the highest number of mental health issues overall, especially regarding problems related to internalization. There are significant differences between school types.ConclusionsOur sample population analysis indicates that early intervention is necessary for the diagnosis and treatment of youth, with the goal of reducing the probability that psychiatric disorders will be prolonged, evolving, and worsening in adulthood.","We kindly acknowledge all the children and adolescents, parents, teachers and schools that participated in this study.",This research was funded by ANID PIA CIE160007.

Many bacterial pathogens have been identified but the L. vannamei microbiota is still poorly known. Using a next-generation sequencing (NGS) approach, this work evaluated the impact of the inclusion in the diet of mannan oligosaccharide, (MOS, 0.5% w/w), over the L. vannamei microbiota and production behavior of L. vannamei under intensive cultivation in Ecuador. The MOS supplementation lasted for 60 days, after which the shrimp in the ponds were harvested, and the production data were collected. MOS improved productivity outcomes by increasing shrimp survival by 30%. NGS revealed quantitative differences in the shrimp microbiota between MOS and control conditions. In the treatment with inclusion of dietary MOS, the predominant phylum was Actinobacteria (28%); while the control group was dominated by the phylum Proteobacteria (30%). MOS has also been linked to an increased prevalence of Lactococcus- and Verrucomicrobiaceae-like bacteria. Furthermore, under the treatment of MOS, the prevalence of potential opportunistic pathogens, like Vibrio, Aeromonas, Bergeyella and Shewanella, was negligible. This may be attributable to MOS blocking the adhesion of pathogens to the surfaces of the host tissues. Together, these findings point to the fact that the performance (survival) improvements of the dietary MOS may be linked to the impact on the microbiota, since bacterial lines with pathogenic potential towards shrimps were excluded in the gut.",The authors wish to thank SENESCYT Ecuador for their contribution (O.G. fellowship) and also to Avila owners of the shrimp farm.

RTT is commonly associated with neurological regression, autistic features, motor control impairment, seizures, loss of speech and purposeful hand movements, mainly affecting females. Different animal and cellular model systems have tremendously contributed to our current knowledge about MeCP2 and RTT. However, the majority of these findings remain unexamined in the brain of RTT patients. Based on previous studies in rodent brains, the highly conserved neuronal microRNA ""miR132"" was suggested to be an inhibitor of MeCP2 expression. The neuronal miR132 itself is induced by Brain Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF), a neurotransmitter modulator, which in turn is controlled by MeCP2. This makes the basis of the MECP2-BDNF-miR132 feedback regulatory loop in the brain. Here, we studied the components of this feedback regulatory network in humans, and its possible impairment in the brain of RTT patients. In this regard, we evaluated the transcript and protein levels of MECP2/MeCP2E1 and E2 isoforms, BDNF/BDNF, and miR132 (both 3p and 5p strands) by real time RT-PCR, Western blot, and ELISA in four different regions of the human RTT brains and their age-, post-mortem delay-, and sex-matched controls. The transcript level of the studied elements was significantly compromised in RTT patients, even though the change was not identical in different parts of the brain. Our data indicates that MeCP2E1/E2-BDNF protein levels did not follow their corresponding transcript trends. Correlational studies suggested that the MECP2E1/E2-BDNF-miR132 homeostasis regulation might not be similarly controlled in different parts of the human brain. Despite challenges in evaluating autopsy samples in rare diseases, our findings would help to shed some light on RTT pathobiology, and obscurities caused by limited studies on MeCP2 regulation in the human brain.","Tissue samples and related data for R255X and frozen control tissues were obtained from the “University of Maryland Brain and Tissue Bank, which is a Brain and Tissue Repository of the NIH Biobank (at NIH NeuroBioBank Program: neurobiobank.nih.gov).

Naturalistic driving studies (NDS) emerged as one of the most sophisticated methodologies to investigate driver behavior; however, NDS have not been implemented in low- or middle-income countries. The aim of this research is to investigate MPU while driving and compare the results to those reported in international studies. An analysis of 61.32 h and 1350 km driven in Curitiba (Brazil) showed that MPU lasted for an average of 28.51 s (n = 627) and occurred in 58.71% of trips (n = 201) with an average frequency of 8.37 interactions per hour (n = 201). The proportion of the trip time using a mobile phone was 7.03% (n = 201), and the average instantaneous speed was 12.77 km/h (n = 627) while using the phone. Generally, drivers spent less time on more complex interactions and selected a lower speed when using the phone. MPU was observed more during short duration than longer trips. Drivers in this study engaged in a larger number of MPU compared to drivers from Netherlands and the United States; and the percentage of trip time with MPU was between North American and European values.","The authors would like to thank the video monitoring team for the detailed information provided, Magaly Natália Pazzian Vasconcellos Romão for leading the focus group session and Anabela dos Santos Aleixo Simões for the participation during the research project conception.","This research was funded by the National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq, Brazil)/MCTIC/CNPq N°. 28/2018, Universal/Faixa A, by the Coordination for the Improvement of Higher Education Personnel (CAPES)/Finance Code 001 and by the National Observatory for Road Safety (ONSV) under the Technical Cooperation Agreement with the Federal University of Parana.

These demonstrations can be viewed as collective rituals and thus focus attention on the processes that facilitate different psychosocial effects. This work aims to explore the mechanisms (i.e., behavioral and attentional synchrony, perceived emotional synchrony, and positive and transcendent emotions) involved in participation in the demonstrations of 8 March 2020, collective and ritualized feminist actions, and their correlates associated with personal well-being (i.e., affective well-being and beliefs of personal growth) and collective well-being (i.e., social integration variables: situated identity, solidarity and fusion), collective efficacy and collective growth, and behavioral intention to support the fight for women's rights. To this end, a cross-cultural study was conducted with the participation of 2,854 people (age 18-79; M = 30.55; SD = 11.66) from countries in Latin America (Mexico, Chile, Argentina, Brazil, Peru, Colombia, and Ecuador) and Europe (Spain and Portugal), with a retrospective correlational cross-sectional design and a convenience sample. Participants were divided between demonstration participants (n = 1,271; 94.0% female) and non-demonstrators or followers who monitored participants through the media and social networks (n = 1,583; 75.87% female). Compared with non-demonstrators and with males, female and non-binary gender respondents had greater scores in mechanisms and criterion variables. Further random-effects model meta-analyses revealed that the perceived emotional synchrony was consistently associated with more proximal mechanisms, as well as with criterion variables. Finally, sequential moderation analyses showed that proposed mechanisms successfully mediated the effects of participation on every criterion variable. These results indicate that participation in 8M marches and demonstrations can be analyzed through the literature on collective rituals. As such, collective participation implies positive outcomes both individually and collectively, which are further reinforced through key psychological mechanisms, in line with a Durkheimian approach to collective rituals.","We wish to express our deepest appreciation to all the participants in this study.

Here we investigated the effects of cells of L. ferriphilum on biofilm formation and leaching performance by S. thermosulfidooxidans. The effects were caused by the presence of L. ferriphilum or an addition of pyrite leach liquor from L. ferriphilum. Data show that the number of attached S. thermosulfidooxidans on pyrite increases, if the pyrite had been pre-colonized by living biofilms of L. ferriphilum, while it decreases if the pre-colonized biofilms had been inactivated. Coaggregation between S. thermosulfidooxidans and L. ferriphilum occurs during the dual-species biofilm formation, but different effects on bioleaching were noted, if the preculture of L. ferriphilum had been different. If L. ferriphilum had been pre-colonized on a pyrite, significantly negative effect was shown. However, if the two species were simultaneously inoculated into a sterile leaching system, the bioleaching efficiency was better than that of a pure culture of S. thermosulfidooxidans. The effect might be related to a metabolic preference of S. thermosulfidooxidans. If S. thermosulfidooxidans performed leaching in a filtered pyrite leachate from L. ferriphilum, the cells preferred to oxidize RISCs instead of ferrous ion and the number of attached cells decreased compared with the control. This study gives an indication that in a short-term multi-species leaching system the role of S. thermosufidooxidans may be related to the time of its introduction.",,"Funding.

Given their harmful effects, this study had two aims; first, to evaluate the effect of cumulative or chronic exposure to OP/CB pesticides on the neurobehavioral performance of agricultural workers and rural inhabitants; second, to determine if changes in the neurobehavioral performance are associated to changes in blood biomarkers of OP/CB pesticides during the spray season, when exposure is higher.MethodsFor the first aim, a cross sectional study of neurobehavioral performance in adult volunteers (men and women, 18–50 years-old, right-handed) was carried out in the pre-spray season. Sampling was done by convenience and a questionnaire was used to categorize participants depending on their level of chronic exposure, as either: occupationally exposed (OE, n = 87), environmentally exposed (EE, n = 81), or non-exposed controls or reference group (RG, n = 100). A neurobehavioral test battery consisting of 21 tests to measure cognitive, motor and emotional state was applied. For the second aim, neurobehavioral measures were taken a second time from EE and OE groups during the spray season, and their exposure corroborated by blood-based biomarker inhibition.ResultsLower neurobehavioral performance was observed in the pre-spray evaluation of EE and OE groups compared to the non-exposed, OE being the worst performing group. Seasonal exposure impaired performance in both exposure groups on all tests except those on attention and mood. Data modeling of the basal (pre-spray) measurements showed that the level of exposure was the best predictor of performance. During spraying, inhibition of BChE activity in the EE group was the best predictor of low performance in tests measuring logical, auditory and visual memory, inhibitory control of cognitive interference, constructional and planning abilities, executive functions, and motor speed and coordination.ConclusionLong-term occupational or environmental exposure to pesticides caused impairment in neurobehavioral functioning, which worsened during the spraying season, mainly in EE. BChE inhibition was the best predictor for seasonal neurobehavioral changes in EE.","The authors thank the Department of Occupational Health of the Institute of Public Health of Chile (ISP) for supporting this research.

Follicular growth is determined by granulosa cells (GCs), theca cells (TCs), and oocyte at the transcription, translation, and secretion levels. With the development of bioinformatic and experimental techniques, non-coding RNAs have been shown to participate in many life events. In this study, we investigated the transcriptomes of GCs and TCs in three different physiological stages: small yellow follicle (SYF), smallest hierarchical follicle (F6), and largest hierarchical follicle (F1) stages. A differential expression (DE) analysis, weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA), and bioinformatic analyses were performed. A total of 18,016 novel circular RNAs (circRNAs) were detected in GCs and TCs, 8127 of which were abundantly expressed in both cell types. and more circRNAs were differentially expressed between GCs and TCs than mRNAs. Enrichment analysis showed that the DE transcripts were mainly involved in cell growth, proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. In the WGCNA analysis, we identified six specific modules that were related to the different cell types in different stages of development. A series of central hub genes, including MAPK1, CITED4, SOD2, STC1, MOS, GDF9, MDH1, CAPN2, and novel_circ0004730, were incorporated into a Cytoscape network. Notably, using both DE analysis and WGCNA, ESR1 was identified as a key gene during follicular development. Our results provide valuable information on the circRNAs involved in follicle development and identify potential genes for further research to determine their roles in the regulation of different biological processes during follicle growth.",We would like to thank the help of data analysis from colleague of Jiangsu Institute of Poultry Science.,"Funding.

Treatment is largely comprised of platinum-based chemotherapy; however, patients progressing after initial chemotherapy have a median overall survival (OS) of less than 6 months. Based on a high percentage of PD-L1 expression in patients with PSCC, and its biological similarities to other squamous cell carcinomas, we present two patient cases treated with pembrolizumab with extraordinary durable treatment response far beyond treatment with standard therapy.
MAIN BODY: The first patient is a 64 year old male with PSCC who was treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy, partial penectomy, and adjuvant radiation prior to developing metastatic disease. He had a high TMB (14 mutations/Mb) and was started on pembrolizumab with a complete response, which has been maintained for 38 months. The second patient is an 85 year old male with PSCC who was treated with partial penectomy and adjuvant chemotherapy and radiation prior to developing metastatic disease. He had positive PD-L1 expression CPS 130) and was started on pembrolizumab with a partial response, which has been maintained for 18 months after starting treatment.
CONCLUSIONS: These two cases of extreme durable response with pembrolizumab (with molecular data including TMB and PD-L1 status) represent a significant clinical benefit in this patient population. With limited treatment options that result in a median OS of less than 6 months, along with the toxicity profile of chemotherapy which may not be tolerated in elderly patients with comorbidities, this survival benefit with pembrolizumab, along with advances in tumor sequencing and clinical trials shows that there is a potentially significant benefit with novel therapies in this patient population.",,,Frontiers in Oncology,,,,2020-12-23,2020,2020-12-23,,10,,615298,All OA; Gold,Article,"Chahoud, Jad; Skelton, William Paul; Spiess, Philippe E.; Walko, Christine; Dhillon, Jasreman; Gage, Kenneth L.; Johnstone, Peter A.

The literature advises studies that include objective markers along with clinical assessment in order to improve the sensitivity and specificity of current diagnostic criteria. The decrease of muscle quality precedes the loss of quantity, so we studied the role magnetic resonance imaging biomarkers as indicators of the quantity and quality of muscle in sarcopenia patients.
METHODS: a cross-sectional analysis was performed to analyze what MR-derived imaging parameters correlate better with sarcopenia diagnostic criteria in women of 70 years of age and over (independent walking and community-dwelling women who were sarcopenic in accordance with EWGSOP criteria with muscle mass adjusted to Spanish population were chosen).
RESULTS: The study included 26 women; 81 ± 8 years old. A strong correlation was obtained between cineanthropometric variables (BMI; thigh perimeter and fat mass) and imaging biomarkers (muscle/fat ratio, fatty infiltration, muscle T2*, water diffusion coefficient, and proton density fat fraction) with coefficients around 0.7 (absolute value).
CONCLUSIONS: Knowing the correlation of clinical parameters and imaging-derived muscle quality indicators can help to identify older women at risk of developing sarcopenia at an early stage. This may allow taking preventive actions to decrease disability, morbidity, and mortality in sarcopenia patients.",The authors would like to thank all of the participants in this research and the Universidad Católica de Valencia “San Vicente Mártir” for its support.,This work was supported by a grant from Universidad Católica de Valencia San Vicente Mártir (grant number 2018-158-002) to APM.

Defining spatial units that consider transmission heterogeneity, human movement and migration will help to set up achievable malaria elimination milestones and guide the creation of efficient operational administrative control units. Using a combination of genetic and epidemiological data we defined a malaria transmission unit as the area contributing 95% of malaria cases diagnosed at the catchment facility located in the town of Guapi in the South Pacific Coast of Colombia. We provide data showing that P. falciparum malaria transmission is heterogeneous in time and space and analysed, using topological data analysis, the spatial connectivity, at the micro epidemiological level, between parasite populations circulating within the unit. To illustrate the necessity to evaluate the efficacy of malaria control measures within the transmission unit in order to increase the efficiency of the malaria control effort, we provide information on the size of the asymptomatic reservoir, the nature of parasite genotypes associated with drug resistance as well as the frequency of the Pfhrp2/3 deletion associated with false negatives when using Rapid Diagnostic Tests.","This work received financial support from Newton-Caldas Fund Institutional Links G1854 Award to JCR and VC.

This form of agriculture has also lacked efficient regulations and surveillance, so it is difficult to estimate the real magnitude of the exposed population and its effects on health in the short or long term. This systematic review compiles the epidemiological evidence generated from studies conducted in several regions of Chile regarding pesticide exposure and health effects. Of the total number of articles, 50% included agricultural workers, 25% children, and 25% women of childbearing age, with the greatest effects being the neurotoxic (54%), genotoxic (31%) and reproductive (15%). The evidence collected shows that in Chile the levels of exposure to pesticides in the general and occupational population are higher than international studies levels. It is urgent to protect the health of both the occupational and general population and especially children through a stricter control of the sale and use of pesticides, with comprehensive surveillance systems in environmental health and educational actions in the social and cultural context of rural communities. It is a priority to strengthen research with national relevance on health effects, and strictly restrict the use of pesticides already prohibited in developed countries due to their high level of risk to human and environmental health.",,,Gaceta Sanitaria,,,Child; Chile; Decision Making; Environmental Exposure; Farmers; Female; Humans; Male; Occupational Exposure; Pesticides; Population Health,2020-07-16,2020,2020-07-16,2021-09,35,5,480-487,All OA; Gold,Article,"Zúñiga-Venegas, Liliana; Saracini, Chiara; Pancetti, Floria; Muñoz-Quezada, María Teresa; Lucero, Boris; Foerster, Claudia; Cortés, Sandra","Zúñiga-Venegas, Liliana (Centro de Investigación en Estudios Avanzados del Maule (CIEAM), Universidad Católica del Maule, Talca, Chile; Centro de Investigaciones en Neuropsicología y Neurociencias Cognitivas (CINPSI-Neurocog), Facultad de Ciencias de la Salud, Universidad Católica del Maule, Talca, Chile.); Saracini, Chiara (Centro de Investigación en Estudios Avanzados del Maule (CIEAM), Universidad Católica del Maule, Talca, Chile; Centro de Investigaciones en Neuropsicología y Neurociencias Cognitivas (CINPSI-Neurocog), Facultad de Ciencias de la Salud, Universidad Católica del Maule, Talca, Chile.); Pancetti, Floria (Laboratorio de Neurotoxicología Ambiental, Facultad de Medicina, Universidad Católica del Norte, Coquimbo, Chile.); Muñoz-Quezada, María Teresa (Centro de Investigaciones en Neuropsicología y Neurociencias Cognitivas (CINPSI-Neurocog), Facultad de Ciencias de la Salud, Universidad Católica del Maule, Talca, Chile.); Lucero, Boris (Centro de Investigaciones en Neuropsicología y Neurociencias Cognitivas (CINPSI-Neurocog), Facultad de Ciencias de la Salud, Universidad Católica del Maule, Talca, Chile.); Foerster, Claudia (Instituto de Ciencias Agronómicas y Veterinarias, Universidad de O'Higgins, San Fernando, Chile.); Cortés, Sandra (Advanced Center for Chronic Diseases (ACCDiS), Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile, Santiago, Chile; Centro de Desarrollo Urbano Sustentable (CEDEUS), Santiago, Chile; Departamento de Salud Pública, Escuela de Medicina, Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile, Santiago, Chile.

Myasis has been reported most commonly in tropical and subtropical areas around the world with poor sanitation and presence of cattle. Neonatal umbilical myiasis is an important cause of death in bovines and produces major economic losses in the livestock industry. However, its presentation in humans is rare, with a few cases reported worldwide. Moreover, umbilical myasis can be life-treating due to the risk of larvae migration to deeper tissues of the abdomen, omphalitis, and sepsis. We describe the case of a 7-day-old infant admitted to the hospital due to umbilical cord myiasis. In total, 55 larvae were removed from the wound and identified as Cochliomyia hominivorax. The patient recovered satisfactorily after treatment with ivermectin and amoxicillin. A literature search was performed in Pubmed, Medline, Lilacs and Google Scholar, with 64 cases of myasis by C. hominivorax being reviewed. Oral cavity, wounds, scalp and natural orifices are the main affected anatomical areas. Risk factors include the extremes of age, male sex, poor hygiene, alcohol and drug use, cancer, and mental disability. Programs for human myiasis prevention and surveillance are needed in neotropical areas where living conditions make it difficult to implement control strategies.",,,Frontiers in Medicine,,,,2020-01-22,2020,2020-01-22,,6,,292,All OA; Gold,Article,"Ruiz-Zapata, Juan David; Figueroa-Gutiérrez, Luis Mauricio; Mesa-Franco, Jaime Alberto; Moreno-Gutierrez, Paula Andrea","Ruiz-Zapata, Juan David (Faculty of Health Sciences, Universidad Tecnológica de Pereira, Pereira, Colombia); Figueroa-Gutiérrez, Luis Mauricio (Faculty of Health Sciences, Universidad Tecnológica de Pereira, Pereira, Colombia); Mesa-Franco, Jaime Alberto (Faculty of Health Sciences, Universidad Tecnológica de Pereira, Pereira, Colombia); Moreno-Gutierrez, Paula Andrea (Grupo de Investigación en Biomedicina, Fundación Universitaria Autónoma de las Américas, Pereira, Colombia)","Moreno-Gutierrez, Paula Andrea (Fundación Universitaria Autónoma De Las Américas)","Ruiz-Zapata, Juan David (Technological University of Pereira); Figueroa-Gutiérrez, Luis Mauricio (Technological University of Pereira); Mesa-Franco, Jaime Alberto (Technological University of Pereira); Moreno-Gutierrez, Paula Andrea (Fundación Universitaria Autónoma De Las Américas)",10,3,1.31,,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmed.2019.00292/pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1124219475,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences,3 Good Health and Well Being

One of the affected resources is the scallop Argopecten purpuratus. Even though this species has a high commercial importance in Northern Chile and Peru, the characteristics of its DA depuration are not known. In this work, the DA depuration was studied by means of two experiments: one in controlled (laboratory) and another in natural conditions. All organs of A. purpuratus depurated the toxin very quickly in both experiments. In some organs, an increase or a very small decrease of toxin was detected in the early depuration steps. Several models were used to describe this kinetics. The one that included toxin transfer between organs and independent depuration from each organ was the model that best fit the data. It seems, therefore, that the DA in this species is quickly transferred from the digestive gland to all other organs, which release it into the environment. Physiological differences in the two experiments have been shown to have some effect on the depuration from each organ but the actual reasons are still unknown.",We have to acknowledge to Christian Tapia and Pamela Tapia (Invertec Ostimar Company) for their support.,"This research was funded by the “ANID + FONDEF/PRIMER CONCURSO INVESTIGACIÓN TECNOLÓGICA TEMATICO EN SISTEMAS PESQUERO ACUICOLAS FRENTE A FLORECIMIENTOS ALGALES NOCIVOS FANS IDeA DEL FONDO DE FOMENTO AL DESARROLLO CIENTÍFICO Y TECNOLÓGICO, FONDEF/ANID 2017, IT17F10002 developed within the framework of a cooperation agreement between the Consellería do Mar, Xunta de Galicia, Spain and the Universidad Católica del Norte, Chile.

We searched PubMed, Scopus, Embase, Lilacs, and IsiWeb for case-reports, case-series, or cohorts of CHIK-F reporting at least one death, up to December 2019. Fifty-seven reports were analyzed, including 2140 deaths. Data about specific clinical events that precede death are scarce. The central tendency of time between disease onset and death ranged from 2 days to 150 days. The most common clinical findings among decedents were fever (22.0%), arthralgia (15.7%), myalgia (10.7%), and headache (8.2%). Excluding pediatric populations, the reported central tendency of age among the decedents was 53 or older, with a non-weighted median of 67, ranging up to 80 years old. Authors mentioned organic dysfunction in 91.2% reports. Among all the 2140 decedents, the most common dysfunctions were cardiovascular (7.2%), respiratory (6.4%), neurological (5.4%), renal (4.2%), liver (3.0%), and hematological (1.3%) dysfunction.

Confirmatory factor analyses replicated the two-dimensional structure of the ECR and its invariance across gender. Results also supported the reliability and concurrent validity of our brief Spanish version of the ECR (i.e., Spanish ECR-12), by its association with measures of emotion regulation, dyadic empathy, psychological distress and well-being, and relationship satisfaction.

T. gondii can infect any warm-blooded animal in its asexual cycle; however, its sexual cycle is restricted to felines. Eimeria spp. are usually restricted to one host species, and their whole life cycle is completed within this same host. The literature reviewed in this article comprises the recent findings regarding the unique biology of the sexual development of T. gondii and Eimeria spp. The molecular basis of sex in these pathogens has been significantly unraveled by new findings in parasite differentiation along with transcriptional analysis of T. gondii and Eimeria spp. pre-sexual and sexual stages. Focusing on the metabolic networks, analysis of these transcriptome datasets shows enrichment for several different metabolic pathways. Transcripts for glycolysis enzymes are consistently more abundant in T. gondii cat infection stages than the asexual tachyzoite stage and Eimeria spp. merozoite and gamete stages compared to sporozoites. Recent breakthroughs in host-pathogen interaction and host restriction have significantly expanded the understating of the unique biology of these pathogens.

H-02-3 Reveals the Presence of Heavy Metal and Antibiotic Resistance Determinants,"Nuclear production and industrial activities led to widespread contamination of the Department of Energy (DOE) managed Savannah River Site (SRS), located in South Carolina, United States. The H-02 wetland system was constructed in 2007 for the treatment of industrial and storm water runoff from the SRS Tritium Facility. Albeit at low levels, mercury (Hg) has been detected in the soils of the H-02 wetland ecosystem. In anoxic sediments, Hg is typically methylated by anaerobic microbiota, forming the highly neurotoxic methylmercury (MeHg), which biomagnifies across food webs. However, in surficial oxic wetland soils, microbially mediated demethylation and/or volatilization processes can transform Hg2+ into the less toxic Hg0 form which is released into the atmosphere, thus circumventing MeHg formation. To obtain a deeper understanding on bacterial Hg volatilization, a robust Hg-resistant (HgR) bacteria, called as strain H-02-3 was isolated from the H-02 soils. A draft genome sequence of this strain was obtained at a coverage of 700×, which assembled in 44 contigs with an N50 of 171,569 bp. The genomic size of the strain H-02-3 was 4,708,612 bp with a total number of 4,240 genes; phylogenomic analysis revealed the strain as an Arthrobacter species. Comparative genomics revealed the presence of 1100 unique genes in strain H-02-3, representing 26.7% of the total genome; many identified previously as metal resistance genes (MRGs). Specific to Hg-cycling, the presence of mercuric ion reductase (merA), the organomercurial lyase (merB), and the mercuric resistance operon regulatory protein, were identified. By inference, it can be proposed that the organomercurial lyase facilitates the demethylation of MeHg into Hg2+ which is then reduced to Hg0 by MerA in strain H-02-3. Furthermore, gene prediction using resistome analysis of strain H-02-3 revealed the presence of several antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs), that statistically correlated with the presence of metal resistant genes (MRGs), suggesting co-occurrence patterns of MRGs and ARGs in the strain. Overall, this study delineates environmentally beneficial traits that likely facilitates survival of Arthrobacter sp. H-02-3 within the H-02 wetland soil. Finally, this study also highlights the largely ignored public health risk associated with the co-development of ARGs and MRGs in bacteria native to historically contaminated soils.","We acknowledge Drs.

This is the case of Flipped Classroom, which is based on a mixed approach between e-learning and face-to-face teaching, as well as gamification, which bases its didactic principles on the recreational components of the games. Within this context, the aim of this research is to observe what effect the application of Flipped Classroom and gamification has in the development of motivation, autonomy and self-regulation towards learning through a didactic unit on healthy habits and diet in 202 students of 6th grade of Primary School from four different schools (public and state-subsidized) in the city of Granada (Spain). For this purpose, a methodological design was used with pre-test and post-test to check the effects of the experience on the students. The findings obtained showed that the application of these methods promoted an increase in students' motivation, as well as in their autonomy and self-regulation when facing the contents of the subject. For this reason, it is advocated that there is a need to continue promoting a quality and innovative educational practice according to the figure of the student today.",To the researchers of the research group AREA (HUM-672) of the University of Granada.,This paper has been funded by the I+D+I Project Research of Results Transfer Office (OTRI) of the University of Granada (Reference: CNT4315).,Nutrients,,,"Child; Curriculum; Diet, Healthy; Emotional Regulation; Female; Healthy Lifestyle; Humans; Male; Motivation; Personal Autonomy; School Health Services; Spain; Students; Teaching; Video Games",2020-07-24,2020,2020-07-24,,12,8,2210,All OA; Gold,Article,"Gómez-García, Gerardo; Marín-Marín, José Antonio; Romero-Rodríguez, José-María; Ramos Navas-Parejo, Magdalena; Rodríguez Jiménez, Carmen","Gómez-García, Gerardo (Department of Didactics and Scholar Organization, University of Granada, 18071 Granada, Spain); Marín-Marín, José Antonio (Department of Didactics and Scholar Organization, University of Granada, 18071 Granada, Spain); Romero-Rodríguez, José-María (Department of Didactics and Scholar Organization, University of Granada, 18071 Granada, Spain); Ramos Navas-Parejo, Magdalena (Department of Didactics and Scholar Organization, University of Granada, 18071 Granada, Spain); Rodríguez Jiménez, Carmen (Department of Didactics and Scholar Organization, University of Granada, 18071 Granada, Spain)","Romero-Rodríguez, José-María (University of Granada)","Gómez-García, Gerardo (University of Granada); Marín-Marín, José Antonio (University of Granada); Romero-Rodríguez, José-María (University of Granada); Ramos Navas-Parejo, Magdalena (University of Granada); Rodríguez Jiménez, Carmen (University of Granada)",33,21,1.18,9.21,https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/12/8/2210/pdf?version=1595593962,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1129655805,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3202 Clinical Sciences; 3210 Nutrition and Dietetics; 42 Health Sciences; 4206 Public Health,4 Quality Education

Antimalarial therapies show little effectiveness to avoid neurological deficits and brain tissue alterations elicited by severe malaria. Melatonin is a well-recognized endogenous hormone involved in the control of brain functions and maintenance of blood-brain barrier integrity. The current study has evaluated the effect of melatonin on the histological alterations, blood-brain barrier leakage, and neurocognitive impairments in mice developing cerebral malaria. Swiss mice infected with Plasmodium berghei ANKA strain was used as cerebral malaria model. Melatonin treatment (5 and 10 mg/kg) was performed for four consecutive days after the infection, and data have shown an increased survival rate in infected mice treated with melatonin. It was also observed that melatonin treatment blocked brain edema and prevented the breakdown of blood-brain barrier induced by the Plasmodium infection. Furthermore, hematoxylin and eosin staining revealed that melatonin mitigates the histological alterations in Plasmodium-infected animals. Melatonin was also able to prevent motor and cognitive impairments in infected mice. Taken together, these results show for the first time that melatonin treatment prevents histological brain damages and neurocognitive alterations induced by cerebral malaria.",,"Funding.

It comprises a wide range of viruses, including herpes simplex virus, poliovirus, enteroviruses, parechovirus, West Nile virus, Japanese encephalitis virus, measles, and mumps viruses among others. Some of these viruses are highly neuroinvasive and neurovirulent, while others are weakly neuroinvasive and neurovirulent. Moreover, some of them, like herpes simplex viruses, are highly neuroinvasive but weakly neurovirulent for the peripheral nervous system and highly neurovirulent but weakly neuroinvasive for the central nervous system. All these disparities are a result of differences in their genomic constitution, associated vectors, geographical region, and environmental factors. Therefore, a successful intervention will be almost impossible without a clear understanding of the molecular biology and epidemiology of these viruses. Thus, we conducted a review of the published studies on the molecular biology and epidemiology of the common neurotropic viruses to make the viral genetic makeup more understandable for targeted intervention and provide the morbidity and mortality data of the different neurotropic viruses for more serious action.",,,Cureus,,,,2020-08-11,2020,2020-08-11,2020-08-11,12,8,e9674,All OA; Gold,Article,"Abdullahi, Abba Musa; Sarmast, Shah T; Singh, Romil","Abdullahi, Abba Musa (Neurology/Neuroscience, Hasiya Bayero Paediatric Hospital, Kano, NGA); Sarmast, Shah T (Neurology, California Institute of Behavioral Neurosciences & Psychology, Fairfield, USA); Singh, Romil (Internal Medicine, Metropolitan Hospital, Jaipur, IND)","Abdullahi, Abba Musa (Neurology/Neuroscience, Hasiya Bayero Paediatric Hospital, Kano, NGA)","Abdullahi, Abba Musa (Neurology/Neuroscience, Hasiya Bayero Paediatric Hospital, Kano, NGA); Sarmast, Shah T (California Institute of Behavioral Neurosciences and Psychology (United States)); Singh, Romil (Internal Medicine, Metropolitan Hospital, Jaipur, IND)",28,18,1.15,5.5,https://www.cureus.com/articles/24775-molecular-biology-and-epidemiology-of-neurotropic-viruses.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1130042937,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3207 Medical Microbiology,3 Good Health and Well Being

An exacerbated cutaneous inflammatory response is crucial for controlling parasite burden but can also promote tissue damage. This study aimed to characterize the populations of natural killer (NK), CD57+, CD4+, and CD8+ T cells, CD20+ B cells, as well as CD68+ macrophages, in biopsies of ulcerated CL lesions, and quantify the production of perforin+, grazyme B+, interleukin 1 beta (IL-1β+) and Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF-α+ cells). We then correlated these parameters with necrosis, inflammation and the number of amastigotes. CD4+ T cells were positively correlated to the extent of inflammation, B cells and IL-1β+ were associated with the extent of necrosis, CD68+ macrophages and perforin were correlated with the number of amastigotes, and CD57+ NK cells was correlated to CD68+ macrophages and amastigotes. In sum, the finding suggests that the production of cytotoxic granules and cytokines by inflammatory cells contributes to tissue damage in CL lesions.",We thank Dr. Mírian Nacagami Sotto and her staff for their assistance and for providing services at the Communicable Diseases Pathology Laboratory of the São Paulo University Medical School.

This study describes, for the first time, the complete mitochondrial genome of H. columbus from South Carolina, USA.MethodsThe mitogenome of H. columbus was assembled from Illumina 300 bp pair-end reads. It was annotated and compared to other published mitogenomes of plant-parasitic nematodes in the superfamily Tylenchoidea. The phylogenetic relationships between H. columbus and other 6 genera of plant-parasitic nematodes were examined using protein-coding genes (PCGs).ResultsThe mitogenome of H. columbus is a circular AT-rich DNA molecule 25,228 bp in length. The annotation result comprises 12 PCGs, 2 ribosomal RNA genes, and 19 transfer RNA genes. No atp8 gene was found in the mitogenome of H. columbus but long non-coding regions were observed in agreement to that reported for other plant-parasitic nematodes. The mitogenomic phylogeny of plant-parasitic nematodes in the superfamily Tylenchoidea agreed with previous molecular phylogenies. Mitochondrial gene synteny in H. columbus was unique but similar to that reported for other closely related species.ConclusionsThe mitogenome of H. columbus is unique within the superfamily Tylenchoidea but exhibits similarities in both gene content and synteny to other closely related nematodes.

The acetylation levels of these proteins are determined by the balance of expression of histone acetyltransferase (HATs) and histone deacetylases (HDACs). We recently reported that class I HDACs (HDAC1 and HDAC3) play important roles in juvenile hormone (JH) suppression of metamorphosis in the red flour beetle, Tribolium castaneum. Here, we report on the function of a single class IV HDAC member, HDAC11. Injection of dsRNA targeting T. castaneum HDAC11 gene into newly molted last instar larvae induced knockdown of the target gene and arrested larval development and prevented metamorphosis into the pupal stage. Dark melanized areas were detected in larvae that showed developmental arrest and mortality. Developmental expression studies showed an increase in HDAC11 mRNA levels beginning at the end of the penultimate larval stage. These higher levels were maintained during the final instar larval and pupal stages. A JH analog, hydroprene, suppressed HDAC11 expression in the larvae. Sequencing of RNA isolated from control and dsHDAC11 injected larvae identified several differentially expressed genes, including those involved in JH action, ecdysone response, and melanization. The acetylation levels of core histones showed an increase in TcA cells exposed to dsHDAC11. Also, an increase in histone H3 acetylation, specifically H3K9, H3K18 and H3K27, were detected in HDAC11 knockdown larvae. These studies report the function of HDAC11 in insects other than Drosophila for the first time and show that HDAC11 influences the acetylation levels of histones and expression of multiple genes involved in T. castaneum larval development.",We thank Najla Albishi for help with microscopic techniques and Hunt lab for RNA-seq analysis.,"Funding.

This study aimed to develop the autotrophic and heterotrophic culture of Tetraselmis suecica (Kylin) Butcher in order to increase EPS production and to characterize its antioxidant activity and cytotoxic effects on tumor cells. The adaptation of autotrophic to heterotrophic culture was carried out by progressively reducing the photoperiod and adding glucose. EPS extraction and purification were performed. EPS were characterized by Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The antioxidant capacity of EPS was analyzed by the 2,2'-azino-bis (3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulphonic acid) (ABTS) method, and the antitumor capacity was measured by the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay, showing high activity on human leukemia, breast and lung cancer cell lines. Although total EPS showed no cytotoxicity, acidic EPS showed cytotoxicity over the gingival fibroblasts cell line. Heterotrophic culture has advantages over autotrophic, such as increasing EPS yield, higher antioxidant capacity of the EPS and, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first probe that T. suecica EPS have cytotoxic effects on tumor cells; therefore, they could offer greater advantages as possible natural nutraceuticals for the pharmaceutical industry.",We want to express our gratitude to the Photobiology and Biotechnology of Aquatic Organisms (FYBOA) research group (RNM-295) for their technical support.

The number of cases peaks during the rainy season and may reach epidemic proportions in the event of flooding. It is possible that people living in areas affected by natural disasters are at greater risk of contracting the disease. The aim of this study was to identify clusters of relatively higher risk for leptospirosis occurrence, both in space and time, in six municipalities of Santa Catarina, Brazil, which had the highest incidence of the disease between 2000 and 2016, and to evaluate if these clusters coincide with the occurrence of natural disasters. The cases were geocoded with the geographic coordinates of patients' home addresses, and the analysis was performed using SaTScan software. The areas mapped as being at risk for hydrological and mass movements were compared with the locations of detected leptospirosis clusters. The disease was more common in men and in the age group from 15 to 69 years. In the scan statistics performed, only space-time showed significant results. Clusters were detected in all municipalities in 2008, when natural disasters preceded by heavy rainfall occurred. One of the municipalities also had clusters in 2011. In these clusters, most of the cases lived in urban areas and areas at risk for experiencing natural disasters. The interaction between time (time of disaster occurrence) and space (areas at risk of experiencing natural disasters) were the determining factors affecting cluster formation.",,,Geospatial Health,,,"Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Brazil; Child; Child, Preschool; Cities; Environment; Humans; Infant; Infant, Newborn; Leptospirosis; Male; Middle Aged; Natural Disasters; Spatial Analysis; Spatio-Temporal Analysis; Young Adult",2020-11-26,2020,2020-11-26,,15,2,,All OA; Gold,Article,"Silva, Ana Elisa Pereira; Chiaravalloti Neto, Francisco; Conceição, Gleice Margarete de Souza","Silva, Ana Elisa Pereira (School of Public Health, University of São Paulo, São Paulo. anaepsilva@hotmail.com.); Chiaravalloti Neto, Francisco (School of Public Health, University of São Paulo, São Paulo. franciscochiara@usp.br.); Conceição, Gleice Margarete de Souza (School of Public Health, University of São Paulo, São Paulo. gleice@usp.br.)",,"Silva, Ana Elisa Pereira (Universidade de São Paulo); Chiaravalloti Neto, Francisco (Universidade de São Paulo); Conceição, Gleice Margarete de Souza (Universidade de São Paulo)",10,6,1.12,2.24,https://geospatialhealth.net/index.php/gh/article/download/903/914,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1132947816,40 Engineering; 4013 Geomatic Engineering; 42 Health Sciences; 4202 Epidemiology,

In this sense, this paper then reports the development of an intelligent driving assistant, based on vehicle telemetry and road accident risk map analysis, whose responsibility is to alert the driver in order to avoid risky situations that may cause traffic accidents. In performance evaluations using real cars in a real environment, the on-board intelligent assistant reproduced real-time audio-visual alerts according to information obtained from both telemetry and road accident risk map analysis. As a result, an intelligent assistance agent based on fuzzy reasoning was obtained, which supported the driver correctly in real-time according to the telemetry data, the vehicle environment and the principles of secure driving practices and transportation regulation laws. Experimental results and conclusions emphasizing the advantages of the proposed intelligent driving assistant in the improvement of the driving task are presented.","This work was supported by Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla-Colombia.",This research received no external funding.,Sensors,,,"Accidents, Traffic; Automobile Driving; Automobiles; Humans; Risk Assessment; Risk Factors; Safety; Telemetry",2020-03-22,2020,2020-03-22,,20,6,1763,All OA; Gold,Article,"Terán, José; Navarro, Loraine; Quintero M, Christian G; Pardo, Mauricio","Terán, José (Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla 081007, Colombia.); Navarro, Loraine (Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla 081007, Colombia.); Quintero M, Christian G (Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla 081007, Colombia.); Pardo, Mauricio (Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla 081007, Colombia.)","Quintero M, Christian G (Universidad del Norte)","Terán, José (Universidad del Norte); Navarro, Loraine (Universidad del Norte); Quintero M, Christian G (Universidad del Norte); Pardo, Mauricio (Universidad del Norte)",14,7,1.1,3.84,https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/20/6/1763/pdf?version=1584875689,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1125885199,40 Engineering; 4005 Civil Engineering; 46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4602 Artificial Intelligence; 4605 Data Management and Data Science,3 Good Health and Well Being

Pulse oximetry screening (POS) is useful for early diagnosis and improved outcomes of critical CHD. Here, we describe POS implementation efforts in Latin American countries guided and/or coordinated by the Ibero American Society of Neonatology (SIBEN), as well as the unique challenges that are faced for universal implementation. SIBEN collaborates to improve the neonatal quality of care and outcomes. A few years ago, a Clinical Consensus on POS was finalized. Since then, we have participated in 12 Latin American countries to educate neonatal nurses and neonatologists on POS and to help with its implementation. The findings reveal that despite wide disparities in care that exist between and within countries, and the difficulties and challenges in implementing POS, significant progress has been made. We conclude that universal POS is not easy to implement in Latin America but, when executed, has not only been of significant value for babies with CHD, but also for many with other hypoxemic conditions. The successful and universal implementation of POS in the future is essential for reducing the mortality associated with CHD and other hypoxemic conditions and will ultimately lead to the survival of many more Latin American babies. POS saves newborns' lives in Latin America.","We would like to acknowledge all individuals that contributed without secondary interests so that all babies and families will not have to struggle through unnecessary suffering due to not receiving a simple method that can definitely aid in their well-being. To our mentors, who showed us the way of the noble practice of neonatal medicine, following humane principles and helping others before anything else. To Masimo (Irvine, CA, USA), who generously donated monitors to SIBEN to distribute in different areas to improve neonatal care. Finally, we thank Lara Maksimovic. Without her, SIBEN would not have been able to collaborate with so many babies and families the way it has done so, or maybe it would not even exist today.",This research received no external funding.,International Journal of Neonatal Screening,,,,2020-03-14,2020,2020-03-14,,6,1,21,All OA;

Methods: A finite elements model of a four-week-old infant skull was developed for simulating low height impact from 30 cm and 50 cm falls. Two impacts were simulated: An occipito-parietal impact on the lambdoid suture and a lateral impact on the right parietal and six cases were considered: unossified and fully ossified sutures, and sagittal, metopic, right lambdoid and right coronal craniosynostosis. Results: 26 simulations were performed. Results showed a marked increase in strain magnitudes in skulls with unossified sutures and fontanels. Higher deformations and lower Von Mises stress in the brain were found in occipital impacts. Fully ossified skulls showed less overall deformation and lower Von Mises stress in the brain. Results suggest that neonate skull impact when falling backward has a higher probability of resulting in permanent damage. Conclusion: This work shows an initial approximation to the mechanisms underlying TBI in neonates when exposed to low height falls common in household environments, and could be used as a starting point in the design and development of cranial orthoses and protective devices for preventing or mitigating TBI.",This work was funded by the 2015 National Young Researchers and Innovators call from Colciencias and the Office of Management and Academic Development of the Universidad del Norte.

This use overlaps with cigarette smoking and other illicit and licit drugs and s associated with depressive symptoms and suicide risk. In our national context, little is known about the relationship between Cannabis use and suicide risk.
Objective: To evaluate the association between Cannabis use and elevated suicide risk in high school adolescents in Santa Marta, Colombia.
Materials and methods: We conducted a cross-sectional study with a probabilistic sample of high school students between 13 and 17 years of age from official and private schools.
We analyzed the use of Cannabis some time in life and suicide risk was quantified using the suicide ideation scale designed by the Center for Epidemiological Studies on Depression.
Scores greater than eight were categorized as a high suicide risk. The crude and adjusted opportunity ratio (OR) was estimated.
Results: A total of 1,462 students participated. Their mean age was 14.4 years (SD=0.8) and 60.3% were women. The lifetime prevalence of Cannabis use was 11.6% (95%CI: 10.0-13.2) and 13.3% of the students reported high suicide risk (95%CI: 11.6-15.0). Cannabis consumption was associated with high suicide risk adjusted by other variables (OR=1.88; 95%CI: 1.23-2.88).
Conclusions: Cannabis use was associated with high suicide risk in high school adolescents in Santa Marta, Colombia. Other variables should be studied in order to further examine this association.","A los estudiantes de psicología ayudantes de investigación, por su invaluable cooperación en el proceso de recolección de la información: Adriana Rodríguez Martínez, Ana Celis Márquez, Carlos Fuentes López, Daniela Gonzales Cantillo, Heiner Tordecilla Arroyo, Nataly Tapia Duarte, Sandra Gómez Mariscal y Yuleinys Dávila Gómez, y a los profesionales de psicología de apoyo: Amparo Echeverry Arias, Heigui Araújo Zúñiga, Johana Guerrero Bolaño y María Paola Jiménez Villamizar.",,Biomédica,,,"Adolescent; Colombia; Confidence Intervals; Cross-Sectional Studies; Depression; Family Characteristics; Female; Humans; Male; Marijuana Abuse; Prevalence; Risk Factors; Social Class; Students; Suicidal Ideation; Suicide, Attempted",2020-09-24,2020,2020-09-24,,40,3,569-577,All OA; Gold,Article,"Campo-Arias, Adalberto; Suárez-Colorado, Yuli Paola; Caballero-Domínguez, Carmen Cecilia","Campo-Arias, Adalberto (Programa de Medicina, Facultad de Ciencias de la Salud, Universidad del Magdalena, Santa Marta, Colombia, Universidad del Magdalena, Facultad de Ciencias de la Salud, Universidad del Magdalena, Santa Marta, Colombia); Suárez-Colorado, Yuli Paola (Programa de Psicología, Universidad Cooperativa de Colombia, Santa Marta, Colombia, Universidad Cooperativa de Colombia, Universidad Cooperativa de Colombia, Santa Marta, Colombia); Caballero-Domínguez, Carmen Cecilia (Programa de Psicología, Facultad de Ciencias de la Salud, Universidad del Magdalena, Santa Marta, Colombia, Universidad del Magdalena, Facultad de Ciencias de la Salud, Universidad del Magdalena, Santa Marta, Colombia)","Campo-Arias, Adalberto (University of Magdalena)","Campo-Arias, Adalberto (University of Magdalena); Suárez-Colorado, Yuli Paola (Cooperative University of Colombia); Caballero-Domínguez, Carmen Cecilia (University of Magdalena)",16,5,1.09,3.14,https://revistabiomedica.org/index.php/biomedica/article/download/4988/4579,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1131234109,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3214 Pharmacology and Pharmaceutical Sciences; 52 Psychology,3 Good Health and Well Being

Non self-medication (NSM), responsible self-medication (RSM) and irresponsible self-medication (ISM) were defined as the outcome categories. Demographic, social, cultural and health system variables were included as covariates. We calculated relative prevalence ratios (RPR) with their 95% confidence intervals (95%CI) using crude and adjusted multinomial logistic regression models for complex samples with NSM as the referent category. Results: 2582 participants were included. The average age was 41.4 years and the frequencies of NSM, RSM and ISM were 25.2%, 23.8% and 51.0%; respectively. The factors associated with RSM were male gender (RPR: 1.35; 95%CI: 1.06-1.72), being between 40 and 59 years old (RPR: 0.53; 95%IC: 0.39-0.72), being 60 or older (RPR: 0.39; 95%IC: 0.25-0.59), not having health insurance (RPR: 1.89; 95%CI: 1.31-2.71) and living in the Highlands region (RPR: 2.27; 95%CI: 1.23-4.21). The factors associated with ISM were male gender (RPR: 1.41; 95%CI: 1.16-1.72), being between 40 and 59 years old (RPR: 0.68; 95%IC: 0.53-0.88), being 60 or older (RPR: 0.65; 95%IC: 0.48-0.88) and not having health insurance (RPR: 2.03; 95%CI: 1.46-2.83). Conclusion: Around half of the population practiced ISM, which was associated with demographic and health system factors. These outcomes are the preliminary evidence that could contribute to the development of health policies in Peru.",The author(s) declared that no grants were involved in supporting this work.,The author(s) declared that no grants were involved in supporting this work.,F1000Research,,,Adult; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Personal Satisfaction; Peru; Pharmacies; Surveys and Questionnaires,2020-01-24,2020,2020-01-24,,8,,23,All OA; Gold,Article,"Urrunaga-Pastor, Diego; Benites-Zapata, Vicente A.; Mezones-Holguín, Edward","Urrunaga-Pastor, Diego (Unidad de Investigación para la Generación y Síntesis de Evidencias en Salud, Universidad San Ignacio de Loyola, Lima, 15024, Peru); Benites-Zapata, Vicente A.

New, improved therapies are needed. Herein, we create a next generation anti-apicomplexan lead compound, JAG21, a tetrahydroquinolone, with increased sp3-character to improve parasite selectivity. Relative to other cytochrome b inhibitors, JAG21 has improved solubility and ADMET properties, without need for pro-drug. JAG21 significantly reduces Toxoplasma gondii tachyzoites and encysted bradyzoites in vitro, and in primary and established chronic murine infections. Moreover, JAG21 treatment leads to 100% survival. Further, JAG21 is efficacious against drug-resistant Plasmodium falciparum in vitro. Causal prophylaxis and radical cure are achieved after P. berghei sporozoite infection with oral administration of a single dose (2.5 mg/kg) or 3 days treatment at reduced dose (0.625 mg/kg/day), eliminating parasitemia, and leading to 100% survival. Enzymatic, binding, and co-crystallography/pharmacophore studies demonstrate selectivity for apicomplexan relative to mammalian enzymes. JAG21 has significant promise as a pre-clinical candidate for prevention, treatment, and cure of toxoplasmosis and malaria.","We thank and gratefully also acknowledge the support of the Cornwell Mann family, the Rodriguez, Musillami, Quinn, Rosenthal, Greenberg, Morel, Rooney and Engel families, Taking out Toxo, and The Toxoplasmosis Research Institute.

Concomitant with cell viability determination during storage (28 days), the pH, titratable acidity, syneresis, protein and fat were evaluated. The results indicated that neither UTNGt28 nor LacAT displayed a high capacity to ferment whole milk and survive during storage; a statistically significant difference (p < 0.05) in cell viability was registered for UTNGt28 compared with LacAT when inoculated alone or in combination with S. thermophilus. A principal component analysis showed a clear difference between the yogurt formulations at day 1 and 28 of storage. The PC 1 explained 46.8% of the total variance (day 28), was loaded in the negative (-) direction with titratable acidity (% lactic acid), while the PC 2 explained 22.5% (day 1) with pH. PC 1 was loaded in the positive (+) direction with pH, cell viability, syneresis, fat and protein.

The aim of the present work was to evaluate the cytotoxic and antitumor activity of a polyphenolic fraction obtained from Thalassia testudinum marine plant and thalassiolin B in human colorectal cancer cells. Human cancer cell lines, including HCT15, HCT116, SW260, and HT29 were treated with tested products for cytotoxicity evaluation by crystal violet assay. The potential proapoptotic effect of these natural products was assessed by flow cytometry in HCT15 cells at 48 h using Annexin V-FITC/propidium iodide. In addition, reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation was measured by fluorescence using DCFH-DA staining, and sulfhydryl concentration by spectrophotometry. The in vivo antitumor activity of the polyphenolic fraction (25 mg/kg) was evaluated in a xenograft model in nu/nu mice. In vivo proapoptotic effect was also evaluated by immunohistochemistry using anti-caspase 3 and anti-Bcl-2 antibodies. The results showed that tested products exert colorectal cancer cell cytotoxicity. Besides, the tested products induced a significant increase (p < 0.05) of intracellular ROS generation, and a depletion of sulfhydryl concentration in HCT15 cells. The polyphenolic fraction arrested tumor growth and induced apoptosis in the xenograft mice model. These results demonstrate the cytotoxic activity of T. testudinum metabolites associated, at least, with ROS overproduction and pro-apoptotic effects. Here we demonstrated for the first time the antitumor activity of a T. testudinum polar extract in a xenograft mice model. These results suggest the potential use of T. testudinum marine plant metabolites as adjuvant treatment in cancer therapy.","The authors are grateful to N.

While plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) are known to induce plant defenses, endosymbiotic bacteria hosted by herbivorous insects are often beneficial to the host. Here, we aimed to assess whether PGPR-induced defenses in broad bean plants impact the pea aphid, depending on its genotype and the presence of endosymbionts. We estimated aphid reproduction, quantified defense- and growth-related phytohormones by GC-MS, and measured different plant growth and physiology parameters, after PGPR treatment. In addition, we recorded the feeding behavior of aphids by electropenetrography. We found that the PGPR treatment of broad bean plants reduced the reproduction of one of the pea aphid clones. We highlighted a phenomenon of PGPR-induced plant defense priming, but no noticeable plant growth promotion. The main changes in aphid probing behavior were related to salivation events into phloem sieve elements. We suggest that the endosymbiont Hamiltonella defensa played a key role in plant-insect interactions, possibly helping aphids to counteract plant-induced resistance and allowing them to develop normally on PGPR-treated plants. Our results imply that plant- and aphid-associated microorganisms add greater complexity to the outcomes of aphid-plant interactions.","The authors thank the R.

Methods: A descriptive comparative study of the documents issued by the national-level government of the most recent past administrations in each country (2012-2018 for Mexico, 2013-2018 for Colombia) was conducted. We identified the documents' objectives, strategies, and evaluation of results, and the representation of international migrants and migrant health in the policy.
Results: Both countries situate health care policies for international migrants in a human rights framework. In both, migrants are entitled to health care, but access is limited by migration status. The main contrasts are the focus on different migrant populations (Mexican migrants in the Mexico-US migration circuit in Mexico; Venezuelan immigrants and Colombians returning from Venezuela in Colombia), and the discursive framing of policies as a response to the crisis in Colombia. As a result, while concrete actions are detailed in the Colombian policies, most documents in Mexico are limited to general strategies. These differences can be explained by the context in which each set of policies was issued: a relatively stable Mexico-US migration flow in Mexico, and the reception of hundreds of thousands of migrants from Venezuela in a very short time in Colombia.
Conclusions: Tradition in matters of migration, and the current migration context, influence health policies for migrant populations.","As part of the project “Mexico-Guatemala trans-border region”, ACV received financial support from FORDECYT (no.

Interacting with the pathogen membranes might produce visible changes in shape or cell wall damage. Previously, we showed that the peptides produced by Lactobacillus plantarum UTNGt2, Lactobacillus plantarum UTNCys5-4, and Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis UTNGt28 exhibit a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity against several foodborne pathogens in vitro. In this study, their possible mode of action against the commensal microorganism Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica ATCC51741 was investigated. The target membrane permeability was determined by detection of beta-galactosidase release from ONPG (o-nitro-phenyl-L-D-galactoside) substrate and changes in the whole protein profile indicating that the peptide extracts destroy the membrane integrity and may induce breaks in membrane proteins to some extent. The release of aromatic molecules such as DNA/RNA was detected after the interaction of Salmonella with the peptide extract. Transmission electronic microscopy (TEM) micrographs depicted at least four simultaneous secondary events after the peptide extract treatment underlying their antimicrobial actions, including morphological alterations of the membrane. Spheroplast and filament formation, vacuolation, and DNA relaxation were identified as the principal events from the Gt2 and Cys5-4 peptide extracts, while Gt28 induced the formation of ghost cells by release of cytoplasmic content, filaments, and separation of cell envelope layers. Gel retarding assays indicate that the Gt2 and Gt28 peptide extracts are clearly binding the Salmonella DNA, while Cys5-4 partially interacted with Salmonella genomic DNA. These results increased our knowledge about the inhibitory mechanism employed by several peptide extracts from native lactic acid bacteria against Salmonella. Further, we shall develop peptide-based formulation and evaluate their biocontrol effect in the food chains.","I expressed my gratitude to Ing. E. Pita for the technical support and C.

In the present work, the performance of a 0.5 vol % GO-incorporated epoxy matrix composite reinforced with 30 vol % fabric made of ramie fibers was investigated by stand-alone ballistic tests against the threat of a 0.22 lead projectile. Composite characterization was also performed by Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, thermal analysis and X-ray diffraction. Ballistic tests disclosed an absorbed energy of 130 J, which is higher than those reported for other natural fabrics epoxy composite, 74-97 J, as well as plain Kevlar (synthetic aramid fabric), 100 J, with the same thickness. This is attributed to the improved adhesion between the ramie fabric and the composite matrix due to the GO-incorporated epoxy. The onset of thermal degradation above 300 °C indicates a relatively higher working temperature as compared to common natural fiber polymer composites. DSC peaks show a low amount of heat absorbed or release due to glass transition endothermic (113-121 °C) and volatile release exothermic (~132 °C) events. The 1030 cm-1 prominent FTIR band, associated with GO bands between epoxy chains and graphene oxide groups, suggested an effective distribution of GO throughout the composite matrix. As expected, XRD of the 30 vol % ramie fabric-reinforced GO-incorporated epoxy matrix composite confirmed the displacement of the (0 0 1) peak of GO by 8° due to intercalation of epoxy chains into the spacing between GO layers. By improving the adhesion to the ramie fabric and enhancing the thermal stability of the epoxy matrix, as well as by superior absorption energy from projectile penetration, the GO may contribute to the composite effective ballistic performance.","The authors wish to thank the support to this investigation by the Brazilian agencies: CNPq, CAPES, FAPERJ, the Navy Research Institute (IPQM) and Institute of Macromolecules (IMA) for the thermal analyses conduction and the Natural Fibers Laboratory at the State University of the North Fluminense Darcy Ribeiro (UENF) for conducting the impact tests.","This research was funded by the Brazilian Council of Scientific Research, Technology and Innovation Development, CNPq (403140/2019-6), as well as State of Rio de Janeiro Research Support Foundation, FAPERJ (257531).",Polymers,,,,2020-11-16,2020,2020-11-16,,12,11,2711,All OA;

Leaching bacteria are characterized by having resistance mechanisms for several metals found in their acidic environments, some of which have been partially described in the Acidithiobacillus genus (mainly on ferrooxidans species). However, the response to copper has not been studied in the psychrotolerant Acidithiobacillus ferrivorans strains. Therefore, we propose to elucidate the response mechanisms of A. ferrivorans ACH to high copper concentrations (0-800 mM), describing its genetic repertoire and transcriptional regulation. Our results show that A. ferrivorans ACH can grow in up to 400 mM of copper. Moreover, we found the presence of several copper-related makers, belonging to cop and cus systems, as well as rusticyanins and periplasmatic acop protein in the genome. Interestingly, the ACH strain is the only one in which we find three copies of copB and copZ genes. Moreover, transcriptional expression showed an up-regulation response (acop, copZ, cusA, rusA, and rusB) to high copper concentrations. Finally, our results support the important role of these genes in A. ferrivorans copper stress resistance, promoting the use of the ACH strain in industrial leaching under low temperatures, which could decrease the activation times of oxidation processes and the energy costs.",,This work was supported by ANID (Agencia Nacional de Investigación y Desarrollo de Chile).

The main systems affected are the central nervous and renal systems, although effects on the reproductive system have also been found. Objective: To explore the relationship between mercury levels in women and their possible sources of contamination. A cross-sectional study was conducted from 2013 to 2015 with women residing in 11 municipalities in La Mojana, Colombia, using non-random sampling. Standardized instruments were used to identify sociodemographic characteristics, mercury use, mining-related activities, water and fish consumption, and other factors. Blood, urine, and hair samples were taken to quantify mercury levels. A logistic regression model was used to identify factors associated with elevated mercury values in the participants' samples. A total of 428 women were included, with an average age of 36.7 ± 16.7 years, 3.3% of whom were pregnant at the time of the survey and 8.4% of whom were exposed occupationally. High levels of mercury were present in 62.8% of the women, in any one of the three samples processed. Those exposed occupationally and environmentally had similar values (p = 0.821). Frequency of fish consumption and source of drinking water were associated with higher levels of mercury (p < 0.05).","We express our gratitude to the people who participated in the study, to the professionals of the Directorates and Risk Analysis in Public Health and Research in Public Health of the National Institute of Health, and to the professionals of the Secretaries of Departmental and Municipal Health, for their valuable contributions in obtaining the field work information.","This work was carried out with operating resources of the Directorates of Surveillance and Risk Analysis in Public Health and Research in Public Health, and Groups of Environmental Risk Factors and Occupational and Environmental Health of the National Institute of Health.",International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health,,,Adult; Animals; Colombia; Cross-Sectional Studies; Dietary Exposure; Drinking Water; Female; Fishes; Gold; Humans; Mercury; Middle Aged; Mining; Pregnancy; Young Adult,2020-03-01,2020,2020-03-11,2020-03-01,17,6,1827,All OA; Gold,Article,"Diaz, Sonia Mireya; Palma, Ruth Marien; Muñoz, Maria Nathalia; Becerra-Arias, Carolina; Niño, Julián Alfredo Fernández","Diaz, Sonia Mireya (Group of Environmental Risk Factors, National Institute of Health, Bogotá 111321, Colombia;, sdiaz21@gmail.com, (S.M.D.);, natamunozg@gmail.com, (M.N.M.)); Palma, Ruth Marien (Environmental and Labor Health Group, National Institute of Health, Bogotá 111321, Colombia;, rpalma@ins.gov.co); Muñoz, Maria Nathalia (Group of Environmental Risk Factors, National Institute of Health, Bogotá 111321, Colombia;, sdiaz21@gmail.com, (S.M.D.);, natamunozg@gmail.com, (M.N.M.)); Becerra-Arias, Carolina (Secretary of Health and Environment of Bucaramanga.

Imiquimod has ability to moderate immune response and used to treat a wide variety of infections and tumors. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effect of imiquimod on the tachyzoites of T. gondii and infected macrophages in vitro and in BALB/c mice. The viability of T. gondii was assessed in the presence of various concentrations of imiquimod by direct counting after 6 and 24 h. The MTT assay was used to identify the viability of uninfected macrophages. The apoptotic effects were determined with flow cytometry on the tachyzoites and infected macrophages. For evaluation of parasite load in pre-treatment or post-treatment of macrophages Quantitative real time PCR (qPCR) was performed. For in vivo experiments, BALB/c mice received imiquimod before and after challenge with parasites. The mortality rate of mice, parasite numbers in spleen, and the INF-γ and IL-4 cytokine levels in spleen lymphocytes were evaluated. Imiquimod demonstrated anti-Toxoplasma effects by reducing the number of tachyzoites. The results of flow cytometry for drug-treated tachyzoites showed that apoptosis did not rise significantly relative to the control group (p < 0.05). Moreover, apoptosis was enhanced in infected macrophages as the concentration of imiquimod was reduced. The parasitic burden in imiquimod pretreated macrophages was significantly lower than those treated after infection (p < 0.01). A marked reduction was observed in survival rate, parasite load and INF-γ level in BALB/c mice that received imiquimod before parasitic challenge relative to those received drug after parasitic challenge (p < 0.01). Overall, imiquimod in the pretreated group had greater anti-Toxoplasma effects than imiquimod in posttreated group in vitro and in vivo. imiquimod may be considered as a candidate for use against Toxoplasmosis both therapeutically and prophylactically.","The authors would like to thank all staff of Department of Parasitology of Tarbiat Modares University, Iran.

As an effort to characterize those organisms, traditionally named as Rickettsia or Chlamydia-like organisms, 1950 specimens comprising 22 mollusk species were collected over 10 countries and after histology examination, a selection of 99 samples involving 20 species were subjected to 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing. Phylogenetic analysis showed Endozoicomonadaceae sequences in all the mollusk species analyzed. Geographical differences in the distribution of Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs) and a particular OTU associated with pathology in king scallop (OTU_2) were observed. The presence of Endozoicomonadaceae sequences in the IMC was visually confirmed by in situ hybridization (ISH) in eight selected samples. Sequencing data also indicated other symbiotic bacteria. Subsequent phylogenetic analysis of those OTUs revealed a novel microbial diversity associated with molluskan IMC infection distributed among different taxa, including the phylum Spirochetes, the families Anaplasmataceae and Simkaniaceae, the genera Mycoplasma and Francisella, and sulfur-oxidizing endosymbionts. Sequences like Francisella halioticida/philomiragia and Candidatus Brownia rhizoecola were also obtained, however, in the absence of ISH studies, the association between those organisms and the IMCs were not confirmed. The sequences identified in this study will allow for further molecular characterization of the microbial community associated with IMC infection in marine mollusks and their correlation with severity of the lesions to clarify their role as endosymbionts, commensals or true pathogens.","We want to thank Cefas Seedcorn for their support in drafting this study.

KSS is a rare mitochondrial disease defined by a classic triad of progressive external ophthalmoplegia, atypical pigmentary retinopathy, and onset before 20 years. PMPS presents in the first year of life with bone marrow failure and exocrine pancreatic dysfunction, and can evolve into KSS later in life. Even though an mtDNA deletion is the most frequent mutation in KSS and PMPS, cases of duplications and molecular rearrangements have also been described. In Colombia, few case reports of KSS and PMPS have been published in indexed journals or have been registered in scientific events.
METHODS: We discuss clinical and genetic aspects of two case reports of pediatric female patients, with initial clinical diagnosis of PMPS who later evolved into KSS, with confirmatory molecular studies of an mtDNA deletion and an mtDNA duplication.
RESULTS: A large-scale mtDNA deletion, NC_012920.1:m.8286_14416del, was confirmed by Southern Blot in patient 1. An mtDNA duplication of 7.9 kb was confirmed by MLPA in patient 2.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings are compatible with the phenotypic and genetic presentation of PMPS and KSS. We present the first molecularly confirmed case reports of Colombian patients, diagnosed initially with PMPS, who later evolved to KSS.",ACKNOWLEDGMENTS The authors have no funding for this study.

METHOD: This was a non-experimental and cross-sectional study. Two populations of nursing students in two nursing programs were studied: Universidad San Sebastián (Santiago, Chile) and Universidad Mayor (Temuco, Chile). The original data on empathy, assessed by the Jefferson Scale of Empathy, were combined into a single data base. They were then analyzed by means of normality tests and homoscedasticity, Cronbach's alpha, analysis of variance; the standard deviation of the dependent outcome measure (Sy.x) and the coefficient of determination (R2) were estimated.
RESULTS: The sample sizes from the two programs were 479 and 277, respectively. It was found that the distributions of the averages over the course of study for empathy (and its components) were constant, and in some cases increased.
CONCLUSION: It was found that the distribution of the means of empathy in the nursing students analyzed did not conform to the classical empathic decline observed in other studies.

Qualitative data included students' responses to open-ended questions about their experience with TBL and transcripts of instructors' interviews.Results: Forty junior college students participated in the study. A non-parametric test was conducted to compare the scores. The results showed that the GRAT score was significantly higher than the IRAT-pre-score, and the IRAT-post score was significantly higher than the IRAT-pre-score. The IRAT-post score was significantly higher than the GRAT score for the first and fourth modules, but IRAT-post score was significantly lower than the GRAT score on the second and third modules. Using direct content analysis, five themes were coded around instructional development, while 15 themes were coded to understand students' experiences with TBL.Conclusions: TBL can be an effective instructional approach to improve students' understanding of radiologic technology content. The results of this research can help instructors decide what action plan to implement to increase the effectiveness of TBL when further employing it for radiologic technology courses.",,,Medical Education Online,,,Diagnostic Imaging; Educational Measurement; Health Services Research; Humans; Learning; Peer Group; Problem-Based Learning; Program Evaluation; Quality Control; Students; Teaching; Universities,2020-01-01,2020,2020-02-23,2020-01-01,25,1,1732159,All OA; Gold,Article,"Tsai, Meng-Fang; Jao, Jo-Chi","Tsai, Meng-Fang (General Research Service Center, National Pingtung University of Science and Technology, Neipu, Pingtung, Taiwan); Jao, Jo-Chi (Department of Medical Imaging and Radiological Sciences, Kaohsiung Medical University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan)","Jao, Jo-Chi (Kaohsiung Medical University)","Tsai, Meng-Fang (National Pingtung University of Science and Technology); Jao, Jo-Chi (Kaohsiung Medical University)",12,7,0.89,7.62,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/10872981.2020.1732159?needAccess=true&,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1125092402,39 Education; 3901 Curriculum and Pedagogy; 3903 Education Systems,

METHODS: Data of Colombian confirmed deaths of COVID-19 until June 11, 2020, were included in this analysis (n=1488 deaths). Relationships between COVID-19, combinations of health conditions and age were explored using locally weighted polynomial regressions.
RESULTS: The most frequent health conditions were high blood pressure, respiratory disease, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and kidney disease. Dyads more frequents were high blood pressure with diabetes, cardiovascular disease or respiratory disease. Some multimorbidity patterns increase probability of death among older individuals, whereas other patterns are not age-related, or decrease the probability of death among older people. Not all multimorbidity increases with age, as is commonly thought. Obesity, alone or with other diseases, was associated with a higher risk of severity among young people, while the risk of the high blood pressure/diabetes dyad tends to have an inverted U distribution in relation with age.
CONCLUSIONS: Classification of individuals according to multimorbidity in the medical management of COVID-19 patients is important to determine the possible etiological models and to define patient triage for hospitalization. Moreover, identification of non-infected individuals with high-risk ages and multimorbidity patterns serves to define possible interventions of selective confinement or special management.",,None declared.,BULL PAN AM HEALTH ORGAN,,,,2020-12-30,2020,2020-12-30,2020-12-30,44,,1,All OA; Gold,Article,"Fernández-Niño, Julián A.; Guerra-Gómez, John A.; Idrovo, Alvaro J.","Fernández-Niño, Julián A.

RSV could be used to mitigate damages associated to metabolic diseases and aging. Particularly, RSV regulates different aspects of mitochondrial metabolism. However, no information is available about the effects of RSV on Coenzyme Q (CoQ), a central component in the mitochondrial electron transport chain. Here, we report for the first time that RSV modulates COQ genes and parameters associated to metabolic syndrome in mice. Mice fed with high fat diet (HFD) presented a higher weight gain, triglycerides (TGs) and cholesterol levels while RSV reverted TGs to control level but not weight or cholesterol. HFD induced a decrease of COQs gene mRNA level, whereas RSV reversed this decrease in most of the COQs genes. However, RSV did not show effect on CoQ9, CoQ10 and total CoQ levels, neither in CoQ-dependent antioxidant enzymes. HFD influenced mitochondrial dynamics and mitophagy markers. RSV modulated the levels of PINK1 and PARKIN and their ratio, indicating modulation of mitophagy. In summary, we report that RSV influences some of the metabolic adaptations of HFD affecting mitochondrial physiology while also regulates COQs gene expression levels in a process that can be associated with mitochondrial dynamics and turnover.",,"J.D.H.C. is a predoctoral research fellow from the Spanish Ministry of Education, Culture and Sports [FPU16/03264].",Antioxidants,,,,2020-05-15,2020,2020-05-15,,9,5,431,All OA; Gold,Article,"Meza-Torres, Catherine; Hernández-Camacho, Juan Diego; Cortés-Rodríguez, Ana Belén; Fang, Luis; Thanh, Tung Bui; Rodríguez-Bies, Elisabet; Navas, Plácido; López-Lluch, Guillermo","Meza-Torres, Catherine (Centro Andaluz de Biología del Desarrollo, Universidad Pablo de Olavide-CSIC-JA, and CIBERER, Instituto de Salud Carlos III, 41013 Sevilla, Spain;, mezacathemeza@gmail.com, (C.M.-T.);, jdhercam@upo.es, (J.D.H.-C.);, abcorrod@upo.es, (A.B.C.-R.);, tungasia82@yahoo.es, (T.B.T.);, ecrodbie1@upo.es, (E.R.-B.);, pnavas@upo.es, (P.N.)); Hernández-Camacho, Juan Diego (Centro Andaluz de Biología del Desarrollo, Universidad Pablo de Olavide-CSIC-JA, and CIBERER, Instituto de Salud Carlos III, 41013 Sevilla, Spain;, mezacathemeza@gmail.com, (C.M.-T.);, jdhercam@upo.es, (J.D.H.-C.);, abcorrod@upo.es, (A.B.C.-R.);, tungasia82@yahoo.es, (T.B.T.);, ecrodbie1@upo.es, (E.R.-B.);, pnavas@upo.es, (P.N.)); Cortés-Rodríguez, Ana Belén (Centro Andaluz de Biología del Desarrollo, Universidad Pablo de Olavide-CSIC-JA, and CIBERER, Instituto de Salud Carlos III, 41013 Sevilla, Spain;, mezacathemeza@gmail.com, (C.M.-T.);, jdhercam@upo.es, (J.D.H.-C.);, abcorrod@upo.es, (A.B.C.-R.);, tungasia82@yahoo.es, (T.B.T.);, ecrodbie1@upo.es, (E.R.-B.);, pnavas@upo.es, (P.N.)); Fang, Luis (Immunology and Molecular Biology Group, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla 081007, Colombia;, lfang@uninorte.edu.co); Thanh, Tung Bui (Centro Andaluz de Biología del Desarrollo, Universidad Pablo de Olavide-CSIC-JA, and CIBERER, Instituto de Salud Carlos III, 41013 Sevilla, Spain;, mezacathemeza@gmail.com, (C.M.-T.);, jdhercam@upo.es, (J.D.H.-C.);, abcorrod@upo.es, (A.B.C.-R.);, tungasia82@yahoo.es, (T.B.T.);, ecrodbie1@upo.es, (E.R.-B.);, pnavas@upo.es, (P.N.); School of Medicine and Pharmacy, Vietnam National University, Hanoi 100000, Vietnam); Rodríguez-Bies, Elisabet (Centro Andaluz de Biología del Desarrollo, Universidad Pablo de Olavide-CSIC-JA, and CIBERER, Instituto de Salud Carlos III, 41013 Sevilla, Spain;, mezacathemeza@gmail.com, (C.M.-T.);, jdhercam@upo.es, (J.D.H.-C.);, abcorrod@upo.es, (A.B.C.-R.);, tungasia82@yahoo.es, (T.B.T.);, ecrodbie1@upo.es, (E.R.-B.);, pnavas@upo.es, (P.N.); Departamento de Deporte e Informática, Universidad Pablo de Olavide, 41013 Sevilla, Spain); Navas, Plácido (Centro Andaluz de Biología del Desarrollo, Universidad Pablo de Olavide-CSIC-JA, and CIBERER, Instituto de Salud Carlos III, 41013 Sevilla, Spain;, mezacathemeza@gmail.com, (C.M.-T.);, jdhercam@upo.es, (J.D.H.-C.);, abcorrod@upo.es, (A.B.C.-R.);, tungasia82@yahoo.es, (T.B.T.);, ecrodbie1@upo.es, (E.R.-B.);, pnavas@upo.es, (P.N.)); López-Lluch, Guillermo (Centro Andaluz de Biología del Desarrollo, Universidad Pablo de Olavide-CSIC-JA, and CIBERER, Instituto de Salud Carlos III, 41013 Sevilla, Spain;, mezacathemeza@gmail.com, (C.M.-T.);, jdhercam@upo.es, (J.D.H.-C.);, abcorrod@upo.es, (A.B.C.-R.);, tungasia82@yahoo.es, (T.B.T.);, ecrodbie1@upo.es, (E.R.-B.);, pnavas@upo.es, (P.N.))","López-Lluch, Guillermo (Centro Andaluz de Biología del Desarrollo)","Meza-Torres, Catherine (Centro Andaluz de Biología del Desarrollo); Hernández-Camacho, Juan Diego (Centro Andaluz de Biología del Desarrollo); Cortés-Rodríguez, Ana Belén (Centro Andaluz de Biología del Desarrollo); Fang, Luis (Universidad del Norte); Thanh, Tung Bui (Centro Andaluz de Biología del Desarrollo; Vietnam National University, Hanoi); Rodríguez-Bies, Elisabet (Centro Andaluz de Biología del Desarrollo; Pablo de Olavide University); Navas, Plácido (Centro Andaluz de Biología del Desarrollo); López-Lluch, Guillermo (Centro Andaluz de Biología del Desarrollo)",13,6,0.88,1.84,https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3921/9/5/431/pdf?version=1589550843,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1127676234,31 Biological Sciences; 3101 Biochemistry and Cell Biology,

Deciphering the genomic underpinnings of eusociality in these marine shrimps has been limited by the sparse genomic resources in this genus. Here, we report, for a eusocial shrimp Synalpheus microneptunus, a complete mitochondrial genome (22X coverage) assembled from short Illumina 150 bp paired-end reads. The 15,603 bp long mitochondrial genome of S. microneptunus is AT-rich and includes 13 protein-coding genes (PCGs), 2 ribosomal RNA genes, 22 transfer RNA genes and an 834 bp intergenic region assumed to be the D-loop. The gene order is identical to that reported for most caridean shrimps and corresponds to the presumed Pancrustacean ground pattern. All PCGs showed signs of purifying selection, with KA/KS <<1 across the whole PCGs and most sliding windows within PCGs. Maximum-likelihood and Bayesian inference phylogenetic analyses of 13 PCGs and 68 terminals supports the monophyly of the Caridea and the family Alpheidae. The complete mitochondrial genome of the eusocial shrimp Synalpheus microneptunus will contribute to a better understanding of the selective pressures and rates of molecular evolution in marine eusocial animals.",J.A.B. thanks Dr. Vincent P.

Here we present new phylogeographic analyses in the pulmonate Siphonaria lessonii across its distribution, from northern Chile in the Pacific to Uruguay in the Atlantic. Contrary to our expectations, populations from the southwestern Atlantic, an area that was less impacted by ice during glacial maxima, showed low genetic diversity and evidence of recent expansion, similar to the patterns recorded in this study across heavily ice-impacted areas in the Pacific Magellan margin. We propose that Atlantic and Pacific shallow marine hard-substrate benthic species were both affected during the Quaternary in South America, but by different processes. At higher latitudes of the southeast Pacific, ice-scouring drastically affected S. lessonii populations compared to non-glaciated areas along the Chile-Peru province where the species was resilient. In the southwest Atlantic, S. lessonii populations would have been dramatically impacted by the reduction of near-shore rocky habitat availability as a consequence of glacio-eustatic movements. The increase of gravelly and rocky shore substrates in the southwest Atlantic supports a hypothesis of glacial refugia from where the species recolonized lower latitudes across the Atlantic and Pacific margins. Our results suggest that current patterns of genetic diversity and structure in near-shore marine benthic species do not solely depend on the impact of Quaternary glacial ice expansions but also on the availability of suitable habitats and life-history traits, including developmental mode, bathymetry and the likelihood of dispersal by rafting.","Several projects and institutions are greatly appreciated, including a Fondecyt Initiation Project 11140087, the program FONDAP IDEAL, Project 15150003 and the INACH project RG_18–17 to C.

However, little research has focused on exploring the factors that can mitigate this effect. Within this framework, the present study examined the mediating role of positive and negative affects in the relationship between ethnic and racial discrimination and psychological well-being in the migrant population. About 919 Colombians, first-generation migrants, residing in Chile (Arica, Antofagasta, and Santiago) were evaluated, of which 50.5% were women, and the participants' average age was 35 years (range: 18-65 years). Krieger's discrimination questionnaires, Watson's Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS), and Ryff's Psychological Well-Being Scale were applied. The measurement models of each variable were estimated, and then the structural equation models were used. The results of the hypothesized multiple mediation model showed that the main mediator in the relationship between ethnic-racial discrimination and psychological well-being was positive affects over negative ones.",,Funding.

This research aims to understand the effect of extensive experience working in the program and the simultaneous interaction among different relationships in the network structure of a team of implementers. The Psychosocial Care Program for Victims of Conflict is implemented by psychologists, social workers, and community advocates.MethodsA cross-sectional study was carried out. Multivariate analysis, quadratic assignment procedures, and graphic visualization are used to (a) determine how seniority affects the professionals’ level of centrality in the program and (b) clarify how the interaction among professionals favors new relationships.ResultsLonger-lasting professionals in the program report stronger network bonding, predisposition to work, and information exchange. The nonparametric permutation test indicates an intense association between the information requests submitted and received and between the predisposition to work network and the network of received information requests. The results are discussed to optimize the teams implementing the intervention programs.ConclusionsNetwork analysis is a powerfull tool to evaluate program implementation processes. Analyzing the interactions among multiples relationships that emerge between members of multidisciplinary teams allows knowing how certain relationships (e.g., information exchange) triggering other kind of relationships (e.g., users referral).

Extracellular ATP is known to signal through plasma membrane receptors of the P2Y and P2X families. Among the P2X receptors, P2X7 has attracted increasing interest in the field of inflammation as well as in cancer. P2X7 is expressed by immune cells and by most malignant tumor cells where it plays a crucial yet complex role that remains to be clarified. P2X7 activity has been associated with production and release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, modulation of the activity and survival of immune cells, and the stimulation of proliferation and migratory properties of tumor cells. Hence, P2X7 plays an intricate role in the tumor microenvironment combining beneficial and detrimental effects that need to be further investigated. For this, we developed a novel methodology termed AAVnano based on the use of Adeno-associated viral vectors (AAV) encoding nanobodies targeting P2X7. We discuss here the advantages of this tool to study the different functions of P2X7 in cancer and other pathophysiological contexts.",,Funding.

This interaction allows the specific association of microbial communities, which participate in a variety of processes in the host including protection against pathogens. Marine aquatic invertebrates such as scallops are also colonized by diverse microbial communities. Scallops remain healthy most of the time, and in general, only a few species are fatally affected on adult stage by viral and bacterial pathogens. Still, high mortalities at larval stages are widely reported and they are associated with pathogenic Vibrio. Thus, to give new insights into the interaction between scallop immune response and its associated microbiota, we assessed the involvement of two host antimicrobial effectors in shaping the abundances of bacterial communities present in the scallop Argopecten purpuratus hemolymph. To do this, we first characterized the microbiota composition in the hemolymph from non-stimulated scallops, finding both common and distinct bacterial communities dominated by the Proteobacteria, Spirochaetes and Bacteroidetes phyla. Next, we identified dynamic shifts of certain bacterial communities in the scallop hemolymph along immune response progression, where host antimicrobial effectors were expressed at basal level and early induced after a bacterial challenge. Finally, the transcript silencing of the antimicrobial peptide big defensin ApBD1 and the bactericidal/permeability-increasing protein ApLBP/BPI1 by RNA interference led to an imbalance of target bacterial groups from scallop hemolymph. Specifically, a significant increase in the class Gammaproteobacteria and the proliferation of Vibrio spp. was observed in scallops silenced for each antimicrobial. Overall, our results strongly suggest that scallop antimicrobial peptides and proteins are implicated in the maintenance of microbial homeostasis and are key molecules in orchestrating host-microbiota interactions. This new evidence depicts the delicate balance that exists between the immune response of A. purpuratus and the hemolymph microbiota.","We thank German Lira for all his support with scallop maintenance and procurement.

However, the role of circRNAs in osteoblast mineralization remains largely unknown. Herein, we explored the expression profiles of circRNAs in 4 groups of osteoblasts with varying mineralization processes. Hsa_circ_0008500 (circ8500), which is upregulated in the RNA-seq data, is sifted through 194 candidate circRNAs in osteoblasts during mineralization. We characterize the features of novel circRNAs and find that the elevated expression of circ8500 promotes osteoblast mineralization. Mechanistically, circ8500 contains a critical binding site for miR-1301-3p. We further show that circ8500 competitively binds miR-1301-3p to abolish its suppressive effect on peptidyl arginine deiminase 4 (PADI4). PADI4 works as a binding partner of RUNX2 and stabilizes its protein expression levels by inhibiting the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. This work provides new insights on the circRNA patterns in osteoblasts and the role of PADI4 in matrix mineralization.","We thank Dr. Ye Zhang (PUMC, Beijing, China) for the pcDNA3.1-HA-PADI4 and pCMV-HA-Ubiquitin plasmids.",Funding.

Due to their specificity and sensitivity, γH2AX immunoassays have become the gold standard for studying DSB induction and repair. One of these assays relies on the immunofluorescent staining of γH2AX followed by microscopic imaging and foci counting. During the last years, semi- and fully automated image analysis, capable of fast detection and quantification of γH2AX foci in large datasets of fluorescence images, are gradually replacing the traditional method of manual foci counting. A major drawback of the non-commercial software for foci counting (available so far) is that they are restricted to 2D-image data. In practice, these algorithms are useful for counting the foci located close to the midsection plane of the nucleus, while the out-of-plane foci are neglected.ResultsTo overcome the limitations of 2D foci counting, we present a freely available ImageJ-based plugin (FocAn) for automated 3D analysis of γH2AX foci in z-image stacks acquired by confocal fluorescence microscopy. The image-stack processing algorithm implemented in FocAn is capable of automatic 3D recognition of individual cell nuclei and γH2AX foci, as well as evaluation of the total foci number per cell nucleus. The FocAn algorithm consists of two parts: nucleus identification and foci detection, each employing specific sequences of auto local thresholding in combination with watershed segmentation techniques. We validated the FocAn algorithm using fluorescence-labeled γH2AX in two glioblastoma cell lines, irradiated with 2 Gy and given up to 24 h post-irradiation for repair. We found that the data obtained with FocAn agreed well with those obtained with an already available software (FoCo) and manual counting. Moreover, FocAn was capable of identifying overlapping foci in 3D space, which ensured accurate foci counting even at high DSB density of up to ~ 200 DSB/nucleus.ConclusionsFocAn is freely available an open-source 3D foci analyzer. The user-friendly algorithm FocAn requires little supervision and can automatically count the amount of DNA-DSBs, i.e. fluorescence-labeled γH2AX foci, in 3D image stacks acquired by laser-scanning microscopes without additional nuclei staining.",The authors are grateful to the radiation therapists’ staff for their help with the irradiation procedure.,"This work was supported by the grant (No. 70112891 to CSD and VLS) of the Deutsche Krebshilfe e.V.

Research supports these conclusions in both U.S. and cross-cultural contexts, even though assumptions about parenting and the parent-child relationship may differ across cultures. However, for true understanding of cultural differences, it is important to have comparable measures across cultures. The purpose of the study is to assess measurement invariance of the two constructs of the Child-parent Relationship Scale using data gathered in programs serving low-income preschool children in the U.S.(n = 4,450) and Turkey (n = 592) from 2014 to 2015. Using Single-group Confirmatory Factor Analysis, the original factor structures of the Turkish and the English versions were tested. Besides, Multigroup Confirmatory Factor Analysis provided evidence for configural, metric, scalar invariance, strict factorial invariance or error variance invariance and construct level invariance across the two versions. Only configural invariance was established, which showed an agreement for the existence of an underlying theoretical construct for each subscale (Conflict and Closeness) of the Turkish and the English versions. However, item CPRS 4 was a non-significant item for Conflict in the Turkish version that affected the possibility to conduct further analyses. Findings encourage researchers to propose and assess cultural and linguistic adaptations for the Child-parent Relationship Scale before cross-cultural comparisons related to family relationships.","MG:Hacettepe University Scientific Research Unit (SDS-2015-5455).

METHODS: Two hundred fifty-three patients were included from three public mental health services from Bolivia, Peru, and Chile. Data were collected using the Drug Attitude Inventory (DAI-10) and the Schizophrenia Quality of Life short-version questionnaire (SQoL-18), which considers 8 dimensions.
RESULTS: Significant associations were found between adherence to antipsychotic medication treatment and QoL (S-QoL-18 index: β = 0.26, p = 0.004; self-esteem: β = 0.37, p = 0.000; and sentimental life: β = 0.20, p = 0.033). Associations of clinical and socio-demographic variables with QoL were identified: severity of psychotic symptoms, awareness of the disease, gender, age, and ethnicity were found to be associated with a lower level of QoL (β from 0.14 -0.56).
CONCLUSION: This study provides evidence of the association between adherence to treatment and quality of life in patients diagnosed with schizophrenia. Therefore, as in developed countries, improving adherence to antipsychotic medication would appear to be an important issue to address to improve patients' QoL in Latin American countries.",This research was funded in part by the Universidad de Tarapacá through Proyecto Mayor de Investigación Cientíﬁca y Tecnológica UTA no. 3732-16.,,Patient Preference and Adherence,,,,2020-09,2020,2020-09,,14,,1595-1604,All OA; Gold,Article,"Caqueo-Urízar, Alejandra; Urzúa, Alfonso; Mena-Chamorro, Patricio; Fond, Guillaume; Boyer, Laurent","Caqueo-Urízar, Alejandra (Instituto de Alta Investigación, Universidad de Tarapacá, Arica, Chile); Urzúa, Alfonso (Escuela de Psicología, Universidad Católica del Norte, Antofagasta, Chile); Mena-Chamorro, Patricio (Escuela de Psicología y Filosofía, Universidad de Tarapacá, Arica, Chile); Fond, Guillaume (Aix-Marseille Univ, EA 3279 – Public Health, Chronic Diseases and Quality of Life - Research Unit, Marseille, 13005, France); Boyer, Laurent (Aix-Marseille Univ, EA 3279 – Public Health, Chronic Diseases and Quality of Life - Research Unit, Marseille, 13005, France)","Caqueo-Urízar, Alejandra (University of Tarapacá)","Caqueo-Urízar, Alejandra (University of Tarapacá); Urzúa, Alfonso (Catholic University of the North); Mena-Chamorro, Patricio (University of Tarapacá); Fond, Guillaume (Aix-Marseille University); Boyer, Laurent (Aix-Marseille University)",13,7,0.83,4.22,https://www.dovepress.com/getfile.php?fileID=61135,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1130554733,42 Health Sciences; 4203 Health Services and Systems,3 Good Health and Well Being

Thus, the relationships among agricultural food production diversity (FPD), dietary diversity (DD), and household food insecurity (HFI) of the rural small holder farmers need further study. Therefore, we examined these associations in small holder farmers residing in this Province in the Andes Highlands (elevation > 2500 m). Non-pregnant maternal home managers (n = 558, x age = 44.1, SD = 16.5 y) were interviewed regarding the number of different agricultural food crops cultivated and domestic animals raised in their family farm plots. DD was determined using the Minimum Dietary Diversity for Women Score (MDD-W) based on the number of 10 different food groups consumed, and household food insecurity (HFI) was determined using the 8-item Household Food Insecurity Experience Scale. The women reported consuming an average of 53% of their total food from what they cultivated or raised. Women with higher DD [MMD-W score ≥ 5 food groups (79% of total sample)] were on farms that cultivated a greater variety of crops (x = 8.7 vs. 6.7), raised more animals (x = 17.9 vs. 12.7, p < 0.05), and reported lower HFI and significantly higher intakes of energy, protein, iron, zinc, and vitamin A (all p < 0.05). Multiple regression analyses demonstrated that FPD was only modestly related to DD, which together with years of education, per capita family income, and HFI accounted for 26% of DD variance. In rural areas of the Imbabura Province, small holder farmers still rely heavily on consumption of self-cultivated foods, but greater diversity of crops grown in family farm plots is only weakly associated with greater DD and lower HFI among the female caretakers.","We want to thank the study participants for their generous donation of time to provide information for this study.

The objectives of this study were to evaluate the effect of: (i) water quality, host sex, size and body condition on adult digenean parasite infections; (ii) digenean infections and host sex and size on the oxidative stress biomarkers and body condition of hosts; and (iii) water quality on the oxidative stress biomarkers and body condition in Clarias gariepinus. Water quality variables were measured and C. gariepinus were collected each month for a year for examination of two intestinal digeneans, Masenia nkomatiensis and Glossidium pedatum, and determination of body condition and measurement of biomarkers in the host. The results indicated that the intensity of M. nkomatiensis was positively correlated with electrical conductivity and total dissolved solids. Prevalence of G. pedatum was negatively correlated with electrical conductivity, salinity and total dissolved solids. High summer water temperature was strongly associated with high digenean infections. There was no host body condition, sex or size bias for any of the parasite infection variables. Differences in the biomarker levels and body condition between uninfected fish and those infected with M. nkomatiensis or G. pedatum were insignificant indicating a low effect of the digenean parasites on oxidative stress biomarkers and body condition in the fish. However, total protein levels were positively associated with host size, and lipid peroxidation was negatively related to host body condition; total protein levels were also positively correlated with temperature and negatively correlated with dissolved oxygen. Host body condition was only negatively correlated with dissolved oxygen. Overall the trends observed in the data showed that the parasites have a negligible effect on oxidative stress in host fish and the trends observed for all variables (water quality, stress biomarkers, body condition and parasite infections) showed a strong seasonal pattern.","We sincerely thank R.

The datasets have been developed to simultaneously solve a staffing and tour scheduling problem that incorporates flexible contracts and multiskilled staff. This Data in Brief article is related to the published article ""Hybrid flexibility strategy on personnel scheduling: Retail case study"" [1]. The datasets contain real, processed, and simulated data. Regarding the real and processed datasets, they are presented for three different store sizes (4, 5 or 6 departments). Real datasets include information about the employment-contract characteristics, cost parameters, and a forecast of the number of employees required in each department for each day of the week and each time period into which the operating day is divided. As regards the data processed for the case study, they include the set of skill sets considering that the employees can be trained in a maximum of two store departments. Regarding the simulated datasets, they include information about the random parameter of staff demand in each store department. The simulated data are presented in 90 text files classified by: (i) Store size (4, 5 or 6 departments). (ii) Coefficient of variation (10, 20, 30%). (iii) Instance identification number (10 instances per scenario that resulted from combining the store sizes and coefficients of variation). Researchers can use the datasets for benchmarking the performance of different approaches with the one presented by Porto et al. [1], and in consequence, they can find solutions to the same (or similar) type of personnel scheduling problem. The dataset includes an Excel workbook that can be used to randomly generate staff demand instances according to a chosen coefficient of variation.","This research was supported by “Fundación para la Promoción de la Investigación y la Tecnología (FPIT)” under Grants 4.254 and 4.523 and Universidad del Norte under Grant 2017–13.

METHODS: A cross-sectional study on adolescents aged 10 to 19 years. The instrument used to collect data contains demographic and socioeconomic information and 27 questions that assess the knowledge and acceptability of the HPV vaccine. To compare the prevalence of vaccinated adolescents with the correct answers to questions about HPV and acceptability and vaccination, the robust variance Poisson regression model was used in the Stata 13.0 software.
FINDINGS: A total of 190 adolescents participated in the study, 60.5% in the age group of vaccination recommended by the Brazilian government, among them, 53.9% reported not having been vaccinated (p <0.001). A total of 150 (78.9%) adolescents correctly recognized HPV as a virus; 121 (63.7%) recognized HPV as a cause of cervical cancer. Participants who know HPV is a causative factor for cervical cancer are 1.94 times more likely to have been vaccinated than those who do not. Among the interviewees, the main sources of knowledge about the vaccine were schools (51.6%) and health professionals (22.6%).

Here we present a study aimed at characterizing the viral fraction and the microbial communities through metagenomic analysis. Two ponds (H0 and H3) were examined in November 2015. Water samples were processed using tangential flow filtration to obtain metagenomes from which the DNA fraction of the sample was amplified and sequenced (HiSeq system, Illumina). The ponds were characterized by freshwater and the viral-like particles to picoplankton ratio was 12.1 and 2.3 for H0 and H3, respectively. A great number of unassigned viral sequences were found in H0 (55.8%) and H3 (32.8%), followed by the family Fuselloviridae 20.8% (H0) and other less relatively abundant groups such as Microviridae (H0, 11.7% and H3, 3.3%) and Inoviridae (H3, 2.7%). The dominant viral sequences in both metagenomes belong to the order Caudovirales, with Siphoviridae being the most important family, especially in H3 (32.7%). The most important bacteria phyla were Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes in both sites, followed by Cyanobacteria (H0). Genes encoding lysogenic and lytic enzymes (i.e., recombinases and integrases) were found in H0 and H3, indicating a potential for active viral replication at the time of sampling; this was supported by the presence of viral metabolic auxiliary genes at both sites (e.g., cysteine hydrolase). In total, our study indicates a great novelty of viral groups, differences in taxonomic diversity and replication pathways between sites, which contribute to a better understanding of how viruses balance the cycling of energy and matter in this extreme environment.","We are grateful to Melline Noronha and Ricardo Valencia for their technical support in data analysis.

METHODS: 113 EP-patients aged 18-35 were recruited from the Treatment and Early Intervention in Psychosis Program [TIPP-Lausanne]. Body Mass Index [BMI], Weight Gain [WG] and Waist Circumference [WC] were measured prospectively at baseline and after 1, 2, 3, 6 and 12 months of weight gain inducing psychotropic treatment. Patients were classified as Early-Trauma and Late-Trauma if the exposure had occurred before age 12 or between ages 12 and 16 respectively. Generalized Linear Mixed-Models were adjusted for age, sex, socioeconomic status, baseline BMI, medication and for diagnosis of depression.
RESULTS: Late-Trauma patients, when compared to Non-Trauma patients showed greater WCs during the follow-up [p = 0.013]. No differences were found in any of the other follow-up measures.
CONCLUSIONS: Exposition to CT during adolescence in EP-patients treated with psychotropic medication is associated with greater WC during the early phase of the disease. Further investigation exploring mechanisms underlying the interactions between peripubertal stress, corticoids responsiveness and a subsequent increase of abdominal adiposity is warranted.","This work represents an independent research part supported by the The Swiss National Science Foundation (no. 320030_135736/1 to P.C. and K.Q.D., no 320030-120686, 324730-144064 and 320030-173211 to C.B.E and PC and no 171804 to LA), the National Center of Competence in Research (NCCR) “SYNAPSY - The Synaptic Bases of Mental Diseases” from the Swiss National Science Foundation (n° 51NF40-158776) The Damm-Etienne and Alamaya Foundation were supporting the recruitment as well as the phenotyping (including psychopathology, neurocognition and neurobiological biomarkers) of our early psychosis patients cohort).

Microbial communities in SH are exposed to low atmospheric pressure, high UV radiation, wide temperature ranges, salinity gradient and the presence of toxic compounds such as arsenic (As). In this work we focus on arsenic stress as one of the main adverse factors in SH and bacteria that belong to the Exiguobacterium genus due to their plasticity and ubiquity. Therefore, our aim was to shed light on the effect of niche conditions pressure (particularly arsenic), on the adaptation and divergence (at genotypic and phenotypic levels) of Exiguobacterium strains from five different SH sites. Also, to capture greater diversity in this genus, we use as outgroup five As(III) sensitive strains isolated from Easter Island (Chile) and The Great Salt Lake (United States). For this, samples were obtained from five different SH sites under an arsenic gradient (9 to 321 mg/kg: sediment) and isolated and sequenced the genomes of 14 Exiguobacterium strains, which had different arsenic tolerance levels. Then, we used comparative genomic analysis to assess the genomic divergence of these strains and their association with phenotypic differences such as arsenic tolerance levels and the ability to resist poly-stress. Phylogenetic analysis showed that SH strains share a common ancestor. Consequently, populations were separated and structured in different SH microenvironments, giving rise to multiple coexisting lineages. Hence, this genotypic variability is also evidenced by the COG (Clusters of Orthologous Groups) composition and the size of their accessory genomes. Interestingly, these observations correlate with physiological traits such as growth patterns, gene expression, and enzyme activity related to arsenic response and/or tolerance. Therefore, Exiguobacterium strains from SH are adapted to physiologically overcome the contrasting environmental conditions, like the arsenic present in their habitat.","We like to thank Dra. Beatriz Cámara from Universidad Técnica Federico Santa María (Valparaiso - Chile) for kindly providing us with the Easter Island strains and David Garcia from Brigham Young University (Hawaii – United States) for the Great Salt Lake strains.

In the present study, the genetic diversity of a wild population from Neguanje Bay, Santa Marta (Colombia), was estimated using microsatellite markers, and the effect of the presence of null alleles on this estimation was assessed. A total of 8 microsatellite markers were developed, the first described for this species, and their amplification conditions were standardized. They were used to determine the genotype of 48 wild individuals from Naguanje Bay, and 1,010 individuals derived from the offspring of 38 directed crosses. For each locus, the frequencies of the identified alleles, including null alleles, were estimated using the statistical package Micro-Checker, and the parental genotypes were confirmed using segregation analysis. Three to 8 alleles per locus with frequencies from 0.001 to 0.632 were detected. The frequencies of null alleles ranged from 0.10 to 0.45, with Ho from 0.0 to 0.79, and He from 0.53 to 0.80. All loci were in H-W disequilibrium. The null allele frequencies values were high, with lower estimations using segregation analysis than estimated using Micro-Checker. The present results show high levels of population genetic diversity and indicate that null alleles were not the only cause of deviation from H-W equilibrium in all loci, suggesting that the wild population under study presents signs of inbreeding and Wahlund effect.","ACKNOWLEDGMENTS The authors thank to GIBEA research group of the Universidad del Magdalena, as well as Katherina Brokordt and Claudia Cárcamo of the Universidad Católica del Norte (Chile) for its support in the molecular analysis and María Vicenta Valdivia for her help in the preparation of the English version of the manuscript, the staff of the Laboratorio de Moluscos y Microalgas of the Universidad del Magdalena and the Asociación de Pescadores y Ostioneros de Taganga (ASPOTAG) for their help during the experiments.

However, filtering the noise while keeping fine details is a difficult task. This paper presents a method, based on sparse representations and singular value decomposition (SVD), for non-locally denoising MR images. The proposed method prevents blurring, artifacts, and residual noise. Our method is composed of three stages. The first stage divides the image into sub-volumes, to obtain its sparse representation, by using the KSVD algorithm. Then, the global influence of the dictionary atoms is computed to upgrade the dictionary and obtain a better reconstruction of the sub-volumes. In the second stage, based on the sparse representation, the noise-free sub-volume is estimated using a non-local approach and SVD. The noise-free voxel is reconstructed by aggregating the overlapped voxels according to the rarity of the sub-volumes it belongs, which is computed from the global influence of the atoms. The third stage repeats the process using a different sub-volume size for producing a new filtered image, which is averaged with the previously filtered images. The results provided show that our method outperforms several state-of-the-art methods in both simulated and real data.",We gratefully thank Mariana Pino for supplying the real clinical MR images used in this research.,This research was partially supported by the Administrative Department of Science and Technology of Colombia—COLCIENCIAS under the program of doctoral scholarship COLCIENCIAS-UNINORTE 2015-006.,Sensors,,,"Algorithms; Artifacts; Brain; Computer Simulation; Humans; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Models, Statistical; Phantoms, Imaging; Signal-To-Noise Ratio; Support Vector Machine",2020-03-10,2020,2020-03-10,,20,5,1536,All OA; Gold,Article,"Leal, Nallig; Zurek, Eduardo; Leal, Esmeide","Leal, Nallig (Department of Systems Engineering, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla 080001, Colombia;, ezurek@uninorte.edu.co); Zurek, Eduardo (Department of Systems Engineering, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla 080001, Colombia;, ezurek@uninorte.edu.co); Leal, Esmeide (Independent Consultant, Barranquilla 080001, Colombia;, esmeide0226@yahoo.com)","Leal, Nallig (Universidad del Norte)","Leal, Nallig (Universidad del Norte); Zurek, Eduardo (Universidad del Norte); Leal, Esmeide (Independent Consultant, Barranquilla 080001, Colombia;, esmeide0226@yahoo.com)",16,3,0.72,5.06,https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/20/5/1536/pdf?version=1583939132,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1125604698,40 Engineering; 4006 Communications Engineering; 46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4603 Computer Vision and Multimedia Computation,

METHODS: We performed a systematic review of published CPGs on CAP from January 2007 to May 2019. All reviewers independently assessed each CPG using the AGREE II instrument. A standardised score was calculated for each of the six domains.
RESULTS: Our search strategy identified 4125 citations but just 18 met our inclusion criteria. Agreement among reviewers was very good: 0.98. The domains that scored better were: ""scope and purpose"" and ""clarity and presentation"". Those that scored worse were ""editorial independence"", and ""applicability"". According to the AGREE II evaluation for each Guideline, the NICE, IDSA, BTS, SWAB, Korea, Consensur II, Colombian and Peruvian CPGs were the only recommended with no further modifications. In addition, ERS and SEPAR CPGs were recommended with modifications, with lower scores regarding the editorial independence and applicability.
CONCLUSION: In conclusion, published CPGs for CAP management vary in quality with a need to improve the methodological and applicability rigour.

One of those is the process of reintegrating ex-combatants into society, in which ensuring their rights to health is a particularly significant challenge in rural areas affected by armed conflict. These areas, known as Territorial Spaces for Training and ReintegrationReincorporation (ETCR, in Spanish), are geographically dispersed throughout 24 municipalities and 13 departments in Colombia. This study aimed to describe how ex-combatants in ETCR regions perceived access to health services one year after the signing of the peace accords. Methods: A descriptive, cross-sectional study was performed between September and October 2018. It included 591 adults and their families, from 23 ETCRs. The study was designed, culturally validated, and piloted. Interviewers were trained and a structured survey was administered containing five dimensions that characterized the perception of effective access to health services. Results: The majority of interviewees were women, heads of household, young adults, ex-combatants, and residents in an ETCR. In total of 96.4% were enrolled in Colombia's subsidized health system, and 20.8% indicated that a member of their household required emergency health services. The regional health center provided the majority of the services. Most of those surveyed (96.0%) reported that they did not have to pay for the services, and that they received respectful (91.6%) and good quality (66.6%) care. There were few referrals to disease prevention and health promotion activities, and only 19.0% of households reported having been visited by extramural health care teams, whose activities were highly valued (80%). Lastly, there was little knowledge about community health activities. Conclusions: While residents of ETCR regions have a favorable perception of their access to health services, they need to be made aware of extramural and public health activities.","The present work was performed under the auspices of Health for Peace, a project sponsored by the United Nation’s Multi-Donor Trust Fund for post-conflict (MDTF), led by the Ministry of Health and Social Protection and implemented by three United Nation agencies: United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), Pan-American Health Organization (PAHO/WHO), and the International Organization for Migration (OIM).

Although hair is used for reflecting the systemic level of this hormone, its use as a ""long-term"" measure appears clinically problematic. Local and systemic stress and non-stress related factors may release cortisol that is accumulated in hair. Non-stressful earwax sampling methods may provide a more accurate specimen to measure chronic cortisol concentration.
METHODS: Earwax from both ears of 37 controls were extracted using a clinical procedure commonly associated with local pain. One month later, earwax from the left ear side was extracted using the same procedure, and earwax from the right ear side was more comfortably obtained, using a novel earwax self-sampling device. Participants also provided one centimetre of hair that represented the retrospective month of cortisol output, and one serum sample that reflected the effect of systemic stressors on cortisol levels. Earwax (ECC), Hair (HCC) and Serum (SCC) Cortisol Concentration were correlated and compared. Confounders' effect on cortisol levels were studied.
RESULTS: The highest levels of cortisol concentration were found in serum, and the lowest in hair (p < 0.01). Left-ECC was larger than Right-ECC (p = 0.03). Right-ECC was the only sample unaffected by confounders (all p > 0.05). A Pearson correlation showed that Right-ECC and HCC samples were moderately correlated between them (r = 0.39; p = 0.03).
CONCLUSIONS: The self-sampling device did not increase cortisol locally. It provided the cortisol level that was least likely to be affected by confounding factors over the previous month. ECC using the novel device might constitute another accurate, but more suitable and affordable specimen for measuring chronic cortisol concentration.",The authors would like to thank Tomas Valdenegro and Bruno Aguilo for their support analysing the data and Dr Mark Coulson and Mr Joel Cols for his support in preparing and editing the manuscript.

Thereby, a beneficial investigation is to continue searching for new procedures to perform this task. A novel Monte Carlo Metropolis framework is presented for solving the equations of motion in Lagrangian systems. The implementation lies in sampling the path space with a probability functional obtained by using the maximum caliber principle. Free particle and harmonic oscillator problems are numerically implemented by sampling the path space for a given action by using Monte Carlo simulations. The average path converges to the solution of the equation of motion from classical mechanics, analogously as a canonical system is sampled for a given energy by computing the average state, finding the least energy state. Thus, this procedure can be general enough to solve other differential equations in physics and a useful tool to calculate the time-dependent properties of dynamical systems in order to understand the non-equilibrium behavior of statistical mechanical systems.","D.G. acknowledges Gonzalo Gutiérrez for the support as tutor during the PhD, where this ideas started.",This research was funded by “Beca de postdoctorado Universidad Católica del Norte” N0 0004/2019 (D.G.) and FONDECYT Grant 1171127 (S.D.) and Anillo ACT-172101 (S.D) and FONDECYT Grant 1170834 (S.C.),Entropy,,,,2020-08-21,2020,2020-08-21,,22,9,916,All OA; Gold,Article,"Diaz, Diego González; Davis, Sergio; Curilef, Sergio","Diaz, Diego González (Departamento de Física, Universidad Católica del Norte, Casilla 1280, Antofagasta, Chile;, scurilef@ucn.cl; Banco Itaú-Corpbanca, Casilla 80-D, Santiago, Chile); Davis, Sergio (Comisión Chilena de Energía Nuclear, Casilla 188-D, Santiago, Chile;, sdavis@cchen.cl); Curilef, Sergio (Departamento de Física, Universidad Católica del Norte, Casilla 1280, Antofagasta, Chile;, scurilef@ucn.cl)","Diaz, Diego González (Catholic University of the North; Banco Itaú-Corpbanca, Casilla 80-D, Santiago, Chile)","Diaz, Diego González (Catholic University of the North; Banco Itaú-Corpbanca, Casilla 80-D, Santiago, Chile); Davis, Sergio (Comisión Chilena de Energía Nuclear); Curilef, Sergio (Catholic University of the North)",3,1,0.69,,https://www.mdpi.com/1099-4300/22/9/916/pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1130282052,49 Mathematical Sciences; 51 Physical Sciences,

However, FARC ex-combatants have faced significant challenges in receiving healthcare, and little is known about physicians' abilities to address this population's healthcare needs.
METHODS: An electronic questionnaire sent to the Colombian Emergency Medicine professional society and teaching hospitals assessed physicians' knowledge, attitudes, and experiences with the FARC ex-combatant reincorporation process.
RESULTS: Among 53 participants, most were male (60.4%), and ∼25% were affected by the FARC conflict (22.6%). Overall knowledge of FARC reincorporation was low, with nearly two-thirds of participants (61.6%) scoring in the lowest category. Attitudes around ex-combatants showed low bias. Few physicians received training about reincorporation (7.5%), but 83% indicated they would like such training. Twenty-two participants (41.5%) had identified a patient as an ex-combatant in the healthcare setting. Higher knowledge scores were significantly correlated with training about reincorporation (r = 0.354, n = 53, P = 0.015), and experience identifying patients as ex-combatants (r = 0.356, n = 47, P = 0.014).
CONCLUSION: Findings suggested high interest in training and low knowledge of the reincorporation process. Most physicians had low bias, frequent experiences with ex-combatants, and cared for these patients when they self-identify. The emergency department (ED) serves as an entrance into healthcare for this population and a potential setting for interventions to improve care delivery, especially those related to mental healthcare. Future studies could evaluate effects of care delivery following training on ex-combatant healthcare reintegration.",CONFLICTS Of INTEREST The authors declare no conflicts of interest.,"Funding and support: This project was funded through a Fulbright U.S. Student Researcher Scholarship, with Pontificia Universidad Javeriana, Bogotá as the Fulbright Host Country Supporting University, and Brown Emergency Medicine Innovation Grant.",Journal of the American College of Emergency Physicians Open,,,,2020-05-05,2020,2020-05-05,2020-10,1,5,757-765,All OA; Gold,Article,"Reynolds, Christopher W.; Aguiar, Leonar G.; Moretti, Katelyn; Duarte, Andres; Romero, Fabián Andrés Rosas; Patiño, Andres; Fricke, Adrienne; Zarama, Virginia; Moreno, Atilio; Carranza, Heidy; Arbelaez, Christian","Reynolds, Christopher W.

Conventional surgical methods are not applicable in some special types of nerve injury, prompting scholars to seek to develop more effective nerve translocation repair technologies. The purpose of this study was to explore the functional state of neurons in injured lower limbs after translocation repair, with a view to preliminarily clarify the molecular mechanisms underlying this process. Eighteen Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into the normal, tibial nerve in situ repair, and common peroneal nerve transposition repair tibial nerve groups. Nerve function assessment and immunohistochemical staining of neurofilament 200 (NF-200), protein kinase B (Akt), mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), and ribosomal protein S6 kinase (p70S6K) in the dorsal root ganglia were performed at 12 weeks after surgery. Tibial nerve function and neuroelectrophysiological analysis, osmic acid staining, muscle strength testing, and muscle fiber staining showed that the nerve translocation repair could restore the function of the recipient nerve to a certain extent; however, the repair was not as efficient as the in situ repair. Immunohistochemical staining showed that the translocation repair resulted in changes in the microstructure of neuronal cell bodies, and the expressions of Akt, mTOR, and p70S6K in the three dorsal root ganglia groups were significantly different (p < 0.05). This study demonstrates that the nerve translocation repair technology sets up a new reflex loop, with the corresponding neuroskeletal adjustments, in which, donor neurons dominate the recipient nerves. This indicates that nerve translocation repair technology can lead to neuronal remodeling and is important as a supplementary treatment for a peripheral nerve injury. Furthermore, the Akt/mTOR/p70S6K signaling pathway may be involved in the formation of the new neural reflex loop created as a result of the translocation repair.",,"Funding.

The pathogen infects gastroenteric epithelia, including digestive gland, disrupting the digestive system and causing a progressive wilting in abalone. Nonetheless, our knowledge about WS implications in digestive gland microbiota, and its role in diseases progress remains largely unknown. This study aims to determine whether digestive gland-associated microbiota differs between healthy red abalone (Haliotis rufescens) and red abalone affected with WS. Using high-throughput sequencing of the V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene, our results revealed differences in microbiota between groups. Bacterial genera, including Mycoplasma, Lactobacillus, Cocleimonas and Tateyamaria were significantly more abundant in healthy abalones, whilst Candidatus Xenohaliotis californiensis and Marinomonas were more abundant in WS-affected abalones. Whilst Mycoplasma was the dominant genus in the healthy group, Candidatus Xenohaliotis californiensis was dominant in the WS group. However, Candidatus Xenohaliotis californiensis was present in two healthy specimens, and thus the Mycoplasma/Candidatus Xenohaliotis californiensis ratio appears to be more determinant in specimens affected with WS.

Most ENM algorithms provide normally exhaustive searches through variable space; however, selecting variables to include in models is a first challenge. The estimation of the explanatory power of variables and the selection of the most appropriate variable set within models can be a second challenge. Although some ENMs incorporate the variable selection rubric inside the algorithms, there is no integrated rubric to evaluate the variable importance in the Genetic Algorithm for Ruleset Production (GARP). Here, we designed a novel variable selection methodology based on the rulesets generated from a GARP experiment. The importance of the variables in a GARP experiment can be estimated based on the consideration of the prevalence of each environmental variable in the dominant presence rules of the best subset of models and its coverage. We tested the performance of this variable selection method based on simulated species with both weak and strong responses to simulated environmental covariates. The variable selection method generally performed well during the simulations with over 2/3 of the trials correctly identifying most covariates. We then predict the distribution of Toxostoma rufum (a bird with a cosmopolitan distribution) in the continental United States (US) and apply our variable selection procedure as a real-world example. We found that the distribution of T. rufum could be accurately modeled with 13 or 10 of 21 variables, using an UI cutoff of 0.5 or 0.25, respectively, arriving at parsimonious environmental coverages with good model accuracy. We also provide tools to simulate species distributions for testing ENM approaches using R.","This study was supported by the National Institutes of Health (No. 1R01GM117617) to Jason K. Blackburn.

The results indicated a bacteriolytic effect at both early and late target growth at 3 h of incubation and total cell death at 6 h when EDTA was co-inoculated with the peptide. Based on BAGEL 4 (Bacteriocin Genome Mining Tool) a putative bacteriocin having 33.4% sequence similarity to enterolysin A was detected within the contig 12. The interaction between the peptide UTNGt21O and the target strains caused permeability in a dose-, time- response manner, with Salmonella (3200 AU/mL) more susceptible than E. coli (6400 AU/mL). The results indicated that UTNGt21O may damage the integrity of the cell target, leading to release of cytoplasmic components followed by cell death. Differences in membrane shape changes in target cells treated with different doses of peptide were observed by transmission electronic microscopy (TEM). Spheroplasts with spherical shapes were detected in Salmonella while larger shaped spheroplasts with thicker and deformed membranes along with filamentous cells were observed in E. coli upon the treatment with the UTNGt21O peptide. These results indicate the promising potential of the putative bacteriocin released by the novel W. cibaria strain UTNGt21O to be further tested as a new antimicrobial substance.",The skillful technical assistance of D.

Extremophile microbial communities inhabiting evaporitic halite nodules (salt rocks) in the Atacama Desert, Chile, are a good model ecosystem for investigating factors leading to microbiome heterogeneity, due to their diverse taxonomic composition and the spatial segregation of individual nodules. We investigated the abiotic factors governing microbiome composition across different spatial scales, allowing for insight into the factors that govern halite colonization from regional desert-wide scales to micro-scales within individual nodules. We found that water availability and community drift account for microbiome assembly differently at different distance scales, with higher rates of cell dispersion at the smaller scales resulting in a more homogenous composition. This trend likely applies to other endoliths, and to non-desert communities, where dispersion between communities is limited. At the intra-nodule scales, a light availability gradient was most important in determining the distribution of microbial taxa despite intermixing by water displacement via capillary action.","We thank Mathias Meier for capturing aerial drone footage of the sampling area, Victoria Meslier for their help in sample collection, and Brian Glass for organizing field expeditions.",Funding.

CHIKV causes a severe and debilitating disease with high morbidity. The first Colombian autochthonous case was reported in the Colombian Caribbean region in September 2014. Within the next two to three months, the CHIKV outbreak reached its peak. Although the CHIKV pattern of clinical symptomatology has been documented in different epidemiological studies, understanding of the relationship between clinical symptomatology and variation in phenotypic response to CHIKV infection in humans remains limited. We performed a cross sectional study following 1160 individuals clinically diagnosed with CHIKV at the peak of the Chikungunya outbreak in the Colombian Caribbean region. We examined the relationship between symptomatology and diverse phenotypic responses. Latent Class Cluster Analysis (LCCA) models were used to characterize patients' symptomatology and further identify subgroups of individuals with differential phenotypic response. We found that most individuals presented fever (94.4%), headache (73.28%) and general discomfort (59.4%), which are distinct clinical symptoms of a viral infection. Furthermore, 11/26 (43.2%) of the categorized symptoms were more frequent in women than in men. LCCA disclosed seven distinctive phenotypic response profiles in this population of CHIKV infected individuals. Interestingly, 282 (24.3%) individuals exhibited a lower symptomatic ""extreme"" phenotype and 74 (6.4%) patients were within the severe complex ""extreme"" phenotype. Although clinical symptomatology may be diverse, there are distinct symptoms or group of symptoms that can be correlated with differential phenotypic response and perhaps susceptibility to CHIKV infection, especially in the female population. This suggests that, comparatively to men, women are a CHIKV at-risk population. Further study is needed to validate these results and determine whether the distinct LCCA profiles are a result of the immune response or a mixture of genetic, lifestyle and environmental factors. Our findings could contribute to the development of machine learning approaches to characterizing CHIKV infection in other populations. Preliminary results have shown prediction models achieving up to 92% accuracy overall, with substantial sensitivity, specificity and accuracy values per LCCA-derived cluster.",The author(s) received no specific funding for this work.

We investigated the associations between excess adiposity, body shape evolution across life, and risk of premenopausal breast cancer among 406 cases (women aged 20–45) and 406 matched population-based controls from Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, and Mexico. Negative associations between adult adiposity and breast cancer risk were observed in adjusted models (body mass index (BMI): Odds ratio (OR) per 1 kg/m2 = 0.93; 95% confidence interval = 0.89–0.96; waist circumference (WC): OR per 10 cm = 0.81 (0.69–0.96); hip circumference (HC): OR per 10 cm = 0.80 (0.67–0.95)). Height and leg length were not associated with risk. In normal weight women (18.5 ≤ BMI < 25), women with central obesity (WC > 88 cm) had an increased risk compared to women with normal WC (OR = 3.60(1.47–8.79)). Residuals of WC over BMI showed positive associations when adjusted for BMI (OR per 10 cm = 1.38 (0.98–1.94)). Body shape at younger ages and body shape evolution were not associated with risk. No heterogeneity was observed by receptor status. In this population of Latin American premenopausal women, different fat distributions in adulthood were differentially associated with risk of breast cancer.","The author wish to thank the substantial support provided by the research nurses and health workers as well as Tracy Lignini, Dacia Cristin, Cecile Le Duc, Jordi de Battle, and Talita Duarte-Salles, Ana Cristina Ocampo for the logistic and data basis development, and Vivian Viallon, who provided statistical support.

As both host and T. cruzi are highly genetically diverse, many variables come into play during infection, making disease outcomes difficult to predict. One important challenge in the field of Chagas disease research is determining the main factors leading to parasite establishment in the chronic stage in some organs, mainly the heart and/or digestive system. Our group previously showed that distinct strains of T. cruzi (JG and Col1.7G2) acquired differential tissue distribution in the chronic stage in dually infected BALB/c mice. To investigate changes in the host triggered by the two distinct T. cruzi strains, we assessed the gene expression profiles of BALB/c mouse hearts infected with either JG, Col1.7G2 or an equivalent mixture of both parasites during the initial phase of infection. This study demonstrates the clear differences in modulation of host gene expression by both parasites. Col1.7G2 strongly activated Th1-polarized immune signature genes, whereas JG caused only minor activation of the host immune response. Moreover, JG strongly reduced the expression of genes encoding ribosomal proteins and mitochondrial proteins related to the electron transport chain. Interestingly, the evaluation of gene expression in mice inoculated with a mixture of the parasites produced expression profiles with both up- and downregulated genes, indicating the coexistence of both parasite strains in the heart during the acute phase. This study suggests that different strains of T. cruzi may be distinguished by their efficiency in activating the immune system, modulating host energy metabolism and reactive oxygen species production and decreasing protein synthesis during early infection, which may be crucial for parasite persistence in specific organs.","We would like to acknowledge the valuable contributions of Neuza Antunes Rodrigues and Afonso da Costa Viana, who assisted us with the mouse procedures and parasite handling, and Fabricio Rodrigues dos Santos for providing access to the 7900HT Fast Real-Time PCR System for the qPCR analyses.

Recent studies have suggested that ADHD patients might present with atypical central myelination that can persist into adulthood. Given the essential role of sphingolipids in myelin formation and maintenance, we explored genetic variation in sphingolipid metabolism genes for association with ADHD risk. Whole-exome genotyping was performed in three independent cohorts from disparate regions of the world, for a total of 1520 genotyped subjects. Cohort 1 (MTA (Multimodal Treatment study of children with ADHD) sample, 371 subjects) was analyzed as the discovery cohort, while cohorts 2 (Paisa sample, 298 subjects) and 3 (US sample, 851 subjects) were used for replication. A set of 58 genes was manually curated based on their roles in sphingolipid metabolism. A targeted exploration for association between ADHD and 137 markers encoding for common and rare potentially functional allelic variants in this set of genes was performed in the screening cohort. Single- and multi-locus additive, dominant and recessive linear mixed-effect models were used. During discovery, we found statistically significant associations between ADHD and variants in eight genes (GALC, CERS6, SMPD1, SMPDL3B, CERS2, FADS3, ELOVL5, and CERK). Successful local replication for associations with variants in GALC, SMPD1, and CERS6 was demonstrated in both replication cohorts. Variants rs35785620, rs143078230, rs398607, and rs1805078, associated with ADHD in the discovery or replication cohorts, correspond to missense mutations with predicted deleterious effects. Expression quantitative trait loci analysis revealed an association between rs398607 and increased GALC expression in the cerebellum.","We are grateful to the individuals with ADHD and their families for their participation.

These relations can also occur transgenerationally. For instance, progeny plants whose mothers experienced herbivory can be more resistant to herbivores. Certain fungal endophytes that are vertically transmitted endow plants with alkaloids and resistance to herbivores. However, endophyte-symbiotic plants exposed to the oxidative agent ozone became susceptible to aphids. Here, we explored whether this effect persists transgenerationally. We exposed Lolium multiflorum plants with and without fungal endophyte Epichloë occultans to ozone (120 or 0 ppb), and then, challenged the progeny with aphids (Rhopalosiphum padi). The endophyte was the main factor determining the resistance to aphids, but its importance diminished in plants with ozone history. This negative ozone effect on the endophyte-mediated resistance was apparent on aphid individual weights. Phenolic compounds in seeds were increased by the symbiosis and diminished by the ozone. The endophyte effect on phenolics vanished in progeny plants while the negative ozone effect persisted. Independently of ozone, the symbiosis increased the plant biomass (≈24%). Although ozone can diminish the importance of endophyte symbiosis for plant resistance to herbivores, it would be compensated by host growth stimulation.",We thank the three anonymous reviewers whose work and suggestions helped us to significantly improve the article. We thank Patricia Demkura for her laboratory assistance and Marta C. Telesnicki for her experience and aphid knowledge.,"This research was funded by projects from the Argentinean Agencia Nacional de Promoción Científica FONCyT (PICT-2355, and PICT-2018-1593).",Insects,,,,2020-08-19,2020,2020-08-19,,11,9,548,All OA; Gold,Article,"Bustos, Ludmila M.

We know that these seniors live increasingly alone, and this impairs their health and general wellbeing. Studies suggest that social networking sites (SNS) can reduce isolation, improve social participation, and increase autonomy. However, there is a lack of knowledge about the characteristics of older adult users of SNS in these new territories. Without this information, it is not possible to improve the adoption of SNS in this population. Based on decision trees, this study analyzes how the elderly users of various SNS in Chile are like. For this purpose, a segmentation of the different groups of elderly users of social networks was constructed, and the most discriminating variables concerning the use of these applications were classified. The results highlight the existence of considerable differences between the various social networks analyzed in their use and characterization. Educational level is the most discriminating variable, and gender influences the types of SNS use. In general, it is observed that the higher the educational level, the more the different social networking sites are used.",,"This research was funded by Universidad Católica del Norte (CHILE) and supported by CONICYT-Chile, through the MEC program, grant no. 80180034.",International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health,,,Aged; Chile; Educational Status; Hong Kong; Humans; Public Health; Social Media; Social Networking,2020-08-01,2020,2020-08-21,2020-08-01,17,17,6078,All OA; Gold,Article,"Rondán-Cataluña, Francisco Javier; Ramírez-Correa, Patricio E.; Arenas-Gaitán, Jorge; Ramírez-Santana, Muriel; Grandón, Elizabeth E.; Alfaro-Pérez, Jorge","Rondán-Cataluña, Francisco Javier (Department Business Management and Marketing, University of Seville, 41004 Sevilla, Spain;, rondan@us.es, (F.J.R.-C.);, jarenas@us.es, (J.A.-G.)); Ramírez-Correa, Patricio E.

In this study, we used seascape genomic tools to evaluate the genetic structure of the commercially important ascidian Pyura chilensis, a species that exhibits a low larval transport potential but high anthropogenic dispersal. A recent study in this species recorded significant genetic differentiation across a transition zone around 30°S in putatively adaptive SNPs, but not in neutral ones, suggesting an important role of environmental heterogeneity in driving genetic structure. Here, we aim to understand genomic-oceanographic associations in P. chilensis along the Southeastern Pacific coast using two combined seascape genomic approaches. Using 149 individuals from five locations along the HCS, a total of 2,902 SNPs were obtained by Genotyping-By-Sequencing, of which 29–585 were putatively adaptive loci, depending on the method used for detection. In adaptive loci, spatial genetic structure was better correlated with environmental differences along the study area (mainly to Sea Surface Temperature, upwelling-associated variables and productivity) than to the geographic distance between sites. Additionally, results consistently showed the presence of two groups, located north and south of 30°S, which suggest that local adaptation processes seem to allow the maintenance of genomic differentiation and the spatial genomic structure of the species across the 30°S biogeographic transition zone of the Humboldt Current System, overriding the homogenizing effects of gene flow.","Authors thanks to Natalia Muñoz-Herrera, Raúl Vera and Francisca Gálvez for help with sampling and laboratory procedures.

Gibberellin (GA) is a key modulator of internode elongation in sugarcane. Understanding the gene expression features of GA-mediated internode elongation has both scientific and practical significance. This study aimed to examine the transcriptomic changes in the internode elongation of sugarcane following GA treatment. Eighteen cDNA libraries from the internode tissues on days of 0, 3, and 6 in control and GA treatment groups were sequenced and their gene expression were studied. RNA-seq analysis revealed 1,338,723,248 reads and 70,821 unigenes from elongating internodes of sugarcane. Comparative studies discovered a large number of transcripts that were differentially expressed in GA-treated samples compared to the control. Further analysis revealed that the differentially expressed genes were enriched in the metabolic process, one-carbon compound transport, and single-organism process. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway annotation showed significant enrichment in photosynthesis and plant hormone signal transduction, indicating its involvement in internode elongation. The function analysis suggested that metabolic pathways and biosynthesis of secondary metabolites, plant hormones, and cell wall components were enriched in the internodes of the GA-treated plants. The hub genes were identified, with the function of cellulose synthesis. The results of this study provide a global view of mRNA changes during sugarcane internode elongation and extend our knowledge of the GA-mediated cellular processes involved in sugarcane stem growth.",,"Funding.

This study aims to evaluate the mechanical properties resulting from the making of Portland cement mixtures with tailings as aggregates so that they can be eventually used in paving stones for building inactive tailings dams. Tailings coming from two dams at a concentration plant located in Taltal (Chile) were used. Currently, Dam 1 is inactive, while Dam 2 is active. The tailings samples obtained from both dams were granulometrically characterized by sieving. In addition, pH, humidity, Eh, and mineralogical assays (sulfides, oxides, sulfates, carbonates, phosphates, and silicates) were measured. The fines content of the tailings from Dams 1 and 2 with a sieve size of N°200 ASTM were 76.2% and 29.6%, respectively. Therefore, owing to their high percentage of fines, they cannot be as used as concrete aggregates. Aggregates must contain a maximum percentage of fines so that mortars and concrete can meet Chilean standards. In this paper, to comply with a 7% and 15% fines content lower than 0.075 mm, tailings materials were mixed with conventional aggregates containing very little fines. In addition, a reference mixture was made with only tailings aggregates with and without a superplasticizer additive. To measure the mixtures of cement, aggregates, and tailings, bending and compression strength assays were made of the specimens after a 28-day curing, according to the Chilean standard. The results of the study show that the addition of only part of the tailings to the mixture increases bending strength by 26% and compression strength by 180% compared with the reference mortar, with a fines content lower than 0.075 mm in the 7% mixture, thus allowing paving stone manufacture with tailings materials. In addition, it was possible to increase the workability of the reference mixture by using superplasticizers as additives.","The authors are thankful to “Rapid Implementation Projects-Pilot Scaling”, Universidad Católica del Norte, Engineering Project 2030, 16ENl2-71940, for the financial support of this project.","This research was funded by “Rapid Implementation Projects-Pilot Scaling”, Universidad Católica del Norte, Engineering Project 2030, 16ENl2-71940.",International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health,,,Chile; Construction Materials; Copper; Mining; Sulfides,2020-04-01,2020,2020-04-03,2020-04-01,17,7,2448,All OA; Gold,Article,"Lam, Elizabeth J.; Zetola, Vicente; Ramírez, Yendery; Montofré, Ítalo L.; Pereira, Franco","Lam, Elizabeth J.

Severity classification is based on the Glasgow Coma Scale. However, the neurological worsening in an acute setting does not always correspond to the initial severity suggesting an underestimation of the real magnitude of the injury.
Objective: To study the correlation between the initial severity according to the Glasgow Coma Scale and the patient outcome in the context of different clinical and tomography variables.
Materials and methods: We analyzed a retrospective cohort of 490 patients with closed traumatic brain injury requiring a stay in the intensive care unit of two third-level hospitals in Barranquilla. The risk was estimated by calculating the OR (95% CI). The significance level was established at an alpha value of 0.05.
Results: Forty-one percent of all patients required orotracheal intubation; 51.2% were initially classified with moderate trauma and 6,0% as mild. The delay in the aggressive management of the traumas affected mainly those patients with traumas classified as moderate in whom lethality increased to 100% when there was delay in the detection of the neurological worsening and in the establishment of the aggressive treatment beyond 4 to 8 hours while the lethality in patients who received this treatment within the first hour reduced to <20%.
Conclusions: The risk of lethality in traumatic brain injury increases with the delayed detection of neurological worsening in an acute setting, especially when aggressive management is performed after the first hour post-trauma.","Manifestamos nuestro agradecimiento especial al Hospital Universidad del Norte y a la Fundación Clínica Campbell, por proporcionar acceso a los registros clínicos para esta investigación.",,Biomédica,,,"Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Brain Injuries, Traumatic; Child; Colombia; Coma; Combined Modality Therapy; Confidence Intervals; Consciousness Disorders; Decompressive Craniectomy; Female; Foundations; Glasgow Coma Scale; Hospitals, University; Humans; Hypertonic Solutions; Hypnotics and Sedatives; Intubation, Intratracheal; Male; Middle Aged; Odds Ratio; Retrospective Studies; Subarachnoid Hemorrhage, Traumatic; Young Adult",2020-03-01,2020,2020-03-01,,40,1,89-101,All OA; Gold,Article,"Rodríguez, Alexander; Cervera, Eliana; Tuesca, Rafael; Flórez, Karen; Romero, Ricardo; Villalba, Pedro J.","Rodríguez, Alexander (Departamento de Medicina, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia, Universidad del Norte, Departamento de Medicina, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); Cervera, Eliana (Departamento de Medicina, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia, Universidad del Norte, Departamento de Medicina, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); Tuesca, Rafael (Departamento de Medicina, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia, Universidad del Norte, Departamento de Medicina, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); Flórez, Karen (Departamento de Medicina, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia, Universidad del Norte, Departamento de Medicina, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); Romero, Ricardo (Unidad de Cuidado Intensivo, Fundación Clínica Campbell, Barranquilla, Colombia, Fundación Clínica Campbell, Barranquilla, Colombia); Villalba, Pedro J.

This tendency promotes sustainability, but its use depends mainly on the final product's properties, such as chemical stability. This study evaluates the physical and chemical properties of RCAs from two different sources in comparison with the performance of NA. One RCA was obtained from the demolition of a building (recycled concrete aggregate of a building-RCAB) and another RCA from the rehabilitation of a Portland cement concrete pavement (recycled concrete aggregate from a pavement-RCAP). Characterization techniques such as X-ray fluorescence (XRF), X-ray diffraction (XRD), UV spectroscopy, and atomic absorption spectrometry were used to evaluate the RCAs' coarse fractions for chemical potential effects on asphalt mixtures. NA was replaced with RCA at 15%, 30%, and 45% for each size of the coarse fractions (retained 19.0, 12.5, 9.5, and 4.75 sieves in mm). The mineralogical characterization results indicated the presence of quartz (SiO2) and calcite (CaCO3) as the most significant constituents of the aggregates. XFR showed that RCAs have lower levels of CaO and Al2O3 concerning NA. Potential reactions in asphalt mixtures by nitration, sulfonation, amination of organic compounds, and reactions by alkaline activation in the aggregates were discarded due to the minimum concentration of components such as NO2, (-SO3H), (-SO2Cl), and (Na) in the aggregates. Finally, this research concludes that studied RCAs might be used as replacements of coarse aggregate in asphalt mixtures since chemical properties do not affect the overall chemical stability of the asphalt mixture.","The authors thank the Universidad del Norte for sponsoring this research, and the Universidad Distrital Francisco José de Caldas.

Nevertheless, these positive effects appear to be modulated by the composition and amount of the N pool in the soil, being greater when plant hosts are growing where N is scarce as is the case of Antarctic soils. Nevertheless, in some coastal areas of this continent, seabirds and marine mammal colonies exert, through their accumulated feces and urine a strong influence on the edaphic N content surrounding their aggregation points. To evaluate if the fungal symbionts (root endophytes), associated to the only two Antarctic vascular plants Colobanthus quitensis and Deschampsia antarctica, act as N-uptake enhancers, even in such N-rich conditions as those found around animal influence, we assessed, under controlled conditions, the process of N mineralization in soil by the accumulation of NH4 + in the rizhosphere and the biomass accumulation of plants with (E+) and without (E-) fungal symbionts. Complementarily, taking advantage of the isotopic N-fractionation that root-fungal symbionts exert on organic N molecules during its acquisition process, we also determined if endophytes actively participate in the Antarctic plants N-uptake, when inorganic N is not a limiting factor, by estimating the δ15N isotopic signatures in leaves. Overall, symbiotic interaction increased the availability of NH4 + in the rhizosphere of both species. As expected, the enhanced availability of inorganic N resulted in a higher final biomass in E + compared with E- plants of both species. In addition, we found that the positive role of fungal symbionts was also actively linked to the process of N-uptake in both species, evidenced by the contrasting δ15N signatures present in E+ (-0.4 to -2.3‰) relative to E- plants (2.7-3.1‰). In conclusion, despite being grown under rich N soils, the two Antarctic vascular plants showed that the presence of root-fungal endophytes, furthermore enhanced the availability of inorganic N sources in the rhizosphere, has a positive impact in their biomass, remarking the active participation of these endophytes in the N-uptake process for plants inhabiting the Antarctic continent.","We thank the Chilean Antarctic Institute (INACH) and the “Henryk Arctowski” Polish Antarctic Station for their logistical support.

We studied the Maipo River Basin, one of the most polluted with untreated wastewater in Chile, for a period of 12 years (2007-2019). Since the implementation of new public policies, including the operation of a wastewater collector (2012), the Maipo River Basin is currently much less polluted by untreated water than before. To analyze the impact of wastewater reduction in this river basin, we studied the native silverside (Basilichthys microlepidotus), which inhabits both polluted and unpolluted areas of the river basin. Previous studies reported the overexpression of the ornithine decarboxylase (odc) gene, heterozygote deficit, and high frequency of a homozygote odc genotype in silverside populations that inhabit wastewater-polluted sites, suggesting a phenotypic change and genotypic selection in response to pollution. Here, a population affected and another population unaffected by wastewater were studied before and after implementing the wastewater collector. The physicochemical data of water samples, changes in odc expression and microsatellite variability, and odc genotype frequencies were analyzed. The results showed physicochemical changes in the affected site before and after the operation of the wastewater collector. The microsatellite loci showed no changes in either population. The odc expression in the affected site was higher before the operation of the wastewater collector. Significant changes in the genotype frequencies of the odc gene before and after the wastewater collector operation were detected only at the affected site, wherein the homozygous dominant genotype decreased from >59% to <25%. Our results suggest that public policies aimed at mitigating aquatic pollution can indirectly affect both gene expression and genotype frequencies of important functional genes.","ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS Authors thanks C Quezada‐Romegialli, S Scott, R Gauci, M Briones, J Cortes, and P Acuña for fieldwork.

Objective: To establish the prevalence of Leptospira spp. in vaccinated working dogs and in the occupationally exposed population in six police units in Colombia.
Materials and methods: A total of 92 vaccinated dogs (65 males and 27 females) and 69 people from six police units in the municipalities of Manizales, Pereira, Armenia, Ibagué, Tuluá, and Cali were tested. Three structured instruments were applied and blood samples were obtained from people and dogs, which were processed with the microagglutination test (MAT) in 24 serogroups. A clinical examination of the dogs was performed and urine samples were obtained for urine cultures.
Results: The seroprevalence of human leptospirosis was 2.9% (n=2) and in dogs, it was 57.61% (n=53). Among the dogs, serogroups L. canicola and L. panama were the most prevalent. Urine cultures were positive in 58.7% (54/92) of the samples. A statistically significant association was found between the age of the dogs (≥10 years; p=0.043) and the location of the police unit (p=0.016) with the urine culture.
Conclusion: The epidemiological characteristics of leptospirosis in dogs suggest an endemic presentation of the infection. There is an urgent need to improve current diagnostic methods to investigate canine leptospirosis and differentiate between vaccine and natural infection antibodies.","Los autores agradecen a la Vicerrectoría de Investigaciones y Posgrados de la Universidad de Caldas, la Universidad del Valle y la Policía Nacional, por la financiación de la investigación.",,Biomédica,,,Adult; Animals; Bacterial Vaccines; Colombia; Dog Diseases; Dogs; Female; Humans; Leptospirosis; Male; Occupational Diseases; Prevalence; Risk Assessment; Working Dogs; Young Adult,2020-05-01,2020,2020-05-01,,40,Supl. 1,62-75,All OA; Gold,Article,"Murcia, César A.; Astudillo, Miryam; Romero, Marlyn H.","Murcia, César A.

Comparative studies of EPS production by cells grown on ferrous ions or pyrite were carried out. The chemical composition of capsular and colloidal EPS produced by Acidithiobacillus (At.) ferrooxidans Ksh were revealed to be proteins and carbohydrates. Exosaccharide produced by At. ferrooxidans Ksh is present mainly as polysaccharide in contrast to Leptospirillum (L.) ferriphilum CC, which is oligosaccharide.

Academic developments in social innovation have mainly occurred in and been documented for English-speaking countries, although relevant experiences have been implemented in Latin America. In this article, we describe and analyze how social innovation in health is being approached and understood in this region.Main textTo identify the theoretical and methodological developments of social innovation in health between 2013 and 2018, a scoping review with a mixed approach was carried out. Eighty texts in English, Spanish and Portuguese were selected for a process of reflexive analysis of intra and intertextual reading. The approaches identified in the studied initiatives were complementary. The most applied approaches were innovation in health, technological innovation in health and social innovation, each with twelve publications, and social innovation in health and ecohealth with ten and seven publications respectively. The approaches showed a general interest in reaching the goals of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), the Alma Ata Declaration and the Ottawa Letter.ConclusionsThe social innovation in health approach in Latin America adopts educational strategies, identifies risk factors, optimizes resources, promotes interculturality, participation, community empowerment, and enhances intersectorality and interdisciplinarity. As an approach, process, program or solution, social innovation in health is a conceptual category under construction.

Protocols for sequencing and assembling mitogenomes include ‘primer walking’ or ‘long PCR’ followed by Sanger sequencing or Illumina short-read low-coverage whole genome (LC-WGS) sequencing with or without prior enrichment of mitochondrial DNA. The aforementioned strategies assemble complete and accurate mitochondrial genomes but are time consuming and/or expensive. In this study, I first tested whether mitogenomes can be sequenced from long-read nanopore sequencing data exclusively. Second, I explored the accuracy of the long-read assembled genomes by comparing them to a ‘gold’ standard reference mitogenome retrieved from the same individual using Illumina sequencing. Third and lastly, I tested if the long-read assemblies are useful for mitophylogenomics and barcoding research. To accomplish these goals, I used the Caribbean spiny lobster Panulirus argus, an ecologically relevant species in shallow water coral reefs and target of the most lucrative fishery in the greater Caribbean region. ResultsLC-WGS using a MinION ONT device and various de-novo and reference-based assembly pipelines retrieved a complete and highly accurate mitogenome for the Caribbean spiny lobster Panulirus argus. Discordance between each of the long-read assemblies and the reference mitogenome was mostly due to indels at the flanks of homopolymer regions. Although not ‘perfect’, phylogenetic analyses using entire mitogenomes or a fragment of the cox1 gene demonstrated that mitogenomes assembled using long reads reliably identify the sequenced specimen as belonging to P. argus and distinguish it from other related species in the same genus, family, and superorder.ConclusionsThis study serves as a proof-of-concept for the future implementation of in-situ surveillance protocols using the MinION to detect mislabeling in P. argus across its supply chain. Mislabeling detection will improve fishery management in this overexploited lobster. This study will additionally aid in decreasing costs for exploring meta-population connectivity in the Caribbean spiny lobster and will aid with the transfer of genomics technology to low-income countries.","The author would like to thank Tom Matthews (FFWCC) and his team at the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission for their help in collecting specimens.

The main aim of this study was to evaluate the role of live feed as a source of antibacterial-resistant bacteria in a commercial culture of G. chilensis. Samples of rotifer and Artemia cultures used as live feed were collected during the larval growth period and culturable bacterial counts were performed using a spread plate method. Rotifer and Artemia cultures exhibited high levels of resistant bacteria (8.03 × 104 to 1.79 × 107 CFU/g and 1.47 × 106 to 3.50 × 108 CFU/g, respectively). Sixty-five florfenicol-resistant isolates were identified as Vibrio (81.5%) and Pseudoalteromonas (15.4%) using 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis. A high incidence of resistance to streptomycin (93.8%), oxytetracycline (89.2%), co-trimoxazole (84.6%), and kanamycin (73.8%) was exhibited by resistant isolates. A high proportion of isolates (76.9%) carried the florfenicol-resistance encoding genes floR and fexA, as well as plasmid DNA (75.0%). The high prevalence of multiresistant bacteria in live feed increases the incidence of the resistant microbiota in reared fish larvae, thus proper monitoring and management strategies for live feed cultures appear to be a priority for preventing future therapy failures in fish larval cultures.","The authors acknowledge Piero Magnolfi and all staff of the Colorado Chile company for providing facilities, materials, and support to develop control and treated live-feed cultures, as well as for good collaboration with live-feed culture maintenance and sampling collection.

Notwithstanding the rich fossil record of the modern great white shark (Carcharodon carcharias, GWS), its use of nursery areas in the fossil record has never been assessed before. Here, we analysed the fossil record of the GWS from three South American Pliocene localities, assessed body size distributions and applied previously established criteria to identify palaeo-nurseries. We found that juveniles dominate the Coquimbo locality (Chile), whereas subadults and adults characterize Pisco (Peru) and Caldera (Chile), respectively. These results, summed to the paleontological and paleoenvironmental record of the region, suggest that Coquimbo represents the first nursery area for the GWS in the fossil record. Our findings demonstrate that one of the top predators in today’s oceans has used nursery areas for millions of years, highlighting their importance as essential habitats for shark survival in deep time.","We thank C.

Objective: To estimate the association between physical disability and the incidence of clinically significant depressive symptoms in older Mexican adults.
Materials and methods: We conducted a retrospective cohort study with data from the Encuesta Nacional sobre Salud y Envejecimiento en México (ENASEM). The analytical sample (n=6,780) included adults over 50 years old with measurements for the main variables and no clinically significant depressive symptoms reported in the first round. These symptoms were evaluated with the CESD-9 scale and disability by means of the report of activities of daily living (ADL) or instrumental activities of daily living (IADL). Descriptive, bivariate, and multivariate analyses were performed using logistic regression models adjusted by sociodemographic variables, health conditions, childhood adversities, social participation, and stressful life events.
Results: The incidence of clinically significant depressive symptoms was 25.75% (95% CI: 24,70 - 26,80). Compared to those without IADL limitations, an increased risk of 68% for the development of clinically significant depressive symptoms was found (95% CI: 1.10-2.57; p= 0,015). With the ADL model, the OR for the development of clinically significant depressive symptoms was 1.36 (1.01 -1.81; p= 0.039). Both models were adjusted by confounding variables.
Conclusion: Presenting limitations in daily life is an important risk factor for the development of clinically significant depressive symptoms at two years of follow-up.",,,Biomédica,,,"Activities of Daily Living; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Confidence Intervals; Depression; Disabled Persons; Female; Humans; Incidence; Logistic Models; Male; Mexico; Middle Aged; Obesity; Retrospective Studies; Social Participation; Stress, Psychological",2020-12-02,2020,2020-12-02,,40,4,641-655,All OA; Gold,Article,"Luna-Orozco, Karen; Fernández-Niño, Julián Alfredo; Astudillo-García, Claudia Iveth","Luna-Orozco, Karen (Departamento de Salud Pública, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia, Universidad del Norte, Departamento de Salud Pública, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); Fernández-Niño, Julián Alfredo (Departamento de Salud Pública, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia, Universidad del Norte, Departamento de Salud Pública, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); Astudillo-García, Claudia Iveth (Servicios de Atención Psiquiátrica, Secretaría de Salud, Ciudad de México, México, Escuela de Enfermería de la Secretaría de Salud del DF, Secretaría de Salud, México, Mexico)","Astudillo-García, Claudia Iveth (Secretaria de Salud)","Luna-Orozco, Karen (Universidad del Norte); Fernández-Niño, Julián Alfredo (Universidad del Norte); Astudillo-García, Claudia Iveth (Secretaria de Salud)",7,3,0.52,2.29,https://revistabiomedica.org/index.php/biomedica/article/download/5398/4586,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1133086102,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3202 Clinical Sciences; 42 Health Sciences; 4203 Health Services and Systems,

Most of the toxin is accumulated in the digestive gland, but this organ contains several cell types whose contribution to the accumulation of the toxin is unknown. Determining the time-course of the depuration by analyzing whole organs is difficult because the inter-individual variability is high. A sampling method, using biopsies of the digestive gland, has been developed. This method allows for repetitive sampling of the same scallop, but the representativeness of the samples obtained in this way needs to be validated. In this work, we found that the distribution of DA in the digestive gland of the scallops is mostly homogeneous. Only the area closest to the gonad, and especially its outer portion, had a lower concentration than the other ones, probably due to a transfer of the toxin to the intestinal loop. Samples obtained by biopsies can therefore be considered to be representative. Most of the toxin was accumulated in large cells (mostly digestive cells), which could be due to differences during the toxin absorption or to the preferential depuration of the toxin from the small cells (mostly secretory).",We acknowledge Carmen Mariño and Helena Martín by their technical assistance.,"“This research was funded by the Programa de Programa de Recursos Marinos of the Consellería de Innovación, Industria e Comercio, Xunta de Galicia, grant number PGIDIT04RMA501007PR” and “The APC was funded by “CONICYT+FONDEF/PRIMER CONCURSO INVESTIGACION TENOLÓGICA TEMATICO EN SISTEMAS PESQUERO ACUICOLAS FRENTE A FLORECIMIENTOS ALGALES NOCIVOS FANS IDeA DEL FONDO DE FOMENTO AL DESARROLLO CIENTIFICO Y TECNOLÓGICO, FONDEF/CONYCIT 2017 IT17F10002, Universidad Católica del Norte, Coquimbo, Chile, and Centro de Investigacións Mariñas, Xunta de Galicia.

The aim of this study was to evaluate HRV in menopausal transition and post-menopausal symptoms with different intensities. This cross-sectional study was conducted in Rio Branco, State of Acre, Brazil from October 2016 to July 2017. We used Kupperman-Blatt Menopausal Index (KMI) to measure menopausal symptoms intensity. HRV analysis was performed based on the guidelines of the European Society of Cardiology and the North American Society of Pacing and Electrophysiology. HRV is lower in the group with moderate/intense menopausal symptoms compared to mild symptoms.

Both compounds showed in vitro cytotoxic activity with IC50 values: 7.1 μM (QS-21) and 13.6 μM (QA) on SNU1 cells; 7.4 μM (QS-21) and 67 μM (QA) on KATO III cells. QS-21 and QA induce apoptosis on SNU1 and KATO III, as demonstrated by TUNEL, Annexin-V and Caspase Assays. Additionally, we performed in silico docking studies simulating the binding of both triterpenic compounds to key proteins involved in apoptotic pathways. The binding energies (∆Gbin) thus calculated, suggest that the pro-apoptotic protein Bid might be a plausible target involved in the apoptotic effect of both triterpenic compounds. Although QA shows some antiproliferative effects on SNU1 cells cultured in vitro, our results suggest that QS-21 is a more powerful antitumor agent, which merits further investigation regarding their properties as potential therapeutic agents for gastric cancer.","Special consideration is given to Dr. Dawit Kidane-Mulat (University of Texas -Austin) who donated GES-1 cells (normal gastric epithelium cell line).

Worldwide and in Cameroon, little attention has been paid to this growing problem in the pediatric population. Identification of risk factors will contribute significantly to prevention. A cross-sectional case-control study was carried out in children ≤ 15 years to identify the risk factors of UTI, etiologic agents, and their antibiotic susceptibility. Samples (urine) were collected from in and outpatients with symptoms of UTI attending two health facilities in Buea. Controls were age- and sex-matched children in the community and those visiting these health facilities for unrelated reasons. Samples were analyzed by microscopy, culture, and antibiotic susceptibility of bacteria isolates tested by the disc diffusion technique. Questionnaires were administered to collect sociodemographic, clinical characteristics and data on risk factors. Odds ratios and bivariate and multivariate analyses were used to assess the relationship between predictors (symptoms and risk factors) and UTI. P < 0.05 was considered significant. A total of 405 participants (200 cases and 205 controls) were investigated. UTI prevalence was 12% in cases. From the UTI cases, bacteria was the major cause of infection, with E. coli (39.4%) predominating. Parasitic organisms, Trichomonas vaginalis (0.5%) and Schistosoma spp (0.5%), and yeast (6%) were also detected. Urinary urgency (F = 4.98, P = 0.027) and back pain (F = 12.37, P = 0.001) were associated to UTI following bivariate analysis. These parameters could be used to predict UTI in the pediatric population in the study area. Third generation cephalosporins: ceftriaxone (90.1%) and cefadroxil (85.4%) were the most effective and thus recommended for treatment.",We are grateful to the study participants and their parents/guardians for their contribution to this study.

Although it has been extensively studied at the molecular level, sequencing of the 5' and 3' ends of the untranslated regions (UTR) commonly requires specific approaches for completion and corroboration. The present study aimed to characterize the 5' and 3' ends of dengue virus types 1 to 4. The 5' and 3' ends of twenty-nine dengue virus isolates from acute infections were amplified through a modified protocol of the rapid amplification cDNA ends approach. For the 5' end cDNA synthesis, specific anti-sense primers for each serotype were used, followed by polyadenylation of the cDNA using a terminal transferase and subsequent PCR amplification with oligo(dT) and internal specific reverse primer. At the 3' end of the positive-sense viral RNA, an adenine tail was directly synthetized using an Escherichia coli poly(A) polymerase, allowing subsequent hybridization of the oligo(dT) during cDNA synthesis. The incorporation of the poly(A) tail at the 5' and 3' ends of the dengue virus cDNA and RNA, respectively, allowed for successful primer hybridization, PCR amplification and direct sequencing. This approach can be used for completing dengue virus genomes obtained through direct and next-generation sequencing methods.","To the National Laboratory Network for routine virologic surveillance of dengue in Colombia.

AIM: To assess the psychometric properties of ACE-III, analyzing its factor structure, its reliability (from an Item Response Theory [TRI] model) and its diagnostic usefulness.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: We studied 1101 older people without cognitive impairment and 63 currently having a diagnosis and receiving treatment for dementia.
RESULTS: The presence of two factors for the Attention subscale (Orientation and Attention, separately) was suggested. The factorial analysis showed adequate adjustment in all the subscales, except for the new Attention subscale. In the TRI analysis, the Attention subscale presented a greater number of items with lack of fit compared to the other subscales. Using a proposed threshold of 66 points or less to identify cognitive impairment related to dementia, a sensitivity of 0.97 and specificity of 0.81 was obtained.

To systematically estimate expression-associated SNPs (eSNPs) that confer genetic predisposition to GC, we evaluated the associations of 314,203 stomach tissue-specific eSNPs with GC risk in three GWAS datasets (2,631 cases and 4,373 controls). Subsequently, we conducted a gene-based analysis to calculate the cumulative effect of eSNPs through sequence kernel association combined test and Sherlock integrative analysis. At the SNP-level, we identified two novel variants (rs836545 at 7p22.1 and rs1892252 at 6p22.2) associated with GC risk. The risk allele carriers of rs836545-T and rs1892252-G exhibited higher expression levels of DAGLB (P = 3.70 × 10-18) and BTN3A2 (P = 3.20 × 10-5), respectively. Gene-based analyses identified DAGLB and FBXO43 as novel susceptibility genes for GC. DAGLB and FBXO43 were significantly overexpressed in GC tissues than in their adjacent tissues (P = 5.59 × 10-7 and P = 3.90 × 10-6, respectively), and high expression level of these two genes was associated with an unfavorable prognosis of GC patients (P = 1.30 × 10-7 and P = 7.60 × 10-3, respectively). Co-expression genes with these two novel genes in normal stomach tissues were significantly enriched in several cancer-related pathways, including P53, MAPK and TGF-beta pathways. In summary, our findings confirm the importance of eSNPs in dissecting the genetic basis of GC, and the identified eSNPs and relevant genes will provide new insight into the genetic and biological basis for the mechanism of GC development.",,Funding.

Key environmental drivers, such as temperature, can profoundly modulate prey energetic costs in ectotherms, although we currently lack knowledge of how both temperature and predation risk can challenge prey physiology and ecology. Such uncertainties in predator-prey interactions are particularly relevant for marine regions experiencing rapid environmental changes due to climate change. Using the octopus (Octopus maorum)-spiny lobster (Jasus edwardsii) interaction as a predator-prey model, we examined different metabolic traits of sub adult spiny lobsters under predation risk in combination with two thermal scenarios: 'current' (20°C) and 'warming' (23°C), based on projections of sea-surface temperature under climate change. We examined lobster standard metabolic rates to define the energetic requirements at specific temperatures. Routine metabolic rates (RMRs) within a respirometer were used as a proxy of lobster activity during night and day time, and active metabolic rates, aerobic scope and excess post-exercise oxygen consumption were used to assess the energetic costs associated with escape responses (i.e. tail-flipping) in both thermal scenarios. Lobster standard metabolic rate increased at 23°C, suggesting an elevated energetic requirement (39%) compared to 20°C. Unthreatened lobsters displayed a strong circadian pattern in RMR with higher rates during the night compared with the day, which were strongly magnified at 23°C. Once exposed to predation risk, lobsters at 20°C quickly reduced their RMR by ~29%, suggesting an immobility or 'freezing' response to avoid predators. Conversely, lobsters acclimated to 23°C did not display such an anti-predator response. These findings suggest that warmer temperatures may induce a change to the typical immobility predation risk response of lobsters. It is hypothesized that heightened energetic maintenance requirements at higher temperatures may act to override the normal predator-risk responses under climate-change scenarios.","This study contributed to the project ‘Preparing fisheries for climate change: identifying adaptation options for four key fisheries in south eastern Australia (DCC &amp; FRDC – Marine Biodiversity and Fisheries Climate Change, Project 2011/039).

METHODS: We carried out a systematic review to identify previously published tools. A composite proposal of algorithm was made by following the steps from clinical experience to deprescribe medications. A 2-round electronic Delphi method was conducted to establish consensus. Eighteen experts from different countries (Colombia, Spain and Argentina) accepted to be part of the panel representing geriatricians, internists, endocrinologist, general practitioners, pharmacologists, clinical pharmacists, family physicians and nurses. Panel members were asked to mark a Likert Scale from 1 to 9 points (1= strongly disagree, 9= strongly agree). The content validity ratio, item-level content validity, and Fleiss' Kappa statistics was measured to establish reliability. The same voting method was used for round 2.
RESULTS: A 7-question algorithm was proposed. Each question was part of a domain and conduct into a decision. In round 1, a consensus was not reached but statements were grouped and organized. In round 2, the tool met consensus. The inter-rater reliability was between substantial and almost perfect for questions with Kappa=0.77 (95% CI 0.60-0.93), for domains with Kappa= 0.73 (95%CI 0.60-0.86) and for decisions with Kappa= 0.97 (95%CI 0.90-1.00).
CONCLUSIONS: This is a novel tool that captures and supports healthcare professionals in clinical decision-making for deprescribing potentially inappropriate medication. This includes patient's and caregiver's preferences about medication. This tool will help to standardize care and provide guidance on the prescribing/deprescribing process of older persons' medications. Also, it provides a holistic way to reduce polypharmacy and inappropriate medications in clinical practice.","The authors thank the Universidad Nacional de Colombia and the entire collaborating group for their valuable contributions and participation in the validation process.

The underreported diagnosis of this clinical entity has been widely highlighted due to multiple factors, such as, among others, ignorance by the primary care practitioner consulted for this condition as well as clinical similarity to secondary gastroenteric symptoms and common food poisonings of bacterial, parasitic or viral etiology. Eventually, it was found that people affected by ciguatoxins had trips to coastal areas hours before the onset of symptoms. Thanks to multiple studies over the years, it has been possible to identify the relation between toxigenic dinoflagellates and seagrasses, as well as its incorporation into the food chain, starting by fish primarily inhabiting reef ecosystems and culminating in the intake of these by humans. Identifying the epidemiological link, its cardinal symptoms and affected systems, such as gastrointestinal, the peripheral nervous system and, fortunately with a low frequency, the cardiovascular system, leads to a purely clinical diagnostic impression without necessitating further complementary studies; in addition, what would also help fight ciguatera poisoning is performing an adequate treatment of the symptoms right from the start, without underestimating or overlooking any associated complications.","Simón Bolívar University and Ministery of Science, Technology, and Innovation of Colombia for facilitating the resources for article publication.","We declare that the funds or sources of support received in this specific internal report study were from Simón Bolívar University, Barranquilla, Colombia and that the external funding was from the Ministry of Science, Technology, and Innovation of Colombia, subsidy 125380763038 and 125380763188.

Whether the mRNA-to-protein correlations are constrained by their stability and conserved across mammalian species including human is unknown. Moreover, whether the stability-dependent correlation pattern is altered in the tumor has not been explored. To establish the quantitative relationship between stability and correlation between mRNA and protein levels, we performed a multi-omics data integration study across mammalian systems including diverse types of human tissues and cell lines in a genome-wide manner. The current study illuminated an important aspect of the mammalian proteotranscriptomic landscape by providing evidence that stability-constrained mRNA-to-protein correlation follows a hierarchical pattern that remains conserved across different tissues and mammalian species. By analyzing the tumor and non-tumor tissues, we further illustrated that mRNA-to-protein correlations deviate in tumor tissues. By gene-centric analysis, we harnessed the hierarchical correlation patterns to identify altered mRNA-to-protein correlation in tumors and characterized the tumor correlation-enhancing and -repressing genes. We elucidated the transcriptional regulatory circuits controlling the correlation-enhancing and -repressing genes that are associated with metabolic reprogramming and cancer-associated pathways in tumor tissue. By tightly controlling the mRNA-to-protein correlation of specific genes, the transcriptional regulatory circuits may enable the tumor cells to evolve in varying tumor microenvironment. The mRNA-to-protein correlation analysis thus can serve as a unique approach to identify the pathways prioritized by the tumor cells at different clinical stages. The component of transcriptional regulatory circuits identified by the current study can serve as potential candidates for stage-dependent anticancer therapy.","We thank Dr. Marcel Schilling (German Cancer Research Center, DKFZ, Heidelberg), Dr. Lorenz Adlung (Weizmann Institute of Sciences, Rehovot, Israel), and Dr. Rajib Chakravorty (Faculty of Science, University of Sydney) for their advice and fruitful discussion.",Funding.

In Colombia, poverty is one of those causes present mainly in rural areas where one in 10 children suffers from malnutrition.
METHODOLOGY: We searched ScienceDirect, PubMed, ClinicalKey, and SciELO for references on child malnutrition, its social determinants, and elements for its intervention in Colombia.
RESULTS: The review allowed us to identify that many factors influence this problem determined not only by the lack of food but also by other factors such as poverty, lack of resources, restricted access to health care, rising prices of essential foods, political conflicts leading forced displacement, drought, the absence of an equity-based policy approach, poor environmental sanitation, among others.
CONCLUSIONS: Child malnutrition should not be conceived as mainly a food-related problem. Other factors that influence this problem should also be taken into account in order to prevent it. Trained personnel should be deployed to intervene in the social determinants that underpin child malnutrition. Thus, in Colombia, the family physician is a fundamental link in the health system, responsible for providing comprehensive medical care and for the leadership of the newly introduced health model based on primary health care.",,,Medwave,,,"Child; Child Nutrition Disorders; Child, Preschool; Colombia; Delivery of Health Care; Family Practice; Health Resources; Humans; Poverty; Primary Health Care; Public Health; Social Determinants of Health; Socioeconomic Factors",2020-03-31,2020,2020-03-31,,20,02,e7839-e7839,All OA; Gold,Article,"Vargas, Mónica; Hernández, Erwin","Vargas, Mónica (Facultad de Medicina, Universidad de La Sabana, Chía, Colombia.

A recently described factor involved in this process is glutamate. Through NMDA ionotropic receptor, glutamate modifies intracellular Ca2+ dynamics allowing the oriented cell migration and proliferation, essentials processes in neurulation. Glutamate synthesis depends on the mitochondrial enzyme known as glutaminase 1 (GLS1) that is widely expressed in brain and kidney. The participation of GLS 1 in prenatal neurogenic processes and in the adult brain has been experimentally established, however, its participation in early stages of embryonic development has not been described. The present investigation describes for the first time the presence and functionality of GLS1 in Xenopus laevis embryos during neurulation. Although protein expression levels remains constant, the catalytic activity of GLS1 increases significantly (~66%) between early (stage 12) and middle to late (stages 14-19) neurulation process. Additionally, the use of 6-diazo-5-oxo-L-norleucine (L-DON, competitive inhibitor of glutamine-depend enzymes), reduced significantly the GLS1 specific activity during neurulation (~36%) and induce the occurrence of neural tube defects involving its possible participation in the neural tube closure in Xenopus laevis embryos.","The authors thank Susana Rojas, Jocelyn Gonzalez, Alejandra Ilabaca and Laurie Aguayo for their outstanding technical assistance.","This work was funded by FONDECYT 11160562 and VRID 220.033.112-4 (PAC).

Agmatine is converted to putrescine and urea by agmatinase (AGM) and by an agmatinase-like protein (ALP), a new type of enzyme which is present in human and rodent brain tissues. Recombinant rat brain ALP is the only mammalian protein that exhibits significant agmatinase activity in vitro and generates putrescine under in vivo conditions. ALP, despite differing in amino acid sequence from all members of the ureohydrolase family, is strictly dependent on Mn2+ for catalytic activity. However, the Mn2+ ligands have not yet been identified due to the lack of structural information coupled with the low sequence identity that ALPs display with known ureohydrolases. In this work, we generated a structural model of the Mn2+ binding site of the ALP and we propose new putative Mn2+ ligands. Then, we cloned and expressed a sequence of 210 amino acids, here called the ""central-ALP"", which include the putative ligands of Mn2+. The results suggest that the central-ALP is catalytically active, as agmatinase, with an unaltered Km for agmatine and a decreased kcat. Similar to wild-type ALP, central-ALP is activated by Mn2+ with a similar affinity. Besides, a simple mutant D217A, a double mutant E288A/K290A, and a triple mutant N213A/Q215A/D217A of these putative Mn2+ ligands result on the loss of ALP agmatinase activity. Our results indicate that the central-ALP contains the active site for agmatine hydrolysis, as well as that the residues identified are relevant for the ALP catalysis.","Special thanks to the Dean of the Faculty of Biological Sciences, Dra.

These patients are homozygous for a unique and novel deletion of four bases (TGCC) in exon 3 of the calpain 3 gene (CAPN3) (NM_000070.2; NP_000061.1) (g.409_412del). The mutation site occurs at the CysPc protein domain, triggering a modified truncated protein structure and affecting motifs within the calpain-like thiol protease family (peptidase family C2) region. The patients reported here developed a very severe phenotype with primary contractures, spinal rigidity in the early stages of the disease, and bilateral talipes equinovarus (clubfoot) in the most affected patients who had the selective involvement of their extremities' distal muscles in a way that resembled Emery-Dreifuss syndrome. We recommend mandatory screening for calpainopathy in all patients with an Emery-Dreifuss-like syndrome or those presenting a non-congenital illness with primary contractures and who, because of other data, are suspected of having muscular dystrophy.","Our special thanks to all the patients and their families for their cooperation in this study and to Cristina Núñez of the University of Panama for her help in the preparation of this manuscript.

Despite the major role that microorganisms play on the marine biogeochemical cycling and ecosystem functioning, the response of bacterial communities upon OA scenarios is still not well understood. Here, we have conducted a detailed characterization of the composition and relative abundance of bacterial communities in the water column of an open-ocean station in the Eastern Tropical South Pacific (ETSP) off northern Chile and their interactions with environmental factors. In addition, through a short-term microcosm experiment, we have assessed the effect of low pH/high pCO2 conditions over the abundance and genetic diversity of bacterial communities. Our results evidence a clear partitioning of community composition that could be attributed mostly to dissolved oxygen. However, our experimental approach demonstrated that low pH/high pCO2 conditions might modify the structure of the bacterial community, evidencing that small changes in pH may impact significantly the abundance and diversity of key microorganisms. This study constitutes a first step aiming to provide insight about the influence of changing carbonate chemistry conditions on natural bacterial communities and to shed light on the potential impact of OA in biogeochemical cycles on the ETSP region.",We acknowledge Project AUB 12806 Trophic food webs and carbon cycle in low pH/low O2 waters (LowpHOX I): Potential impact of El Niño phenomenon any data used in this paper can be obtained by contacting the corresponding author.,"This work was supported by National Agency for Research and Development of Chile (ANID), Millennium Science Initiative-ANID Program (grant ICN12_019-IMO), FONDECYT Grants N° 3170732 (P.A.) and N° 1170065 (C.V.G).",Microorganisms,,,,2020-12-04,2020,2020-12-04,,8,12,1924,All OA; Gold,Article,"Aguayo, Paulina; Campos, Víctor L.; Henríquez, Carlos; Olivares, Francisca; De Ia Iglesia, Rodrigo; Ulloa, Osvaldo; Vargas, Cristian A.","Aguayo, Paulina (Department of Aquatic System, Faculty of Environmental Sciences & Environmental Sciences Center EULA Chile, Universidad de Concepción, Concepción 4070386, Chile;, crvargas@udec.cl; Millennium Institute of Oceanography (IMO), Universidad de Concepción, Concepción 4070386, Chile;, frolivares@udec.cl, (F.O.);, oulloa@udec.cl, (O.U.); Institute of Natural Resources, Faculty of Veterinary medicine and agronomy, Universidad de Las Américas, Sede Concepcion, Chacabuco 539, Concepcion 3349001, Chile); Campos, Víctor L.

Spectrofluorometric techniques were used to evaluate the effect of tested products on rat and human CYP1A and CYP2B activity. The antimutagenic effect of tested products was evaluated in benzo[a]pyrene (BP)-induced mutagenicity assay by an Ames test. Finally, the antimutagenic effect of Thalassia testudinum (100 mg/kg) was assessed in BP-induced mutagenesis in mice. The tested products significantly (p < 0.05) inhibit rat CYP1A1 activity, acting as mixed-type inhibitors of rat CYP1A1 (Ki = 54.16 ± 9.09 μg/mL, 5.96 ± 1.55 μg/mL and 3.05 ± 0.89 μg/mL, respectively). Inhibition of human CYP1A1 was also observed (Ki = 197.1 ± 63.40 μg/mL and 203.10 ± 17.29 μg/mL for the polyphenolic fraction and for thalassiolin B, respectively). In addition, the evaluated products significantly inhibit (p < 0.05) BP-induced mutagenicity in vitro. Furthermore, oral doses of Thalassia testudinum (100 mg/kg) significantly reduced (p < 0.05) the BP-induced micronuclei and oxidative damage, together with an increase of reduced glutathione, in mice. In summary, Thalassia testudinum metabolites exhibit antigenotoxic activity mediated, at least, by the inhibition of CYP1A1-mediated BP biotransformation, arresting the oxidative and mutagenic damage. Thus, the metabolites of T. testudinum may represent a potential source of chemopreventive compounds for the adjuvant therapy of cancer.",The authors acknowledge the technical support given by Cindel Cuellar.,"This research was funded by: CITMA P211LH005-019 (Cuba); the program Becas de Excelencia del Gobierno de México para Extranjeros 2016 (México); FONDECYT 1130601 (Chile), as well as Programas Institucionales del Instituto de Investigaciones Biomédicas, UNAM (México).",Marine Drugs,,,"Activation, Metabolic; Animals; Antimutagenic Agents; Benzo(a)pyrene; Cytochrome P-450 CYP1A1; Cytochrome P-450 CYP1A2; Cytochrome P-450 CYP1A2 Inhibitors; Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme Inhibitors; DNA Damage; Flavonoids; Humans; Hydrocharitaceae; Isoenzymes; Kinetics; Micronuclei, Chromosome-Defective; Micronucleus Tests; Oxidative Stress; Polyphenols; Rats; Salmonella typhi",2020-11-19,2020,2020-11-19,,18,11,566,All OA; Gold,Article,"Delgado-Roche, Livan; Santes-Palacios, Rebeca; Herrera, José A.; Hernández, Sandra L.; Riera, Mario; Fernández, Miguel D.; Mesta, Fernando; Garrido, Gabino; Rodeiro, Idania; Espinosa-Aguirre, Jesús Javier","Delgado-Roche, Livan (Departamento de Farmacología, Instituto de Ciencias del Mar (ICIMAR), Loma 14, Alturas del Vedado, Plaza de la Revolución, La Habana 10600, Cuba;, ldelgado@liomont.com.mx, (L.D.-R.);, mario@icimar.cu, (M.R.);, migueldavid@cebimar.cu, (M.D.F.); Dirección Médica, Laboratorios Liomont S.A. de C.V., Carretera México-Toluca 5420, Ciudad de México 05320, Mexico); Santes-Palacios, Rebeca (Laboratorio de Toxicología Genética, Instituto Nacional de Pediatría, Insurgentes Sur 3700, Insurgentes Cuicuilco, Ciudad de México 04530, Mexico;, rebeca.santes@inp.mx); Herrera, José A.

Tumor-repopulating cells (TRCs) are cancer stem cell (CSC)-like cells with highly tumorigenic and self-renewing abilities, which were selected from tumor cells in soft three-dimensional (3D) fibrin gels.
METHODS: Here, we presented a genome-wide map of methylated cytosines for time-series samples in TRC selection, in a 3D culture using whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS).
RESULTS: A comparative analysis revealed that the methylation degrees of many differentially methylated genes (DMGs) were increased by the mechanical environment and changed from 2D rigid to 3D soft. DMGs were significantly enriched in stemness-related terms. In 1-day, TRCs had the highest non-CG methylation rate indicating its strong stemness. We found that genes with continuously increasing or decreasing methylation like CREB5/ADAMTS6/LMX1A may also affect the TRC screening process. Furthermore, results showed that stage-specific/common CSCs markers were biased toward changing their methylation in non-CG (CHG and CHH, where H corresponds to A, T, or C) methylation and enriched in gene body region.
CONCLUSIONS: WGBS provides DNA methylome in TRC screening. It was confirmed that non-CG DNA methylation plays an important role in TRC selection, which indicates that it is more sensitive to mechanical microenvironments and affects TRCs by regulating the expression of stemness genes in tumor cells.",The authors thank Huazhong University of Science and Technology for their technical support.,Funding.

When trying to explain the biological diversity of early groups across North, Central and South America, studies have defended a wide range of dispersion models that tend to oversimplify the diversity observed across the continent. In this study, we aim to contribute to this debate by exploring the cranial morphological affinities of four late Pleistocene/early Holocene specimens recovered from the caves of Quintana Roo, Mexico. The four specimens are among the earliest human remains known in the continent and permit the contextualization of biological diversity present during the initial millennia of human presence in the Americas. The specimens were compared to worldwide reference series through geometric morphometric analyses of 3D anatomical landmarks. Morphological data were analyzed through exploratory visual multivariate analyses and multivariate classification based on Mahalanobis distances. The results show very different patterns of morphological association for each Quintana Roo specimen, suggesting that the early populations of the region already shared a high degree of morphological diversity. This contrasts with previous studies of South American remains and opens the possibility that the initial populations of North America already had a high level of morphological diversity, which was reduced as populations dispersed into the southern continent. As such, the study of these rare remains illustrates that we are probably still underestimating the biological diversity of early Americans.",The authors received no specific funding for this work.,The authors received no specific funding for this work.,PLOS ONE,,Michael D.

This situation does not favor effective treatment and prevention of diseases for the population, due to potential information loss, misinformation, or data leaks related to a patient, which in turn may imply a direct risk for the individual and high public health costs for governments. One of the proposed solutions to this problem has been the creation of electronic medical record (EMR) systems using blockchain networks; however, most of them do not take into account the occurrence of connectivity failures, such as those found in various developing countries, which can lead to failures in the integrity of the system data. To address these problems, HealthyBlock is presented in this paper as an architecture based on blockchain networks, which proposes a unified electronic medical record system that considers different clinical providers, with resilience in data integrity during connectivity failure and with usability, security, and privacy characteristics. On the basis of the HealthyBlock architecture, a prototype was implemented for the care of patients in a network of hospitals.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total of 294 samples from patients with clinical diagnosis of febrile syndrome compatible with dengue were collected between June 2015 and December 2016. All samples were tested for DENV and ZIKV by RT-PCR using C6/36 cells culture supernatant.
RESULTS: Thirty-three percent of the samples were positive (97/294); from these, 61.8% were positive for DENV and 31% were positive for Zika. The predominant serotype was DENV-2 (70.1%), followed by DENV-3 (8.9%), DENV-4 (6%), and DENV-1 (3%). DENV/ZIKV coinfection was identified in 7.2% of the cases associated with DENV-1 and DENV-3 serotypes. The confirmed cases of dengue, Zika, and DENV/ZIKV coinfections were clinically mild and self-limited.
CONCLUSIONS: We reported the co-circulation of all four DENV serotypes, with a higher frequency of DENV-2, and ZIKV introduction in Córdoba department-Colombia in August 2015.

One of the most conspicuous traits in butterflies is their wing color pattern, which has been shown to be important in speciation. The evolution of many taxa in the Neotropics has also been influenced by major geological events. Using a dated, species-level molecular phylogenetic hypothesis for Preponini, a colorful Neotropical butterfly tribe, we evaluated whether diversification rates were constant or varied through time, and how they were influenced by color pattern evolution and biogeographical events. We found that Preponini originated approximately 28 million years ago and that diversification has increased through time consistent with major periods of Andean uplift. Even though some clades show evolutionarily rapid transitions in coloration, contrary to our expectations, these shifts were not correlated with shifts in diversification. Involvement in mimicry with other butterfly groups might explain the rapid changes in dorsal color patterns in this tribe, but such changes have not increased species diversification in this group. However, we found evidence for an influence of major Miocene and Pliocene geological events on the tribe's evolution. Preponini apparently originated within South America, and range evolution has since been dynamic, congruent with Andean geologic activity, closure of the Panama Isthmus, and Miocene climate variability.","ACKNOWLEDGMENTS We are deeply grateful to everyone that was involved in the field and who donated material to be included in this study.

However, changes in the presence of this disease across years hampers the effective identification of resistant genotypes to this disease. To avoid the limitations of phenotypic selection under natural pressure, this research aimed to devise an effective strategy to screen disease-resistant genotypes in the absence of high and constant natural pressures. To do so, we investigated the presence of antixenosis and antibiosis as components of resistance to the vector Dalbulus maidis as well as resistance to the pathogen Spiroplasma kunkelii under artificial inoculation conditions in four maize hybrids. The hybrids shown differences in their levels of resistance and target organisms, either the insect vector or the pathogen. Antixenosis and antibiosis to D. maidis were observed in DK72-10. Resistance to S. kunkelii by DK79-10 was seen as a delayed onset of symptoms, and DKB390 showed antixenosis to D. maidis and resistance to S. kunkelii. An association between symptom severity and yield reduction was found, but not between accumulation of pathogen S. kunkelii and symptom severity nor yield. In conclusion, the proposed methodology was efficacious and can aid in the screening of resistant genotypes in breeding programs to reduce the impact of Corn Stunt disease, ensuring that hybrids with good resistance level will be planted by farmers whenever disease occurs.","Bayer CropScience Argentina provided support for this study in the form of salaries fro JO and PC and the expenses related directly to implement the experiments (supplies, mobility, meals, etc.).

(GaMn)Sb thin films were grown by DC magnetron co-sputtering method as an innovative procedure to fabricate III-V DMS. The presence of unusual Mn2Sb2 and Mn2Sb secondary phases, induced by substrate temperature and deposition time, were revealed through XRD measurements. Magnetization measurements allow determining crossover between a paramagnetic-like to a ferromagnetic-like behavior controlled by secondary phases. It was found that both, the magnetic remanence and magnetic coercivity, increases with substrate temperature. Interestingly, the magnetic response is paramagnetic at lower deposition times and substrate temperatures, and XRD measurements suggest the absence of Mn2Sb and Mn2Sb2 in secondary phases. For longer deposition times or higher substrate temperature, XRD shows the presence of Mn2Sb2 and Mn2Sb phases and ferromagnetic-like behavior. The DC resistivity of our samples was characterized and the carrier density was determined by Hall measurements and, in contrast with the reported in other studies, found them to be a p-type semiconductor with carrier densities as big as one order of magnitude larger than reported values. From the ferromagnetic-like samples, evidence of an anomalous Hall-effect in the sample was found, with higher magnetic saturation and a anomalous Hall conductivity of 2380 S/cm. All the results point to a contribution of the secondary phases to the overall magnetic response of the samples used, and suggest the importance of studying the formation of secondary phases in the growth of DMS, especially, for the case of (GaMn)Sb where Mn ion can have multiple oxidation states.","The Universidad Nacional de Colombia - COLCIENCIAS Quipu Code: 201010020958, Universidad del Rosario and Universidad del Norte supported this work.

It plays an important role in the ecological and economic development of the most water-stressed region, revealing the impact of the mining industry, which exacerbate regional water shortages for many organisms and ecological processes. Despite this, the river system has remained understudied. To our knowledge, this study provides the first effort to attempt to compare the microbial communities at spatial scale along the Loa River, as well as investigate the physicochemical factors that could modulate this important biological component that still remains largely unexplored. The analysis of the spatial bacterial distribution and their interconnections in the water column and sediment samples from eight sites located in three sections along the river catchment (upper, middle and lower) was conducted using 16S rRNA gene-based Illumina MiSeq sequencing. Among a total of 543 ASVs identified at the family level, over 40.5% were cosmopolitan in the river and distributed within a preference pattern by the sediment substrate with 162 unique ASVs, while only 87 were specific to the column water. Bacterial diversity gradually decreased from the headwaters, where the upper section had the largest number of unique families. Distinct groupings of bacterial communities often associated with anthropogenic disturbance, including Burkholderiaceae and Flavobacteriaceae families were predominant in the less-impacted upstream section. Members of the Arcobacteraceae and Marinomonadaceae were prominent in the agriculturally and mining-impacted middle sector while Rhodobacteraceae and Coxiellaceae were most abundant families in downstream sites. Such shifts in the community structure were also related to the influence of salinity, chlorophyll, dissolved oxygen and redox potential. Network analyses corroborated the strong connectivity and modular structure of bacterial communities across this desert river, shedding light on taxonomic relatedness of co-occurring species and highlighting the need for planning the integral conservation of this basin.","Ana Zárate was supported by a Scientific and Technological Research Scholarship for Doctoral Studies (CONICYT-PCHA/DoctoradoNacional/2015–21150407) and Cristina Dorador (Fondecyt 1181773), and Centro de Bioingeniería y Biotecnología (CeBiB) FB0001.

In decoding tasks, on the contrary, brain responses are used to predict the stimuli, and traditionally, the signals are assumed stationary within trials, which is rarely the case for natural stimuli. We hypothesize that a decoding model assuming each experimental trial as a realization of a random process more likely reflects the statistical properties of the undergoing process compared to the assumption of stationarity. Here, we propose a Coherence-based spectro-spatial filter that allows for reconstructing stimulus features from brain signal’s features. The proposed method extracts common patterns between features of the brain signals and the stimuli that produced them. These patterns, originating from different recording electrodes are combined, forming a spatial filter that produces a unified prediction of the presented stimulus. This approach takes into account frequency, phase, and spatial distribution of brain features, hence avoiding the need to predefine specific frequency bands of interest or phase relationships between stimulus and brain responses manually. Furthermore, the model does not require the tuning of hyper-parameters, reducing significantly the computational load attached to it. Using three different cognitive tasks (motor movements, speech perception, and speech production), we show that the proposed method consistently improves stimulus feature predictions in terms of correlation (group averages of 0.74 for motor movements, 0.84 for speech perception, and 0.74 for speech production) in comparison with other methods based on regularized multivariate regression, probabilistic graphical models and artificial neural networks. Furthermore, the model parameters revealed those anatomical regions and spectral components that were discriminant in the different cognitive tasks. This novel method does not only provide a useful tool to address fundamental neuroscience questions, but could also be applied to neuroprosthetics.","This work was performed thanks for the Swiss National Funds project grant to ALG 320030_163040, and to the EU FET-BrainCom project and NINDS R3723115.

Yet, evidence of such linkage for copepods, the most abundant metazoans in the oceans, remains scarce, particularly for naturally corrosive Eastern Boundary Upwelling systems (EBUs). This study assessed the relationship between pH levels and traits (body and egg size) and performance (ingestion rate (IR) and egg reproduction rate (EPR)) of the numerically dominant neritic copepod Acartia tonsa, in a year-round upwelling system of the northern (23° S) Humboldt EBUs. The study revealed decreases in chlorophyll (Chl) ingestion rate, egg production rate and egg size with decreasing pH as well as egg production efficiency, but the opposite for copepod body size. Further, ingestion rate increased hyperbolically with Chl, and saturated at ~1 µg Chl. L−1. Food resources categorized as high (H, >1 µg L−1) and low (L, <1 µg L−1) levels, and pH-values categorized as equivalent to present day (≤400 µatm pCO2, pH > 7.89) and future (>400 µatm pCO2, pH < 7.89) were used to compare our observations to values globally employed to experimentally test copepod sensitivity to OA. A comparison (PERMANOVA) test with Chl/pH (2*2) design showed that partially overlapping OA levels expected for the year 2100 in other ocean regions, low-pH conditions in this system negatively impacted traits and performance associated with copepod fitness. However, interacting antagonistically with pH, food resource (Chl) maintained copepod production in spite of low pH levels. Thus, the deleterious effects of ocean acidification are modulated by resource availability in this system.","We thank Dr. Mauricio Cerda, Mr. Espiridion Montanares and Mr. Lucas Vega for their valuable help during cruises and experiments.

While the left superior temporal sulcus (STS) is presumably the locus of AV integration, the process leading to combination is unknown. Based on previous modelling work, we hypothesize that combination results from a complex dynamic originating in a failure to integrate AV inputs, followed by a reconstruction of the most plausible AV sequence. In two different behavioural tasks and one MEG experiment, we observed that combination is more time demanding than fusion. Using time-/source-resolved human MEG analyses with linear and dynamic causal models, we show that both fusion and combination involve early detection of AV incongruence in the STS, whereas combination is further associated with enhanced activity of AV asynchrony-sensitive regions (auditory and inferior frontal cortices). Based on neural signal decoding, we finally show that only combination can be decoded from the IFG activity and that combination is decoded later than fusion in the STS. These results indicate that the AV speech integration outcome primarily depends on whether the STS converges or not onto an existing multimodal syllable representation, and that combination results from subsequent temporal processing, presumably the off-line re-ordering of incongruent AV stimuli.","We thank Jean-Luc Schwartz for support and inspiration.

This study estimated the occurrence of body image dissatisfaction in primary schoolchildren aged 9-13 years and investigated its association with obesity and other factors.
Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted, for which 533 students attending three public primary schools in Acapulco were recruited. Students completed a facilitated self-administered questionnaire about their age, sex, socioeconomic level, body image satisfaction, and perception of their parents' body image. We registered anthropometry of the students and calculated body mass index (BMI). We examined the associations of BMI category and other factors with body image dissatisfaction, calculating the cluster-adjusted odds ratio and 95% confidence intervals.
Results: From the total number of participants, 75% (181/243) of girls and 73% (170/232) of boys were dissatisfied with their body image and wanted a slimmer body. About half were overweight or obese: 45% (121/271) of girls and 52% (135/262) of boys. Overweight or obese children were much more likely to be dissatisfied with their body image (cluster adjusted: 6.73; 95% CI: 5.42-8.36). No other factors were significantly associated with body image dissatisfaction. One-third of the girls (32%, 86/271) and 17% (45/261) of the boys reported an underweight desired body image.
Conclusions: The high level of obesity is a cause for concern and an even higher level of body image dissatisfaction as well. The high dissatisfaction among children suggests that boys, as well as girls in Mexico, may now be subjected to intense social pressure about desirable body image.",,,Boletín Médico del Hospital Infantil de México,,,Body Image; Child; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Humans; Male; Mexico; Pediatric Obesity; Schools,2020-07-15,2020,2020-07-15,2020-07-15,77,3,119-126,All OA; Gold,Article,"Casarrubias-Jaimez, Ana I; Legorreta-Soberanis, José; Sánchez-Gervacio, Belén M; Serrano-de Los Santos, Felipe R; Paredes-Solís, Sergio; Flores-Moreno, Miguel; Andersson, Neil; Cockcroft, Anne","Casarrubias-Jaimez, Ana I (Centro de Investigación de Enfermedades Tropicales, Universidad Autónoma de Guerrero, Acapulco de Juárez, Guerrero, Mexico.); Legorreta-Soberanis, José (Centro de Investigación de Enfermedades Tropicales, Universidad Autónoma de Guerrero, Acapulco de Juárez, Guerrero, Mexico.); Sánchez-Gervacio, Belén M (Centro de Investigación de Enfermedades Tropicales, Universidad Autónoma de Guerrero, Acapulco de Juárez, Guerrero, Mexico.); Serrano-de Los Santos, Felipe R (Centro de Investigación de Enfermedades Tropicales, Universidad Autónoma de Guerrero, Acapulco de Juárez, Guerrero, Mexico.); Paredes-Solís, Sergio (Centro de Investigación de Enfermedades Tropicales, Universidad Autónoma de Guerrero, Acapulco de Juárez, Guerrero, Mexico.); Flores-Moreno, Miguel (Centro de Investigación de Enfermedades Tropicales, Universidad Autónoma de Guerrero, Acapulco de Juárez, Guerrero, Mexico.); Andersson, Neil (Centro de Investigación de Enfermedades Tropicales, Universidad Autónoma de Guerrero, Acapulco de Juárez, Guerrero, Mexico.; University McGill, Montreal, Canada.); Cockcroft, Anne (Centro de Investigación de Enfermedades Tropicales, Universidad Autónoma de Guerrero, Acapulco de Juárez, Guerrero, Mexico.; University McGill, Montreal, Canada.)",,"Casarrubias-Jaimez, Ana I (Autonomous University of Guerrero); Legorreta-Soberanis, José (Autonomous University of Guerrero); Sánchez-Gervacio, Belén M (Autonomous University of Guerrero); Serrano-de Los Santos, Felipe R (Autonomous University of Guerrero); Paredes-Solís, Sergio (Autonomous University of Guerrero); Flores-Moreno, Miguel (Autonomous University of Guerrero); Andersson, Neil (Autonomous University of Guerrero; McGill University); Cockcroft, Anne (Autonomous University of Guerrero; McGill University)",6,4,0.29,1.54,https://www.bmhim.com/files/bmhim_20_77_3_119-126.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1127750467,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3210 Nutrition and Dietetics; 42 Health Sciences; 4206 Public Health,

Because of this, different alternatives have been evaluated such as natural coagulants, which are considered safe for human health and contain fewer contaminants than chemicals due to their biodegradation properties. The main objective of this study was to evaluate the efficiency of mixing nopal mucilage and cassava starch for turbidity removal in water purification. In this paper, test jars and the treatment equipment (TA-scale FQ-005/PE manufactured by Generatoris SA de CV of Mexico) was applied in order to measure turbidity and pH parameters before and after the process of coagulation-flocculation, which was applied to water from the Magdalena River in Colombia. Samples from two sampling periods were assessed. One was evaluated during the rainy season and the other was evaluated without precipitation (drought) with initial turbidities of 316 NTU and 80 NTU, respectively. It was found that aluminum sulfate as a coagulant reference obtained better turbidity removal results (up to 99%) as compared to nopal (up to 60.4%), and nopal-starch combination of cassava (up to 67%), indicating that this mixture increases the effectiveness of natural coagulants used individually.

To date, there is not a practical, as well as an accurate sample for reflecting chronic glucose levels. We measured earwax glucose in 37 controls. Participants provided standard serum, glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) and earwax samples at two time-points, one month apart. The specimens measured baseline fasting glucose, a follow-up postprandial glucose level and a between sample chronic glucose, calculated using the average level on the two occasions. The baseline earwax sample was obtained using a clinical method and the follow-up using a novel self-sampling earwax device. The earwax analytic time was significantly faster using the novel device, in comparison to the clinical use of the syringe. Earwax accurately reflected glucose at both assessments with stronger correlations than HbA1c. Follow-up postprandial concentrations were more significant than their respective fasting baseline concentrations, reflecting differences in fasting and postprandial glycemia and more efficient standardization at follow up. Earwax demonstrated to be more predictable than HbA1c in reflecting systemic fasting, postprandial and long-term glucose levels, and to be less influenced by confounders. Earwax glucose measurements were approximately 60% more predictable than HbA1c in reflecting glycemia over a month. The self-sampling device provided a sample that might accurately reflect chronic glycemia.","The views expressed are those of the author(s) and not necessarily those of University College London, King’s College London, and Universidad Católica del Norte.

Detection of Leishmania donovani antigens in urine has the potential to provide both a non-invasive diagnostic and a test of cure. We searched for L. donovani antigens in urine of VL patients from India and Sudan to contribute to the development of urine antigen capture immunoassays. VL urine samples were incubated with immobilised anti-L. donovani polyclonal antibodies and captured material was eluted. Sudanese eluted material and concentrated VL urine were analysed by western blot. Immunocaptured and immunoreactive material from Indian and Sudanese urine was submitted to mass spectrometry for protein identification. We identified six L. donovani proteins from VL urine. Named proteins were 40S ribosomal protein S9, kinases, and others were hypothetical. Thirty-three epitope regions were predicted with high specificity in the 6 proteins. Of these, 20 were highly specific to Leishmania spp. and are highly suitable for raising antibodies for the subsequent development of an antigen capture assay. We present all the identified proteins and analysed epitope regions in full so that they may contribute to the development of non-invasive immunoassays for this deadly disease.","TM was funded by the Sir Halley Stewart Trust (http://www.sirhalleystewart.org.uk/).

This research presents the results of an analysis on Patient Safety Culture (PSC), according to the perception of health professionals who work in the Psychosocial Care Network, through a descriptive observational cross-sectional study, using the Hospital Survey on Patient Safety Culture in a municipality in the Western Amazon of Brazil. Sixty-nine (69) professionals expressed that the best dimensions evaluated were: ""expectations and actions to promote the safety of supervisors and managers"" (75%) and ""support from hospital management to patient safety"" (64%). The worst evaluations were: ""non-punitive responses to errors"" (27%) and ""general perceptions about patient safety"" (35%), demonstrating that there still is a culture of fear of causing harm and the need for educational actions on patient safety. In general, all professionals have close contact with patients, regardless of the length on duty; however, the weekly workload and turnover in this sector is leading to a greater chance of errors. The analysis of the internal reliability of the dimensions ranged from 0.12 to 0.89. Only one-third of the respondents scored PSC as ""Good"" in the studied institutions and 63 out 69 professionals did not report any adverse events in the last 12 months.

Even though the terms sex and gender are often used in a binary way, there is considerable diversity in the way individuals and groups understand, experiment and express them. This narrative review describes some relevant aspects of the subjective difference that exists and favors men over women in the fields of sciences and research, starting from a historical perspective in the light of feminist movements.

The GDS-15 had a KR-20 coefficient of 0.90 for the non-indigenous group, 0.80 for Aymara, and 0.85 for Mapuche. The homogeneity index was 0.38 for non-indigenous, 0.24 for Aymara, and 0.29 for Mapuche.DiscussionThe GDS-15 showed satisfactory psychometric characteristics for the samples studied. However, the better results observed for the non-indigenous group suggest that some characteristics and content of the rating scale are not fully appropriate for the indigenous older population.ConclusionsThere is a need to develop the transcultural validation of scales such as GDS-15, which are applied in a standardized manner in geriatric evaluations as part of primary healthcare.",This study was funded by Government of Chile through the Comisión Nacional de Investigación Científica y Tecnológica (“Proyecto FONDECYT N° 1170493”).,,Psicologia: Reflexão e Crítica,,,,2020-05-19,2020,2020-05-19,2020-12,33,1,7,All OA; Gold,Article,"Gallardo-Peralta, Lorena P.; Rodríguez-Blázquez, Carmen; Ayala-García, Alba; Forjaz, María João","Gallardo-Peralta, Lorena P.

METHODS: Design: a global evidence mapping type systematic review. Data sources: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Health Systems Evidence, The Campbell Collaboration, PubMed, BioMed Central, CINAHL, EMBASE, Lilacs, and Health Evidence Portal. Review methods: Ad hoc descriptors were used to identify randomized controlled trials and other types of studies. The search was done between January 2003 and March 2020, limited to the English, Portuguese, and Spanish. The PRISMA-P protocol was applied to register the synthesis of the included studies. The quality of the evidence was evaluated according to the GRADE protocol and by three external evaluators.
RESULTS: A total of 8959 studies were identified, and, after screening and eligibility assessment, 18 studies were included in the systematic review, involving 1777 workers from 176 health centers in Spain, Portugal, Mexico, Nicaragua, Colombia, Brazil, Peru, and Argentina. Half of the included studies are randomized controlled trials; 37.2% of the included studies were deemed of moderate quality, while 18.7% were of high quality.
CONCLUSIONS: Preventive practices with strong evidence correspond to policies that improve the working conditions of night hospital work. We found low-quality evidence in six preventive dimensions for the practices based on multi-component interventions. We found evidence gaps in five domains of preventive interventions for psychosocial risks.",,,Medwave,,,Health Personnel; Humans; Occupational Diseases; Occupational Health; Occupational Health Services; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic,2020-08-31,2020,2020-08-31,,20,07,e8000-e8000,All OA; Gold,Article,"Abregú-Tueros, Luis Fidel","Abregú-Tueros, Luis Fidel (Programa de Posgraduação em Psicologia Social e Institucional, Instituto de Psicologia, Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul, Porto Alegre, Brasil.

Measures were taken early in order to strengthen the health system before the potential spread of the virus. Mandatory isolation measures impacted on the energy system: they modified energy demand and production patterns, and caused reasons for uncertainty among investors and project stakeholders. Nevertheless, profound changes caused by the pandemic, pave the way for the adoption of sustainable solutions with the potential to improve people's quality of life. This paper aims to explore the effects of the COVID-19 lockdown on the Argentinian energy sector and on the course of the transition. By means of secondary sources, such as public reports and national statistics, and semi-structured interviews, changes in the energy sector are analysed as well as local-scale alternatives for the post-pandemic. Community-led energy initiatives and the possibility of implementing sustainable practices, could contribute to reducing uncertainty and valorizing local resources and capabilities.",Institutions that support our research: National Council of Scientific and Technical Research (CONICET).

A number of studies have indicated that, in Latin American countries, male CSA is phenomenon of great concern. However, research on this topic is seriously lacking, and more specifically, on male-on-male CSA. We carried out a qualitative and quantitative secondary analysis of 680 cases of alleged male-on-male CSA that occurred between the years 2017 and 2018 in the Caribbean Region of Colombia. We analyzed the contents of forensic interviews with the alleged victims, conducted by professionals working at the Colombian Institute of Legal Medicine and Forensic Sciences. Our findings indicated a high prevalence of cases of alleged male-on-male CSA among young minors. Most of these cases were allegedly perpetrated by offenders known to the victim and involved high levels of violence. Evidence-based and culturally grounded preventative actions, such as training-based programs for teachers and parents among other public health initiatives are needed to address this type of CSA. Further research is also required to gain a more fine-grained understanding of the cultural and social context of CSA in the Caribbean Latin American countries.","The authors would like to acknowledge the help of Dick Edelstein in editing the final manuscript, and the support of Lissette Milhoua, Laura Villarreal, Julitsa Mendoza, and Marilyn Anturi for their help in the data management.",This study was carried out with the support of a 2019–0003 grant from the Instituto Nacional De Medicina Legal y Ciencias Forenses (Colombia) and Universidad del Norte awarded to Elsa Escalante-Barrios and Sandra Patricia Ferreira Pérez to carry out the research project entitled “Characterization of child sexual abuse in the Departments of the North Region of Colombia: Foundations for Prevention”.,International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health,,,"Adolescent; Caribbean Region; Child; Child Abuse, Sexual; Child, Preschool; Colombia; Criminals; Humans; Male; Prevalence; Social Problems",2020-11-01,2020,2020-11-08,2020-11-01,17,21,8248,All OA; Gold,Article,"Escalante-Barrios, Elsa Lucia; Fàbregues, Sergi; Meneses, Julio; del Mar García-Vita, María; Jabba, Daladier; Ricardo-Barreto, Carmen; Pérez, Sandra Patricia Ferreira","Escalante-Barrios, Elsa Lucia (Department of Education, Universidad del Norte, Km.5 Vía Puerto Colombia, 080001 Barranquilla, Colombia;, cricardo@uninorte.edu.co); Fàbregues, Sergi (Department of Psychology and Education, Universitat Oberta de Catalunya, Rambla del Poblenou, 156, 08018 Barcelona, Spain;, sfabreguesf@uoc.edu, (S.F.);, jmenesesn@uoc.edu, (J.M.)); Meneses, Julio (Department of Psychology and Education, Universitat Oberta de Catalunya, Rambla del Poblenou, 156, 08018 Barcelona, Spain;, sfabreguesf@uoc.edu, (S.F.);, jmenesesn@uoc.edu, (J.M.)); del Mar García-Vita, María (Department of Education, Universidad de Almería, Carretera Sacramento, Calle San Urbano, s/n, 04120 Almería, Spain;, margvita@ual.es); Jabba, Daladier (Department of Computer Science, Universidad del Norte, Km.5 Vía Puerto Colombia, 080001 Barranquilla, Colombia;, djabba@uninorte.edu.co); Ricardo-Barreto, Carmen (Department of Education, Universidad del Norte, Km.5 Vía Puerto Colombia, 080001 Barranquilla, Colombia;, cricardo@uninorte.edu.co); Pérez, Sandra Patricia Ferreira (Instituto Nacional De Medicina Legal y Ciencias Forenses (Regional Norte), Cra. 23 #5356, 080012 Barranquilla, Colombia;, sferreira@medicinalegal.gov.co)","Escalante-Barrios, Elsa Lucia (Universidad del Norte)","Escalante-Barrios, Elsa Lucia (Universidad del Norte); Fàbregues, Sergi (Open University of Catalonia; Department of Psychology and Education, Universitat Oberta de Catalunya, Rambla del Poblenou, 156, 08018 Barcelona, Spain;, sfabreguesf@uoc.edu, (S.F.);, jmenesesn@uoc.edu, (J.M.)); Meneses, Julio (Open University of Catalonia; Department of Psychology and Education, Universitat Oberta de Catalunya, Rambla del Poblenou, 156, 08018 Barcelona, Spain;, sfabreguesf@uoc.edu, (S.F.);, jmenesesn@uoc.edu, (J.M.)); del Mar García-Vita, María (University of Almería); Jabba, Daladier (Universidad del Norte); Ricardo-Barreto, Carmen (Universidad del Norte); Pérez, Sandra Patricia Ferreira (Instituto Nacional De Medicina Legal y Ciencias Forenses (Regional Norte), Cra. 23 #5356, 080012 Barranquilla, Colombia;, sferreira@medicinalegal.gov.co)",6,4,0.23,8.42,https://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/17/21/8248/pdf?version=1604995956,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1132450833,48 Law and Legal Studies; 4804 Law In Context,"16 Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions"

In this context, the measurement of work satisfaction is important for organizations that profess an interest in engaged and satisfied workers. Therefore, this study aims to examine the psychometric properties of the Satisfaction with Job Life Scale (SWJLS) in Portuguese workers by combining the procedures of the Classical Test Theory (CTT) and the Item Response Theory (IRT). Specifically, internal structure of the scale was studied, its reliability (consistency), correlations with other measures of wellbeing (life satisfaction, loneliness, emotional wellbeing at work, and job satisfaction) were also estimated, and finally, the sacle waqs tested for gender measurement invariance. Participants were 404 workers, 61% women and 39% men, aged between 18 and 64 years (M = 36.85; SD = 14.50). Confirmatory Factor Analysis indicated that the one-dimensional model of the SWJLS was adequate (Robust χ2(5) = 9.89, p = .078; CFI = .993; RMSEA = .049, 90% CI [.000 - .094]; SRMR = .011.) and had good internal consistency (ω = .947, 95% CI [.936, 956]; α = .947, 95% CI [.935, .955]). Subsequent analyses revealed that the scores of the SWJLS were related to other measures of job satisfaction (r = .742), job-related emotional well-being (r = .628), satisfaction with life (r = .808) and loneliness (r = -.455). Factorial invariance suggests that the structure of the SWJLS measures the same construct (satisfaction with work-life) in both female and male workers. Moreover, IRT analysis suggests that higher levels of work-life satisfaction are needed to choose the upper response options, while a very low level of work-life satisfaction is required to increase the likelihood of choosing the lower response options. In this sense, the SWJLS is useful and reliable, especially for identifying people with low levels of job satisfaction. These findings support the validity of the SWJLS and indicate that the Portuguese version is a brief instrument with good psychometric characteristics for measuring work-life satisfaction.",,"This study has been partially funded by the aid program Challenges of the Ministry of Science, Innovation and Universities, Spain [RTI2018-093321-B-100], the aid program for Special Actions of the Vice-Rectorate for Research of the University of Valencia, Spain [AE18-777619] and fund 20194003 of the Universidad Privada del Norte.",Heliyon,,,,2020-06-02,2020,2020-06-02,2020-06,6,6,e03881,All OA; Gold,Article,"Caycho-Rodríguez, Tomás; Neto, Joana; Tomás, José M.; Valencia, Pablo D.; Ventura-León, José; Neto, Félix; Reyes-Bossio, Mario; Vilca, Lindsey W.","Caycho-Rodríguez, Tomás (Universidad Privada del Norte, Lima, Peru); Neto, Joana (Universidade do Porto, Portugal); Tomás, José M.

Lirima, our study site, is a polyextreme, high-altitude, hydrothermal ecosystem located in the Chilean Andean highlands. Herein, we analyze the benthic communities of three nearby springs in a gradient of temperature (42-72 °C represented by stations P42, P53, and P72) and pH, and we characterize their microbial diversity by using bacteria 16S rRNA (V4) gene metabarcoding and 16S rRNA gene clone libraries (bacteria and archaea). Bacterial clone libraries of P42 and P53 springs showed that the community composition was mainly represented by phototrophic bacteria (Chlorobia, 3%, Cyanobacteria 3%, at P42; Chlorobia 5%, and Chloroflexi 5% at P53), Firmicutes (32% at P42 and 43% at P53) and Gammaproteobacteria (13% at P42 and 29% at P53). Furthermore, bacterial communities that were analyzed by 16S rRNA gene metabarcoding were characterized by an overall predominance of Chloroflexi in springs with lower temperatures (33% at P42), followed by Firmicutes in hotter springs (50% at P72). The archaeal diversity of P42 and P53 were represented by taxa belonging to Crenarchaeota, Diapherotrites, Nanoarchaeota, Hadesarchaeota, Thaumarchaeota, and Euryarchaeota. The microbial diversity of the Lirima hydrothermal system is represented by groups from deep branches of the tree of life, suggesting this ecosystem as a reservoir of primitive life and a key system to study the processes that shaped the evolution of the biosphere.","We thank Valeria Souza, Valerie de Anda, Gabriel Ponce and Mirna Vázquez from UNAM (Mexico), for their invaluable help in metadata analysis.

Cytogenetic information for the family Centrolophidae is lacking and the genomic size of five of the twenty-eight species described for this family are is barely known. This study aimed to describe for the first time the karyotype structure via classical and molecular cytogenetics analysis with the goal of identifying the constitutive heterochromatin distribution, chromosome organization of rDNA sequences and quantification of nuclear DNA content. The karyotype of S. violacea is composed of 48 chromosomes, with the presence of conspicuous blocks of heterochromatin on chromosomal pairs one and two. FISH assay with a 5S rDNA probe, revealed the presence of fluorescent markings on the heterochromatic block of pair one. The 18S rDNA sites are located exclusively on pair two, characterizing this pair as the carrier of the NOR. Finally, the genomic size of S. violacea was estimated at 0.59 pg of DNA as C-value. This work represents the first effort to document the karyotype structure and physical organization of the rDNA sequences in the Seriolella genome, contributing with new information to improve our understanding of chromosomal evolution and genomic organization in marine perciforms.","Dirección de Investigación y Análisis de la Produción Cientifica.

The standard critical N concentration (standard Nc) dilution curves, an expression of the dynamics of N uptake and dry matter accumulation in plants, are widely used to diagnose the N status of crops. Several standard Nc dilution curves were proposed and validated for several crops, based on experiments involving different N fertilizer treatments. However, standard Nc dilution curves are affected by crop water status, e.g., resulting from differences in irrigation management. This paper aimed at developing a N diagnostic model under the coupling effect of irrigation and fertilizer managements. For this purpose, Nc dilution curves were developed under different irrigation rates. Additionally, plant water content (PWC), leaf water content (LWC), leaf area index (LAI), equivalent water thickness (EWT), and leaf area duration (LAD) were introduced into the model, to construct a modified Nc (mNc) dilution curve. The mNc dilution curves were designed using the principle of hierarchical linear model (HLM), introducing aboveground dry biomass (AGB) as the first layer of information, whereas the second layer of information included the different agronomic variables (PWC, LWC, LAI, EWT, and LAD). The results showed that parameters ""a"" and ""b"" of the standard Nc dilution curves ranged from 5.17 to 6.52 and -0.69 to -0.38 respectively. Parameter ""a"" was easily affected by different management conditions. The performance of standard Nc dilution models obtained by the cross-validation method was worse than that of mNc dilution models. The Nc dilution curve based on 4 years of data was described by the negative power equation Nc = 5.05 × AGB-0.47, with R 2 and nRMSE of 0.63 and 0.21, respectively. The mNc dilution curve considers different treatments and was represented by the equation mNc = a×AGB-b , where a = 2.09 × PWC + 3.24, b = -0.02 × LAI + 0.51, with R 2 and nRMSE of 0.79 and 0.13, respectively. For winter wheat, C3 crop, there would be a few problems in using standard Nc dilution methods to guide field management, however, this study provides a reliable method for constructing mNc dilution curves under different water and N fertilizer management. Due to the significant differences in hereditary, CO2 fixation efficiency and N metabolism pathways for C3 and C4 crops, the construction of mNc dilution curve suitable for different N response mechanisms will be conducive to the sustainable N management in crop plants.",,"Funding.

For instance, in the context of psychology, when a set of instruments are applied to individuals, psychologists typically look for an explanation of particular psychological constructs (variables), such as personality, intelligence, or emotional functioning. It is common to cross statistical information from the results of different psychological tests to measure certain variables or to confirm prior beliefs. Here, we estimate the Joint Probability Density Function of suicide-related vulnerability and protective factors to assess suicide risk in adolescents. A Markov Chain Monte Carlo Method is employed to move away from the typical Gaussian assumption on data. This allows us to estimate probabilities of the development of suicidal ideation based on samples (which form a Markov chain). We employ our proposed statistical method at a high school in Colombia. The results reveal that adolescents can develop suicidal ideation as a consequence of the following factors, together with their corresponding probabilities: poor school performance 52%, low academic expectations 27%, school integration problems 68%, risky eating behaviors (binge-purge) 42%, risky eating behaviors (compensatory measurements) 21%, risky eating habits (restriction) 22%, and low family functionality 16%.",This work was supported by the Applied Math and Computer Science Laboratory at Universidad del Norte (AML-CS).,This research was funded by grant number 2019-004.,International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health,,,Adolescent; Adolescent Behavior; Colombia; Cross-Sectional Studies; Humans; Monte Carlo Method; Risk Factors; Suicidal Ideation; Suicide,2020-05-01,2020,2020-05-22,2020-05-01,17,10,3674,All OA; Gold,Article,"Nino-Ruiz, Elias David; Trejos-Herrera, Ana Maria; Exposito-Concepcion, Maria Yaquelin; Rodriguez-Giraldo, Marjorie; Consuegra-Ortega, Randy Steven; Guevara-Novoa, Claudia","Nino-Ruiz, Elias David (Applied Math and Computer Science Lab, Department of Computer Science, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla 080001, Colombia;, rconsuegra@uninorte.edu.co); Trejos-Herrera, Ana Maria (Department of Psychology, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla 080001, Colombia;, atrejos@uninorte.edu.co, (A.M.T.-H.);, marjoier@uninorte.edu.co, (M.R.-G.)); Exposito-Concepcion, Maria Yaquelin (Department of Nursing, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla 080001, Colombia;, mexposito@uninorte.edu.co, (M.Y.E.-C.);, cguevara@uninorte.edu.co, (C.G.-N.)); Rodriguez-Giraldo, Marjorie (Department of Psychology, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla 080001, Colombia;, atrejos@uninorte.edu.co, (A.M.T.-H.);, marjoier@uninorte.edu.co, (M.R.-G.)); Consuegra-Ortega, Randy Steven (Applied Math and Computer Science Lab, Department of Computer Science, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla 080001, Colombia;, rconsuegra@uninorte.edu.co); Guevara-Novoa, Claudia (Department of Nursing, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla 080001, Colombia;, mexposito@uninorte.edu.co, (M.Y.E.-C.);, cguevara@uninorte.edu.co, (C.G.-N.))","Nino-Ruiz, Elias David (Universidad del Norte)","Nino-Ruiz, Elias David (Universidad del Norte); Trejos-Herrera, Ana Maria (Universidad del Norte); Exposito-Concepcion, Maria Yaquelin (Universidad del Norte); Rodriguez-Giraldo, Marjorie (Universidad del Norte); Consuegra-Ortega, Randy Steven (Universidad del Norte); Guevara-Novoa, Claudia (Universidad del Norte)",2,1,0.21,0.59,https://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/17/10/3674/pdf?version=1590493766,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1127906707,52 Psychology; 5203 Clinical and Health Psychology,3 Good Health and Well Being

Efforts have been directed to search for candidate genes such as LEP, LEPR, and MC4R involved in the leptin-melanocortin system. The neuroendocrine regulation of these genes on energy intake and balance influences the pathogenesis of this disease. Contradictory results regarding the association of these genes with obesity raise the need for new research.
Objective: To analyze the association between obesity and LEP rs2167270, LEPR rs1137101, and MC4R rs17782313 polymorphisms and the clinical and biochemical variables in obese adults from Barranquilla, Colombia.
Materials and methods: We analyzed 111 obese adults and 155 non-obese individuals as controls. The polymorphisms were determined by real-time PCR. Besides, anthropometric measures, blood pressure, and biochemical tests were evaluated.
Results: No statistical differences were found in allele and genotype frequencies of gene polymorphisms between groups. The CC genotype of MC4R rs17782313 polymorphism was associated with increased systolic blood pressure and T allele and TT genotype, with decreased HDL cholesterol in obese adults. The effect of the other polymorphisms on these variables was not evidenced.
Conclusions: LEP rs2167270, LEPR rs1137101, and MC4R rs17782313 polymorphisms were not associated with obesity in the population under study.

Similarly, the food transition during migration has been related to a high consumption of foods high in refined sugars and saturated fats. There are specific characteristics of the eating behavior that may influence quality in the migrant population's diet. Objective: to compare feeding behavior between the Colombian and Chilean populations residing in the north and center of Chile. Method: the structured interview E-TONA, focused on assessing the behavioral components of daily and anomalous eating habits, was administered to 1,872 individuals, both Chileans and Colombians. Descriptive analyses of frequency distribution and logistic regressions were performed, and odds ratios were calculated. Results: there are significant differences in the majority of eating behaviors, both daily and anomalous, between Chileans and Colombian migrants. Chileans tend to follow more regular schedules and ""snack"" more between meals than migrants. Migrants have twice the risk of eating alone because they feel ashamed of their eating amount and speed, tend to show fewer behaviors related to better quality in their diet, and tend to be less worried about their diet than Chileans; however, Chileans are almost twice as likely to binge on food and use food as a method to calm anxiety.

We assessed the potential sub-lethal negative effects of these stressors in a native seabird listed as vulnerable in its south-eastern pacific distribution. This study was conducted in two red-tailed tropicbird (Phaethon rubricauda) colonies, one located in Rapa Nui Island, which is threatened by the presence of introduced predators, and the other located in Salas & Gómez Island, which has no introduced predators, but birds are infested by ectoparasitic louse flies.
METHODS: The effects on physiological stress traits of both, predation risk on different nest types (protected and exposed) on Rapa Nui, and different levels of louse flies' parasitic loads on Salas & Gómez were studied. Three variables were analyzed: the heterophil/lymphocyte (H/L) ratio, the transcriptional levels of mRNA HSP70 in blood, and the body condition. These stress indicators and leukocyte counts were compared between colonies.
RESULTS: No significant differences were found in any stress indicator between different nest types within Rapa Nui, showing that the effect of predator's presence was the same for adults nesting in both, protected and exposed nests. No significant correlation was found between louse flies' parasitic loads and any stress indicators in the birds of Salas & Gómez. Also, there was no difference in any stress indicator between islands. However, a significant opposite trend between islands was found in the eosinophil, lymphocyte, and monocyte counts when related to body condition.
CONCLUSIONS: We found a lack of significant differentiation in all the stress level indicators assessed within and between islands. The presence of louse flies in Salas & Gómez vs. the absence of this parasite at Rapa Nui may be the cause for the significant difference in the trend of eosinophil, lymphocyte and monocyte counts between the islands. However, further studies are necessary to elucidate the reason for this difference and to better investigate the lethal effects of introduced predators on the Rapa Nui colony to evaluate appropriate conservation measures for this native seabird.","Funding for this project was provided by a postdoctoral research grant awarded to Andrea I.

METHODS: This study reports, for the first time, the genome size and nuclear repetitive elements, including the 45S ribosomal DNA operon, 5S unit, and microsatellites, of P. argus.
RESULTS: Using a k-mer approach, the average haploid genome size estimated for P. argus was 2.17 Gbp. Repetitive elements comprised 69.02% of the nuclear genome. In turn, 30.98% of the genome represented low- or single-copy sequences. A considerable proportion of repetitive sequences could not be assigned to known repeat element families. Taking into account only annotated repetitive elements, the most frequent belonged to Class I-LINE which were noticeably more abundant than Class I-LTR-Ty- 3/Gypsy, Class I-LTR-Penelope, and Class I-LTR-Ty-3/Bel-Pao elements. Satellite DNA was also abundant. The ribosomal operon in P. argus comprises, in the following order, a 5' ETS (length = 707 bp), ssrDNA (1,875 bp), ITS1 (736 bp), 5.8S rDNA (162 bp), ITS2 (1,314 bp), lsrDNA (5,387 bp), and 3' ETS (287 bp).

Loss-of-function mutants of H+-PPase (fugu5s) have been reported to show atrophic phenotypes in their rosette leaves when nitrate is the sole nitrogen source in the culture medium. For this phenotype, two questions remain unanswered: why does atrophy depend on physical contact between shoots and the medium, and how does ammonium prevent such atrophy. To understand the mechanism driving this phenotype, we analyzed the growth and phenotypes of mutants on ammonium-free medium in detail. fugu5-1 showed cuticle defects, cell swelling, reduced β-glucan levels, and vein malformation in the leaves, suggesting cell wall weakening and cell lethality. Based on the observation in the double mutants fugu5-1 ppa1 and fugu5-1 ppa4 of more severe atrophy compared to fugu5-1, the nitrogen-dependent phenotype might be linked to PPi metabolism. To elucidate the role of ammonium in this process, we examined the fluctuations of sPPase mRNA levels and the possibility of alternative PPi-removing factors, such as other types of pyrophosphatase. First, we found that both the protein and mRNA levels of sPPases were unaffected by the nitrogen source. Second, to assess the influence of other PPi-removing factors, we examined the phenotypes of triple knockout mutants of H+-PPase and two sPPases on ammonium-containing medium. Both fugu5 ppa1 ppa2 and fugu5 ppa1 ppa4 had nearly lethal embryonic phenotypes, with the survivors showing striking dwarfism and abnormal morphology. Moreover, fugu5 ppa1+/- ppa4 showed severe atrophy at the leaf margins. The other triple mutants, fugu5 ppa1 ppa5 and fugu5 ppa2 ppa4, exhibited death of root hairs and were nearly sterile due to deformed pistils, respectively, even when grown on standard medium. Together, these results suggest that H+-PPase and sPPases act in concert to maintain PPi homeostasis, that the existence of other PPi removers is unlikely, and that ammonium may suppress the production of PPi during nitrogen metabolism rather than stimulating PPi hydrolysis.","We are grateful to Drs.

Managerial positions in these contexts are highly stressful, and although physical activity may reduce the negative effects of work stress, the relationships between these two aspects regarding their effects on the body mass index (BMI) of obese managers are scarcely studied. This article aims to study such relationships by using the Job Content Questionnaire (JCQ) dimensions with the Baecke's physical activity questionnaire dimensions and analyzing their effects on the BMI. A sample of 255 managers from the Mexican industry, with a (BMI > 30) participated by answering the surveys and providing their weight, their height, and certain sociodemographic information. The research hypotheses were tested using WarpPLS® 6.0 for structural equation modeling. The results for three models featuring acceptable reliability to estimate the direct, indirect, and total effects are presented. The first model showed a medium explanatory power, the variable of job decision-making authority having the greatest direct effect on BMI. The second model showed a medium explanatory power, and the variable of physical activity during leisure-time observed the unique direct effect on BMI. Finally, although the integrating model showed a small explanatory power, both work stress and the physical activity exerted observed direct effects on BMI reduction.","The authors acknowledge the take part companies for their invaluable contributions and participation.

It is critical to describe the characteristics of retina at the single-cell level for understanding its biological functions. A variety of abnormalities in terms of morphology and function are present in the trisomy 21 (T21) retina. To evaluate the consequences of chromosome aneuploidy on retina development, we identified the single-cell transcriptional profiles of a T21 fetus and performed comprehensive bioinformatic analyses. Our data revealed the diversity and heterogeneity of cellular compositions in T21 retina, as well as the abnormal constitution of T21 retina compared to disomic retina. In total, we identified seven major cell types and several subtypes within each cell type, followed by the detection of corresponding molecular markers, including previously reported ones and a series of novel markers. Through the analysis of the retinal differentiation process, subtypes of retinal progenitor cells (RPCs) exhibiting the potential of different retinal cell-type commitments and certain Müller glial cells (MGs) with differentiating potency were identified. Moreover, the extensive communication networks between cellular types were confirmed, among which a few ligand-receptor interactions were related to the formation and function of retina and immunoregulatory interactions. Taken together, our data provides the first ever single-cell transcriptome profiles for human T21 retina, which facilitates the understanding on the dosage effects of chromosome 21 on the development of retina.","We sincerely thank the Department of Obstetrics of Shiyan Taihe Hospital for the gift of a T21 human fetal retina sample.

Evidence of past environmental conditions is commonly preserved in natural archives, such as lacustrine sediments. Sediment records obtained from Inca Coya Lake (22°20'S-68°35'W, 2534 m.a.s.l.), a small lake located in the Atacama Desert, reflected the evolution of regional mining activity during the 20th century and sedimentation associated with decadal climate variability. We studied the aquatic community structure changes recorded in sediment records from Inca Coya Lake. By analysis of magnetic properties (susceptibility, hysteresis curves and Curie temperatures), grain size and geochemical composition of the sediments, we identified environmental periods and changes in the community of benthic and planktonic organisms (diatoms and diapausing egg bank). We identified three detrital episodes that we interpret as dry/wet phases during the last 90 years associated with the increase of flash flood events promoting hypoxia oscillations; anthropogenic (mining activity) signals were also identified. Invertebrate community structure (primary consumers) reflected the metal exposure, measured as changes in assemblage composition through species turnover. Diatom community composition was best associated with variables related to wetter/drier alternation and consequent changes in oxygen availability. Bioindicators analyzed (diatoms, diapausing egg bank and invertebrate community) demonstrated to be excellent indicators of the bioavailability of compounds in the aquatic ecosystem of Inca Coya Lake, allowing the environmental impact assessment of the water resources due to flash floods and mining activity in the driest desert of the world.","This work was supported by: A.A-A.

An ancient DNA study,"The southern boundary of prehispanic farming in South America occurs in central Mendoza Province, Argentina at approximately 34 degrees south latitude. Archaeological evidence of farming includes the recovery of macrobotanical remains of cultigens and isotopic chemistry of human bone. Since the 1990s, archaeologists have also hypothesized that the llama (Lama glama), a domesticated South American camelid, was also herded near the southern boundary of prehispanic farming. The remains of a wild congeneric camelid, the guanaco (Lama guanicoe), however, are common in archaeological sites throughout Mendoza Province. It is difficult to distinguish bones of the domestic llama from wild guanaco in terms of osteological morphology, and therefore, claims that llama were in geographic areas where guanaco were also present based on osteometric analysis alone remain equivocal. A recent study, for example, claimed that twenty-five percent of the camelid remains from the high elevation Andes site of Laguna del Diamante S4 were identified based on osteometric evidence as domestic llama, but guanaco are also a likely candidate since the two species overlap in size. We test the hypothesis that domesticated camelids occurred in prehispanic, southern Mendoza through analysis of ancient DNA. We generated whole mitochondrial genome datasets from 41 samples from southern Mendoza late Holocene archaeological sites, located between 450 and 3400 meters above sea level (masl). All camelid samples from those sites were identified as guanaco; thus, we have no evidence to support the hypothesis that the domestic llama occurred in prehispanic southern Mendoza.","This work was supported by United States National Science Foundation Grant number 1630051 (Principal Investigator – SW; Co-Principal Investigator – JJ; Co-Principal Investigator – LN) and Agencia Nacional de Promotion Cientifica PICT 2013-0881.

In recent years, it has been shown that the excess and distribution of body fat increases morbidity, with excess visceral fat being the most important factor that triggers pathologies. Thus, estimation of visceral fat makes it possible to identify patients with a higher cardiovascular risk, aiding the management of obesity. The main objective of the study was to identify predictors of the visceral fat index through a lifestyle intervention and to observe the effect of the intervention on dietary habits and functional capacity.
METHODS: A randomized intervention, parallel-group study was made. This study included 97 obese and overweight people (control group, n = 48; experimental group, n = 49) with a low socioeconomic status in an 8-month lifestyle intervention. Anthropometric, fitness and nutritional tests were assessed.
RESULTS: It was found that being female, eating the recommended daily portions of fruit, gaining strength in the legs and gaining flexibility are factors predictive of a lower visceral fat index. Age over 45 years and eating the recommended weekly portions of cereals and meats, fat and processed meats increases the visceral fat index after a lifestyle intervention. There were changes in the visceral fat index and in the different physical condition variables, but not in eating habits.
CONCLUSION: A multicomponent lifestyle intervention reduces the visceral fat index; age over 45 and consuming cereals and meat increases the visceral fat index.",,,Obesity Facts,,,Adult; Aged; Exercise; Feeding Behavior; Female; Humans; Intra-Abdominal Fat; Life Style; Male; Middle Aged; Obesity; Overweight; Young Adult,2020-06-12,2020,2020-06-12,2020,13,3,403-414,All OA; Gold,Article,"López-Hernández, Lourdes; Pérez-Ros, Pilar; Fargueta, María; Elvira, Laura; López-Soler, Josep; Pablos, Ana","López-Hernández, Lourdes (Department of Nursing, Universidad Católica de Valencia San Vicente Mártir, Valencia, Spain); Pérez-Ros, Pilar (Department of Nursing, Universidad Católica de Valencia San Vicente Mártir, Valencia, Spain); Fargueta, María (Faculty of Physical Activity and Sport Sciences, Universidad Católica de Valencia San Vicente Martir, Valencia, Spain); Elvira, Laura (Faculty of Physical Activity and Sport Sciences, Universidad Católica de Valencia San Vicente Martir, Valencia, Spain); López-Soler, Josep (Faculty of Physical Activity and Sport Sciences, Universidad Católica de Valencia San Vicente Martir, Valencia, Spain); Pablos, Ana (Faculty of Physical Activity and Sport Sciences, Universidad Católica de Valencia San Vicente Martir, Valencia, Spain)","Pérez-Ros, Pilar (Valencia Catholic University Saint Vincent Martyr)","López-Hernández, Lourdes (Valencia Catholic University Saint Vincent Martyr); Pérez-Ros, Pilar (Valencia Catholic University Saint Vincent Martyr); Fargueta, María (Valencia Catholic University Saint Vincent Martyr); Elvira, Laura (Valencia Catholic University Saint Vincent Martyr); López-Soler, Josep (Valencia Catholic University Saint Vincent Martyr); Pablos, Ana (Valencia Catholic University Saint Vincent Martyr)",2,1,0.13,0.51,https://www.karger.com/Article/Pdf/507960,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1128460711,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3210 Nutrition and Dietetics; 42 Health Sciences; 4206 Public Health,

The total solar eclipse passed through Coquimbo region from ~ 16:38 CLT (~ 20:38 UTC) to ~ 16:40 CLT (~ 20:40 UTC) and maximum eclipse was observed ~ 16:39 CLT (~ 20:39 UTC). The total electron content (TEC) derived from GPS signals shows peculiar features. At the totality stations TEC variations are small (~ 0.39 TECu), but it shows significant decrease (maximum ~ 2.24 TECu) for stations located south and increase (maximum ~ 3.89 TECu) for the stations located north of totality of the surface. The wavelet analysis of VTEC timeseries shows the presence of strong atmospheric gravity waves (AGWs) of duration ~ 30 to 60 min at the stations located north of totality. Thus, the results suggest an interplay between eclipse effect on the ionosphere plasma density and eclipse generated AGWs induced plasma density perturbation provided the peculiar features.","The author A.K.M. thanks the Science and Education Research Board (SERB) for financial support under Ramanujan Fellowship (File No. SB/S2/RJN-052/2016) and the Faculty Recharge Program (FRP) of the University Grants Commission (UGC) (ID FRP62343), New Delhi.

Biosimilar teriparatide, which is believed to have efficacy and safety similar to the originator product, is now available in Colombia. However, little is known about patients' preferences for originator biologic and biosimilar treatments. Our objective was to quantify the relative importance that patients in Colombia place on features of injectable osteoporosis treatments including whether the treatment is an originator biologic or a biosimilar.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: We used a discrete choice experiment (DCE) to elicit preferences of patients with osteoporosis treatment devices in Colombia. The survey was completed by 200 respondents at high risk of fracture, with or without teriparatide experience. Each treatment alternative within the DCE was characterized by five attributes: type of medicine (originator biologic, biosimilar), needle length, angle of injection, how to measure the medicine dose, and how long the medicine can be left unrefrigerated. A random parameters logit regression was used to estimate preferences and conditional relative attribute importance, while controlling for preference heterogeneity.
RESULTS: A total of 200 patients (mean age = 58.3 years) completed the survey. Most were female (84.5%) and married (54.5%); 50.5% had secondary education or less, 21% had current teriparatide exposure. The attribute with the highest conditional relative importance estimate (standard error) was biologic versus biosimilar (10 [1.11]), followed by needle length (8.06 [1.11]), dose measurement (6.38 [0.87]), refrigeration (3.81 [1.18]), and angle of injection (1.30 [0.66]). Unobserved preference heterogeneity was present and controlled for in the analyses.
CONCLUSION: Despite the availability of biosimilar teriparatide in Colombia, patients expressed a strong preference for an originator biologic osteoporosis medicine over a biosimilar osteoporosis medicine, when the efficacy, safety, and cost of the two options were assumed to be the same.","The research was funded by Eli Lilly and Company.

Materials and Methods: Data from 761 UC patients who underwent testing for PD-L1 expression using the VENTANA (SP-142 immunohistochemistry assay) for measuring PD-L1 expression according to the manufacturer's protocol between February 2016 and July 2019 were retrospectively reviewed. Patients were categorized into three groups based on the percentage of tumor area covered by PD-L1-expressing tumor-infiltrating immune cells (ICs) as follows: IC0 (<1%), IC1 (≥1% and <5%), and IC2/3 (≥5%). Positive PD-L1 expression was defined as IC2/3 (≥5%). The factors related to positive PD-L1 expression were assessed by using unadjusted and adjusted logistic regression analyses. Results: In the entire cohort, 213 (28%) patients showed positive PD-L1 expression. Final adjusted regression analyses for positive PD-L1 expression revealed that several factors, including intravesical BCG prior to PD-L1 testing (odds ratio [OR] 0.57, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.37-0.96), advanced tumor stage (stage III/IV) (OR 2.04, 95% CI 1.41-2.93), and high tumor grade (OR 5.31, 95% CI 2.38-11.83) were significantly associated with positive PD-L1 expression. Conclusions: This study showed that the PD-L1 expression is associated with several clinical and pathological factors for the first time in a real-world setting. Further follow-up clinical trials should consider adjusting these factors, including intravesical BCG treatment, tumor stage and grade to clarify the utility of PD-L1 as a biomarker.","We thank all of the researchers who gathered the data from the nine Korean academic institutions, including those from the Dongguk University Ilsan Medical Center, Yonsei University Severance Hospital, Chonnam National University Hwasun Hospital, Ewha Womans University Mokdong Hospital, Seoul National University Hospital, Pusan National University Hospital, Chung-Ang University Hospital, Kyung Hee University Hospital at Gangdong, and National Cancer Center.

In order to robustly model magma evolution and assimilation at subduction zones such as the Andes, the compositions of parental magmas feeding crustal magma reservoirs need to be defined. Here we present new olivine and clinopyroxene oxygen isotope data from rare mafic volcanic rocks erupted at the margins of the giant Altiplano-Puna Magma Body (APMB) of the Altiplano-Puna Volcanic Complex, Central Andes. Existing olivine and pyroxene δ18O values for the Central Andes are highly variable and potentially not representative of sub-arc parental compositions. However, new olivine (n = 6) and clinopyroxene (n = 12) δ18O values of six Central Andean volcanoes presented here display a narrow range, with averages at 6.0‰ ± 0.2 (2σ S.D.) and 6.7‰ ± 0.3 (2σ S.D.), consistent with a common history for the investigated minerals. These data allow us to estimate the δ18O values of sub-arc, parental melts to ca. 7.0‰ ± 0.2 (2σ S.D.). Parental melts feeding the APMB and associated volcanic centres are postulated to form in the felsic continental crust following assimilation of up to 28% high-δ18O basement rocks by mantle-derived magmas.","We thank the two anonymous reviewers for their constructive suggestions and comments that helped to significantly improve this manuscript, and Christoph Beier for editorial handling.

Thus, water availability for irrigation is decisive for crop success, such as the case of highbush blueberry (Vaccinium corymbosum L.). Therefore, drought stress may compromise blueberry production due to lower fruit weight or fruit yield. Despite this, it is unclear if there is any difference in the response of blueberry cultivars to water deficit, either in terms of physiological and molecular parameters, or in terms of their sensitivity or resistance to drought. In this study, we determined the effect of drought on different physiological parameters in blueberry plants (relative water content (RWC), photochemical efficiency of photosystem II (Fv/Fm), Carbon Isotopic Discrimination, and proline content) in six V. corymbosum cultivars. We also explored molecular responses in terms of gene expression coding for late embryogenesis abundant proteins. Finally, we estimated cultivar water deficit resistance using an integrative model based on physiological results. Upon water deficit conditions, we found reductions in Fv/Fm, RWC, and isotopic discrimination of 13C (Δ13C), while proline content increased significantly for all cultivars. Additionally, we also found differences in the estimated water deficit resistance index. These results indicate differences in water deficit resistance, possibly due to variations in cultivars' genetic composition.","The authors are grateful to Maria Jose Romero for help with the physiological measurements, Ricardo Perez-Díaz and Samuel Morales-Navarro for help with the qPCR analysis, and Miguel Garriga for help with the experimental design.

Here we assessed the characteristics of the SM battery, developed by Catricalà et al. (2013), in a sample of Colombian children. This battery was originally conceived to evaluate adults, and features six subtests that assess SM in different modalities, using a common set of 48 stimuli in both living and nonliving categories. The design of the current study is of a cross-sectional and exploratory type. The sample was composed of 111 children, 57 boys (51%) and 54 girls (49%), who were 6 (n = 68) and 7 (n = 43) years old and had no intellectual disability. Robust linear regression models and correlation networks were used. We found an effect of age on general intelligence after correcting for gender, and no differences on the six subtest scores after corrections for gender and age were performed. Furthermore, age was found to be positively associated with the naming of colored photographs (β = .75, p = .039), naming in response to an oral description (β = 1.81, p = .039), picture sorting at four levels (β = 7.22, p = .029), and sentence verification (β = 26.66, p = .01). In addition, there were differences between the results obtained in adults in the original study and in the children of our study. This exploratory study supports the feasibility of the Spanish translation of the Catricalà et al. (2013) battery to assess SM in children with a nonclinical condition. Future studies are needed to evaluate the psychometric properties of this SM battery, and to corroborate and expand our findings in a larger sample of control children, and in children with some degree of intellectual disability or suffering of some neurodegenerative or psychiatric conditions.","We thank all individuals participating in this study for their cooperation, disposition, and patience.

Objective: To determine the relationship between the expression of the alpha synuclein gene (SNCA) in blood, single nucleotide variant (SNV) in its promoter region, and chronic constipation in people with problems of alcohol consumption.
Materials and methods: The sample consisted of 35 controls and 27 cases selected according to the score obtained with the AUDIT tool. For the diagnosis of constipation, the Rome IV criteria were applied. Nucleic acid extraction was performed from peripheral blood and the expression of the gene was evaluated by qPCR, protein quantification by ELISA, and the presence of SNV in the promoter region of the gene by Sanger sequencing.
Results: We observed a relative gene overexpression of SNCA mRNA in the case group, which was not related to the diagnosis of chronic constipation. There was 4.8 times greater risk of presenting constipation in the group of cases. Besides, nine single nucleotide variants were found in a segment of the promoter region of the gene rich in CpG regulatory sequences with similar frequency between the groups while a variant was identified in position -2171, which is not reported in GenBank for variants and whose genotype A/T was associated with increased expression of SNCA mRNA.
Conclusion: We evidenced an overexpression of alpha synuclein mRNA in people with problems of alcohol consumption that was not related to the diagnosis of chronic constipation.","A los participantes voluntarios del estudio, a los estudiantes de pregrado y posgrado del Semillero de Investigación, subgrupo de Genética de las Adicciones, Grupo de Genética Clínica, y a todo el personal del Instituto de Genética de la Universidad Nacional de Colombia que de una u otra forma han contribuido al desarrollo de este trabajo.",,Biomédica,,,"Adult; Alcoholism; Case-Control Studies; Chronic Disease; Colombia; Constipation; Female; Gastrointestinal Motility; Gene Expression; Gene Frequency; Humans; Inflammation; Leukocytes, Mononuclear; Male; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Prevalence; Promoter Regions, Genetic; RNA, Messenger; Urban Population; Young Adult; alpha-Synuclein",2020-06-15,2020,2020-06-15,,40,2,309-321,All OA; Gold,Article,"Martínez-Rodríguez, Tania Yadira; Rey-Buitrago, Mauricio","Martínez-Rodríguez, Tania Yadira (Maestría en Fisiología, Departamento de Ciencias Fisiológicas, Facultad de Medicina, Universidad Nacional de Colombia, Bogotá, D.C., Colombia, Universidad Nacional de Colombia, Maestría en Fisiología, Departamento de Ciencias Fisiológicas, Facultad de Medicina, Universidad Nacional de Colombia, Bogotá, D.C, Colombia); Rey-Buitrago, Mauricio (Maestria en Genetica Humana, Departamento de Morfologia, Facultad de Medicina, Universidad Nacional de Colombia, Bogota, D.C., Colombia, Universidad Nacional de Colombia, Maestria en Genetica Humana, Departamento de Morfologia, Facultad de Medicina, Universidad Nacional de Colombia, Bogota, D.C, Colombia)","Rey-Buitrago, Mauricio (National University of Colombia)","Martínez-Rodríguez, Tania Yadira (National University of Colombia); Rey-Buitrago, Mauricio (National University of Colombia)",3,3,0.11,0.59,https://revistabiomedica.org/index.php/biomedica/article/download/4771/4593,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1129358186,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3214 Pharmacology and Pharmaceutical Sciences,3 Good Health and Well Being

The new species from the plain squeaker, Synodontis zambezensis Peters (Siluriformes: Mochokidae), is morphologically most similar to Wenyonia acuminata Woodland, 1923, a species reported from three species of Synodontis in north-eastern, western and central Africa (Sudan, Nigeria, Democratic Republic of the Congo). Both these species are markedly different from congeners by having a nematoform body and a digitiform scolex. Wenyonia gracilis sp. n. differs from W. acuminata in its general body size, length and width of main body regions (testicular and uterine regions), a posterior extension of the testes into the uterine region, numerous postovarian vitelline follicles filling the entire medulla, eggs c. 1/3 larger in size, and a scolex with an apical introvert but devoid of longitudinal furrows and a well-defined base.

Aim To assess the correlation between AASI and brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity (baPWV), ankle-brachial index (ABI) and cardio-ankle vascular index (CAVI) in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus without hypertension. Material and Methods Cross sectional study in 28 diabetic patients aged 49 ± 7 years (40% women). AASI was calculated as 1 minus the regression slope of diastolic on systolic blood pressure, using ABPM data. ABPM was measured in the arm using an oscillometric device. ABI was calculated as the ratio between ankle and brachial systolic blood pressure. CAVI was derived from pulse wave velocity using the Vasera VS-1000 device. Correlations were calculated using a bivariate Spearman correlation. Results The mean values for AASI, ABI, baPWV and CAVI were 0.39 ± 0.14, 1.14 ± 0.09, 15.15 ± 2.71 m/s and 7.60 ± 1.90, respectively. There was a significant negative correlation between AASI and ABI (r = -0.491, p < 0.01).

These transformations revealed mechanistic pathways that had not been previously observed in reactions involving carbophilic catalysis. In particular, we have found that allenedienes bearing a silyl ether in the carbon tether connecting the diene and the allene divergently afford cyclopropane-embedded tricyclic derivatives, 6,6-fused bicarbocyclic products or 5,6-fused bicarbocyclic systems, depending on the type of Au or Pt catalyst used. We have carried out experimental and computational studies that shed light on the mechanistic reasons behind this rich and unusual skeletal divergence, and provide new lessons on the drastic influence of platinum ancillary ligands on the reaction outcome.","This work received financial support from the Spanish MINECO (SAF2016-76689-R, CTQ2016-77047-P, CTQ2017-84767-P, CTQ2017-87889-P, RYC-2016-20335 and RTI2018-098795-A-I00), the Xunta de Galicia (ED431C 2017/19, 2015-CP082, Centro Singular de Investigación de Galicia accreditation 2019–2022, ED431G 2019/03 and predoctoral fellowship ED481A-2017/068 to M.

The Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment (CGA) is used as an evaluation tool for these parameters through the use of validated, simple and easy-to-apply instruments. Objective: to report the health status of older adults who attend a primary care center in an urban-marginal area of Guayaquil (Ecuador) through CGA, as a first step in order to establish a coordinated care plan in the areas studied. Material and Methods: a cross-sectional assessment of 196 aged subjects with a median age of 70.9 years (83 % females) who attended a Primary Care Community Health Center in Guayaquil. Nutritional, social, demographic, functional, and cognitive variables were assessed. Results: participants had a mean age of 70.9 ± 7.1 years. Demographic variables: 73 % were Afro-Ecuadorian, 69 % had basic education, and 57 % performed no physical activity. Clinical assessment: 47.4 % presented with vision impairment, and 37.8 % with hearing problems; 52 % had nutritional risk and 6 % malnutrition. Social valuation: 13 % had severe social deterioration; 40 % had some cognitive impairment, and 8.2 % had depression; 46.9 % were functionally dependent, and 16.8 % had dynapenia.

These complexes modify histone-DNA interactions and therefore play a pivotal role in different DNA-dependent processes. In Trypanosoma cruzi, a protozoan that controls gene expression principally post-transcriptionally, the transcriptional regulation mechanisms mediated by chromatin remodeling are poorly understood. OBJECTIVE To characterise the ISWI remodeler in T. cruzi (TcISWI). METHODS A new version of pTcGW vectors was constructed to express green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged TcISWI. CRISPR-Cas9 system was used to obtain parasites with inactivated TcISWI gene and we determined TcISWI partners by cryomilling-affinity purification-mass spectrometry (MS) assay as an approximation to start to unravel the function of this protein. FINDINGS Our approach identified known ISWI partners [nucleoplasmin-like protein (NLP), regulator of chromosome condensation 1-like protein (RCCP) and phenylalanine/tyrosine-rich protein (FYRP)], previously characterised in T. brucei, and new components in TcISWI complex [DRBD2, DHH1 and proteins containing a domain characteristic of structural maintenance of chromosomes (SMC) proteins]. Data are available via ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD017869. MAIN CONCLUSIONS In addition to its participation in transcriptional silencing, as it was reported in T. brucei, the data generated here provide a framework that suggests a role for TcISWI chromatin remodeler in different nuclear processes in T. cruzi, including mRNA nuclear export control and chromatin compaction. Further work is necessary to clarify the TcISWI functional diversity that arises from this protein interaction study.","To Fiocruz for the use of its facilities, especially to Dr Priscila Mazzocchi Hiraiwa, Dr Rodrigo Netto Costa and Dr Kelly Cavalcanti Machado.

In addition, both signaling pathways fulfill important roles in cancer initiation and progression. The present study was aimed at identifying mechanistic differences between INSR and IGF1R using a recently developed bioinformatics tool, the Biological Network Simulator (BioNSi). This application allows to import and merge multiple pathways and interaction information from the KEGG database into a single network representation. The BioNsi network simulation tool allowed us to exploit the availability of gene expression data derived from breast cancer cell lines with specific disruptions of the INSR or IGF1R genes in order to investigate potential differences in protein expression that might be linked to biological attributes of the specific receptor networks. Modeling-generated information was corroborated by experimental and biological assays. BioNSi analyses revealed that the expression of 75 and 71 genes changed during simulation of IGF1R-KD and INSR-KD, compared to control cells, respectively. Out of 16 proteins that BioNSi analysis was based on, validated by Western blotting, nine were shown to be involved in DNA repair, eight in cell cycle checkpoints, six in proliferation, eight in apoptosis, seven in oxidative stress, six in cell migration, two in energy homeostasis, and three in senescence. Taken together, analyses identified a number of commonalities and, most importantly, dissimilarities between the IGF1R and INSR pathways that might help explain the basis for the biological differences between these networks.","We thank Drs.

Understanding how these can be modulated at low-frequency is thus critical to infer their role in the climate system. Here we use 26 years of satellite altimeter data and regional oceanic modeling to investigate the modulation of eddy kinetic energy (EKE) off Peru and Chile by ENSO, the main mode of natural variability in the tropical Pacific. We show that EKE tends to increase during strong Eastern Pacific (EP) El Niño events along the Peruvian coast up to northern Chile and decreases off central Chile, while it is hardly changed during Central Pacific El Niño and La Niña events. However the magnitude of the EKE changes during strong EP El Niño events is not proportional to their strength, with in particular the 1972/1973 El Niño event standing out as an extreme event in terms of EKE increase off Peru reaching an amplitude three times as large as that during the 1997/1998 El Niño event, and the 2015/2016 El Niño having instead a weak impact on EKE. This produces decadal changes in EKE, with a similar pattern than that of strong EP El Niño events, resulting in a significant negative (positive) long-term trend off Peru (central Chile).",Carlos Conejero was supported by a doctoral scholarship from the National Chilean Research and Technology Council (CONICYT) through the program Becas Chile (scholarship N°72170554).

Previous studies have mostly focused on the roles of somatic mutations in tumorigenesis, but how germline variants act is largely unknown. In this study, we hypothesized that allelic expression imbalance (AEI) participated in the process of germline variants on tumorigenesis. We screened single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) as representative germline variants. By using 127 patients' RNA sequencing data from paired lung cancer and adjacent normal tissues from public databases, we analyzed the effects of the functional consequence of SNPs, function and conservativeness on genes with AEI. We found that natural selection can affect AEI. Functional adaptability of genes with a high frequency of AEI and a correlation of the incidence of AEI with conservativeness were observed in both adjacent tissues and tumor tissues. Moreover, we observed a higher incidence of AEI in genes with non-synonymous SNPs than in those with synonymous SNPs. However, we also found that AEI was affected by allele expression noise, especially in tumor tissues, which led to an increased proportion of AEI, weakened the effect of natural selection and eliminated the influence of the functional consequence of SNPs on AEI. We unveiled a previously unknown adaptive regulatory mechanism in which the effect of natural selection on SNPs can be reflected in allelic expression, which provides insight into a better understanding of cancer evolution.","We thank Guohong Hu, Jingyu Lang, and Shanye Yin for their advice.

In the last 10 years, more than 400,000 young people carry, in their life experiences, the title of victims. The psychological and social circumstances that determine the lives of displaced young people in the world are not unknown. Fear, the poor resources for social adaptation available to them, and the possible reproduction of the cycle of violence, represent psychosocial risk factors in the young and displaced population. In this context, the Victims Law in Colombia stipulated various measures of repairment, including Relocation (the person or household victim of forced displacement decides to settle in some place, other than the one they were forced to leave) and Return (the person or the household victim of forced displacement decides to return to the place from which they were displaced, in order to settle indefinitely) provided the conditions of voluntariness, security, and dignity are present. A hypothesis that well-being will be better in the returnees was set, since they would strengthen the social support networks between neighbors and other victims in their old spaces of life. To test the hypothesis, the scales of Psychological Well-being, Social Well-being, the Satisfaction with Life Scale, and the Psychosocial Trauma Scale were applied to young returnees (n = 129) and relocated (n = 259) in Colombia. The Exploratory and Confirmatory Factor Analysis was performed to extract the general measure of well-being and psychosocial trauma followed by the comparison between the groups. Significance, power, and effect size indicators were obtained, and finally, the partial correlation between the groups was made in relation to psychosocial trauma and well-being. Results showed that returnees have greater well-being and clearer indicators (d = 0.365, 1-β = 0.996), with respect to that of relocated. In addition, the well-being of returnees has fewer trauma factors, who in turn are quasi-moderated by the situation of return or relocation.","We thank the editors for taking the time to evaluate our work.

The research was based on a non-experimental methodology with an associative-relational strategy. An intentional non-probabilistic sample of 151 people affected by the winter wave in the south of the Department of Atlántico (Colombia) was selected. In total, the study included 42 males (27.8%) and 109 females (72.2%) participants, with an average age of 37.48 (±14, ranging from 18 to 80) and average relocation time of 21.79 months (±8.22, ranging from 5 to 36). The Arizona Social Support Interview Schedule (ASSIS) and Community Empowerment instruments were responded to with an instrument adapted from the leadership competence factor. The results show lower rates of intermediation in the older population, and the relationship between social participation and gender shows equally cohesive social support networks in men and women. This evidence is discussed to promote psychosocial interventions aimed to increase community engagement and empowerment of people that have experienced non-voluntary mobility processes.","The authors thank the copy editors for dedicating time and efforts in evaluating our work.

The method works as follows: via an ensemble of model realizations, a well-conditioned and full-rank square-root approximation of the background error covariance matrix is obtained. This square-root approximation serves as a control space onto which analysis increments can be computed. These are calculated via Line-Search (LS) optimization. We theoretically prove the convergence of the MLEF-MC. Experimental simulations were performed using an Atmospheric General Circulation Model (AT-GCM) and a highly nonlinear observation operator. The results reveal that the proposed method can obtain posterior error estimates within reasonable accuracies in terms of ℓ - 2 error norms. Furthermore, our analysis estimates are similar to those of the MLEF with large ensemble sizes and full observational networks.","This work was supported in part by award UN 2018-38, and by the Applied Math and Computer Science Laboratory at Universidad del Norte (AML-CS).",,Sensors,,,,2020-02-06,2020,2020-02-06,,20,3,877,All OA; Gold,Article,"Nino-Ruiz, Elias David; Mancilla-Herrera, Alfonso; Lopez-Restrepo, Santiago; Quintero-Montoya, Olga","Nino-Ruiz, Elias David (Applied Math and Computer Science Laboratory, Department of Computer Science, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla 080001, Colombia;, amancill@uninorte.edu.co); Mancilla-Herrera, Alfonso (Applied Math and Computer Science Laboratory, Department of Computer Science, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla 080001, Colombia;, amancill@uninorte.edu.co); Lopez-Restrepo, Santiago (Mathematical Modelling Research Group, Department of Mathematical Sciences, Universidad EAFIT, Medellín 050001, Colombia;, slopezr2@eafit.edu.co, (S.L.-R.);, oquinte1@eafit.edu.co, (O.Q.-M.); Delft Institute of Applied Mathematics, Delft University of Technology, 2625 Delft, The Netherlands); Quintero-Montoya, Olga (Mathematical Modelling Research Group, Department of Mathematical Sciences, Universidad EAFIT, Medellín 050001, Colombia;, slopezr2@eafit.edu.co, (S.L.-R.);, oquinte1@eafit.edu.co, (O.Q.-M.))","Nino-Ruiz, Elias David (Universidad del Norte)","Nino-Ruiz, Elias David (Universidad del Norte); Mancilla-Herrera, Alfonso (Universidad del Norte); Lopez-Restrepo, Santiago (EAFIT University; Delft University of Technology); Quintero-Montoya, Olga (EAFIT University)",4,0,,1.03,https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/20/3/877/pdf?version=1581493640,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1124753647,"40 Engineering; 4008 Electrical Engineering; 4009 Electronics, Sensors and Digital Hardware; 46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4606 Distributed Computing and Systems Software",

Thus, this study aimed to explore the association between the social environment of the neighborhood and disability in older adults. A cohort study was assembled using waves 1 and 2 from the Study of Global Ageing and Adults Health (SAGE) in Mexico, which included adults with 55+ years old. Neighborhood characteristics - such as social participation, trust and safety - and individual covariates were measured only in wave 1 (baseline), while disability was measured in both waves to adjust for the score of wave 1. Multilevel negative binomial models with random intercepts at the municipality level were constructed for the disability score in wave 2, using each of the social environment variables as the main exposure and adjusting for the sociodemographic and health-related variables. Finally, interaction terms with sex, age, and socioeconomic quintiles were tested. Results showed that neighborhoods with a medium (IRR: 0.68; 95%CI: 0.53-0.87) or high (IRR: 0.67; 95%CI: 0.52-0.86) safety level were associated with a significant reduction in the disability score of adults older than 75 years, although there was no association between other characteristics of the social environment and disability in the general sample. Consequently, actions to improve safety in the neighborhoods should be carried out to help reduce the disability score in vulnerable older adults, especially in a context where safety is a critical issue, as in Mexico.",,,Cadernos de Saúde Pública,,,Aged; Brazil; Cohort Studies; Humans; Mexico; Middle Aged; Residence Characteristics; Social Environment,2020,2020,2020,,36,11,e00206919,All OA; Gold,Article,"Bonilla-Tinoco, Laura Juliana; Fernández-Niño, Julián Alfredo; Duncan, Dustin T","Bonilla-Tinoco, Laura Juliana (Universidad Industrial de Santander, Bucaramanga, Colombia.); Fernández-Niño, Julián Alfredo (Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia.); Duncan, Dustin T (Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health, New York, U.S.A.)",,"Bonilla-Tinoco, Laura Juliana (Industrial University of Santander); Fernández-Niño, Julián Alfredo (Universidad del Norte); Duncan, Dustin T (Columbia University)",0,0,,0.0,http://www.scielo.br/pdf/csp/v36n11/1678-4464-csp-36-11-e00206919.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1132875707,42 Health Sciences; 4202 Epidemiology; 4206 Public Health,4 Quality Education

METHODS: Prevalence study with exploratory analysis. The study included patients with endometrial cancer who underwent total abdominal hysterectomy plus bilateral salpyingooophorectomy and pelvic lymphadenectomy with or without para-aortic lymphadenectomy in seven oncology centers in Colombia between 2009 and 2016. Patients who had received prior radiotherapy or chemotherapy, with a histological diagnosis of neuroendocrine tumors, carcinosarcomas or synchronous or metachronous lesions were excluded. Non-probabilistic sampling. Sample size n=290. Measured variables: sociodemographic, clinical and histopathological, and pelvic or para-aortic lymph node involvement. The prevalence for the period is presented. The exploratory analysis was conducted using crude odds ratio (OR) and adjusted OR by means of a multivariate model (unconditional logistic regression).
RESULTS: Overall, 467 cases were retrieved. Of them, 163 were excluded because of non-availability of all the variables. In total, 304 patients were studied. The prevalence of lymph node involvement was 15.8 % (48/304). In the crude and adjusted analysis, factors associated with lymph node involvement were lymphovascular invasion (adjusted OR: 9.32; 95 % CI 4.27-21.15) and myometrial invasion (adjusted OR: 3.95; 95 % CI 1.29-14.98).

At the University of Rwanda, anatomy is being taught using team-based learning (TBL). While student-generated multiple choice questions (MCQs) stimulate deeper thinking on a given topic, their impact on anatomy learning is not known. This study aimed to find out the impact of student-generated MCQs on the current anatomy teaching method at the University of Rwanda.
METHODS: In this comparative interventional study, two similar chapters on anatomy were selected; one was taught using TBL while for the other one, in addition to TBL, students were encouraged to set MCQs while studying. Pre- and post-test scores were analyzed using SPSS 23 and the Student's t-test was used to compare the mean scores obtained.
RESULTS: Thirty-one medical students were recruited. Pre-test mean scores were 25.10 and 25.19 out of 50 for chapters 1 and 2, respectively. Although the students' post-test scores improved after teaching for each chapter, the improvement was much greater for chapter 2 than for chapter 1, with mean scores of 39.97 and 32.45 out of 50, respectively (P<0.05). Despite such improvement, almost half of the students found that setting MCQs was not easy.

METHODS: We conducted a comprehensive qualitative study with a hermeneutical strategy, which gathered information using well-researched questions that were posed to focus groups consisting of 32 participants. These participants were asked for opinions related to multimedia elements to display educational messages about physical activity and healthy eating in a mobile application. There were three analysis categories of multimedia elements: text, visual elements, and audio elements.
RESULTS: The majority of the participants, 93.75%, were in the low socioeconomic stratum; 68.75% are in a civil union with their partner; 53.12% completed or failed to complete secondary school, and 68.75% were housewives. Based on the qualitative results, we found that mobile applications become mediating tools that support the adoption of actions that tend to improve lifestyles and increase knowledge about proper nutrition and physical activity. Text messages used in mobile applications should promote healthy habits and remind users of their benefits. Images and videos should be accompanied by text and audio to provide greater clarity regarding recommendations of healthy habits.
CONCLUSIONS: Technology must provide accessibility and coverage opportunities, while meeting the needs and expectations of users. It should facilitate primary health intervention through education to transform unhealthy behaviors and generate lifestyles that improve the health of the user and their family context.","The authors thank all the women who are part of the New Life Generation Program; the field work team of Fundación Vida Nueva, for their contribution regarding the collection of information.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: An exploratory study was conducted as part of the VERISAÚDE project, a cross-sectional population-based study of individuals aged ≥65 years enrolled in senior community centers located in Galicia, Northwest of Spain (n = 749). A comprehensive gerontological evaluation was used to assess the social, medical, psychological, and functional characteristics of the sample.
RESULTS: Women presented a higher prevalence of frailty (p = 0.017), a higher risk of malnutrition (p = 0.029), more medication consumption (p = 0.002), and polypharmacy (p = 0.008), higher depressive scores (p = 0.007), and lower cognitive scores (p = 0.045) than men, who showed a higher prevalence of hearing impairment (p = 0.034), toxic habits (all ps = 0.0001), and comorbidity (p = 0.002), and better quality of life (p = 0.030), and social resources (p = 0.002). Participants considered that attending and being involved in senior centers has a positive influence on their health and promotes successful aging.
DISCUSSION: Important differences were found between women and men in health variables, suggesting that sex exerts a powerful influence on health status in older age. These differences should be identified and taking into account when designing interventions to promote active aging and to improve the quality of life of older adults. Taking a sex perspective during the evaluation process could lead to a higher number of older people being effectively treated in clinical practice.",The authors sincerely thank the staff and older users of the 43 senior community centers who contributed to this study.,"Funding.

In this paper, we propose a Bayesian hierarchical model that simultaneously allows for risk estimation and cluster identification. Our model formulation assumes that there is an unknown number of risk classes and small areas are assigned to a risk class by means of independent allocation variables. Therefore, areas within each cluster are assumed to share a common risk but they may be geographically separated. The posterior distribution of the parameter representing the number of risk classes is estimated using a novel procedure that combines its prior distribution with an efficient estimate of the marginal likelihood of the data given this parameter. An extension of the model incorporating covariates is also shown. These covariates may incorporate additional information on the problem or they may account for spatial correlation in the data. We illustrate the performance of the proposed model through both a simulation study and a case study of reported cases of varicella in the city of Valencia, Spain.","This work has been supported by Grant Number MTM2017-83850-P from the Spanish Ministry of Economy, Industry, and Competitiveness.

Here we describe a new elasmobranch assemblage from the rich fossil site of Montañita-Olón (Dos Bocas Formation, Santa Elena, Ecuador), where other vertebrates have already been described: for example, sea turtles and cetaceans. We report a total of 27 elasmobranch taxa, 19 of which are new fossil records for Ecuador, 10 new records for the Central Eastern Pacific and four new records for South America. Additionally, in order to reconstruct the environment where these marine remains were deposited, we performed abundance, paleobathymetric and habitat preference analyses, concluding that they were likely deposited in an outer neritic (open shelf) environment. The study of Oligocene and early Miocene marine elasmobranchs faunas in Tropical America is key to addressing the issues in the evolutionary history of this group.","This study was supported by the project from the Universidad Estatal Península de Santa Elena, (Instituto de investigación Científica y Desarrollo Tecnológico) code 91870000.0000.381019.

Un estudio de caso sobre persuasión, distorsión y emoción en las noticias","This article describes how a deceptive event framed in the “interview” journalistic genre makes up a deceptive narrative that, even after being rectified, will continue to affect the audiences summoned emotionally and ideologically. It is a case study developed through a content analysis to explain how a fake news appears in a newscast of private television in Colombia, through the introduction of false phrases that, combined with the framing, emotional narratives and the distortions, sharpen the political polarization and reveal how are these emotions inserted in the news narrative. The results show us that the biases of distortion, not necessarily partisan, and the emotions aligned with the ideological principles together with the gains of the market, are the breeding ground for the gestation of false news. The objective of this paper is to show how traditional media, such as television and its strategies of narrative persuasion, provide their audiences, (fake) materials for the (skewed) construction of (fake) news, while exciting the public, which generates political and economic benefits for the news médium the economic group that it is part of, and the presidential candidate supported by the group.

IoT networks have evolved around the wireless sensor network (WSN), and the following research looks at relevant IoT concepts and the different security issues that occur specifically at the network layer. This analysis is performed using a structured literature review (SLR). This form of bibliographic review has been a trend in recent years. Its strength is the performance of a bibliometric analysis that allows studying both trends in the line of research that you want to address and the relevant authors. This SLR reviews 53 proposals between 2011 and 2020, whose contribution is to mitigate attacks in the RPL (Routing Protocol for Low-Power and Lossy Networks) protocol. The revised proposals emerged after selecting keywords and databases in which to apply the search. Initially, approximately 380 research works appeared, for which it was necessary to continue using filters to refine the proposals to be included. After reading titles and abstracts, 53 papers were finally selected. In addition to analyzing the attacks mitigated in the RPL protocol, it is intended to identify the trend by which these attacks are reduced, as a result of the review, nine attacks have been found: rank, blackhole, selective forwarding, wormhole, DODAG (Destination-Oriented Directed Acyclic Graph) version number, DAO (Destination Advertisement Object) inconsistency, DIO (DODAG Information Object) suppression, Sybil, and sinkhole. Each of the 53 proposals analyzed in this review has an associated mitigation strategy, these strategies have been categorized into four groups, based on authentication or cryptography, based on network monitoring, based on secure parent node selection and other. According to the results, the authors’ primary mitigation strategy is based on network monitoring, with 30%.

This paper makes a comparison between the networks of Higher Education Institutions accredited as high quality and those not accredited, according to the indicators of the National Accreditation System in Colombia. The analysis of the institutional collaboration is carried out by constructing joint work networks, using the UCINET software. The first institution registered in the “top of collaboration”, published in the ResearchGate profile of each Higher Education Institution, is taken in account. The results shows that accredited institutions have a well-connected and integrated collaboration network. On the other hand, the non-accredited institutions have a weak and poorly integrated collaboration network. In addition, non-accredited universities seek to collaborate mostly with accredited institutions and not between them. In this way, the efforts of non-accredited institutions are not well coordinated and become diluted in the distribution of their relationships.",,,Revista española de Documentación Científica,,,,2020-06-11,2020,2020-06-11,,43,2,e265-e265,All OA; Gold,Article,"Pertuz, Vanessa; Pérez, Adith; Vega, Adriana; Aguilar-Ávila, Jorge","Pertuz, Vanessa (Universidad de Santander, Facultad de Ingenierías, Grupo de Investigación Nuevas Tecnologías UDES); Pérez, Adith (Universidad de Santander, Facultad de Ingenierías, Grupo de Investigación Nuevas Tecnologías UDES); Vega, Adriana (Universidad de Santander, Facultad de Ingenierías, Grupo de Investigación Nuevas Tecnologías UDES); Aguilar-Ávila, Jorge (Centro de Investigaciones Económicas, Sociales y Tecnológicas de la Agroindustria y la Agricultura Mundial (CIESTAAM), Universidad Autónoma Chapingo)",,"Pertuz, Vanessa (Universidad de Santander, Facultad de Ingenierías, Grupo de Investigación Nuevas Tecnologías UDES); Pérez, Adith (Universidad de Santander, Facultad de Ingenierías, Grupo de Investigación Nuevas Tecnologías UDES); Vega, Adriana (Universidad de Santander, Facultad de Ingenierías, Grupo de Investigación Nuevas Tecnologías UDES); Aguilar-Ávila, Jorge (Chapingo Autonomous University)",6,1,,4.0,https://redc.revistas.csic.es/index.php/redc/article/download/1200/1906,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1128440876,"39 Education; 3902 Education Policy, Sociology and Philosophy; 3903 Education Systems; 46 Information and Computing Sciences",

So far, this process has been explained in terms of its location, national and international market networks, migratory flow, and its connection with productive centers. However, the fact that this growth led to a significant urban demand for sustainable regulated food markets that were profitable has been paid little attention. This article exposes the main motivations that gave rise to Barranquilla's Public Market project, a milestone in the formalization of wholesale market. In order to do so, the conditions surrounding its creation were analyzed along with the impact that subsequent government management cycles had on its consolidation. In fact, these cycles were differentiated by two types of administration: private and public. In this way, it could be concluded that the public-private administration had a crucial role in establishing the public market as one of the most valuable assets of the city due to its structural characteristics, service, organization and profitability.",,,HiSTOReLo Revista de Historia Regional y Local,,,,2020-01-01,2020,2020-01-01,,12,23,14-50,All OA; Gold,Article,"López-García, Jessille; Gómez-Araujo, Eduardo; González-Arana, Roberto","López-García, Jessille (Universidad de Norte, Colombia); Gómez-Araujo, Eduardo (Universidad del Norte, Colombia); González-Arana, Roberto (Universidad del Norte, Colombia; Universidad de Norte, Colombia)",,"López-García, Jessille (Universidad del Norte); Gómez-Araujo, Eduardo (Universidad del Norte); González-Arana, Roberto (Universidad del Norte; Universidad del Norte)",0,0,,0.0,https://revistas.unal.edu.co/index.php/historelo/article/download/79471/pdf_1,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1124062790,44 Human Society; 4407 Policy and Administration,

The diagnosis of the pathology implies compliance with at least three of five risk factors. Doctors obtain two of those factors in a medical consultation: waist circumference and blood pressure. The other three factors are biochemical variables that require a blood test to determine triglyceride, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and fasting plasma glucose. Consequently, scientists are developing technology for non-invasive diagnostics, but medical personnel also need the risk factors involved in MetS to start a treatment. This paper describes the segmentation of MetS into ten types based on harmonized Metabolic Syndrome criteria. It proposes a framework to diagnose the types of MetS based on Artificial Neural Networks and Random undersampling Boosted tree using non-biochemical variables such as anthropometric and clinical information. The framework works over imbalanced and balanced datasets using the Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique and for validation uses random subsampling to get performance evaluation indicators between the classifiers. The results showed an excellent framework for diagnosing the 10 MetS types that have Area under Receiver Operating Characteristic (AROC) curves with a range of 71% to 93% compared with AROC 82.86% from traditional MetS.","The first author expresses his deep thanks to the Administrative Department of Science, Technology, and Innovation—COLCIENCIAS of Colombia for the Doctoral scholarship.

This phenomenon creates political polarization that degrades democracies in societies that exclude the opinion of those who does not think as the collective body, which takes place, especially in social networks. The method employed in this research is the hermeneutic one, given that it allows the analysis of some specific facts —that were recognized indifferently— to locate the post-truth concept in a political context that is conjunctural in several geographical spaces of the world. These spaces will be interpreted in the light of postmodern philosophy and critical reflection. One of the most important reflections that arise from this research is that the objectivity pretended by the traditional epistemology has rapidly weakened in front of the fact that the belief systems have demanded citizenship. These systems summarize certainties in the collective imaginary, in the realm and knowledge of reality, of facts, of feelings, and intentions of people independently of the fact that judgements correspond or not things themselves. Thus, this allows us to see  hat these belief systems divert human beings, the common citizen, from objective reality, which also deviates  hem from truly critical thinking.",,,Anagramas Rumbos y Sentidos de la Comunicación,,,,2020-09-30,2020,2020-09-30,,19,37,111-126,All OA; Gold,Article,"Morales Romero, Frank Brady; Martínez Martínez, Renato Rafael","Morales Romero, Frank Brady (Universidad del Atlántico); Martínez Martínez, Renato Rafael (Universidad del Norte)",,"Morales Romero, Frank Brady (Universidad del Atlántico); Martínez Martínez, Renato Rafael (Universidad del Norte)",1,1,,0.7,https://revistas.udem.edu.co/index.php/anagramas/article/download/2910/3115,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1132320916,44 Human Society; 4408 Political Science,
2430,pub.1130017629,10.15359/rnh.8-1.4,,,El constructivismo sociocultural lingüístico como teoría pedagógica de soporte para los Estudios Generales,"This article aims to highlight and analyze some characteristics of constructivism and General Studies to build conceptual bridges and methodological encounters between them. It also aims to generate reflection that allows identifying, specifically, the benefits of linguistic, sociocultural constructivism as an appropriate theoretical foundation for General Studies epistemology, whose purpose is to develop ethical citizens, with critical thinking, and sense of the common good, among other characteristics. A horizontal relationship that General Studies proposed and a student-teacher bond, which allows recognizing oneself and others as persons, cannot be founded upon any pedagogical theory. Therefore, it is possible to create bonds with this form of constructivism, in which the process of teaching and learning implies joint activities between students and teachers and occurs around contents and teaching actions through the structuring of those activities and the semiotic resources present in the speech of people involved. Finally, a parallel can be established between linguistic, sociocultural constructivism and General Studies, as long as a position is adopted for the conception of learning to be superseded from disciplines independently, prioritizing, at the same time, the means with which knowledge is built, i.e., language, in addition to other similarities that lead to considering that position to be worthy of being taken into account as a founding theory for teaching practice in General Studies.
El presente artículo tiene como objetivo, señalar y analizar algunas características del constructivismo y de los Estudios Generales con intención de establecer puentes conceptuales y de encuentro metodológico entre ambos, así como generar la reflexión que permita identificar, específicamente, las bondades del constructivismo sociocultural lingüístico como un soporte teórico adecuado a la epistemología de los Estudios Generales, cuyo propósito se orienta al desarrollo de ciudadanos éticos, con pensamiento crítico y sentido del bien común, entre otras características. La relación de horizontalidad, que proponen los Estudios Generales, y el vínculo docente-estudiante, donde me reconozco y reconozco al otro como persona, no pueden estar sostenidos por cualquier teoría pedagógica. Por tal razón, es posible empezar a establecer lazos con esta modalidad de constructivismo, en la cual el proceso de enseñanza y aprendizaje implica actividad conjunta entre estudiantes y docentes, y acontece alrededor de contenidos y acciones de enseñanza a través de la estructuración de esa actividad y de los recursos semióticos presentes en el habla de los involucrados. Por último, se puede establecer un paralelismo entre el constructivismo sociocultural lingüístico y los Estudios Generales, en tanto se asuma una postura que supere la concepción de aprendizaje desde las disciplinas de manera independiente, a la vez que se priorice el vehículo con el que se construye conocimiento que es el lenguaje, además de otras similitudes que llevan a considerarla digna de ser tomada en cuenta como una teoría de soporte para la práctica docente en Estudios Generales.",,,Revista Nuevo Humanismo,,,,2020-06-24,2020,2020-06-24,,8,1,,All OA; Gold,Article,"Córdoba, María Elena","Córdoba, María Elena (Instituto Tecnológico de Santo Domingo)",,"Córdoba, María Elena (Instituto Tecnológico de Santo Domingo)",7,6,,,https://www.revistas.una.ac.cr/index.php/nuevohumanismo/article/download/13904/19522,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1130017629,,

The research questions were: (a) what are the aspects of the institutional tutoring program that impact on the academic performance of the students? (B) What is the satisfaction stage from the tutored about the tutoring institutional program attended? and (c) what effect does the institutional mentoring program have on the academic performance of administration students during their scholar journey? The methodology used in this study was based on the quantitative approach, non-experimental with a transactional design. 63 eight semester students participated, and they attended the tutoring program. The Pearson correlation test was used for the aspects included in the tutoring program and the academic performance of the students. The results indicate that there is no significant relation between the aspects that the tutorial program covers and the academic performance, however, is a high rate student satisfaction with the tutoring program. In the results of Pearson´s correlation test between the aspects of the program and the general average, no significant relation was found in the aspects covered by the program. As a conclusion, the institutional tutoring program does not have a statistically significant relation in the students' academic performance, in contrast to student satisfaction, which was favorable to the tutoring program.

The ER data used in the study were excerpted from the Texas flexible pavements and overlays database, namely, the Texas Data Storage System (DSS), covering plant‐mix extracted PG XX‐22 asphalt‐binders (i.e., rolling thin film oven (RTFO) residues) from 20 different sources and measured using the Ductilometer test at 10°C. The findings of the study indicated that material source has an impact on the ER property of asphalt‐binders. Statistically significant differences were observed among some sources and suppliers that reported the same low‐temperature asphalt‐binder type/grade (i.e., PG XX‐22). Overall, the study contributes to enriching the literature on the material‐source effects on asphalt‐binders’ ER properties, consistency, variability, and data quality. In particular, the study highlights the sensitivity nature of the asphalt‐binder ER parameter to material‐source effects.",Conflicts of Interest The authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest.

Se analizan los programas de pregrado a través de su localización, la naturaleza de la institución, denominaciones, justificaciones, núcleo básico de conocimiento y la acreditación de alta calidad. Como resultado, se obtiene que, desde finales de la década de los noventas, la oferta de programas de relaciones internacionales ha aumentado considerablemente y esto ha permitido la institucionalización de la disciplina, lo que se ha materializado en decisiones oficiales y el fortalecimiento de una comunidad epistémica. Asimismo, identificamos una notable centralización de la formación en relaciones internacionales en la capital del país, así como una concentración de su oferta en universidades privadas y muy pocos programas con acreditación de alta calidad. Si bien este panorama refleja un fortalecimiento disciplinar, también persiste una notable heterogeneidad con respecto a las concepciones que las universidades tienen sobre las relaciones internacionales alrededor de su lugar en las ciencias sociales (como parte de la ciencia política, como disciplina autónoma o como un proyecto multidisciplinar).",,,OASIS,,,,2020-10-23,2020,2020-10-23,,,33,95-123,All OA; Gold,Article,"Guerra Molina, René Alonso; Virviescas Peña, John Anderson; Badilllo Sarmiento, Reynell","Guerra Molina, René Alonso (); Virviescas Peña, John Anderson (); Badilllo Sarmiento, Reynell ()",,"Guerra Molina, René Alonso (); Virviescas Peña, John Anderson (); Badilllo Sarmiento, Reynell ()",0,0,,,https://uexternado3.metarevistas.org/index.php/oasis/article/download/6865/9330,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1132026582,,

La preocupación por el peso y la imagen corporal surge tanto en hombres como en mujeres; no obstante, diversos estudios han demostrado mayor inquietud sobre la percepción corporal en mujeres. La preocupación extrema por la imagen corporal puede conllevar —en la mayoría de los casos— a trastornos alimentarios, acciones extremas para estar delgadas, miedo al rechazo y a las comparaciones, sintiéndose además imposibilitadas para ser amadas. OBJETIVO. Caracterizar la percepción de la imagen corporal de mujeres del programa Licenciatura en Educación Especial de la Universidad del Atlántico en el semestre 2019-2, Barranquilla, Colombia. METODOLOGÍA. Estudio descriptivo-transversal, llevado a cabo con 150 mujeres de la Universidad del Atlántico, aplicando el Body Shape Questionnaire (BSQ), con el fin de conocer su percepción de imagen corporal, teniendo en cuenta dos criterios: la insatisfacción corporal y la preocupación por el peso. RESULTADOS Y CONCLUSIONES. Se evidencia una tendencia de las mujeres hacia la preocupación extrema por la imagen corporal (64,7%), lo que indica insatisfacción corporal y preocupación por el peso en las universitarias estudiadas. Esto representa un factor de riesgo para el padecimiento de trastornos emocionales como depresión, ansiedad y conducta asocial; no obstante, estos resultados representan un punto de partida para la creación de campañas de sensibilización y el fomento de estilos de vida saludables, disuadiendo acciones desesperadas que puedan atentar contra su salud física y mental.",,,MUSAS Revista de Investigación en Mujer Salud y Sociedad,,,,2020-07-28,2020,2020-07-28,,5,2,77-92,All OA; Gold,Article,"Nieto-Ortiz, Dolores; Nieto-Mendoza, Isaac","Nieto-Ortiz, Dolores (Universidad del Atlántico); Nieto-Mendoza, Isaac (Universidad del Atlántico)",,"Nieto-Ortiz, Dolores (Universidad del Atlántico); Nieto-Mendoza, Isaac (Universidad del Atlántico)",1,1,,,https://revistes.ub.edu/index.php/MUSAS/article/download/vol5.num2.5/32196,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1131232786,,

Objetivo: Describir la utilización de métodos anticonceptivos de gestantes migrantes venezolanas, en dos ciudades de la costa norte de Colombia (Barranquilla y Riohacha), entre 2018 y 2019. Método: Se diseñó un estudio descriptivo de corte transversal. Las participantes se seleccionaron mediante muestreo sistemático en hospitales y muestreo en bola de nieve en la comunidad. Un cuestionario estandarizado permitió la recolección de variables sociodemográficas, de migración, de uso de anticonceptivos, entre otras. Resultados: Fueron encuestadas 552 mujeres gestantes provenientes de Venezuela, principalmente jóvenes, casadas o en unión libre; la minoría de los embarazos fueron planificados (37,7 %), aun cuando las mujeres conocían sobre métodos de anticoncepción. El preservativo (condón) y la píldora fueron los métodos más conocidos (94,7 y 96,1 %, respectivamente). Conclusión: Casi todas las mujeres conocen métodos anticonceptivos y los lugares dónde obtenerlos; no obstante, solo la mitad logró conseguirlos la última vez que los buscó; así, la mayoría de los embarazos fueron no planificados.

In this work, a framework is presented to evaluate the effects of geoprivacy mechanisms on the quality of geodata to provide insights into how the data is affected for geospatial analysis. For this purpose, a toolkit of indices was developed to evaluate different characteristics of the data before and after a geoprivacy mechanism is implemented, providing a criterion to select one of them. The indices measure the changes in the presence of clusters through the quantification of hotspots in hotspot analysis and the difference observed in heatmaps of the concentration of the geodata. Variations in global indices like the Nearest Neighbor Index (NNI) and the orientation of the standard deviational ellipse are also measured. For demonstration, the data of crime arrests in New York was used for the month of January in 2017 and 2018.

Firstly, it served to build and strengthen a particular identity of the city as a leader and epicenter of development in the Caribbean region. Secondly, it was strongly influenced by the role of an ""entrepreneur"" of that external action and, finally, it also responded to the influence of ""experts"" with the capacity to encourage individuals with the potential to be entrepreneurs of subnational foreign action.

Introduction The educational hospital climate provides meaningful learning, and is dependent on the perception of its staff. Burnout syndrome appears in professionals who work directly with other people, and both can have a significant influence on the training and performance of future physicians. Objective To evaluate the correlation between the educational environment of hospitals and the Burnout syndrome in the Foundation of doctors in the Lambayeque region of Peru during 2018. Material and methods A descriptive, cross-sectional and observational study was conducted on a sample that consisted of all foundation year doctors from the Lambayeque region during 2018. The Postgraduate Hospital Educational Environment Measurement (PHEEM) questionnaire was used to measure the educational climate, the Maslach Burnout Inventory-Human Services Survey to measure burnout syndrome, as well as a socio-demographic-occupational questionnaire. Results It was found that 28% of the foundation year doctors had burnout syndrome. A more positive than negative educational climate was observed in 5 hospitals in the Lambayeque region (PHEEM=80-120), and only in a reference hospital of the Ministry of Health there was an educational climate with many problems (PHEEM=40-80). There was a statistically significant correlation (p=0.019), and an inverse and low correlation (r=−0.19) between hospital educational climate and burnout syndrome in foundation year doctors in the Lambayeque region. In addition, a significant correlation was found between the sociodemographic occupational factors and burnout syndrome, inverse and low with hours of sleep (r=−0.22 and p=0.009), and direct and low with hours of work (r=0.28 and p=.001).

A 550 TR centrifugal chiller plant facility was available to collect data from July and September 2018. The authors propose rearranging variables of the traditional (GNU) model based on average electric consumption and through a thermodynamic analysis comparable to the original model. Furthermore, assumptions are validated. Then, by estimation of the parameters of the new model using least square fitting with field training data and comparing to the GNU model and Braun model (based on consumption), it was shown that the proposed model provides a better prediction in order to evaluate consumption of a centrifugal chiller in regular operation, by improving the coefficient of variation (CV), CV = 3.24% and R2 = 92.52% for a filtered sub-data. Through an algorithm built from steady-state cycle analysis, physical parameters (Sgen, Qleak,eq, R) were estimated to compare with the same parameters obtained by regression to check the influence of the interception term in the model. It was found that without an interception term, the estimated parameters achieve relative errors (ER) below 20%. Additional comparison between external and internal power prediction is shown, with CV = 3.57 % and mean relative error (MRE) of 2.7%, achieving better accuracy than GNU and Braun model.","The authors would like to thank Universidad del Norte and Colciencias through Convocatoria Doctorados Nacionales 727 of Fondo Nacional de Financiamiento para la Ciencia, la Tecnología e Innovación FCTeI, by Sistema General de Regalías SGR for supporting this research.","This research was funded by Colciencias through Convocatoria Doctorados Nacionales 727 of Fondo Nacional de Financiamiento para la Ciencia, la Tecnología e Innovación FCTeI, by Sistema General de Regalías SGR and Universidad del Norte.",Energies,,,,2020-04-28,2020,2020-04-28,,13,9,2135,All OA; Gold,Article,"Foliaco, Blanca; Bula, Antonio; Coombes, Peter","Foliaco, Blanca (Department of Mechanical Engineering, Universidad del Norte, Puerto Colombia 081001, Colombia;, abula@uninorte.edu.co); Bula, Antonio (Department of Mechanical Engineering, Universidad del Norte, Puerto Colombia 081001, Colombia;, abula@uninorte.edu.co); Coombes, Peter (School of Environment, Science and Engineering, Southern Cross University, Lismore NSW 2480, Australia;, peter.coombes@scu.edu.au)","Foliaco, Blanca (Universidad del Norte)","Foliaco, Blanca (Universidad del Norte); Bula, Antonio (Universidad del Norte); Coombes, Peter (Southern Cross University)",10,4,,2.74,https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/13/9/2135/pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1127273003,33 Built Environment and Design; 3302 Building; 40 Engineering,

Considerando también otras disciplina para estudiar el Manejo de residuos sólidos hospitalarios, el Cultivo de Arthrospira jenneri en fotobiorreactor multitubular para captura de CO2 de gases de combustión, el Efecto del extracto etanólico de las hojas de Piper aduncum y el Pastoreo de vacas estacadas y su efecto sobre el consumo y la condición del pasto. Estas investigaciones permiten comprender los grandes desafíos para la sociedad moderna. Incluso, son evidencia del compromiso de la Universidad César Vallejo (UCV) con la producción y divulgación del conocimiento científico; por lo cual UCV-SCIENTIA, se convierte en un espacio académico donde los científicos exponen los resultados de sus trabajos; constituyéndose en un importante medio, con reconocimiento internacional, para trasmitir conocimiento científico. En esta edición, se muestran una serie de investigaciones con alta pertinencia social aproximando al lector con las interrelaciones que se encuentran entre el conocimiento y sociedad, como base del progreso y la sostenibilidad. Se espera que el lector encuentre interesante pasar por la complejidad interconectada de los temas aquí abordados, pues no hay motivación mayor para un investigador, junior o novel, que pasearse por el mundo de las conjeturas y encontrar nuevas visiones y nuevas interrogantes. Por consiguiente, se hace imperativo promover entre la comunidad académica internacional un mayor diálogo entre éste saber científico y los problemas sociales, en pro de una sociedad con mayor bienestar y desarrollo humano. De modo que, espacios académicos como UCV-SCIENTIA brindan la oportunidad a las distintas disciplinas de intervenir como un proceso que propicia la transformación del mundo, volviéndose aún más borrosos los límites de la ciencia, para un complejo comprender de la realidad actual. Desde esta perspectiva, el conocimiento que se produce no está alejado de contexto social donde se detecta una necesidad, se genera una idea, se evalúa y valida un conocimiento científico. De esta forma, podemos observar en UCV-SCIENTIA la construcción de nuevas ideas científicas como resultado de la publicación de diversidad de temas, diversidad de investigadores y de instituciones.",,,UCV - SCIENTIA,,,,2020-02-11,2020,2020-02-11,,11,1,9-9,All OA; Gold,Article,"Moreno, Zahirá","Moreno, Zahirá (Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla – Colombia)",,"Moreno, Zahirá (Universidad del Norte)",0,0,,,http://revistas.ucv.edu.pe/index.php/UCV-SCIENTIA/article/download/2396/1970,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1125469759,,

Quantitative study with descriptive design. Child Symptom Checklist CBCL/6-18 adapted to Latinos was used to assess psychological adjustment. Social competencies and school activities scale showed that 79% of the participants were in clinical range and 21% in the normal range. Syndrome scale showed that 43% of evaluated are in clinical range, 36% in normal range and 21% in borderline. The psychological adjustment perception referred by participant’s caregivers evidences a low level in the social capacities due to the low participation and skills in diverse activities; without links with social character organizations, minimum social red and school performance out of the expected. Also, the majority of the sample reflects psychosomatic behavior problems, aggressiveness and anxiety, indicating a psychological maladjustment of internalized and externalized type.

In this paper, we present a new method for the construction of cyclic Grassmannian codes. To do that was designed and implemented a series of algorithms using the GAP System for Computational Discrete Algebra and Wolfram Mathematica software. We also present a classification of such codes in the space $\mathbb {P}_{q}(n)$ , with $n$ at most 9. The fundamental idea to construct and classify the cyclic Grassmannian codes is to endow the projective space $\mathbb {P}_{q}(n)$ with a graph structure and then find cliques.","This work was supported by the Universidad del Norte.

She was thinking of strategies to improve the weaknesses she had detected and was clear that she should maintain FLORA´s differentiating factors. The delivery of the floral arrangements to the final consumer represented an opportunity for improvement: This is the time when detailed control of the FLORA service experience could be lost due to protocol breaches. This could affect the positive positioning of the brand, lead to a bad reaction of consumers in the post-purchase experience, resulting in a negative impact on financial results.

Therein writers establish the theoretical tradition that supports their research and make an account of the theoretical and research developments in their discipline, specifically, in their topic of research, thus establishing a dialogue with other voices. This article examines how writers organize their theoretical framework by means of verbal clauses using the resources of the graduation subsystem proposed by the systemic functional linguistics to express force —which will help them to construct their authorial voice. This study analyzed the verbal clauses and the graduation resources of the theoretical frameworks in 20 research articles in Spanish language published in Colombian journals from the area of applied linguistics. Findings show the variety of resources deployed by writers in their verbal clauses to strengthen their commitment to their tenets, especially in prominent places of their theoretical framework, such as the macroTheme, hyperThemes, macroNew and hyperNew.

In particular, we investigate the flow of a glycerin–air mixture moving through a horizontal pipeline with a U-section installed midway along the pipe. Different combinations of liquid and air mass flow rates are experimentally tested. Then, we examine the moments of the statistical distributions obtained from the resulting pressure time series, in order to highlight the significant dynamical traits of the flow. Finally, we propose a novel correlation with two dimensionless parameters: the Euler number and a mass-flow-rate ratio to predict the pressure gradient in high-viscosity two-phase flow. Distinctive variations of the pressure gradients are observed in each section of the pipeline, which suggest that the local flow dynamics must not be disregarded in favor of global considerations.","The authors would like to acknowledge the support from Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México (UNAM), Universidad del Norte, Scholarship Contract Identification Number: UN-OJ-2017-38125 and Minciencias (Colciencias) through Convocatoria No. 727 de 2015.",This research received no external funding.,Journal of Marine Science and Engineering,,,,2020-12-08,2020,2020-12-08,,8,12,1000,All OA; Gold,Article,"Torres, Lizeth; Noguera, José; Guzmán-Vázquez, José Enrique; Hernández, Jonathan; Sanjuan, Marco; Palacio-Pérez, Arturo","Torres, Lizeth (Instituto de Ingeniería, Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México, Mexico City 04510, Mexico;, ftorreso@iingen.unam.mx, (L.T.);, JHernandezGa@iingen.unam.mx, (J.H.);, APalacioP@iingen.unam.mx, (A.P.-P.)); Noguera, José (Departamento de Mecánica, Facultad de Ingeniería, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla 081007, Colombia;, jfnoguera@uninorte.edu.co, (J.N.);, msanjuan@uninorte.edu.co, (M.S.)); Guzmán-Vázquez, José Enrique (Instituto de Ingeniería, Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México, Mexico City 04510, Mexico;, ftorreso@iingen.unam.mx, (L.T.);, JHernandezGa@iingen.unam.mx, (J.H.);, APalacioP@iingen.unam.mx, (A.P.-P.)); Hernández, Jonathan (Instituto de Ingeniería, Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México, Mexico City 04510, Mexico;, ftorreso@iingen.unam.mx, (L.T.);, JHernandezGa@iingen.unam.mx, (J.H.);, APalacioP@iingen.unam.mx, (A.P.-P.)); Sanjuan, Marco (Departamento de Mecánica, Facultad de Ingeniería, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla 081007, Colombia;, jfnoguera@uninorte.edu.co, (J.N.);, msanjuan@uninorte.edu.co, (M.S.)); Palacio-Pérez, Arturo (Instituto de Ingeniería, Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México, Mexico City 04510, Mexico;, ftorreso@iingen.unam.mx, (L.T.);, JHernandezGa@iingen.unam.mx, (J.H.);, APalacioP@iingen.unam.mx, (A.P.-P.))","Guzmán-Vázquez, José Enrique (National Autonomous University of Mexico; Instituto de Ingeniería, Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México, Mexico City 04510, Mexico;, ftorreso@iingen.unam.mx, (L.T.);, JHernandezGa@iingen.unam.mx, (J.H.);, APalacioP@iingen.unam.mx, (A.P.-P.))","Torres, Lizeth (National Autonomous University of Mexico; Instituto de Ingeniería, Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México, Mexico City 04510, Mexico;, ftorreso@iingen.unam.mx, (L.T.);, JHernandezGa@iingen.unam.mx, (J.H.);, APalacioP@iingen.unam.mx, (A.P.-P.)); Noguera, José (Universidad del Norte; Departamento de Mecánica, Facultad de Ingeniería, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla 081007, Colombia;, jfnoguera@uninorte.edu.co, (J.N.);, msanjuan@uninorte.edu.co, (M.S.)); Guzmán-Vázquez, José Enrique (National Autonomous University of Mexico; Instituto de Ingeniería, Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México, Mexico City 04510, Mexico;, ftorreso@iingen.unam.mx, (L.T.);, JHernandezGa@iingen.unam.mx, (J.H.);, APalacioP@iingen.unam.mx, (A.P.-P.)); Hernández, Jonathan (National Autonomous University of Mexico; Instituto de Ingeniería, Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México, Mexico City 04510, Mexico;, ftorreso@iingen.unam.mx, (L.T.);, JHernandezGa@iingen.unam.mx, (J.H.);, APalacioP@iingen.unam.mx, (A.P.-P.)); Sanjuan, Marco (Universidad del Norte; Departamento de Mecánica, Facultad de Ingeniería, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla 081007, Colombia;, jfnoguera@uninorte.edu.co, (J.N.);, msanjuan@uninorte.edu.co, (M.S.)); Palacio-Pérez, Arturo (National Autonomous University of Mexico; Instituto de Ingeniería, Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México, Mexico City 04510, Mexico;, ftorreso@iingen.unam.mx, (L.T.);, JHernandezGa@iingen.unam.mx, (J.H.);, APalacioP@iingen.unam.mx, (A.P.-P.))",4,2,,0.82,https://www.mdpi.com/2077-1312/8/12/1000/pdf?version=1607653616,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1133354126,40 Engineering; 4012 Fluid Mechanics and Thermal Engineering,

While the hot side employs a metal plate, the cold side is attached with a phase-change material acting as an effective passive dissipative material. The desired temperature gradient allows claiming power conversion efficiencies of about 26.43%, without efficiency reductions associated with heating and soiling. This work presents the characterization of a low-cost off-the-shelf thermoelectric generator that allows estimating the production of at least 407.3 mW corresponding to 2.44 Wh of available energy considering specific operation hours—determined statistically for a given geographic location. Then, the energy production is experimentally verified with the construction of an outdoor IoT sensor powered by a passively-cooled thermoelectric generator. The prototype contains a low-power microcontroller, environmental sensors, and a low-power radio to report selected environmental variables to a central node. This work shows that the proposed supply mechanism provides sufficient energy for continuous operation even during times with no solar resource through an on-board Li-Po battery. Such a battery can be recharged once the solar radiation is available without compromising sensor operation.",,"This research was funded by the National Fund for Financing Science, Technology and Innovation—Francisco José de Caldas Fund—of the Colombian government, through the call for registration of projects that aspire to obtain tax benefits for investment in science, technology and innovation (call 741 of 2016).",Energies,,,,2020-06-01,2020,2020-06-01,,13,11,2782,All OA; Gold,Article,"Charris, Daniela; Gomez, Diego; Ortega, Angie Rincon; Carmona, Mauricio; Pardo, Mauricio","Charris, Daniela (Robotics and Intelligent Systems Research Group from Universidad Del Norte, Barranquilla, Atlántico 8600, Colombia;, dgomez@uninorte.edu.co, (D.G.);, mpardo@uninorte.edu.co, (M.P.)); Gomez, Diego (Robotics and Intelligent Systems Research Group from Universidad Del Norte, Barranquilla, Atlántico 8600, Colombia;, dgomez@uninorte.edu.co, (D.G.);, mpardo@uninorte.edu.co, (M.P.)); Ortega, Angie Rincon (Rational Use of Energy and Environment Preservation Research Group from Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Atlántico 8600, Colombia;, anggier@uninorte.edu.co, (A.R.O.);, mycarmona@uninorte.edu.co, (M.C.)); Carmona, Mauricio (Rational Use of Energy and Environment Preservation Research Group from Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Atlántico 8600, Colombia;, anggier@uninorte.edu.co, (A.R.O.);, mycarmona@uninorte.edu.co, (M.C.)); Pardo, Mauricio (Robotics and Intelligent Systems Research Group from Universidad Del Norte, Barranquilla, Atlántico 8600, Colombia;, dgomez@uninorte.edu.co, (D.G.);, mpardo@uninorte.edu.co, (M.P.))","Charris, Daniela (Universidad del Norte; Robotics and Intelligent Systems Research Group from Universidad Del Norte, Barranquilla, Atlántico 8600, Colombia;, dgomez@uninorte.edu.co, (D.G.);, mpardo@uninorte.edu.co, (M.P.))","Charris, Daniela (Universidad del Norte; Robotics and Intelligent Systems Research Group from Universidad Del Norte, Barranquilla, Atlántico 8600, Colombia;, dgomez@uninorte.edu.co, (D.G.);, mpardo@uninorte.edu.co, (M.P.)); Gomez, Diego (Universidad del Norte; Robotics and Intelligent Systems Research Group from Universidad Del Norte, Barranquilla, Atlántico 8600, Colombia;, dgomez@uninorte.edu.co, (D.G.);, mpardo@uninorte.edu.co, (M.P.)); Ortega, Angie Rincon (Universidad del Norte; Rational Use of Energy and Environment Preservation Research Group from Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Atlántico 8600, Colombia;, anggier@uninorte.edu.co, (A.R.O.);, mycarmona@uninorte.edu.co, (M.C.)); Carmona, Mauricio (Universidad del Norte; Rational Use of Energy and Environment Preservation Research Group from Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Atlántico 8600, Colombia;, anggier@uninorte.edu.co, (A.R.O.);, mycarmona@uninorte.edu.co, (M.C.)); Pardo, Mauricio (Universidad del Norte; Robotics and Intelligent Systems Research Group from Universidad Del Norte, Barranquilla, Atlántico 8600, Colombia;, dgomez@uninorte.edu.co, (D.G.);, mpardo@uninorte.edu.co, (M.P.))",23,7,,,https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/13/11/2782/pdf?version=1591006594,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1128182848,40 Engineering,7 Affordable and Clean Energy

Firstly, the state of the coastal lagoon was assessed, finding that hydrology, wave climate, and the morphological changes of the coastline explain recent changes in the coastal wetlands. Key variables were used to describe the level of conservation or degradation of the coastal lagoon system and to identify measures to improve its ecological functions. Finally, to mimic some of these functions and improve connectivity of the ecosystems, green infrastructure alternatives were proposed for the short and medium term to recover the services of these ecosystems and restore their resilience.","The authors would like to acknowledge all the support given by Universidad del Norte, and Universidad Tecnológica de Bolívar through the scholarship program for Master degree and the management of the Research and Innovation office in both universities, National University of Mexico (UNAM), Exceed-Swindon Network, Red de Investigaciones en Ecohidrologia y Ecohidraulica (REDECOHH Network), and World Association for Waterborne Transport Infrastructure (PIANC) colombian chapter.

Method: for this, a descriptive study with a retrospective qualitative design was developed, whose population was constituted by the clients of five tourist agencies. As a technique for collecting information, documentary review was used and for data analysis, the MICMAC technique. Results and discussions: The results of the MICMAC technique suggest that e-loyalty is given by the perceived quality, honesty, organization, variety of sites offered and the efficiency of the agency to fulfill the services offered. This demonstrates the importance of generating strategies that involve the factors found to be key; however, the transportation factor that should also be placed among the keys and determinants, was located in the autonomous zone. Conclusions: Finally, customer loyalty represents a key element in the electronic marketplace, so marketing must invest extra effort in detailing their training and performance.

Method: A descriptive type of research was used, with a quantitative approach and a non-experimental field design, in which a closed survey was applied, directed at a sample of 53 companies. Results and discussion: Among the main findings, it was found that 56% of the participating SMEs do not take actions to reduce the volume or hazardousness of their waste, since they do not consider it important or profitable. Therefore, these processes are not eco efficient and the commitment to environmental preservation and sustainability of the SMEs under study is  insufficient. Conclusions: Given that the textile sector is one of the resources with the lowest rate of reuse in the world, it is fundamental that this link with the processes of sustainable management and eco efficiency be clear and constant, aiming at an internalization of the processes of social responsibility, relying on the State, families, people and laws for their constant evolution and development.",,,Desarrollo Gerencial,,,,2020-11-30,2020,2020-11-30,,12,2,1-20,All OA; Gold,Article,"Pitre-Redondo, Remedios; De la Ossa-Guerra, Santander; Hernández-Palma, Hugo","Pitre-Redondo, Remedios (Universidad de la Guajira, Riohacha, Colombia); De la Ossa-Guerra, Santander (Universidad de Sucre, Sincelejo, Colombia); Hernández-Palma, Hugo (Universidad del Atlántico, Barranquilla, Colombia)",,"Pitre-Redondo, Remedios (University of La Guajira); De la Ossa-Guerra, Santander (University of Sucre); Hernández-Palma, Hugo (University of Atlántico)",1,0,,0.4,https://revistas.unisimon.edu.co/index.php/desarrollogerencial/article/download/3870/5292,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1133056910,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3507 Strategy, Management and Organisational Behaviour; 41 Environmental Sciences",12 Responsible Consumption and Production

The methodology was tested for three locations: Colombia, Ecuador, and Spain. The data is input into the process in two ways: (1) As a single time series containing all measurements, and (2) as twenty-four separate parallel sequences, corresponding to the values of wind speed at each of the 24 h in the day over several months. The methodology relies on the use of three non-parametric techniques: Least-squares support vector machines, empirical mode decomposition, and the wavelet transform. Moreover, the traditional and simple auto-regressive model is applied. The combination of the aforementioned techniques results in nine methods for performing wind prediction. Experiments using a matlab implementation showed that the least-squares support vector machine using data as a single time series outperformed the other combinations, obtaining the least root mean square error (RMSE).","The authors thank Universidad del Norte for the support given through the Energy Strategic Area Program and for the availability of Renewable energy Laboratory, UniGrid.

This leads to the need to innovate in the control and management information systems of the systems responsible to treat these residual waters in search of improvement. This paper proposes the development of an intelligent system that uses the data from the process and makes a prediction of its behavior to provide support in decision making related to the operation of the wastewater treatment plant (WWTP). To carry out the development of this system, a multilayer perceptron neural network with 2 hidden layers and 22 neurons each is implemented, together with process variable analysis, time-series decomposition, correlation and autocorrelation techniques; it is possible to predict the chemical oxygen demand (COD) at the input of the bioreactor with a one-day window and a mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of 10.8%, which places this work between the adequate ranges proposed in the literature.","This work was supported by the Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia.","This research was supported by the Colombian Ministry of Science and Technology, MINCIENCIAS, Investment Tax Benefits, Call No. 786.",Sustainability,,,,2020-08-07,2020,2020-08-07,,12,16,6348,All OA; Gold,Article,"Arismendy, Luis; Cárdenas, Carlos; Gómez, Diego; Maturana, Aymer; Mejía, Ricardo; M., Christian G.

Methods: The proposed research met the criteria of a qualitative descriptive study with nine in-depth interviews in the three abovementioned social groups (three participants from each social group) that have an impact on teleworking. Discourse analysis by maps of association of ideas was employed as an information analysis technique. Results: The study results suggested that the meaning and value that the workers assign to organizing their work, social interactions, routines, and the use of objects and positioning is unknown to the policy makers. Moreover, the discourses of the government and the employer are similar, and therefore, a time of psychosocial narrative is consolidated; the second psychosocial time is developed by the discourse of the teleworker. Discussions: In the first psychosocial time, teleworking means an opportunity to help workers regarding their quality of life and productivity. In the second psychosocial time, teleworking means a different way of working in which individuals occupy a physical space as workers, but they are actually in a virtual space that allows to give work a meaning other than the traditional one. Conclusions: The study concluded that teleworking is perceived by the government as an opportunity to improve employability indicators and give access to people with special abilities to the market; for employers, it is a mechanism for increasing flexibility that would help them with cost reduction, and for workers, it involves freedom and work flexibility.",,,Desarrollo Gerencial,,,,2020-07-31,2020,2020-07-31,,12,2,1-25,All OA; Gold,Article,"Cifuentes-Leiton, Diana Milec","Cifuentes-Leiton, Diana Milec (Universidad del Valle, Cali, Colombia)",,"Cifuentes-Leiton, Diana Milec (University of Valle)",4,1,,2.04,https://revistas.unisimon.edu.co/index.php/desarrollogerencial/article/download/3913/5288,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1130305783,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3505 Human Resources and Industrial Relations",

He wondered if it was time to diversify his business, and if the conditions of the economy and the responsiveness of his company, which occupied the largest share of the market at that time, would not be affected. The opportunity to diversify was always present, but previous efforts did not go well. Entering new markets with different proposals still generated a certain internal suspicion that he did not express when he told the team that there was no doubt about the need to start operating the company infrastructure, in sectors adjacent to the business and institutional cleaning and maintenance service, that since 2013 had been considered and included in the 2016-2019 strategic plan. “It seems like a risky option, but Adriana and her team seem to have a clearer idea of how to bring our Know how to all the different homes and cover the B2C segment,” meditated Alonso. Although he was willing to listen to the new proposal of the team led by his daughter, between positivism, uncertainty and resistance to change, he wondered if the conditions were favorable for these innovations, and if it would be possible to successfully achieve a victory early to break the business schemes that had been taking place in Mayordomia for almost 30 years.

This scheme is a member of the family of asymmetric cryptographic primitives based on multivariable polynomials over a finite field K and has been submitted as candidate to the ongoing National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) standardisation process of post-quantum signature schemes. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that this scheme is evaluated in this setting. To perform our assessment of the scheme in this setting, we review two implementations of this scheme, the reference implementation and the libpqcrypto implementation, to learn the most common in-memory private key formats and next develop a key recovery algorithm exploiting the structure of this scheme. Since the LUOV’s key generation algorithm generates its private components and public components from a 256-bit seed, the key recovery algorithm works for all the parameter sets recommended for this scheme. Additionally, we tested the effectiveness and performance of the key recovery algorithm through simulations and found the key recovery algorithm may retrieve the private seed when α = 0.001 (probability that a 0 bit of the original secret key will flip to a 1 bit) and β (probability that a 1 bit of the original private key will flip to a 0 bit) in the range { 0.001 , 0.01 , 0.02 , … , 0.15 } by enumerating approximately 2 40 candidates.",,This research was funded by Universidad del Norte grant number 2019-029 and the APC was funded by Universidad del Norte.,Applied Sciences,,,,2020-06-15,2020,2020-06-15,,10,12,4106,All OA; Gold,Article,"Villanueva-Polanco, Ricardo","Villanueva-Polanco, Ricardo (Computer Science Department, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla 080001, Colombia)",,"Villanueva-Polanco, Ricardo (Universidad del Norte)",8,2,,2.32,https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3417/10/12/4106/pdf?version=1592209930,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1128516293,46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4604 Cybersecurity and Privacy,

The intervention was an educational strategy. Two groups of health science students were selected for convenience. Empathy levels were measured using the Jefferson Medical Empathy Scale for health professions students’ version and from the Climate Change Risk Perception Survey as a threat to human health two items were measured: risk perception index and knowledge about health effects because of climate change. Statistical differences were found between pre and post-test (p <0.05). In the pre-test both groups presented high levels of empathy with an average of 107. For the post-test, the experimental group presented a statistically significant increase in empathy levels. Finally, statistically significant correlations were observed between global empathy and empathy factors: compassionate care and perspective taking; and beware of compassion and knowledge about the health effects of climate change.

However, diesel engines are a significant source of pollutant emissions that contribute to poor air quality, negative human health impacts, and climate change. This experimental case study develops emission maps based on statistical models for a single-cylinder, four-stroke, air-cooled diesel engine as a function of torque and engine speed. The tested fuels were 100% diesel (B0), and blends with 5% (B5) and 10% (B10) biodiesel originating from African oil palm (Elaeis guineensis). The study explores the individual contributions of NO and NO2 to NOx and discusses the correlation between CO and O2 emission maps. The statistical models of CO, CO2, and O2 feature R2 adjusted values greater than 0.8, while the models of NO and NO2 show R2 adjusted values of around 0.6. The apparent discrepancies in CO emission trends among previous studies are explained. The emission maps developed here are a practical alternative to predictive models and can assist in engine calibration and aftertreatment optimization while saving time and costs.","The authors thank the UNIVERSIDAD DEL ATLÁNTICO, UNIVERSIDAD DEL NORTE, and SPHERE ENERGY company for their support on the development of this research by allowing the use of its facilities and the required instrumentation.

It is about determining what impact this has on Colombian professionals (especially during the current pandemic), what trends there are on the subject, and the theoretical contribution they address. First, the study framework is contextualized based on burnout syndrome and its incidence in various professions, then the methodology that guided the bibliographic review is exposed. Burnout syndrome has been (and still is) the subject of study in numerous investigations for more than three decades. This is how, through these, its incidence has been observed in a different way depending on the performance area of each profession. Hence the importance of knowing what the burnout syndrome consists of, symptoms and how the situations currently faced by professionals in the country because of the pandemic make us look back at it.",,,Interconectando Saberes,,,,2020-08-05,2020,2020-08-05,,,10,,All OA; Gold,Article,"De Arco Paternina, Lilian Karina; Hernández, José Andrés Castillo","De Arco Paternina, Lilian Karina (Universidad Americana de Europa (UNADE)); Hernández, José Andrés Castillo (Universidad Americana de Europa (UNADE))",,"De Arco Paternina, Lilian Karina (Universidad Americana de Europa (UNADE)); Hernández, José Andrés Castillo (Universidad Americana de Europa (UNADE))",4,0,,2.53,https://is.uv.mx/index.php/IS/article/download/2675/4570,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1131816453,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 48 Law and Legal Studies; 4802 Environmental and Resources Law,
1776,pub.1127233698,10.3390/su12093573,,,Intelligent System for Interactive Teaching through Videogames,"Education, videogames, and intelligent systems are all relevant topics for researchers. Determining means of improving academic performance using a range of techniques and tools is an important challenge. However, while there are currently websites and multimedia resources that help students to improve their knowledge on specific topics, these lack in not having intelligent agents that can evaluate students and recommend materials to suit the difficulty that a user is having in a given subject. In this sense, this paper aims at developing an intelligent system that allows interactive teaching in basic education using videogames. In particular, high school students’ skills in basic mathematical operations with fractions were used for testing experimentally the approach. An intelligent system was developed using computational techniques such as fuzzy logic and case-based reasoning to evaluate user performance and recommend additional study material according to the specific challenges from the given educational game. The use of the games was supported by ICT (information and communication technologies) tools on a web platform. Such a developed platform was tested by 206 high school students, who played 5400 games in total. The students showed an improvement of around 14% in the topics covered. The results indicate that the implementation jointly of videogames and intelligent systems allows users to improve their performance in the given topics.","This work was supported by Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla - Colombia.

Metodología: Esta revisión bibliográfica integrativa fue realizada a través de un estudio detallado, selectivo y crítico que sintetiza la información en una perspectiva unitaria y de conjunto; para mostrar resultados de investigaciones anteriores, y recoger las conclusiones de la literatura sobre las conductas del cuidador que afectan el proceso de crianza de los niños en etapas preescolar y escolar. Resultados: Las conductas más relevantes encontradas en la literatura, que afectan el proceso de crianza de los niños son: el lenguaje inapropiado que usan los cuidadores hacia ellos, la violencia, los malos tratos, la carencia de afecto y apoyo hacia ellos. Además de estas conductas hay un factor comportamental de rol por carencia de tiempo de los padres para compartir con los hijos, esta variable de la falta de tiempo para dedicar a sus hijos, ha generado cuidadores indirectos y cambios en la conducta de los niños por mala utilización del tiempo en ellos. Conclusiones: Esta revisión crítica de la literatura evidencio que conductas simples y cotidianas para algunas personas como el lenguaje inapropiado, la violencia, el tiempo o carencia de este, el poco afecto en el hogar afectan negativamente el proceso de crianza de los niños, y generan daños irremediables en los niños; modificando su estado de ánimo, su manera de ser, su estilo de vida, su salud y su comportamiento a largo plazo ya que serán adolescentes y adultos con dificultades sociales, e incapaces de enfrentar un mundo con adversidades diarias.

First, an explanation is given about the characteristics inherent to experience marketing and how it can generate a cascade of sensations, perceptions, and emotions normally sought in goods and services with hedonic consumption characteristics. Today the consumption of dental services has several commercial fronts. In the different specialties aesthetics is part of them, which is normally sought as pleasant consumption. Likewise, the stress variable, commonly studied in this service, generates animosity to the consultation and is associated with negative emotions. The study identifies one of the variables that contributes to stress in dentistry,such as the olfactory stimulus, and specifically its relationship with emotions. The research allows concluding, by means of a field research, that the olfative stimulus to eugenol has identifiable impacts on stress and is associated with negative emotions in patients who have had negative experiences in dentistry.

Prediction studies for energy demand require a high level of reliability since a deviation in the forecasting demand could affect operation costs. This paper proposed a short-term forecasting energy demand methodology based on hierarchical clustering using Dynamic Time Warp as a similarity measure integrated with Artificial Neural Networks. Clustering was used to build the typical curve for each type of day, while Artificial Neural Networks handled the weather sensibility to correct a preliminary forecasting curve obtained in the clustering stage. A statistical analysis was carried out to identify those significant factors in the prediction model of energy demand. The performance of this proposed model was measured through the Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE). The experimental results show that the three-stage methodology was able to improve the MAPE, reaching values as good as 2%.","This work was supported by Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla-Colombia.","This research was supported by the Colombian Ministry of Science and Technology, MINCIENCIAS.

Principalmente, se resaltan tres cosas. La primera es que la felicidad cartesiana consiste en un estado en que la mente se encuentra tanto contenta como satisfecha. Descartes no considera que la felicidad sea un bien, sino que es el placer que gozamos cuando alcanzamos el bien supremo. Por eso, la segunda cosa que vale la pena notar es que la felicidad, para Descartes, no ocupa el lugar del bien supremo. Finalmente, la tercera cosa que quiero señalar es que Descartes propone dos fines para nuestras acciones. Para examinar los cambios propuestos por esa reforma, prestaré especial atención a los tres puntos mencionados.

Estas últimas, hacen referencia al desarrollo de la Inteligencia emocional, la cual, según las investigaciones de la última década, tendría una relación con un mejor ajuste a las exigencias del medio universitario y/o laboral. El objetivo de esta investigación fue relacionar los niveles de inteligencia emocional con los niveles del Síndrome de Burnout y Engagement académico en estudiantes de enfermería de una Universidad del norte del país, por medio de un estudio cuantitativo, correlacional, no experimental, transversal. La muestra fue de 189 alumnos de enfermería, de ambos sexos, cursando entre el primer y octavo semestre de la malla académica, donde se realizó un muestreo probabilístico aleatorio. Los resultados evidenciaron correlación entre los factores de claridad y regulación emocional con ambos factores de Engagement (predisposición y satisfacción). Por otro lado, al correlacionar inteligencia emocional con Burnout académico, se evidenció, que el único factor que correlacionó con las 3 dimensiones de Burnout fue regulación emocional. Además, se demostró que a mayor claridad emocional menor sería el agotamiento y mayor la realización personal. Finalmente, se mostró que mayores niveles de Burnout correlacionaron con menores niveles de satisfacción con los estudios.",,,Revista Electrónica de Investigación en Docencia Universitaria,,,,2020-07-01,2020,2020-07-01,,2,1,53-83,All OA; Gold,Article,"Ardiles, Rodrigo; Alfaro, Paola; Moya, María; Leyton, Claudia; Rojas, Patrick; Videla, Jeremy","Ardiles, Rodrigo (); Alfaro, Paola (); Moya, María (); Leyton, Claudia (); Rojas, Patrick (); Videla, Jeremy ()",,"Ardiles, Rodrigo (); Alfaro, Paola (); Moya, María (); Leyton, Claudia (); Rojas, Patrick (); Videla, Jeremy ()",6,3,,,https://reidu.cl/index.php/REIDU/article/download/10/60,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1149297107,,

Acorde con esto, la presente investigación centró su atención en caracterizar la formación en TIC de profesores de matemáticas de instituciones educativas del Distrito de Barranquilla, y la influencia de las mismas en sus prácticas pedagógicas. Para esto se aplicaron técnicas como: encuestas, observaciones no participantes y grupos focales a 23 profesores, con la finalidad de recolectar información sobre el conocimiento de las TIC, la frecuencia de uso y el tipo de aplicación. Se encontró como principal hallazgo las limitantes en cuanto al conocimiento tecnológico de los profesores para la enseñanza de las matemáticas y la desarticulación de esta competencia con las prácticas pedagógicas. Se concluyó que los profesores cuentan con estas deficiencias, ya que en los programas de los cuales egresan no se profundiza ni se integra, con suficiencia, la tecnología en su futura práctica profesional.

1706,pub.1124692590,10.3390/atmos11020167,,,A Four Dimensional Variational Data Assimilation Framework for Wind Energy Potential Estimation,"In this paper, we propose a Four-Dimensional Variational (4D-Var) data assimilation framework for wind energy potential estimation. The framework is defined as follows: we choose a numerical model which can provide forecasts of wind speeds then, an ensemble of model realizations is employed to build control spaces at observation steps via a modified Cholesky decomposition. These control spaces are utilized to estimate initial analysis increments and to avoid the intrinsic use of adjoint models in the 4D-Var context. The initial analysis increments are mapped back onto the model domain from which we obtain an estimate of the initial analysis ensemble. This ensemble is propagated in time to approximate the optimal analysis trajectory. Wind components are post-processed to get wind speeds and to estimate wind energy capacities. A matrix-free analysis step is derived from avoiding the direct inversion of covariance matrices during assimilation cycles. Numerical simulations are employed to illustrate how our proposed framework can be employed in operational scenarios. A catalogue of twelve Wind Turbine Generators (WTGs) is utilized during the experiments. The results reveal that our proposed framework can properly estimate wind energy potential capacities for all wind turbines within reasonable accuracies (in terms of Root-Mean-Square-Error) and even more, these estimations are better than those of traditional 4D-Var ensemble-based methods. Moreover, large variability (variance of standard deviations) of errors are evidenced in forecasts of wind turbines with the largest rate-capacity while homogeneous variability can be seen in wind turbines with the lowest rate-capacity.",This work was supported by the Applied Math and Computer Science Laboratory at Universidad del Norte (AML-CS).,This research received no external funding.,Atmosphere,,,,2020-02-05,2020,2020-02-05,,11,2,167,All OA; Gold,Article,"Nino-Ruiz, Elias D.; Calabria-Sarmiento, Juan C.; Guzman-Reyes, Luis G.; Henao, Alvin","Nino-Ruiz, Elias D.

To achieve this objective, the methodology that was developed was based on the analysis of 102 surveys to delegates from 42 universities in 12 countries that have already participated in the negotiating models in the period of 2014-2018. The results suggest that the respondents consider that the main benefit from their participation in the models is the experience gained in the knowledge of the management of global affairs; at the same time, respondents consider that they gain skills by working under pressure; in the same way, they believe that the knowledge acquired as a result of their participation in these models is related to topics about cross-cultural negotiation.

1650,pub.1129653858,10.28945/4601,,,Trends in Using ICT Resources by Professors in HEIs (Higher Education Institutions),"Aim/Purpose: This study aimed at recognizing and analyzing the trends of ICT use (hardware, software, and digital educational resources) by higher education professors in the Antioquia region (Colombia), and characterizing this population according to their context. 

Background: The inexorable growth of ICT and the convergence of networks have produced great changes in human culture, and particularly in the educational environment. As a result, the development of appropriate technological competencies and the study of the trends of ICT use to meet this requirement become necessary. 

Methodology: The study follows a quantitative approach, with a non-experimental and correlational design. The sample consisted of 97 professors from different universities of the Antioquia region (Colombia), age between 21 and 60 years old, selected in a non-aleatory way, to fill in an online survey. 

Contribution: A contribution is the identification and characterizing of an active population in higher education and the trends in use of digital resources in the classroom from the professors’ perception that allows recognizing the pedagogical potential of these resources to enrich the process of social and educational appropriation of ICT in higher education institutions (HEI).  

Findings: Findings show the level of use (low and high) of ICT (hardware, software, and digital educational resources) by university professors, identifying those that still maintain a predominant use (e.g., desktop PC); those that are innovative (e.g., laptop, smartphone), and those that appear with low frequency (e.g., apps, digital blackboard, clickers). These results show some factors that may influence the development of these trends, such as technological infrastructure, HEI support, teachers’ training, the accessibility and availability of resources, and preference for digital open resources.  

Recommendations for Practitioners: According to the results, universities should provide technological resources and suitable connectivity necessary for educational innovation to professors. Besides, it is suggested to strengthen the pedagogical use of ICT by training according to the trends of use and professors’ competency levels.   

Recommendation for Researchers: This study made evident professors’ great preference of using storage, display, and sound devices, among them the desktop PC and the laptop continue being the key tools to boost the educational process, in contrast to the low use of tools to detect plagiarism, social networks, and apps to boost activities with emergent technologies. Considering the potential and richness these tools may offer in the educational processes, it should be interesting to carry out studies on factors or motivations that influence the little inclination to use them.

Impact on Society: The analysis of the trends of ICT use from the perspective of university professors about hardware, software, and digital educational resources may suggest greater attention to the permanent training to take advantage of the pedagogical and technological potential of these tools. 

Future Research: This study allows thinking of other ways and lines of research that are the base to develop future proposals exploring the reality of new generations of professors. It also could be the base to carry out comparative studies in other regional contexts, which permit to compare, contrast and enrich professors’ diversity. On the other hand, this research also shows the importance of carrying out mixed studies that offer a greater level of comprehension, analysis, and reflection about the target population and the trends of use of ICT.",,,Journal of Information Technology Education Research,,,,2020,2020,2020,,19,,395-425,All OA; Gold,Article,"Tulia Ricardo-Barreto, Carmen; Jabba Molinares, Daladier; Llinás, Humberto; M Peña Santodomíngo, Judith; Milena Astorga Acevedo, Cinthia; D Acevedo Rodríguez, Pedro; P Baloco Navarro, Claudia; M Villarreal Villa, Sandra","Tulia Ricardo-Barreto, Carmen (Universidad del Norte); Jabba Molinares, Daladier (Universidad del Norte); Llinás, Humberto (Universidad del Norte); M Peña Santodomíngo, Judith (Universidad de San Buenaventura); Milena Astorga Acevedo, Cinthia (Universidad del Norte); D Acevedo Rodríguez, Pedro (Universidad del Norte); P Baloco Navarro, Claudia (Universidad del Norte); M Villarreal Villa, Sandra (Universidad del Norte)",,"Tulia Ricardo-Barreto, Carmen (Universidad del Norte); Jabba Molinares, Daladier (Universidad del Norte); Llinás, Humberto (Universidad del Norte); M Peña Santodomíngo, Judith (Universidad de San Buenaventura); Milena Astorga Acevedo, Cinthia (Universidad del Norte); D Acevedo Rodríguez, Pedro (Universidad del Norte); P Baloco Navarro, Claudia (Universidad del Norte); M Villarreal Villa, Sandra (Universidad del Norte)",15,6,,9.99,http://www.jite.org/documents/Vol19/JITE-Rv19p395-425Ricardo6320.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1129653858,"39 Education; 3902 Education Policy, Sociology and Philosophy; 3903 Education Systems",4 Quality Education

Sin embargo, el concepto de “identidad”, pese a su gran presencia en los discursos públicos, sigue siendo afectado por una profunda ambigüedad definitoria que limita su utilidad analítica y dificulta la transferencia de conocimiento de las investigaciones científicas que pudieran contribuir a debates informados en el ámbito público. El presente artículo, en base a la revisión de estudios existentes, aboga por la conceptualización de la identidad como un proceso multidimensional. La elaboración teórica sobre los mecanismos de construcción identitaria lleva a plantear cinco precauciones principales a considerar a la hora establecer relaciones entre las categorías identitarias y las pautas sociales. Se realiza una reflexión sobre la necesidad de combinar el antiesencialismo analítico con el estudio de los esencialismos cotidianos y sus implicaciones.
Abstract The understanding of present social and political tensions generates a renewed interest in the study of identity construction processes. However, the concept of “identity”, despite its wide presence in the public discourses, remains profoundly affected by ambiguity in terms of its definition. This limits its analytical usage and hinders the dissemination of the findings of scientific research that could contribute to creating informed debates in the public domain. The present paper, based on the review of existing studies, argues for a conceptualization of identity that defines it as a multidimensional process. The theoretical discussion concerning the main mechanisms of identity construction leads us to propose five precautions which should be taken into account when analysing the relation between identity categories and social patterns. Finally, we reflect on the necessity of combining analytical anti-essentialism with the study of everyday essentialisms and their implications.",,,Sociologias,,,,2020-08,2020,2020-08,,22,54,202-229,All OA; Gold,Article,"Sobczyk, Rita; Soriano-Miras, Rosa; Caballero-Calvo, Andrés","Sobczyk, Rita (Universidad del Norte, Colombia); Soriano-Miras, Rosa (Universidad de Granada, Spain); Caballero-Calvo, Andrés (Universidad del Norte, Colombia)",,"Sobczyk, Rita (Universidad del Norte); Soriano-Miras, Rosa (University of Granada); Caballero-Calvo, Andrés (Universidad del Norte)",1,1,,1.23,http://www.scielo.br/j/soc/a/nLV4kXFkXsc9S8nFbfYZTrG/?format=pdf&lang=es,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1130477438,"44 Human Society; 47 Language, Communication and Culture; 4702 Cultural Studies",

Using a multiple linear regression method, several mathematical models with statistical significance were obtained. The robustness of the models was validated, employing the leave-one-out cross-validation and Y-scrambling methods. The entire data set was docked against penicillin-binding protein, iso-tyrosyl tRNA synthetase, and DNA gyrase. The most active cannabinoids had high affinity to penicillin-binding protein (PBP), whereas the least active compounds had low affinities for all of the targets. Among the cannabinoid compounds, Cannabinoid 2 was highlighted due to its suitable combination of both antimicrobial activity and higher scoring values against the selected target; therefore, its docking performance was compared to that of oxacillin, a commercial PBP inhibitor. The 2D figures reveal that both compounds hit the protein in the active site with a similar type of molecular interaction, where the hydroxyl groups in the aromatic ring of cannabinoids play a pivotal role in the biological activity. These results provide some evidence that the anti-Staphylococcus aureus activity of these cannabinoids may be related to the inhibition of the PBP protein; besides, the robustness of the models along with the docking and Quantitative Structure–Activity Relationship (QSAR) results allow the proposal of three new compounds; the predicted activity combined with the scoring values against PBP should encourage future synthesis and experimental testing.","We thank three institutions for their generous support: Universidad Del Norte, Universidad San Francisco de Quito, and Universidad de la Costa.",This research received no external funding.,Crystals,,,,2020-08-11,2020,2020-08-11,,10,8,692,All OA; Gold,Article,"Cortes, Eliceo; Mora, José; Márquez, Edgar","Cortes, Eliceo (Grupo de Investigación en Ciencias Naturales y Exactas, Departamento de Ciencias Naturales y Exactas, Universidad de la Costa, Barranquilla 080002, Colombia); Mora, José (Grupo de Química Computacional y Teórica (QCT-USFQ), Departamento de Ingeniería Química, Universidad San Francisco de Quito, Diego de Robles y Vía Interoceánica, Quito 170901, Ecuador); Márquez, Edgar (Grupo de Investigaciones en Química y Biología, Departamento de Química y Biología, Facultad de Ciencias Exactas, Universidad del Norte, Carrera 51B, Km 5, vía Puerto Colombia, Barranquilla 081007, Colombia)","Cortes, Eliceo (University of the Coast); Mora, José (Universidad San Francisco de Quito); Márquez, Edgar (Universidad del Norte)","Cortes, Eliceo (University of the Coast); Mora, José (Universidad San Francisco de Quito); Márquez, Edgar (Universidad del Norte)",22,10,,2.88,https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4352/10/8/692/pdf?version=1597106291,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1130061228,34 Chemical Sciences; 3404 Medicinal and Biomolecular Chemistry,

The catalysts were characterized by elemental analysis, textural properties, XRD, XPS, EDS elemental mapping and High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM). The chemical analyses by X-ray Fluorescence (XRF) and CHNS-O elemental analysis showed results for all compounds in agreement, within experimental accuracy, according to stoichiometric values proposed to Mo/Ni = 6 and (V+Ni)/(V+Ni+Mo) = 0.35. The sol-gel synthesis method increased the surface area by incorporation of Ga3+ ions into the Al2O3 forming Ga-O-Al bonding; whereas the impregnation synthesis method leads to decrease by blocking of alumina pores, as follows NiMoV/Al-Ga(1%-I) < NiMoV/Al-Ga(1%-SG) < NiMo/Al2O3 < Al2O3-Ga2O3(1%-I) < Al2O3-Ga2O3(1%-SG) < Al2O3, propitiating Dp-BJH between 6.18 and 7.89 nm. XRD confirmed a bulk structure typical of (NH4)4[NiMo6O24H6]•5H2O and XPS the presence at the surface of Mo4+, Mo6+, NixSy, Ni2+, Ga3+ and V5+ species, respectively. The EDS elemental mapping confirmed that Ni, Mo, Al, Ga, V and S are well-distributed on Al2O3-Ga2O3(1%-SG) support. The HRTEM analysis shows that the length and stacking distribution of MoS2 crystallites varied from 5.07 to 5.94 nm and 2.74 to 3.58 with synthesis method (SG to I). The results of the characterization sulfided catalysts showed that the synthesis method via impregnation induced largest presence of gallium on the surface influencing the dispersion V5+ species, this effect improves the dispersion of the MoS2 phase and increasing the number of active sites, which correlates well with the dibenzothiophene HDS and naphthalene HYD activities. The dibenzothiophene HDS activities with overall pseudo-first-order rate constants’ values (kHDS) from 1.65 to 7.07 L/(h·mol·m2) follow the order: NiMoV-S/Al-Ga(1%-I) < NiMo-S/Al2O3 < NiMoV-S/Al-Ga(1%-SG), whereas the rate constants’ values (k) of naphthalene HYD from 0.022 to 2.23 L/(h·mol·m2) as follow: NiMoV-S/Al-Ga(1%-SG) < NiMo-S/Al2O3 < NiMoV-S/Al-Ga(1%-I). We consider that Ga and V act as structural promoters in the NiMo catalysts supported on Al2O3 that allows the largest generation of BRIM sites for HYD and CUS sites for DDS.","The authors also gratefully the financial support provided by Universidad del Norte, under Project number: 2019-017.

This work proposes the adaptation of a pattern recognition model based on the systematic functioning of the brain called Ar2p for the selection of web services in composition activities in Cloud environments. The web serice are represented as patterns to be recognized by Ar2p, which determines the necessary and sufficient web services that constitute the composition of services that meet its functional and non-functional requirements. The services composition and activity selection have been formalized through a logical-mathematical model of web service recognition mechanisms in two steps, one that describes the syntactic search of the service and the second, which offers filtering through quality of service parameters. An adaptive implementation of the final model allows its recognition modules to be provided with any desired optimization strategy.",,,Journal of Physics Conference Series,,,,2020-03-01,2020,,2020-03-01,1513,1,012004,All OA; Gold,Article,"Adarme, M A; Jimeno, M A; Puerto, E G","Adarme, M A (Universidad Francisco de Paula Santander, San José de Cúcuta, Colombia); Jimeno, M A (Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); Puerto, E G (Universidad Francisco de Paula Santander, San José de Cúcuta, Colombia)",,"Adarme, M A (Francisco de Paula Santander University); Jimeno, M A (Universidad del Norte); Puerto, E G (Francisco de Paula Santander University)",0,0,,,https://doi.org/10.1088/1742-6596/1513/1/012004,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1128013166,51 Physical Sciences,
1608,pub.1130745923,10.3390/en13184687,,,Characterization of Thermophysical Properties of Phase Change Materials Using Unconventional Experimental Technologies,"The growing interest in developing applications for the storage of thermal energy (TES) is highly linked to the knowledge of the properties of the materials that will be used for that purpose. Likewise, the validity of representing processes through numerical simulations will depend on the accuracy of the thermal properties of the materials. The most relevant properties in the characterization of phase change materials (PCM) are the phase change enthalpy, thermal conductivity, heat capacity and density. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) is the most widely used technique for determining thermophysical properties. However, several unconventional methods have been proposed in the literature, mainly due to overcome the limitations of DSC, namely, the small sample required which is unsuitable for studying inhomogeneous materials. This paper presents the characterization of two commercial paraffins commonly used in TES applications, using methods such as T-history and T-melting, which were selected due to their simplicity, high reproducibility, and low cost of implementation. In order to evaluate the reliability of the methods, values calculated with the proposed alternative methods are compared with the results obtained by DSC measurements and with the manufacturer’s technical datasheet. Results obtained show that these non-conventional techniques can be used for the accurate estimation of selected thermal properties. A detailed discussion of the advantage and disadvantage of each method is given.",,"This research has been partially funded by Universidad Del Norte with his PhD Scholarship Contract Identification Number: UN-OJ-2013-22063, the Colombian Administrative Department of Science, Technology and Innovation-COLCIENCIAS Scholarship Call No 727 of 2015 and through the program “es tiempo de volver”.",Energies,,,,2020-09-09,2020,2020-09-09,,13,18,4687,All OA; Gold,Article,"Martínez, Arnold; Carmona, Mauricio; Cortés, Cristóbal; Arauzo, Inmaculada","Martínez, Arnold (Rational Use of Energy and Environment Preservation Research Group from Universidad del Norte, 081007 Barranquilla, Atlántico, Colombia;, arnoldg@uninorte.edu.co; Engineering, Science and Technology—I.C.T Research group from Universidad de Córdoba, 230002 Montería, Córdoba, Colombia); Carmona, Mauricio (Rational Use of Energy and Environment Preservation Research Group from Universidad del Norte, 081007 Barranquilla, Atlántico, Colombia;, arnoldg@uninorte.edu.co); Cortés, Cristóbal (Department of Mechanical Engineering, University of Zaragoza, Campus Río Ebro.

This article analyzes these dynamics of co-opted State reconfiguration in order to comprise in which way armed patronage affected the institutional structure of the city and extracted public funds from the local administration with the aim of financing the AUC´s criminal activity. It was found that the José Pablo Díaz front was an intermediary among a great part of the political and electoral relations, and that there was a complementary relation between the armed group and some politicians in the city.

This gas could reach energy densities close to 12 MJ/Nm3, which allows its use as a fuel in conventional thermal machines or as a precursor for higher fuel gases. Given this, in the present work allothermal gasification for a 50 %w.t. moisture content biomass was analyzed computationally aiming to yield a high hydrogen content syngas. Using a power supply of 8 kW, the dry tar-free gas yield was around 51.9 mol/kg of biomass with an average concentration of 45.7% CO, 44.8% H2, 4.8% CH4 and 4.6% CO2. A peak temperature of 1070 K and 33% for chemical efficiency were achieved. In spite of using homogeneous heating along the reactor wall, the process temperature decreases near the gas outlet. This is due to solid material depletion decreasing the process thermal inertia. During the final stages, H2 and CO concentration also record an increase due to the endothermic carbon gasification as well as water-gas shift and methanation reactions.",,,Revista Facultad de Ingeniería,,,,2020-05-04,2020,2020-05-04,,,,,All OA; Gold,Article,"Lenis-Rodas, Yuhan Arley; Maag, Gilles; de Oliveira, Celso Eduardo Lins; Corredor, Lesme Antonio; Sanjuan, Marco Enrique","Lenis-Rodas, Yuhan Arley (Institución Universitaria Pascual Bravo); Maag, Gilles (Universidade de São Paulo (USP)); de Oliveira, Celso Eduardo Lins (Universidade de São Paulo (USP)); Corredor, Lesme Antonio (Universidad del Norte); Sanjuan, Marco Enrique (Universidad del Norte)",,"Lenis-Rodas, Yuhan Arley (Pascual Bravo Institution University); Maag, Gilles (Universidade de São Paulo); de Oliveira, Celso Eduardo Lins (Universidade de São Paulo); Corredor, Lesme Antonio (Universidad del Norte); Sanjuan, Marco Enrique (Universidad del Norte)",0,0,,0.0,https://revistas.udea.edu.co/index.php/ingenieria/article/download/338106/20802452,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1127789813,40 Engineering; 4004 Chemical Engineering,7 Affordable and Clean Energy

1576,pub.1129630091,10.7307/ptt.v32i4.3385,,,Factors Influencing Crash Frequency on Colombian Rural Roads,"Traffic crashes in Colombia have become a public health problem causing about 7,000 deaths and 45,000 severe injuries per year. Around 40% of these events occur on rural roads, taking note that the vulnerable users (pedestrians, motorcyclists, cyclists) account for the largest percentage of the victims. The objective of this research is to identify the factors that influence the frequency of crashes, including the singular orography of the country. For this purpose, we estimated Negative Binomial (Poisson-gamma) regression, Zero-inflated model, and generalized the linear mixed model, thus developing a comparative analysis of results in the Colombian context. The data used in the study came from the official sources regarding records about crashes with consequences; that is, with the occurrence of fatalities or injuries on the Colombian roads. For collecting the highway characteristics, an in-field inventory was conducted, gathering information about both infrastructure and operational parameters in more than three thousand kilometres of the national network. The events were geo-referenced, with registries of vehicles, involved victims, and their condition. The results suggest that highways in flat terrain have higher crash frequency than highways in rolling or mountainous terrain. Besides, the presence of pedestrians, the existence of a median and the density of intersections per kilometre also increase the probability of crashes. Meanwhile, roads with shoulders and wide lanes have lower crash frequency. Specific interventions in the infrastructure and control for reducing crashes risk attending the modelling results have been suggested.",,,PROMET - Traffic&Transportation,,,,2020-07-09,2020,2020-07-09,,32,4,449-460,All OA; Gold,Article,"Arévalo-Támara, Andrea; Orozco-Fontalvo, Mauricio; Cantillo, Víctor","Arévalo-Támara, Andrea (Santo Tomás University, Bogotá, Colombia); Orozco-Fontalvo, Mauricio (Universidad Militar Nueva Granada, Bogotá, Colombia); Cantillo, Víctor (Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia)",,"Arévalo-Támara, Andrea (Santo Tomás University, Bogotá, Colombia); Orozco-Fontalvo, Mauricio (Military University Nueva Granada); Cantillo, Víctor (Universidad del Norte)",9,3,,2.44,https://traffic.fpz.hr/index.php/PROMTT/article/download/3385/561561836,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1129630091,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3509 Transportation, Logistics and Supply Chains; 40 Engineering; 4005 Civil Engineering",3 Good Health and Well Being

Likewise, it studied the knowledge on the socio-political and demographic characteristics of the local political elite of the city as well as the identification and definition of the factors that influence (or explain) the configuration of their role vis-à-vis their political representation. Similarly, based on the attitudes, beliefs and perceptions of the councilors, it also seeks to answer questions related to democracy, its actors and institutions, political guidelines and the rules of the local political game.

1565,pub.1133258235,10.3390/math8122160,,,Networks of Picture Processors with Filtering Based on Evaluation Sets as Solvers for Cryptographic Puzzles Based on Random Multivariate Quadratic Equations,"Networks of picture processors is a massively distributed and parallel computational model inspired by the evolutionary cellular processes, which offers efficient solutions for NP-complete problems. This bio-inspired model computes two-dimensional strings (pictures) using simple rewriting rules (evolutionary operations). The functioning of this model mimics a community of cells (pictures) that are evolving according to these bio-operations via a selection process that filters valid surviving cells. In this paper, we propose an extension of this model that empowers it with a flexible method that selects the processed pictures based on a quantitative evaluation of its content. In order to show the versatility of this extension, we introduce a solver for a cryptographic proof-of-work based on the hardness of finding a solution to a set of random quadratic equations over the finite field F2. This problem is demonstrated to be NP-hard, even with quadratic polynomials over the field F2, when the number of equations and the number of variables are of roughly the same size. The proposed solution runs in O(n2) computational steps for any size (n,m) of the input pictures. In this context, this paper opens up a wide field of research that looks for theoretical and practical solutions of cryptographic problems via software/hardware implementations based on bio-inspired computational models.",,"Ricardo Villanueva-Polanco was funded by Universidad del Norte (Grant 2019-029), and Karina Paola Jiménez was funded by Fundación Carolina (call 2014) and Universidad Simon Bolivar.",Mathematics,,,,2020-12-04,2020,2020-12-04,,8,12,2160,All OA; Gold,Article,"Jiménez, Karina Paola; Gómez-Canaval, Sandra; Villanueva-Polanco, Ricardo; Suazo, Silvia Martín","Jiménez, Karina Paola (Facultad de Ingenierías, Universidad Simón Bolívar, Calle 58 No 55-132, Barranquilla 080001, Colombia;, kjimenez6@unisimonbolivar.edu.co; Departamento de Sistemas Informáticos, Universidad Politécnica de Madrid, Calle Alan Turing s/n, 28031 Madrid, Spain;, silvia.marsuazo@alumnos.upm.es); Gómez-Canaval, Sandra (Departamento de Sistemas Informáticos, Universidad Politécnica de Madrid, Calle Alan Turing s/n, 28031 Madrid, Spain;, silvia.marsuazo@alumnos.upm.es); Villanueva-Polanco, Ricardo (Computer Science Department, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla 080001, Colombia;, rpolanco@uninorte.edu.co); Suazo, Silvia Martín (Departamento de Sistemas Informáticos, Universidad Politécnica de Madrid, Calle Alan Turing s/n, 28031 Madrid, Spain;, silvia.marsuazo@alumnos.upm.es)","Gómez-Canaval, Sandra (Technical University of Madrid)","Jiménez, Karina Paola (Universidad Simón Bolívar; Technical University of Madrid); Gómez-Canaval, Sandra (Technical University of Madrid); Villanueva-Polanco, Ricardo (Universidad del Norte); Suazo, Silvia Martín (Technical University of Madrid)",0,0,,,https://www.mdpi.com/2227-7390/8/12/2160/pdf?version=1607069573,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1133258235,49 Mathematical Sciences,

We believed by providing a space for online conversation, written collaboration and discussion, students would enhance their plurilingual and pluricultural competence as well as their communicative competences through the medium of English as an international language (EIL).  The aim was also to enable students to investigate cultural complexity and to develop cultural curiosity. Taking into account plurilingual and pluricultural competence (PPC) and the efficacy of virtual exchanges for language learning, we used a series of tasks for students to participate in a wide range of activities of varying complexity regarding German and Colombian culture for a six-week exchange.  Students self-assessed their written and spoken online interactions as well as their perceived skills in mediating texts and communication based on the recently added descriptors in the Companion Volume to the CEFR. They also rated their plurilingual and pluricultural competences on a PPC scale at both the beginning and end of the project. Results demonstrate that there is value in implementing virtual exchange projects in which students reflect on and increase their awareness of these concepts also suggesting that pairing students with international students rather than L1 speakers of the language has a potentially positive effect on students’ anxiety level and communicative competences.",,,The EuroCALL Review,,,,2020-03-31,2020,2020-03-31,,28,1,3-14,All OA; Gold,Article,"Bailey, Angela; Gruber, Alice","Bailey, Angela (Universidad del Norte); Gruber, Alice (University of Applied Sciences Heilbronn)",,"Bailey, Angela (Universidad del Norte); Gruber, Alice (University of Applied Sciences Heilbronn)",3,1,,2.75,https://polipapers.upv.es/index.php/eurocall/article/download/11982/12620,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1127980250,"39 Education; 3901 Curriculum and Pedagogy; 47 Language, Communication and Culture; 4703 Language Studies; 4704 Linguistics",

Support given from families to their children depends to a large extent on the reinforcement of perceptions about self-determination. In that sense, this research aims to describe the opinion of parents of adolescents and young people with intellectual disabilities about this construct. Five focus groups were formed with 42 participants. The lexicometric analysis of the group interviews using Iramuteq software yielded four dimensions: autonomy; barriers in the family and the background; support and opportunities; psychological capabilities. Parents do not acknowledge the entire concept of self-determination. They associate it with autonomy for personal care and housework and, to a lesser extent, with community life. The family barriers are psychological: fear, overprotection, underestimation and lack of trust in the child’s capacity. This leads to less opportunity offer. They consider that society is poorly prepared to stimulate these processes. They feel the need to receive professional support directed to revise their beliefs, increase their knowledge and put into practice strategies to facilitate the achievement of self-determination in their children.",,,Siglo Cero,,,,2020-11-17,2020,2020-11-17,,51,4,7-24,All OA; Gold,Article,"Sabeh, Eliana Noemí; Aguilar, Licia María Sotelo; Carreras, María Paula","Sabeh, Eliana Noemí (Universidad del Norte de Santo Tomás de Aquino); Aguilar, Licia María Sotelo (Universidad del Norte de Santo Tomás de Aquino); Carreras, María Paula (Universidad Nacional de Tucumán)",,"Sabeh, Eliana Noemí (Universidad del Norte de Santo Tomás de Aquino); Aguilar, Licia María Sotelo (Universidad del Norte de Santo Tomás de Aquino); Carreras, María Paula (National University of Tucumán)",1,1,,0.4,https://revistas.usal.es/index.php/0210-1696/article/download/scero2020514724/24408,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1132745126,44 Human Society; 4409 Social Work; 52 Psychology; 5204 Cognitive and Computational Psychology,3 Good Health and Well Being

With this expansion, the development of bilingual education approaches is under constant scrutiny. One recent approach is content and language integrated learning (CLIL). European in origin, CLIL can be viewed as an educational or language teaching approach and it refers to the teaching of curricular content and L2 in an integrated manner. This approach has received international attention, yet, how CLIL unfolds in settings outside Europe appears underrepresented in international publications. The aim of this article is to provide a critical review of CLIL in Latin America between 2008 and 2018. We surveyed 64 items (articles, book chapters, and dissertations) published in regional and international outlets: 41 empirical studies, 19 practice-oriented publications, and four reviews. It begins by summarizing the CLIL continuum with a focus on content- and language-driven CLIL and CLIL frameworks. It then provides a synthesis of empirical studies and practice-oriented publications about CLIL in different Latin American settings. The corpus is analyzed following these unifying themes: pedagogy, perceptions and beliefs, teacher education, global citizenship, and language development. From this review, it transpires that Latin American CLIL is mostly implemented and examined from a language-driven perspective in private primary, secondary and higher education.

Through explicit instruction on the argumentative genre and reflection on the linguistic correlates of neoliberal ideology, we guided students in developing enhanced awareness of neoliberalism and its influence on environmental policy. In the independent writing stage, students’ argumentation revealed critical stances towards neoliberalism and adequate command of the target genre. The paper closes with general reflections and recommendations for the adoption of an explicitly critical approach in university literacy education.

Then, the fishes were classified taxonomically and also according to their trophic guild. Subsequently, the ecological indices of diversity, equity and dominance were analyzed, complementing this analysis with the development of a conceptual model of the trophic network, based on the trophic associations established. The results of these analyses indicate that the ecosystem not only has low values of richness (12 species), low diversity (0-1.90) and equity (0-0.98), but also high dominance (0.16-1.00) of omnivorous fish when compared to other wetlands in the Colombian Caribbean. This indicates that this marsh complex is undergoing a potential degradation process of the fish food base, possibly due to inadequate environmental conditions this ecosystem is currently experiencing, which, in turn, could be negatively compromising the sustainability of their fish populations in both the mid and long term",,,Intropica,,,,2020-12-12,2020,2020-12-12,,15,2,144-154,All OA; Gold,Article,"Valdelamar Villegas, Juan Carlos; García Pacheco, Lissy Carolina; Cuadro Alzamora, Sonia María; Torres Benítez, José David; Arciniegas Suárez, Cesar Augusto","Valdelamar Villegas, Juan Carlos (Grupo de Investigaciones Ambientales, Fundación Universitaria Tecnológico Comfenalco, Cartagena Colombia); García Pacheco, Lissy Carolina (Grupo de Investigaciones Ambientales, Fundación Universitaria Tecnológico Comfenalco, Cartagena Colombia); Cuadro Alzamora, Sonia María (Grupo de Investigaciones Ambientales, Fundación Universitaria Tecnológico Comfenalco, Cartagena, Colombia); Torres Benítez, José David (Grupo de Investigaciones Ambientales, Fundación Universitaria Tecnológico Comfenalco, Cartagena, Colombia); Arciniegas Suárez, Cesar Augusto (Grupo de Investigaciones Ambientales, Fundación Universitaria Tecnológico Comfenalco, Cartagena, Colombia)",,"Valdelamar Villegas, Juan Carlos (Fundación Universitaria Tecnológico Comfenalco Cartagena); García Pacheco, Lissy Carolina (Fundación Universitaria Tecnológico Comfenalco Cartagena); Cuadro Alzamora, Sonia María (Fundación Universitaria Tecnológico Comfenalco Cartagena); Torres Benítez, José David (Fundación Universitaria Tecnológico Comfenalco Cartagena); Arciniegas Suárez, Cesar Augusto (Fundación Universitaria Tecnológico Comfenalco Cartagena)",1,0,,0.2,https://revistas.unimagdalena.edu.co/index.php/intropica/article/download/3553/2864,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1135859675,31 Biological Sciences; 3103 Ecology; 41 Environmental Sciences; 4104 Environmental Management,14 Life Below Water

The importance of containers is the ability they must separate an application and interact with its parts, without the entire application having to be affected. Containers can share processes between multiple applications, using the same strategy used by service-oriented architecture. The aim this paper is to present a novel architecture for the automatic deployment of containers in academic contexts. The verification and validation of the architecture was carried out through the construction of a platform that adapts the concepts of the architecture and allows to visualize each of its components level by level. In this study, a bibliographic analysis was carried out on the architectures that manage containers, showing strengths and weaknesses. The principal result of this research was the proposal of novel architecture for the deployment of containers as extension of Docker. The secondary result was the development of a web platform, this platform allows to present all characteristics of the novel approach.

This proposal has three stages: a non-supervised clustering of consumption profiles based on a hybrid algorithm between self-organizing maps (SOM) and genetic algorithms (GA). A second stage for demand forecasting is based on ARIMA (autoregressive integrated moving average) models corrected intelligently through neural networks (ANN). The final stage is a classifier based on random forests for fraudulent user detection. The proposed intelligent approach was trained and tested with real data from the Colombian Caribbean region, where the utility reports energy losses of around 18% of the total energy purchased by the company during the five last years. The results show an average overall performance of 82.9% in the detection process of fraudulent users, significantly increasing the effectiveness compared to the approaches (68%) previously applied by the utility in the region.","This work was supported by Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla-Colombia.",This research received no external funding.,Energies,,,,2020-05-11,2020,2020-05-11,,13,9,2393,All OA; Gold,Article,"González Rodríguez, Rubén; Jiménez Mares, Jamer; Quintero M., Christian G.","González Rodríguez, Rubén (Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla 081007, Colombia); Jiménez Mares, Jamer (Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla 081007, Colombia); Quintero M., Christian G.

1452,pub.1128466356,10.3390/electronics9060971,,,Imitating Human Emotions with a NAO Robot as Interviewer Playing the Role of Vocational Tutor,"This paper proposes an intelligent system that can hold an interview, using a NAO robot as interviewer playing the role of vocational tutor. For that, twenty behaviors within five personality profiles are classified and categorized into NAO. Five basic emotions are considered: anger, boredom, interest, surprise, and joy. Selected behaviors are grouped according to these five different emotions. Common behaviors (e.g., movements or body postures) used by the robot during vocational guidance sessions are based on a theory of personality traits called the “Five-Factor Model”. In this context, a predefined set of questions is asked by the robot—according to a theoretical model called the “Orientation Model”—about the person’s vocational preferences. Therefore, NAO could react as conveniently as possible during the interview, according to the score of the answer given by the person to the question posed and its personality type. Additionally, based on the answers to these questions, a vocational profile is established, and the robot could provide a recommendation about the person’s vocation. The results show how the intelligent selection of behaviors can be successfully achieved through the proposed approach, making the Human–Robot Interaction friendlier.","This work was supported by Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla—Colombia.",This research received no external funding.,Electronics,,,,2020-06-11,2020,2020-06-11,,9,6,971,All OA; Gold,Article,"Goenaga, Selene; Navarro, Loraine; Quintero M., Christian G.; Pardo, Mauricio","Goenaga, Selene (Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla 081007, Colombia); Navarro, Loraine (Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla 081007, Colombia); Quintero M., Christian G.

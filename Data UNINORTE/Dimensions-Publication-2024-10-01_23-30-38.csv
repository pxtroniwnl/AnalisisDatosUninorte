Point-of-Care Ultrasound (POCUS) is a reliable, easy-to-use, and available tool for an accurate diagnosis of ADHF. We aimed to analyze the impact of introducing POCUS as an additional tool to clinical standard diagnosis in clinical times of hospitalized heart failure patients.
METHODS: Retrospective cohort study comparing patients consulting to ED for heart failure acute decompensation previous to the rutinary use of POCUS versus patients who received an ultrasound-guided diagnosis at entrance. Ultrasound evaluation was additional to standard diagnosis (which included natriuretic peptides, images, etc). Cumulative incidence functions were calculated for time to treatment, time to disposition decision, and time to discharge. We used a flexible parametric model for estimate the time ratio (TR) in order to reflect the effect of POCUS.
RESULTS: A total of 149 patients were included. The most frequent comorbid condition was hypertension (71.8%) followed by type 2 diabetes (36.2%). B type natriuretic peptide (BNP) was over 500 ng/ml. Most patients had Stevenson B profile (83.9%) at admission. In the cumulative incidence model (Fig. A), the TR (time ratio) for the outcome time to treatment was 1.539 (CI 95% 0.88 to 2.69). The TR for the outcome time to disposition decision was 0.665 (CI 95% 0.48 to 0.99). The TR for the outcome time to discharge (hospital length of stay) was 0.663 (CI 95% 0.49 to 0.90).
CONCLUSION: In our study, the introduction of POCUS to ADHF patients decreases time to disposition decision and total length of hospital stay. Conversely, time to treatment augments. There is need for the evaluation of ultrasound as an intervention in clinical trials to confirm these findings.",Declaration of Competing Interest The authors declare no conflict of interest.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A descriptive observational study was carried out, and data were obtained by reviewing the influenza-like illness and severe acute respiratory infection database in the pediatric population of the sentinel surveillance reference center in the district of Barranquilla during the years 2016-2021, applying inclusion and exclusion criteria.
RESULTS: During 2016-2019, the average age of individuals was 1.3 (±1.7) years, during 2021, it was 2.3 (±3.5) years. The distribution by sex was similar, predominantly male. August and February were the months with the highest record of symptoms for 2016-2019 and 2021, respectively, the most frequent being cough, fever, shortness of breath, and diarrhea. By 2021 there was a higher use of antibiotics and antivirals reported than in 2016-2019. Most patients tested negative for viral detection. When comparing the percentage of viruses detected by age group and years of detection, positivity was lower in 2021 by every age group, and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) was the most frequently detected.
CONCLUSIONS: There was less virus positivity in viral detection tests in the pediatric population in 2021. RSV persists as the main etiology affecting this population, especially infants. The use of antibiotic therapy in viral infections continues to be a problematic practice in their management. Sentinel surveillance can be strengthened throughout the country.",CONFLICTS OF INTEREST The authors declare no conflicts of interest.,,Journal of Medical Virology,,,"Infant; Child; Humans; Male; Child, Preschool; Female; SARS-CoV-2; Colombia; COVID-19; Respiratory Tract Infections; Viruses; Virus Diseases; Respiratory Syncytial Virus, Human; Respiratory Syncytial Virus Infections; Influenza, Human",2023-01-03,2023,2023-01-03,2023-01,95,1,e28439,All OA; Green,Article,"Zarur‐Torralvo, Shiara; Stand‐Niño, Iván; Flórez‐García, Victor; Mendoza, Humberto; Viana‐Cárdenas, Erika","Zarur‐Torralvo, Shiara (Department of Pediatrics, School of Medicine, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); Stand‐Niño, Iván (Department of Pediatric Pulmonology, School of Medicine, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); Flórez‐García, Victor (Department of Public Health, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia; Department of Public Health, Joseph J.

Data were collected from 1135 participants over 30 years of age, at risk of developing T2D from the PREDICOL project. Participants' glycemic status was defined using an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). Participants were divided into normoglycemic subjects (NGT), prediabetes and diabetics do not know they have diabetes (UT2D). HRQOL was assessed using the EQ-5D-3L questionnaire of the EuroQol group. Logistic regression and Tobit models were used to examine factors associated with EQ-5D scores for each glycemic group.ResultsThe mean age of participants was 55.6 ± 12.1 years, 76.4% were female, and one in four participants had prediabetes or unknown diabetes. Participants reported problems most frequently on the dimensions of Pain/Discomfort and Anxiety/Depression in the different glycemic groups. The mean EQ-5D score in NGT was 0.80 (95% CI 0.79–0.81), in prediabetes, 0.81 (95% CI 0.79–0.83), and in participants with UT2D of 0.79 (95% CI 0.76–0.82), respectively. Female sex, older age, city of residence, lower education, receiving treatment for hypertension, and marital status were significantly associated with lower levels of HRQOL in the Tobit regression analysis.ConclusionsHRQOL of NGT, prediabetes, and UT2D participants was statistically similar. However, factors such as gender, age. and place of residence were found to be significant predictors of HRQOL for each glycemic group.","The authors are solely responsible for the views expressed in this publication and do not necessarily represent the views, decisions, or policies of the institutions with which they are affiliated.","Open Access funding provided by Colombia Consortium.

The trauma mechanism varies according to the patient's age. Non-operative treatment continues to be performed, although surgical treatment has gained popularity in recent years. Paediatric orthopaedic traumatologists should always bear in mind the already known general principles of treatment. In this study, we aimed to provide a general characterization of femoral fractures, risk factors, and current definitive treatment methods in a developing Latin American country.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This is an observational, analytical, retrospective study with a non-probabilistic sample of consecutive cases of skeletally immature patients with femoral fractures treated at a trauma hospital in Asunción, Paraguay, from January to December 2022. Patients with diseases fragile bones and femoral fractures were excluded. Demographic and clinical characteristics of the study population were analysed.
RESULTS: Traffic accidents were the most frequent cause of femoral fractures in our population. Femur fractures were more common in males. The femoral shaft was the most frequent fracture site. Age was one of the most important criteria for defining the treatment approach, considering non-operative management in children younger than 4 years.
CONCLUSIONS: Fracture of the femoral shaft in male patients is the most frequent presentation at our Institution. Summer vacations and traffic accidents are the main risk factors identified in Paraguayan children who suffer a femoral fracture. Non-operative treatment is preferred in children under 4 years of age, while surgical treatment is preferred in children aged 5 years and above. Paediatric orthopaedic traumatologists should be involved in parent education to promote children's safety, especially by increasing care and vigilance during school vacations and dangers related to traffic accidents.",Declaration of Competing Interest None.,,Injury,,,"Humans; Child; Male; Child, Preschool; Retrospective Studies; Developing Countries; Femoral Fractures; Femur; Risk Factors",2023-05-18,2023,2023-05-18,2023-11,54,,110819,All OA; Bronze,Article,"Navarro Vergara, Daniel; Navarro Fretes, Alberto","Navarro Vergara, Daniel (Hospital de Trauma ""Manuel Giagni""; Hospital Central del IPS, Universidad del Norte, Cátedra de Ortopedia y Traumatología, Asunción, Paraguay.

However, visual involvement is not commonly observed, and to date, no cases have been reported in the literature.
OBSERVATIONS: The case involves a 62-year-old female patient with a history of right carotid body tumor resection. She presented to the emergency department with a sudden decrease in visual acuity and bitemporal hemianopsia, accompanied by a left parietal headache. Initial brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a pituitary macroadenoma, which was completely resected. However, postoperatively, the patient developed left amaurosis. Subsequent brain MRI showed the presence of hemostatic material mixed with blood in the sellar region, causing displacement of the optic chiasm. A repeat intervention was performed, identifying bleeding from both cavernous sinuses. Head and neck angiography demonstrated a right glomus vagale tumor with abundant blood drainage into the right cavernous sinus. Embolization of the glomus vagale tumor was performed, resulting in no further bleeding and improvement of symptoms.

In contrast, magnons in antiferromagnets are commonly considered to have bands with both chiralities that are degenerate across the entire Brillouin zone, and to be in the THz range and to have a linear dispersion near the center of the Brillouin zone. Here we theoretically demonstrate a new class of magnons on a prototypical d-wave altermagnet RuO_{2} with the compensated antiparallel magnetic order in the ground state. Based on density-functional-theory calculations we observe that the THz-range magnon bands in RuO_{2} have an alternating chirality splitting, similar to the alternating spin splitting of the electronic bands, and a linear magnon dispersion near the zero wave vector. We also show that, overall, the Landau damping of this metallic altermagnet is suppressed due to the spin-split electronic structure, as compared to an artificial antiferromagnetic phase of the same RuO_{2} crystal with spin-degenerate electronic bands and chirality-degenerate magnon bands.","We acknowledge funding from the Czech Science Foundation Grants No. 19-18623X and No. 19-06433S, the Ministry of Education of the Czech Republic Grants No. LM2018096, No. LM2018110, No. LM2018140, and No. LNSM-LNSpin, and the EU FET Open RIA Grant No. 766566, Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft Grant No. 288 Elasto-q-mat (Project A09 and B05), TopDyn funding of Johannes Gutenberg University Mainz (project ALTERSEED), the computing time supported by the project No. CEDAMNF CZ.02.1.01/0.0/0.0/15_003/0000358 (Ministry of Education, Youth, and Sport) and by the “Information Technology for Innovation” (IT4I) Grant OPEN-22-42, and granted on the supercomputer Mogon at Johannes Gutenberg University Mainz [45] and the support of Alexander Von Humboldt Foundation.",,Physical Review Letters,,,,2023-12-20,2023,2023-12-20,2023-12-22,131,25,256703,All OA; Green,Article,"Šmejkal, Libor; Marmodoro, Alberto; Ahn, Kyo-Hoon; González-Hernández, Rafael; Turek, Ilja; Mankovsky, Sergiy; Ebert, Hubert; D'Souza, Sunil W; Šipr, Ondřej; Sinova, Jairo; Jungwirth, Tomáš","Šmejkal, Libor (Institut für Physik, Johannes Gutenberg Universität Mainz, D-55099 Mainz, Germany.; Institute of Physics, Czech Academy of Sciences, Cukrovarnická 10, 162 00 Praha 6, Czech Republic.); Marmodoro, Alberto (Institute of Physics, Czech Academy of Sciences, Cukrovarnická 10, 162 00 Praha 6, Czech Republic.); Ahn, Kyo-Hoon (Institute of Physics, Czech Academy of Sciences, Cukrovarnická 10, 162 00 Praha 6, Czech Republic.); González-Hernández, Rafael (Institut für Physik, Johannes Gutenberg Universität Mainz, D-55099 Mainz, Germany.; Grupo de Investigación en Física Aplicada, Departamento de Física, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia.); Turek, Ilja (Institute of Physics of Materials, Czech Academy of Sciences, Zizkova 22, CZ-616 62 Brno, Czech Republic.); Mankovsky, Sergiy (Department of Chemistry, Ludwig-Maximilians-University Munich, Butenandtstrasse 11, D-81377 Munich, Germany.); Ebert, Hubert (Department of Chemistry, Ludwig-Maximilians-University Munich, Butenandtstrasse 11, D-81377 Munich, Germany.); D'Souza, Sunil W (New Technologies-Research Center, University of West Bohemia, Plzeň 3, CZ-30100 Czech Republic.); Šipr, Ondřej (Institute of Physics, Czech Academy of Sciences, Cukrovarnická 10, 162 00 Praha 6, Czech Republic.); Sinova, Jairo (Institut für Physik, Johannes Gutenberg Universität Mainz, D-55099 Mainz, Germany.; Institute of Physics, Czech Academy of Sciences, Cukrovarnická 10, 162 00 Praha 6, Czech Republic.); Jungwirth, Tomáš (Institute of Physics, Czech Academy of Sciences, Cukrovarnická 10, 162 00 Praha 6, Czech Republic.; School of Physics and Astronomy, University of Nottingham, Nottingham NG7 2RD, United Kingdom.)",,"Šmejkal, Libor (Johannes Gutenberg University Mainz; Institute of Physics); Marmodoro, Alberto (Institute of Physics); Ahn, Kyo-Hoon (Institute of Physics); González-Hernández, Rafael (Johannes Gutenberg University Mainz; Universidad del Norte); Turek, Ilja (Institute of Physics of Materials); Mankovsky, Sergiy (Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität München); Ebert, Hubert (Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität München); D'Souza, Sunil W (University of West Bohemia); Šipr, Ondřej (Institute of Physics); Sinova, Jairo (Johannes Gutenberg University Mainz; Institute of Physics); Jungwirth, Tomáš (Institute of Physics; University of Nottingham)",26,26,,,https://nottingham-repository.worktribe.com/preview/32464530/chiral_magnons_RuO2_accepted.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1167202680,51 Physical Sciences; 5103 Classical Physics; 5104 Condensed Matter Physics,

As ECCE scales, contextually relevant and feasible measurement is needed to inform policy and programs on strengths and areas for improvement. However, few measures have been designed for use across diverse contexts. Drawing on principles of mixed methods design, this study reports on a new approach to ECCE quality measurement: the Brief Early Childhood Quality Inventory. Using data from the USA, Liberia, and Colombia, results indicate variation in the items perceived as highly relevant to each setting and in the characteristics of classrooms including the degree of child autonomy, the types of activities, and in child/educator interactions and dialogue.  However, despite this variation, a small set of items indicate potential functionality as cross-country anchor items. Findings lend support to the idea that quality measures can have some common elements with room for adaptation within and across settings. Future work in this area should address the possibility that the significance of these practices for child development also varies across settings.",Funding to support this work was provided by Porticus Foundation in a grant to the first author.,"Funding for this research in Liberia and Colombia was provided by the Porticus Foundation in a grant to the first author, and in Nebraska, funding was provided by the Nebraska Early Childhood Collaborative to measure and report on quality of childcare programs.

To infect host cells, the attachment glycoprotein (G) interacts with a cell surface receptor. This interaction determines the specific cell types that are susceptible to infection. RSV possesses a type I fusion protein F. Type I fusion proteins are metastable when rearrangement of the prefusion F occurs; the fusion peptide is exposed transforming the protein into postfusion form. The transition between the prefusion form and its postfusion form facilitates the viral envelope and the host cell membrane to fuse, enabling the virus to enter the host cell. Understanding the entry mechanism employed by RSV is crucial for developing effective antiviral therapies. In this review, we will discuss the various types of viral fusion proteins and explore the potential entry mechanisms utilized by RSV. A deeper understanding of these mechanisms will provide valuable insights for the development of novel approaches to treat RSV infections.",,,Molecular Microbiology,,,"Infant, Newborn; Humans; Aged; Antibodies, Neutralizing; Respiratory Syncytial Virus, Human; Respiratory Syncytial Virus Infections; Viral Fusion Proteins",2023-08-03,2023,2023-08-03,2023-09,120,3,341-350,All OA; Bronze,Article,"Cadena‐Cruz, C.; Camacho, J.

The aim of this study was to assess the environmental risk of recurrent PHS on mangrove ecosystems in Tumaco municipality, Colombian Pacific. Mangrove characteristics and management aspects led to subdividing the study area into 11 units-of-analysis (UAs) for which threats, vulnerability, potential impacts, and risks were assessed based on environmental factors and the formulation and use of indicators in a rating scale with five categories, which are very low, low, moderate, high, and very high. The results showed that all UAs are highly (64%; 15,525 ha) or moderately (36%; 4,464 ha) threatened by PHS, highly (45%; 13,478 ha) or moderately (55%; 6,511 ha) vulnerable to this kind of pollution, and susceptible to high (73%; 17,075 ha) or moderate (27%; 2,914 ha) potential impacts. The environmental risk was high in 73% (17,075 ha) of the UAs, indicating likely irreversible damage to mangrove ecosystems by PHS, thus pointing to the need of urgent intervention by responsible authorities to ease their recovery and conservation. The methodology and results of this study become technical inputs that serve for environmental control and monitoring, which can be incorporated into contingency and risk management plans.","This work was carried out within the framework of the project Implementation of actions that contribute to the ecological rehabilitation of areas affected by hydrocarbons in the coastal zone and foothills of the department of Nariño, financed by the Colombian Environment Ministry, INVEMAR, University of Valle and CORPONARIÑO.

Here we observe a spontaneous anomalous Hall signal in the absence of an external magnetic field in an epitaxial film of MnTe, which is a semiconductor with a collinear antiparallel magnetic ordering of Mn moments and a vanishing net magnetization. The anomalous Hall effect arises from an unconventional phase with strong time-reversal symmetry breaking and alternating spin polarization in real-space crystal structure and momentum-space electronic structure. The anisotropic crystal environment of magnetic Mn atoms due to the nonmagnetic Te atoms is essential for establishing the unconventional phase and generating the anomalous Hall effect.","We acknowledge M.

CCM exhibits distinct myocardial involvement and is associated with a poorer prognosis compared to different HF etiologies. The aim is to explain the features and prognosis of individuals with HF resultant to CCM registered in the Colombian Registry of Heart Failure (RECOLFACA). RECOLFACA registry enrolled 2528 adult patients with HF. A comparison was made between patients diagnosed with CCM and those diagnosed with other etiologies of HF. Eighty-eight patients (3.5%) present CCM diagnosis. The individuals diagnosed with both HF and CCM were notably younger in age, had less comorbidities, poorer functional class, and significantly inferior ejection fraction. Finally, the presence of CCM diagnosis was linked to a substantially elevated mortality risk throughout the follow-up period (HR 2.01; 95% CI, 1.01-4.00) according to a multivariate model adjusted. CCM represents an important etiology of HF in Colombia, drawing attention to a distinct clinical profile and a higher risk of mortality compared to other HF etiologies.","Declaration of Competing Interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

It is a respiratory infection with multiple repercussions on people's lives at an individual and social level, as well as representing a significant burden on the health system. This Consensus Document arises from the collaboration of various Spanish scientific societies involved in influenza virus infection. The conclusions drawn are based on the highest quality evidence available in the scientific literature and, failing that, on the opinion of the experts convened. The Consensus Document addresses the clinical, microbiological, therapeutic, and preventive aspects (with respect to the prevention of transmission and in relation to vaccination) of influenza, for both adult and pediatric populations. This Consensus Document aims to help facilitate the clinical, microbiological, and preventive approach to influenza virus infection and, consequently, to reduce its important consequences on the morbidity and mortality of the population.","We would like to thank the Executive Committee of the Spanish Society for Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (SEIMC) for trusting us to develop this Consensus Statement (especially José Ramón Blanco and Antonio Aguilera). We are particularly grateful to Carlota Gudiol, Mª Nieves Larrosa, Manuel Crespo, and Juan Carlos Rodríguez Díaz (former members of the Executive Committee of SEIMC). We also acknowledge the enthusiastic welcome to SEIMC&#x27;s proposal of the other Scientific Societies involved in drawing up the document.

The second COVID-19 Vaccination in Autoimmune Diseases (COVAD-2) survey is a multinational cross-sectional electronic survey which has collected data on patients suffering from various autoimmune diseases including T1DM. We performed a subgroup analysis on this cohort to investigate COVID-19 BI characteristics in patients with T1DM. Logistic regression with propensity score matching analysis was performed. A total of 9595 individuals were included in the analysis, with 100 patients having T1DM. Among the fully vaccinated cohort, 16 (16%) T1DM patients had one BI and 2 (2%) had two BIs. No morbidities or deaths were reported, except for one patient who required hospitalization with oxygen without admission to intensive care. The frequency, clinical features, and severity of BIs were not significantly different between T1DM patients and HCs after adjustment for confounding factors. Our study did not show any statistically significant differences in the frequency, symptoms, duration, or critical care requirements between T1DM and HCs after COVID-19 vaccination. Further research is needed to identify factors associated with inadequate vaccine response in patients with BIs, especially in patients with autoimmune diseases.","The authors are grateful to all respondents for completing the questionnaire.

Although the FAS has been widely used in diverse linguistic contexts, it has not been previously translated into Spanish. Here, we examined the psychometric properties of a novel Spanish translation of the FAS in Colombian adults. A total of 1420 university students from Colombia (804 women, 616 men) completed the FAS, as well as additional validated measures. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses in separate subsamples supported a unidimensional model of FAS scores. The FAS evidenced scalar invariance across gender identity, with men having significantly higher FAS scores than women (Cohen's d = 0.18). FAS scores were also found to have adequate composite reliability, as well as adequate convergent (significant associations with body appreciation, appearance evaluation, and eating disorder psychopathology) and concurrent validity (significant associations with self-esteem, life satisfaction, and gratitude). Functionality appreciation incrementally predicted life satisfaction in women, but not in men.

Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is one of the leading causes of death and disability in the world. The majority of diabetes deaths (> 80%) occur in low- and middle-income countries, which are predominant in Latin America. Therefore, the purpose of this article is to compare the clinical practice guideline (CPG) for the pharmacological management of T2DM in Latin America (LA) with international reference guidelines.Recent FindingsSeveral LA countries have recently developed CPGs. However, the quality of these guidelines is unknown according to the AGREE II tool and taking as reference three CPGs of international impact: American Diabetes Association (ADA), European Diabetes Association (EASD), and Latin American Diabetes Association (ALAD).SummaryTen CPGs were selected for analysis. The ADA scored > 80% on the AGREE II domains and was selected as the main comparator. Eighty percent of LA CPGs were developed before 2018. Only one was not recommended (all domains < 60%). The CPGs in LA have good quality but are outdated. They have significant gaps compared to the reference. There is a need for improvement, as proposing updates every three years to maintain the best available clinical evidence in all guidelines.",,This research was funded by SANOFI and was developed by Sapyens SAS BIC.,Current Diabetes Reports,,,"Humans; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Latin America; Dinucleoside Phosphates",2023-05-01,2023,2023-05-01,2023-06,23,6,89-101,All OA; Hybrid,Article,"Taborda Restrepo, Paula Andrea; Acosta-Reyes, Jorge; Estupiñan-Bohorquez, Andrés; Barrios-Mercado, María Alejandra; Correa Gonzalez, Nestor Fabián; Taborda Restrepo, Alejandra; Barengo, Noël C.; Gabriel, Rafael","Taborda Restrepo, Paula Andrea (Sapyens SAS BIC, Bogotá, Colombia); Acosta-Reyes, Jorge (Departamento de Salud Pública, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); Estupiñan-Bohorquez, Andrés (Departamento de Salud Pública, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); Barrios-Mercado, María Alejandra (Sapyens SAS BIC, Bogotá, Colombia; Departamento de Salud Pública, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); Correa Gonzalez, Nestor Fabián (Hospital Universitario San Ignacio, Bogotá, Colombia); Taborda Restrepo, Alejandra (Sapyens SAS BIC, Bogotá, Colombia); Barengo, Noël C.

During coal mining activities, many compounds are released into the environment that can negatively impact human health. Particulate matter, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), metals, and oxides are part of the complex mixture that can affect nearby populations. Therefore, we designed this study to evaluate the potential cytotoxic and genotoxic effects in individuals chronically exposed to coal residues from peripheral blood lymphocytes and buccal cells. We recruited 150 individuals who lived more than 20 years in La Loma-Colombia and 120 control individuals from the city of Barranquilla without a history of exposure to coal mining. In the cytokinesis-block micronucleus cytome (CBMN-Cyt) assay, significant differences in the frequency of micronucleus (MN), nucleoplasmic bridge (NPB), nuclear bud (NBUD), and apoptotic cells (APOP) were observed between the two groups. In the buccal micronucleus cytome (BM-Cyt) assay, a significant formation of NBUD, karyorrhexis (KRX), karyolysis (KRL), condensed chromatin (CC), and binucleated (BN) cells was observed in the exposed group. Considering the characteristics of the study group, a significant correlation for CBMN-Cyt was found between NBUD and vitamin consumption, between MN or APOP and meat consumption, and between MN and age. Moreover, a significant correlation for BM-Cyt was found between KRL and vitamin consumption or age, and BN versus alcohol consumption. Using Raman spectroscopy, a significant increase in the concentration of DNA/RNA bases, creatinine, polysaccharides, and fatty acids was detected in the urine of individuals exposed to coal mining compared to the control group. These results contribute to the discussion on the effects of coal mining on nearby populations and the development of diseases due to chronic exposure to these residues.","The authors thank the population from La Loma-Cesar, Colombia, for their disposition during sampling.

Yet, empirical data on most biotic factors are lacking. Nest predation is thought to be especially important because it appears to be common and can change selective pressures underlying life history traits, which can alter competitive interactions. We monitored 2538 nests, 338 of which had known nest predators, to evaluate if nest predation changes along a tropical elevational gradient. We found that nest predation decreased with elevation, reflecting the loss of lowland predators that do not tolerate colder climates. We found different ""super"" nest predators at each elevation that accounted for a high percentage of events, suggesting that selection pressures exerted by nest predator communities may be less diffuse than has been hypothesized, at least for birds nesting in the understory.","ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS More than 130 field and laboratory assistants were essential in obtaining the data used in this paper.

This evidence-based guideline from the Colombian Association of Digestive Endoscopy (ACED) intends to support patients, clinicians, and others in decisions about using in adults the SOC compared to endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP), to diagnose indeterminate biliary stricture and to manage difficult biliary stones.MethodsACED created a multidisciplinary guideline panel balanced to minimize potential bias from conflicts of interest. Universidad de los Andes and the Colombia Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) Network supported the guideline-development process, updating and performing systematic evidence reviews. The panel prioritized clinical questions and outcomes according to their importance for clinicians and patients. The GRADE approach was used, including GRADE Evidence-to-Decision frameworks.ResultsThe panel agreed on one recommendation for adult patients with indeterminate biliary strictures and one for adult patients with difficult biliary stones when comparing SOC versus ERCP.ConclusionFor adult patients with indeterminate biliary strictures, the panel made a conditional recommendation for SOC with stricture pattern characterization over ERCP with brushing and/or biopsy for sensitivity, specificity, and procedure success rate outcomes. For the adult patients with difficult biliary stones the panel made conditional recommendation for SOC over ERCP with large-balloon dilation of papilla.

This study aimed to assess the oxidative potential of residual coal mining dust on human lymphocyte DNA and telomeres and to perform a chemical characterization of coal dust and urine samples. The study included 150 individuals exposed to coal dust for over ten years, along with 120 control individuals. The results revealed significantly higher levels of DNA damage in the exposed group, as indicated by the standard comet assay, and oxidative damage, as determined by the FPG-modified comet assay. Moreover, the exposed individuals exhibited significantly shorter telomeres compared to the control group, and a significant correlation was found between telomere length and oxidative DNA damage. Using the PIXE method on urine samples, significantly higher concentrations of sodium (Na), phosphorus (P), sulfur (S), chlorine (Cl), potassium (K), iron (Fe), zinc (Zn), and bromine (Br) were observed in the exposed group compared to the control group. Furthermore, men showed shorter telomeres, greater DNA damage, and higher concentrations of nickel (Ni), calcium (Ca), and chromium (Cr) compared to exposed women. Additionally, the study characterized the particles released into the environment through GC–MS analysis, identifying several compounds, including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) such as fluoranthene, naphthalene, anthracene, 7H-benzo[c]fluorene, phenanthrene, pyrene, benz[a]anthracene, chrysene, and some alkyl derivatives.

However, the estimates of long-term exposure to air pollution are scarce in the region. We developed intraurban land use regression (LUR) models to map long-term exposure to fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) in the five largest cities in Colombia. We conducted air pollution measurement campaigns using gravimetric PM2.5 and passive NO2 sensors for 2 weeks during both the dry and rainy seasons in 2021 in the cities of Barranquilla, Bucaramanga, Bogotá, Cali, and Medellín, and combined these data with geospatial and meteorological variables. Annual models were developed using multivariable spatial regression models. The city annual PM2.5 mean concentrations measured ranged between 12.32 and 15.99 µg/m3 while NO2 concentrations ranged between 24.92 and 49.15 µg/m3. The PM2.5 annual models explained 82% of the variance (R2) in Medellín, 77% in Bucaramanga, 73% in Barranquilla, 70% in Cali, and 44% in Bogotá. The NO2 models explained 65% of the variance in Bucaramanga, 57% in Medellín, 44% in Cali, 40% in Bogotá, and 30% in Barranquilla. Most of the predictor variables included in the models were a combination of specific land use characteristics and roadway variables. Cross-validation suggests that PM2.5 outperformed NO2 models. The developed models can be used as exposure estimate in epidemiological studies, as input in hybrid models to improve personal exposure assessment, and for policy evaluation.","The authors thank Oscar Jiménez, Hermes Betancur, Jefferson Fernánez, Angie Rojas, Paola Barbosa, Kelly Burbano, Ronald Correa, Daniela Ortiz, Martha Mendoza, Wilmer Urango, Luz Obando, and Orlando Guaduña for their contributions during the monitoring field work in the cities.","Open Access funding provided by Colombia Consortium This research was funded by the Ministry of Science and Technology MINCIENCIAS in Colombia, grant number 905–2019.",Environmental Science and Pollution Research,,,Air Pollutants; Cities; Nitrogen Dioxide; Colombia; Environmental Monitoring; Air Pollution; Particulate Matter; Environmental Exposure,2023-12-12,2023,2023-12-12,2024-01,31,2,3207-3221,All OA; Hybrid,Article,"Rodriguez-Villamizar, Laura A.; Rojas, Yurley; Grisales, Sara; Mangones, Sonia C.; Cáceres, Jhon J.; Agudelo-Castañeda, Dayana M.; Herrera, Víctor; Marín, Diana; Jiménez, Juan G.

This study examined the presence of three repositioned drugs used for COVID-19 treatment: azithromycin (AZI), ivermectin (IVE) and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) in water samples collected from three urban rivers in Curitiba, Brazil, during August and September 2020. We conducted a risk assessment and evaluated the individual (0, 2, 4, 20, 100 and 200 μg.L-1) and combined (mix of the drugs at 2 μg.L-1) effects of the antimicrobials on the cyanobacterium Synechococcus elongatus and microalga Chlorella vulgaris. The liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry results showed that AZI and IVE were present in all collected samples, while HCQ occurred in 78 % of them. In all the studied sites, the concentrations found of AZI (up to 2.85 μg.L-1) and HCQ (up to 2.97 μg.L-1) represent environmental risks for the studied species, while IVE (up to 3.2 μg.L-1) was a risk only for Chlorella vulgaris. The hazard quotients (HQ) indices demonstrated that the microalga was less sensitive to the drugs than the cyanobacteria. HCQ and IVE had the highest values of HQ for the cyanobacteria and microalga, respectively, being the most toxic drugs for each species. Interactive effects of drugs were observed on growth, photosynthesis and antioxidant activity. The treatment with AZI + IVE resulted in cyanobacteria death, while exposure to the mixture of all three drugs led to decreased growth and photosynthesis in the cells. On the other hand, no effect on growth was observed for C. vulgaris, although photosynthesis has been negatively affected by all treatments. The use of AZI, IVE and HCQ for COVID-19 treatment may have generated surface water contamination, which could increased their potential ecotoxicological effects. This raises the need to further investigation into their effects on aquatic ecosystems.",Declaration of competing interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.,"This research was financed in part by the Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior - Brazil (CAPES) - Finance Code 001 and by the Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico (CNPq, Brazil) through a strategic grant “REDES—Remediation of the Rio Doce Basin: potential of the aquatic and terrestrial biota” (Grant number 88881.118082/2016-01) and Contaminação dos sistemas lóticos e produtos alimentares por antimicrobianos: da aquisição à prevenção da resistência em microrganismos (Grant number 406190/2018-6) awarded to MG, and the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (Grant number RGPIN-2017-06210) awarded to PJ.

We studied delayed-onset vaccine adverse events (AEs) in patients with IIMs, other systemic autoimmune and inflammatory disorders (SAIDs), and healthy controls (HCs), using data from the second COVID-19 Vaccination in Autoimmune Diseases (COVAD) study. A validated self-reporting e-survey was circulated by the COVAD study group (157 collaborators, 106 countries) from Feb–June 2022. We collected data on demographics, comorbidities, IIM/SAID details, COVID-19 history, and vaccination details. Delayed-onset (> 7 day) AEs were analyzed using regression models. A total of 15165 respondents undertook the survey, of whom 8759 responses from vaccinated individuals [median age 46 (35–58) years, 74.4% females, 45.4% Caucasians] were analyzed. Of these, 1390 (15.9%) had IIMs, 50.6% other SAIDs, and 33.5% HCs. Among IIMs, 16.3% and 10.2% patients reported minor and major AEs, respectively, and 0.72% (n = 10) required hospitalization. Notably patients with IIMs experienced fewer minor AEs than other SAIDs, though rashes were expectedly more than HCs [OR 4.0; 95% CI 2.2–7.0, p < 0.001]. IIM patients with active disease, overlap myositis, autoimmune comorbidities, and ChadOx1 nCOV-19 (Oxford/AstraZeneca) recipients reported AEs more often, while those with inclusion body myositis, and BNT162b2 (Pfizer) recipients reported fewer AEs. Vaccination is reassuringly safe in individuals with IIMs, with AEs, hospitalizations comparable to SAIDs, and largely limited to those with autoimmune multimorbidity and active disease. These observations may inform guidelines to identify high-risk patients warranting close monitoring in the post-vaccination period.","The authors are grateful to all respondents for completing the questionnaire.

5720,pub.1156457559,10.1093/rheumatology/kead144,36961331,,Flares in autoimmune rheumatic diseases in the post-COVID-19 vaccination period—a cross-sequential study based on COVAD surveys,"OBJECTIVE: Flares of autoimmune rheumatic diseases (AIRDs) following COVID-19 vaccination are a particular concern in vaccine-hesitant individuals. Therefore, we investigated the incidence, predictors and patterns of flares following vaccination in individuals living with AIRDs, using global COVID-19 Vaccination in Autoimmune Diseases (COVAD) surveys.
METHODS: The COVAD surveys were used to extract data on flare demographics, comorbidities, COVID-19 history, and vaccination details for patients with AIRDs. Flares following vaccination were identified as patient-reported (a), increased immunosuppression (b), clinical exacerbations (c) and worsening of PROMIS scores (d). We studied flare characteristics and used regression models to differentiate flares among various AIRDs.
RESULTS: Of 15 165 total responses, the incidence of flares in 3453 patients with AIRDs was 11.3%, 14.8%, 9.5% and 26.7% by definitions a-d, respectively. There was moderate agreement between patient-reported and immunosuppression-defined flares (K = 0.403, P = 0.022). Arthritis (61.6%) and fatigue (58.8%) were the most commonly reported symptoms. Self-reported flares were associated with higher comorbidities (P = 0.013), mental health disorders (MHDs) (P < 0.001) and autoimmune disease multimorbidity (AIDm) (P < 0.001).In regression analysis, the presence of AIDm [odds ratio (OR) = 1.4; 95% CI: 1.1, 1.7; P = 0.003), or a MHD (OR = 1.7; 95% CI: 1.1, 2.6; P = 0.007), or being a Moderna vaccine recipient (OR = 1.5; 95% CI: 1.09, 2.2; P = 0.014) were predictors of flares. Use of MMF (OR = 0.5; 95% CI: 0.3, 0.8; P = 0.009) and glucocorticoids (OR = 0.6; 95% CI: 0.5, 0.8; P = 0.003) were protective.A higher frequency of patients with AIRDs reported overall active disease post-vaccination compared with before vaccination (OR = 1.3; 95% CI: 1.1, 1.5; P < 0.001).
CONCLUSION: Flares occur in nearly 1 in 10 individuals with AIRDs after COVID vaccination; people with comorbidities (especially AIDm), MHDs and those receiving the Moderna vaccine are particularly vulnerable. Future avenues include exploring flare profiles and optimizing vaccine strategies for this group.","The authors are grateful to all respondents for completing the questionnaire.

Therefore, we studied the prevalence, predictors and reasons for hesitancy in patients with IIMs, other AIRDs, non-rheumatic autoimmune diseases (nrAIDs) and healthy controls (HCs), using data from the two international COVID-19 Vaccination in Autoimmune Diseases (COVAD) e-surveys.
METHODS: The first and second COVAD patient self-reported e-surveys were circulated from March to December 2021, and February to June 2022 (ongoing). We collected data on demographics, comorbidities, COVID-19 infection and vaccination history, reasons for hesitancy, and patient reported outcomes. Predictors of hesitancy were analysed using regression models in different groups.
RESULTS: We analysed data from 18 882 (COVAD-1) and 7666 (COVAD-2) respondents. Reassuringly, hesitancy decreased from 2021 (16.5%) to 2022 (5.1%) (OR: 0.26; 95% CI: 0.24, 0.30, P < 0.001). However, concerns/fear over long-term safety had increased (OR: 3.6; 95% CI: 2.9, 4.6, P < 0.01). We noted with concern greater skepticism over vaccine science among patients with IIMs than AIRDs (OR: 1.8; 95% CI: 1.08, 3.2, P = 0.023) and HCs (OR: 4; 95% CI: 1.9, 8.1, P < 0.001), as well as more long-term safety concerns/fear (IIMs vs AIRDs - OR: 1.9; 95% CI: 1.2, 2.9, P = 0.001; IIMs vs HCs - OR: 5.4 95% CI: 3, 9.6, P < 0.001). Caucasians [OR 4.2 (1.7-10.3)] were likely to be more hesitant, while those with better PROMIS physical health score were less hesitant [OR 0.9 (0.8-0.97)].
CONCLUSION: Vaccine hesitancy has decreased from 2021 to 2022, long-term safety concerns remain among patients with IIMs, particularly in Caucasians and those with poor physical function.","COVAD Study Group Authors: Sinan Kardes, Laura Andreoli, Daniele Lini, Karen Screiber, Melinda Nagy Vince, Yogesh Preet Singh, Rajiv Ranjan, Avinash Jain, Sapan C Pandya, Rakesh Kumar Pilania, Aman Sharma, Manesh Manoj M, Vikas Gupta, Chengappa G Kavadichanda, Pradeepta Sekhar Patro, Sajal Ajmani, Sanat Phatak, Rudra Prosad Goswami, Abhra Chandra Chowdhury, Ashish Jacob Mathew, Padnamabha Shenoy, Ajay Asranna, Keerthi Talari Bommakanti, Anuj Shukla, Arunkumar R Pande, Kunal Chandwar, Akanksha Ghodke, Hiya Boro, Zoha Zahid Fazal, Döndü Üsküdar Cansu, Reşit Yıldırım, Armen Yuri Gasparyan, Nicoletta Del Papa, Gianluca Sambataro, Atzeni Fabiola, Marcello Govoni, Simone Parisi, Elena Bartoloni Bocci, Gian Domenico Sebastiani, Enrico Fusaro, Marco Sebastiani, Luca Quartuccio, Franco Franceschini, Pier Paolo Sainaghi, Giovanni Orsolini, Rossella De Angelis, Maria Giovanna Danielli, Vincenzo Venerito, Silvia Grignaschi, Alessandro Giollo, Alessia Alluno, Florenzo Ioannone, Marco Fornaro, Lisa S Traboco, Suryo Anggoro Kusumo Wibowo, Jesús Loarce-Martos, Sergio Prieto-González, Raquel Aranega Gonzalez, Akira Yoshida, Ran Nakashima, Shinji Sato, Naoki Kimura, Yuko Kaneko, Takahisa Gono, Stylianos Tomaras, Fabian Nikolai Proft, Marie-Therese Holzer, Margarita Aleksandrovna Gromova, Or Aharonov, Zoltán Griger, Ihsane Hmamouchi, Imane El bouchti, Zineb Baba, Margherita Giannini, François Maurier, Julien Campagne, Alain Meyer, Daman Langguth, Vidya Limaye, Merrilee Needham, Nilesh Srivastav, Marie Hudson, Océane Landon-Cardinal, Wilmer Gerardo Rojas Zuleta, Álvaro Arbeláez, Javier Cajas, José António Pereira Silva, João Eurico Fonseca, Olena Zimba, Doskaliuk Bohdana, Uyi Ima-Edomwonyi, Ibukunoluwa Dedeke, Emorinken Airenakho, Nwankwo Henry Madu, Abubakar Yerima, Hakeem Olaosebikan, Becky A., Oruma Devi Koussougbo, Elisa Palalane, Ho So, Manuel Francisco Ugarte-Gil, Lyn Chinchay, José Proaño Bernaola, Victorio Pimentel, Hanan Mohammed Fathi, Reem Hamdy A Mohammed, Ghita Harifi, Yurilís Fuentes-Silva, Karoll Cabriza, Jonathan Losanto, Nelly Colaman, Antonio Cachafeiro-Vilar, Generoso Guerra Bautista, Enrique Julio Giraldo Ho, Raúl González, Lilith Stange Nunez, Cristian Vergara M, Jossiell Then Báez, Hugo Alonzo, Carlos Benito Santiago Pastelin, Rodrigo García Salinas, Alejandro Quiñónez Obiols, Nilmo Chávez, Andrea Bran Ordóñez, Sandra Argueta, Gil Alberto Reyes Llerena, Radames Sierra-Zorita, Dina Arrieta, Eduardo Romero Hidalgo, Ricardo Saenz, Idania Escalante M, Roberto Morales, Wendy Calapaqui, Ivonne Quezada, Gabriela Arredondo.

We studied these flares among patients with idiopathic inflammatory myopathies (IIMs) and other autoimmune rheumatic diseases (AIRDs).
METHODS: The COVAD-1 and -2 global surveys were circulated in early 2021 and 2022, respectively, and we captured demographics, comorbidities, AIRDs details, COVID-19 infection history and vaccination details. Flares of IIMs were defined as (a) patient self-reported, (b) immunosuppression (IS) denoted, (c) clinical sign directed and (d) with >7.9-point minimal clinically significant improvement difference worsening of Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) PROMISPF10a score. Risk factors of flares were analysed using regression models.
RESULTS: Of 15 165 total respondents, 1278 IIMs (age 63 years, 70.3% female, 80.8% Caucasians) and 3453 AIRDs were included. Flares of IIM were seen in 9.6%, 12.7%, 8.7% and 19.6% patients by definitions (a) to (d), respectively, with a median time to flare of 71.5 (10.7-235) days, similar to AIRDs. Patients with active IIMs pre-vaccination (OR 1.2; 95% CI 1.03, 1.6, P = 0.025) were prone to flares, while those receiving rituximab (OR 0.3; 95% CI 0.1, 0.7, P = 0.010) and AZA (OR 0.3, 95% CI 0.1, 0.8, P = 0.016) were at lower risk. Female gender and comorbidities predisposed to flares requiring changes in IS. Asthma (OR 1.62; 95% CI 1.05, 2.50, P = 0.028) and higher pain visual analogue score (OR 1.19; 95% CI 1.11, 1.27, P < 0.001) were associated with disparity between self-reported and IS-denoted flares.
CONCLUSION: A diagnosis of IIMs confers an equal risk of flares in the post-COVID-19 vaccination period to AIRDs, with active disease, female gender and comorbidities conferring a higher risk. Disparity between patient- and physician-reported outcomes represents a future avenue for exploration.","Disclaimer: no part of this manuscript has been copied or published elsewhere either in whole or in part.

The present study examined associations among attitudes toward sugar relationships and relevant variables (e.g., sex, sociosexuality, gender inequality, parasitic exposure) in 69,924 participants across 87 countries. Two self-report measures of Acceptance of Sugar Relationships (ASR) developed for younger companion providers (ASR-YWMS) and older resource providers (ASR-OMWS) were translated into 37 languages. We tested cross-sex and cross-linguistic construct equivalence, cross-cultural invariance in sex differences, and the importance of the hypothetical predictors of ASR. Both measures showed adequate psychometric properties in all languages (except the Persian version of ASR-YWMS). Results partially supported our hypotheses and were consistent with previous theoretical considerations and empirical evidence on human mating. For example, at the individual level, sociosexual orientation, traditional gender roles, and pathogen prevalence were significant predictors of both ASR-YWMS and ASR-OMWS. At the country level, gender inequality and parasite stress positively predicted the ASR-YWMS. However, being a woman negatively predicted the ASR-OMWS, but positively predicted the ASR-YWMS. At country-level, ingroup favoritism and parasite stress positively predicted the ASR-OMWS. Furthermore, significant cross-subregional differences were found in the openness to sugar relationships (both ASR-YWMS and ASR-OMWS scores) across subregions. Finally, significant differences were found between ASR-YWMS and ASR-OMWS when compared in each subregion. The ASR-YWMS was significantly higher than the ASR-OMWS in all subregions, except for Northern Africa and Western Asia.",The authors are thankful to Mikhail Kozlov for his comments on the previous drafts of this manuscript.,"Open access funding provided by University of Pécs.

To this end, drastic changes in the trip choices for commuting to work have been reported and studied, mostly through descriptive analysis. On the other hand, modeling-based research that can simultaneously understand both changes in mode choice and its frequency at an individual level has not been much used in existing studies. As such, this study aims to understand the changes in mode-choice preference and the frequency of trips, comparing pre-COVID with during-COVID scenarios, in two different countries of the Global South: Colombia and India. A hybrid multiple discrete-continuous nested extreme value model was implemented using the data obtained from online surveys in Colombia and India during the early COVID-19 period of March and April 2020. This study found that, in both countries, utility related to active modes (more used) and public transportation (less used) changed during the pandemic. In addition, this study highlights potential risks in likely unsustainable futures where there may be increased use of private vehicles such as cars and motorcycles, in both countries. It was also identified that perceptions toward government responses had a significant impact on the choices in Colombia, though this was not the case in India. These results may help decision makers focus on public policies to encourage sustainable transportation by avoiding the detrimental long-term behavioral changes resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic.",,"Funding The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: The authors acknowledge the financial support from the Scheme for Promotion of Academic and Research Collaboration (SPARC), MHRD, Govt. of India, and the UK-India Education and Research Initiative (UKIERI).

Depending on the scale and mineral extracted, complex chemical mixtures are generated, impacting the health of occupationally exposed populations and communities near mining projects. Increasing evidence suggests that chromosomal instability (CIN) is an important link between the development of certain diseases and exposure to complex mixtures. To better understand the effects of exposure to complex mixtures we performed a biomonitoring study on 407 healthy individuals from four areas: three located in municipalities exploiting different-scale mining systems and a reference area with no mining activity. Large, medium, and small-scale mining systems were analyzed in Montelibano (Córdoba), artisanal and small-scale mining (ASGM) in Nechí (Antioquia), and a closed mining system in Aranzazu (Caldas). The reference area with no mining activity was established in Montería (Córdoba). ICP-MS measured multi-elemental exposure in hair, and CIN was evaluated using the cytokinesis-block micronucleus technique (MNBN). Exposure to mixtures of chemical elements was comparable in workers and residents of the mining areas but significantly higher compared to reference individuals. In Montelibano, increased MNBN frequencies were associated with combined exposure to Se, Hg, Mn, Pb, and Mg. This distinct pattern significantly differed from other areas. Specifically, in Nechí, Cr, Ni, Hg, Se, and Mg emerged as the primary contributors to elevated frequencies of MNBN. In contrast, a combination of Hg and Ni played a role in increasing MNBN in Aranzazu. Interestingly, Se consistently correlated with increased MNBN frequencies across all active mining areas. Chemical elements in Montelibano exhibit a broader range compared to other mining zones, reflecting the characteristics of the high-impact and large-scale mining in the area. This research provides valuable insights into the effects of exposure to chemical mixtures, underscoring the importance of employing this approach in the risk assessment of communities, especially those from residential areas.","Declaration of competing interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

Utilizing samples from 1,705 individuals in 5 countries, we examined putative determinants of immunity, including: single nucleotide polymorphisms, ancestry informative markers, herpesvirus status, age, and sex. In healthy subjects, we found significant differences in cytokine levels, leukocyte phenotypes, and gene expression. Transcriptional responses also varied by cohort, and the most significant determinant was ancestry. In influenza infected subjects, we found two disease severity immunophenotypes, largely driven by age. Additionally, cytokine regression models show each determinant differentially contributes to acute immune variation, with unique and interactive, location-specific herpesvirus effects. These results provide novel insight into the scope of immune heterogeneity across diverse populations, the integrative effects of factors which drive it, and the consequences for illness outcomes.","We thank the participants and clinical study support staff in each of the cohorts; Emily Walker and the Hartwell Center for processing Infinium Global Screening Array-24 v3.0 chips; Jessica Gaevert for technical assistance with RNA extractions; and ALSAC (American Lebanese Syrian Associated Charities).

DATA SOURCES: Empirical and theoretical literature studies were reviewed to define the framework rationale and its components.
DATA SYNTHESIS: A deductive/inductive collaborative expert-informed approach was undertaken to develop this evidence-based codesigned framework. Its mission, along with unique components, implementation strategies, and outcomes, were successively integrated into the framework to guide nursing knowledge, learning, and curriculum development. A hermeneutic collaborative process of circular reflection was used in the development process.
CONCLUSIONS: The NEF contains central guiding principles and concepts that are intended to provide structural consistency across its included programs from a humanistic person/family-centered approach.
IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING PRACTICE: This comprehensive theory-guided framework allows educators to suggest specific directions for nursing practice within the nursing discipline and articulate nursing's unique and specialized approach to promoting excellent patient care outcomes. It can assist students to develop critical lens from a person/family-centered relationship-based practice approach.",ACKNOWLEDGMENTS We sincerely thank Prof. Maribel Saracíbar‐Rázquin for useful comments and suggestions.

To better understand this relationship in preclinical AD, we examined hippocampal volume and depressive symptoms in cognitively unimpaired carriers of the presenilin-1 (PSEN1) E280A mutation for autosomal dominant AD.
METHODS: A total of 27 PSEN1 mutation carriers and 26 non-carrier family members were included. Linear regression was used to test the relationship between hippocampal volume and 15-item Geriatric Depression Scale.
RESULTS: Carriers and non-carriers did not differ in depressive symptoms or hippocampal volume. Within carriers, lower hippocampal volume was associated with greater depressive symptoms, which remained significant after adjusting for age and cognition. This relationship was not significant in non-carriers.
DISCUSSION: Hippocampal neurodegeneration may underlie depressive symptoms in preclinical autosomal dominant AD. These findings provide support for the utility of targeting depressive symptoms in AD prevention.
HIGHLIGHTS: We compared unimpaired autosomal dominant Alzheimer's disease (AD) mutation carriers and non-carriers. Carriers and non-carriers did not differ in severity of depressive symptoms. In carriers, hippocampal volume was inversely associated with depressive symptoms. Depressive symptoms may be a useful target in AD prevention.","ACKNOWLEDGMENTS The authors thank the PSEN1 Colombian families for contributing their valuable time and effort, without which this study would not have been possible.

Initially, the isolates were evaluated in a screening for the production of colorants. The influences of cultivation and nutritional conditions on the production of colorants by fungal isolates were investigated. The colorants produced by selected fungal isolates were chemically characterized using the Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry technique. The antimicrobial and cytotoxic activities, stability evaluation and applicability of the colorants were investigated. As results, we observed that the isolates Penicillium sclerotiorum P3SO224, Clonostachys rosea P2SO329 and Penicillium gravinicasei P3SO332 stood out since they produced the most intense colorants. Compounds produced by Penicillium sclerotiorum P3SO224 and Clonostachys rosea P2SO329 were identified as sclerotiorin and penicillic acid. The colorant fraction (EtOAc) produced by these species has antimicrobial activity, stability at temperature and at different pHs, stability when exposure to light and UV, and when exposed to different concentrations of salts, as well as being nontoxic and having the ability to dye fabrics and be used as a pigment in creams and soap. Considering the results found in this study, it was concluded that fungi from the soil in the Amazon have the potential to produce colorants with applications in the textile and pharmaceutical industries.",ACKNOWLEDGMENTS We would like to thank Fundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado do Amazonas (FAPEAM) for the funding of the research by Luciana Aires de Oliveira under the Universal Call FAPEAM‐006/2019 and for the POSGRAD 2018 grant.

However, extant research concerning measurement invariance of the BAS-2 across a large number of nations remains limited. Here, we utilised the Body Image in Nature (BINS) dataset - with data collected between 2020 and 2022 - to assess measurement invariance of the BAS-2 across 65 nations, 40 languages, gender identities, and age groups. Multi-group confirmatory factor analysis indicated that full scalar invariance was upheld across all nations, languages, gender identities, and age groups, suggesting that the unidimensional BAS-2 model has widespread applicability. There were large differences across nations and languages in latent body appreciation, while differences across gender identities and age groups were negligible-to-small. Additionally, greater body appreciation was significantly associated with higher life satisfaction, being single (versus being married or in a committed relationship), and greater rurality (versus urbanicity). Across a subset of nations where nation-level data were available, greater body appreciation was also significantly associated with greater cultural distance from the United States and greater relative income inequality. These findings suggest that the BAS-2 likely captures a near-universal conceptualisation of the body appreciation construct, which should facilitate further cross-cultural research.",Declaration of Competing Interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.,,Body Image,,,"Humans;

However, the capabilities of these applications and how they can impact offending behavior is currently unknown.
METHOD: Two studies were conducted to understand which of these applications are being used by drivers and how these applications are impacting road rule violations. Study 1 consisted of a content analysis that involved searching the Google Play Store and Apple iTunes Store for applications that could be used to avoid road rule violations using pre-determined keywords. Meanwhile, Study 2 consisted of 468 licensed Australian drivers (54.5% males) over the age of 17 years (Mage = 35 years) who completed a survey.
RESULTS: A total of 73 applications were identified for Study 1, with most of the applications displaying speed camera locations. It was found that applications that notify drivers of traffic enforcement locations are widely prevalent, can be used on a variety of interfaces and include numerous additional features. Study 2 found that those who use the applications were more willing to speed than those who do not use the applications, while there was no difference in phone use while driving between those who do and do not use the applications.
PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: The findings have important implications for stakeholders, policy, and future research. For example, it is suggested that specific functions of these applications need to be regulated to reduce road rule violations and crash risk. Meanwhile, enforcement initiatives need to evolve at a faster rate to keep up to date with the changing technology that can undermine them.",Declaration of Competing Interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.,"This project was supported by the Motor Accident Insurance Commission (MAIC) Queensland.

It is characterized by a mutation of the PHEX gene which results in excess FGF23 production, with abnormal renal and intestinal phosphorus metabolism, hypophosphatemia and osteomalacia secondary to chronic renal excretion of phosphate. Clinical manifestations include hypophosphatemic rickets leading to growth abnormalities and osteomalacia, myopathy, bone pain and dental abscesses. The transition of these patients to adult life continues to pose challenges to health systems, medical practitioners, patients and families. For this reason, the aim of this consensus is to provide a set of recommendations to facilitate this process and ensure adequate management and follow-up, as well as the quality of life for patients with X-linked hypophosphatemia as they transition to adult life.Materials and MethodsEight Latin American experts on the subject participated in the consensus and two of them were appointed as coordinators. The consensus work was done in accordance with the nominal group technique in 6 phases: (1) question standardization, (2) definition of the maximum number of choices, (3) production of individual solutions or answers, (4) individual question review, (5) analysis and synthesis of the information and (6) synchronic meetings for clarification and voting. An agreement was determined to exist with 80% votes in favor in three voting cycles.Results and DiscussionTransition to adult life in patients with hypophosphatemia is a complex process that requires a comprehensive approach, taking into consideration medical interventions and associated care, but also the psychosocial components of adult life and the participation of multiple stakeholders to ensure a successful process. The consensus proposes a total of 33 recommendations based on the evidence and the knowledge and experience of the experts. The goal of the recommendations is to optimize the management of these patients during their transition to adulthood, bearing in mind the need for multidisciplinary management, as well as the most relevant medical and psychosocial factors in the region.",,Ultragenyx has funded the medical writing service for this article.

Most common causes are genetic variants in genes (GLRA1, GLRB) encoding inhibitory glycine receptor (GlyR) subunits. The adult GlyR is a heteropentameric complex composed of α1 and β subunits that localizes at postsynaptic sites and replaces embryonically expressed GlyRα2 homomers. The human GlyR variants of GLRA1 and GLRB, dominant and recessive, have been intensively studied in vitro. However, the role of unaffected GlyRβ, essential for synaptic GlyR localization, in the presence of mutated GlyRα1 in vivo is not fully understood. Here, we used knock-in mice expressing endogenous mEos4b-tagged GlyRβ that were crossed with mouse Glra1 startle disease mutants. We explored the role of GlyRβ under disease conditions in mice carrying a missense mutation (shaky) or resulting from the loss of GlyRα1 (oscillator). Interestingly, synaptic targeting of GlyRβ was largely unaffected in both mouse mutants. While synaptic morphology appears unaltered in shaky animals, synapses were notably smaller in homozygous oscillator animals. Hence, GlyRβ enables transport of functionally impaired GlyRα1 missense variants to synaptic sites in shaky animals, which has an impact on the efficacy of possible compensatory mechanisms. The observed enhanced GlyRα2 expression in oscillator animals points to a compensation by other GlyRα subunits. However, trafficking of GlyRα2β complexes to synaptic sites remains functionally insufficient, and homozygous oscillator mice still die at 3 weeks after birth. Thus, both functional and structural deficits can affect glycinergic neurotransmission in severe startle disease, eliciting different compensatory mechanisms in vivo.",,,Journal of Neuroscience,,,"Humans; Adult; Mice; Animals; Receptors, Glycine; Virulence; Spinal Cord; Glycine; Synaptic Transmission",2023-11-14,2023,2023-11-14,2024-01-10,44,2,e0837232023,All OA; Hybrid,Article,"Wiessler, Anna-Lena; Hasenmüller, Ann-Sofie; Fuhl, Isabell; Mille, Clémence; Campo, Orlando Cortes; Reinhard, Nicola; Schenk, Joachim; Heinze, Katrin G.; Schaefer, Natascha; Specht, Christian G.; Villmann, Carmen","Wiessler, Anna-Lena (Institute for Clinical Neurobiology, University Hospital, Julius-Maximilians-University of Würzburg, 97078 Würzburg, Germany); Hasenmüller, Ann-Sofie (Institute for Clinical Neurobiology, University Hospital, Julius-Maximilians-University of Würzburg, 97078 Würzburg, Germany); Fuhl, Isabell (Institute for Clinical Neurobiology, University Hospital, Julius-Maximilians-University of Würzburg, 97078 Würzburg, Germany); Mille, Clémence (Institut National de la Santé et de la Recherche Médicale (Inserm U1195), Université Paris-Saclay, 94276 Le Kremlin-Bicêtre, France); Campo, Orlando Cortes (Institute for Clinical Neurobiology, University Hospital, Julius-Maximilians-University of Würzburg, 97078 Würzburg, Germany); Reinhard, Nicola (Institute for Clinical Neurobiology, University Hospital, Julius-Maximilians-University of Würzburg, 97078 Würzburg, Germany); Schenk, Joachim (Rudolf Virchow Center for Integrative and Translational Bioimaging, Julius-Maximilians-University of Würzburg, 97080 Würzburg, Germany); Heinze, Katrin G.

The success of the integration of specific digital resources in research work can be affected by several factors, such as: digital skills for finding information, managing it, analyzing it, and communicating results; digital flow; anxiety in the use of ICT; digital ethics; quality of digital resources; and finally, the behavioral intention to integrate ICT. The purpose of this study is to examine the factors that influence the integration of ICT in the research process of the Higher Education teacher, and the relation between them. An online survey was used to collect data, and 1740 participants. This study used a causal model through partial least squares structural equations modeling (PLS-SEM). With this, the hypotheses established between the integration of ICT and its possible incident factors were verified. The findings revealed a significant influence path from factor integration to digital skills, ethics, flow digital, and behavior intention. Although, resource quality and ICT anxiety had significant effects on the causal model, they did not have a large impact on teachers’ integration of digital resources. The total of these factors corresponded to 48.20% of the variance in the integration of the researcher of the specific digital resources to be used in the research process. These results confirm that this model is effective in explaining the technological integration of teachers to use ICT in research work.","This scientific article is part of my doctoral thesis, attached to the Doctoral Program in Education of the Autonomous University of Madrid (UAM).",Not applicable.,Education and Information Technologies,,,,2023-05-15,2023,2023-05-15,2023-12,28,12,16509-16529,All OA; Hybrid,Article,"Guillén-Gámez, Francisco D.; Ruiz-Palmero, Julio; García, Melchor Gómez","Guillén-Gámez, Francisco D.

However, no previous systematic review and meta-analysis determined the proportion of disordered eating among children and adolescents.
Objective: To establish the proportion among children and adolescents of disordered eating as assessed with the SCOFF tool.
Data Sources: Four databases were systematically searched (PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library) with date limits from January 1999 to November 2022.
Study Selection: Studies were required to meet the following criteria: (1) participants: studies of community samples of children and adolescents aged 6 to 18 years and (2) outcome: disordered eating assessed by the SCOFF questionnaire. The exclusion criteria included (1) studies conducted with young people who had a diagnosis of physical or mental disorders; (2) studies that were published before 1999 because the SCOFF questionnaire was designed in that year; (3) studies in which data were collected during COVID-19 because they could introduce selection bias; (4) studies based on data from the same surveys/studies to avoid duplication; and (5) systematic reviews and/or meta-analyses and qualitative and case studies.
Data Extraction and Synthesis: A systematic review and meta-analysis was performed according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) reporting guideline.
Main Outcomes and Measures: Proportion of disordered eating among children and adolescents assessed with the SCOFF tool.
Results: Thirty-two studies, including 63 181 participants, from 16 countries were included in this systematic review and meta-analysis. The overall proportion of children and adolescents with disordered eating was 22.36% (95% CI, 18.84%-26.09%; P < .001; n = 63 181) (I2 = 98.58%). Girls were significantly more likely to report disordered eating (30.03%; 95% CI, 25.61%-34.65%; n = 27 548) than boys (16.98%; 95% CI, 13.46%-20.81%; n = 26 170) (P < .001). Disordered eating became more elevated with increasing age (B, 0.03; 95% CI, 0-0.06; P = .049) and body mass index (B, 0.03; 95% CI, 0.01-0.05; P < .001).
Conclusions and Relevance: In this systematic review and meta-analysis, the available evidence from 32 studies comprising large samples from 16 countries showed that 22% of children and adolescents showed disordered eating according to the SCOFF tool. Proportion of disordered eating was further elevated among girls, as well as with increasing age and body mass index. These high figures are concerning from a public health perspective and highlight the need to implement strategies for preventing eating disorders.",,,JAMA Pediatrics,,,Male; Female; Humans; Child; Adolescent; COVID-19; Surveys and Questionnaires; Body Mass Index; Feeding and Eating Disorders,2023-04-01,2023,2023-04-03,2023-04-01,177,4,363-372,All OA; Bronze,Article,"López-Gil, José Francisco; García-Hermoso, Antonio; Smith, Lee; Firth, Joseph; Trott, Mike; Mesas, Arthur Eumann; Jiménez-López, Estela; Gutiérrez-Espinoza, Héctor; Tárraga-López, Pedro J.; Victoria-Montesinos, Desirée","López-Gil, José Francisco (Health and Social Research Center, Universidad de Castilla-La Mancha, Cuenca, Spain; Department of Environmental Health, T.H.

Multiple studies have sought robust associations between BI and DHs to prevent unhealthy behaviors.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this systematic review was to examine the available literature on the association between BI perception (BIP) and/or satisfaction (BIS) and DHs in adolescents.
DATA SOURCES: A search was carried out of 5 electronic databases (PubMed, SciELO, Cochrane, Embase, and PsycInfo) using a combination of keywords (and synonyms) related to adolescence, BI, and diet.
DATA EXTRACTION: Data screening, extraction, and quality assessment were performed independently by 2 investigators using the PRISMA and AXIS guidelines.
DATA ANALYSIS: Of 2496 articles screened, 30 articles, published in English or Spanish, that evaluated the relationship between BI and DHs in adolescents aged between 10 years and 18 years, were included. A relationship between accurate BI perception in adolescents and healthy DHs was reported in 5 articles (16.2%). A relationship between overestimation of body weight in adolescents and healthy DHs was reported in 4 articles (13.3%). A relationship between underestimation of body weight and unhealthy DHs was reported in 8 articles (26.7%). In addition, 4 articles (13.3%) reported a relationship between BIS and healthy DHs. The desire to gain weight was associated with unhealthy DHs in 3 (10%) of the articles, while the desire to lose weight was related to healthy DHs in 3 (10%) of the articles and to unhealthy DHs in 3 (10%) other articles. There were also gender differences in the relationship between BIP or BIS and DHs.
CONCLUSION: Adolescents who underestimate their body weight tend to report less healthy DHs than body weight overestimators. Adolescents unsatisfied with their BI and with a drive for thinness frequently engage in DHs linked to losing weight.

3269,pub.1157108052,10.1111/jgs.18363,37029710,,Depression in older adults during the COVID‐19 pandemic: A systematic review,"BACKGROUND: Depression affected 5.7% of people aged 60 years and over prior to the pandemic and has increased by approximately 28%. The aim of this study is to identify and describe factors associated with depressive symptoms, the diagnostic assessment instruments and interventions used to evaluate and treat depression in adults aged 60 years and older since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic.
METHODS: Four electronic databases were systematically searched to identify eligible studies published since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. A total of 832 articles were screened, of which 53 met the inclusion criteria.
RESULTS: Factors contributing to depressive symptoms in older adults prior to the pandemic were grouped into the following categories: sociodemographic characteristics (i.e., being female); loneliness and weak social support; limitations in daily functioning, physical activity and neurocognitive impairment; and clinical factors. The following groups of factors directly related to the pandemic were found: stress-related factors and feelings or worries related to the pandemic; information access (e.g., receiving news about COVID-19 through the media); factors directly related to COVID-19 (e.g., having infected acquaintances); and factors related to the measures that were taken to reduce the spread of COVID-19 (e.g., confinement measures). The most frequently used instrument to assess depressive symptoms was the Geriatric Depression Scale Short Form (GDS-SF). Four studies implemented interventions during the pandemic that led to significant reductions in depressive symptoms and feelings of loneliness.
CONCLUSIONS: Improved understanding of pandemic-associated risk factors for depression can inform person-cantered care. It is important continued mental healthcare for depression for older adults throughout crises, such as the COVID-19 pandemic. Remote delivery of mental healthcare represents an important alternative during such times. It is crucial to address depression in older adults (which often causes disability), since the pandemic situation has increased depressive symptoms in this population.",CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT The authors declare that there is no conflict of interest.,"This manuscript was funded by FEDER.

The investigations generally respond to the need to comply with protection regulations of archaeological heritage in restoration projects of Assets of Cultural Interest (BIC, the Spanish acronym for Bienes de Interés Cultural), located in historic centers or urban infrastructure works. The results have allowed for the reconstruction of various aspects of daily life in these cities since their foundation, but they have also uncovered data on previous occupations of those same spaces during the pre-Hispanic period. There is still a need to consolidate adequate work strategies adjusted to the needs and particularities of these contexts, which increasingly require the execution of this type of archaeology project.","This paper was made under project CONCHA (The Construction of Early Modern Global Cities and Oceanic Networks in the Atlantic: An Approach via Ocean’s Cultural Heritage) that received funding from the EU H2020-MSCA-RISE-2017 research and innovation programme under grant agreement Nº 777998.

Despite the nest depth, these events play a crucial role in the seismic hazard assessment for several cities in northern South America (NoSAm), particularly those situated close to their epicenters. Moreover, these earthquakes are widely felt across the country, even hundreds of kilometers away from the nest. This paper assesses the performance of commonly used subduction intra-slab Ground Motion Models (GMMs) in predicting the updated nest database gathered and processed by the Colombian Geological Survey. This analysis confirms the necessity of a partially non-ergodic ground motion model for estimating the spectral acceleration produced by Bucaramanga nest earthquakes in northern South America. The GMM presented herein is the first model developed specifically for seismic nests in the region and is conceived as a regionalization of the recent NGA-Sub Abrahamson and Gülerce (2022) GMM. Additionally, we provide estimates of the variance components at both the earthquake and station levels and compare the developed GMM with the spectral accelerations recorded for typical earthquakes, for the highest magnitude earthquake in the database, and for the most recent Bucaramanga nest earthquake having a moment magnitude over 5.",,,Research Square,,,,2023-12-04,2023,2023-12-04,,,,,All OA; Green,Preprint,"Pájaro, César A.; Carlos, Arteta A.; Vicente, Mercado; Julián, Montejo; Arcila, Mónica; Abrahamson, Norman","Pájaro, César A.

2124,pub.1155944926,10.3791/64622,36939245,,A Visuospatial Planning Task Coupled with Eye-Tracker and Electroencephalogram Systems.,"The planning process, characterized by the capability to formulate an organized plan to reach a goal, is essential for human goal-directed behavior. Since planning is compromised in several neuropsychiatric disorders, the implementation of proper clinical and experimental tests to examine planning is critical. Due to the nature of the deployment of planning, in which several cognitive domains participate, the assessment of planning and the design of behavioral paradigms coupled with neuroimaging methods are current challenges in cognitive neuroscience. A planning task was evaluated in combination with an electroencephalogram (EEG) system and eye movement recordings in 27 healthy adult participants. Planning can be separated into two stages: a mental planning stage in which a sequence of steps is internally represented and an execution stage in which motor action is used to achieve a previously planned goal. Our protocol included a planning task and a control task. The planning task involved solving 36 maze trials, each representing a zoo map. The task had four periods: i) planning, where the subjects were instructed to plan a path to visit the locations of four animals according to a set of rules; ii) maintenance, where the subjects had to retain the planned path in their working memory; iii) execution, where the subjects used eye movements to trace the previously planned path as indicated by the eye-tracker system; and iv) response, where the subjects reported the order of the visited animals. The control task had a similar structure, but the cognitive planning component was removed by modifying the task goal. The spatial and temporal patterns of the EEG revealed that planning induces a gradual and lasting rise in frontal-midline theta activity (FMθ) over time. The source of this activity was identified within the prefrontal cortex by source analyses. Our results suggested that the experimental paradigm combining EEG and eye-tracker systems was optimal for evaluating cognitive planning.",,,Journal of Visualized Experiments,,,"Adult; Animals; Humans; Electroencephalography; Prefrontal Cortex; Eye Movements; Memory, Short-Term",2023-03-03,2023,2023-03-03,,,193,,All OA; Bronze,Article,"Domic-Siede, Marcos; Irani, Martín; Valdés, Joaquín; Rodríguez, María; Follet, Brice; Perrone-Bertolotti, Marcela; Ossandón, Tomás","Domic-Siede, Marcos (Laboratorio de Neurociencia Cognitiva, Escuela de Psicología, Universidad Católica del Norte; mdomic@ucn.cl.); Irani, Martín (Department of Psychology, University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign.); Valdés, Joaquín (Neurodynamics of Cognition Laboratory, Departamento de Psiquiatría, Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile.); Rodríguez, María (Instituto de Ciencias de la Salud, Universidad de O'Higgins; Instituto de Ciencias de la Ingeniería, Universidad de O'Higgins.); Follet, Brice (Neurodynamics of Cognition Laboratory, Departamento de Psiquiatría, Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile; Department of Psychiatry, University Hospital of Saint-Etienne.); Perrone-Bertolotti, Marcela (Univ.

The decreasing costs of processors, sensors, and wireless connectivity have made it possible to use UAVs in many variety of military to civilian applications.  While most applications utilizing the drones in the IoD have been real-time related, users are now interested in obtaining real-time services from drones that are tailored to a specific fly zone. This study develops a Sea Turtle Foraging Algorithm with Hybrid Deep Learning-based Intrusion Detection (STFA-HDLID) as a algorithm that recognizes and categorizes intrusions in the IoD environment. For this purpose, it is necessary to implement data pre-processing to standardize the input data via min-max normalization. Additionally, the feature selection process is also based on the STFA. Finally, a Deep Belief Network (DBN) with a Sparrow Search Optimization (SSO) algorithm is used for classification. A comprehensive experimental analysis is performed on a benchmark dataset to demonstrate the performance of the STFA-HDLID, which achieves maximum accuracy of 99.51% and 98.85% on the TON_IoT and UNSW-NB15 datasets, respectively, outperforming other techniques.",Declaration of Competing Interest The authors declare that they have no conflict of interest.

Few studies have evaluated aHUS in Latin American population. We studied a Colombian pediatric cohort to delineate disease presentation and outcomes.Methods A multicenter cohort of 27 Colombian children with aHUS were enrolled between 2010 to 2019. Patients were grouped by age at onset. Clinical features were compared using analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Fisher exact tests. Renal biopsy was performed on six patients who were suspected of having other renal diseases before aHUS diagnosis.Results Most patients were male (70%). The onset of aHUS occurred frequently before age 4 years (60%) and followed gastroenteritis as the main triggering event (52%). Age groups were comparable in clinical presentation, disease severity, treatment, and outcomes. Pulmonary involvement (67%) was the main extrarenal manifestation. A higher frequency was observed in the 1–7 age group (p = 0.01). Renal biopsies were as follows: three had membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (MPGN) type I, one MPGN type III, one C3-glomerulonephritis, and one rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis. Genetic screening was available in five patients and identified 2xCFHR5, 2xMCP, and 1xADAMTS-13/THBD mutations. A total of 15 relapses were seen, of which 8 (72%) occurred in the 1–7 age group. The renal outcome was not significantly different regardless of age group.Conclusion  In our cohort, we observed a relatively high frequency of extrarenal involvement at first presentation represented by pulmonary manifestations.

However, psychometric studies have suggested different factor structures for this instrument, which may lead to a biased assessment of the subdimensions of sexual sensation seeking. The present study (N = 812) aimed to identify the best factorial model of the SSSS by comparing the model suggested by previous research. Results from Exploratory and Confirmatory Factor Analyses showed that none of the models tested have sufficient goodness-of-fit to support the internal validity of the instrument.

We validated a Latin American Spanish version of the Body Esteem Scale for Adolescents and Adults (BESAA; Mendelson et al., 2001).Methods The scale was translated, culturally adapted, and validated with adults in Colombia (N = 525, 65% women, Mage 24.4, SD = 9.28). We assessed factor structure (using confirmatory and exploratory factor analysis CFA and EFA), internal reliability (using Cronbach’s alpha and omega), validity (using the Body Appreciation Scale BAS and Sociocultural Attitudes Towards Appearance Questionnaire SATAQ), test-retest stability (using Intraclass correlations ICC) and measurement invariance. To evaluate the generalizability of the scale, we assessed reliability, validity, and factor structure in a second sample from rural Nicaragua (N = 102, 73% women, Mage 22.2, SD = 4.72).Results The scale showed excellent internal reliability and validity across both samples. Test-retest stability and invariance across gender was established for the Colombian sample. EFA showed a three-factor structure with the subscales appearance-positive, appearance-negative and weight that was confirmed using CFA in both the Colombian and Nicaraguan sample and showed invariance across countries.Conclusion The Latin American Spanish version BESAA-LA is a psychometrically sound measure with excellent reliability, validity and invariance across gender and countries.

Among the various deterioration mechanisms, carbonation and chlorides are the most significant and widespread problems affecting these structures. This paper aims to assess the durability condition of the historical Colombian Bridge “Laureano Gómez”, which has been in service for over 40 years. The condition assessment involved measurements of the concrete cover, carbonation depths, concrete resistivity, compressive strength, crack survey, and visual inspection of the steel surface. Estimating the remaining service life showed that the stay elements are the most prone to steel depassivation due to carbonation, primarily due to low concrete cover and exposure conditions. The insights from this study could provide valuable information for the durability prognosis of the new bridge built next to it.",,,Ce/Papers,,,,2023-09-25,2023,2023-09-25,2023-09,6,5,184-189,All OA; Hybrid,Article,"Hernandez, Juan Daniel Cassiani; Dugarte, Margareth; Keβler, Sylvia; Arteta, Carlos","Hernandez, Juan Daniel Cassiani (Helmut Schmidt University/University of the Federal Armed Forces Hamburg, Germany); Dugarte, Margareth (Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); Keβler, Sylvia (Helmut Schmidt University/University of the Federal Armed Forces Hamburg, Germany); Arteta, Carlos (Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia)","Hernandez, Juan Daniel Cassiani (Helmut Schmidt University)","Hernandez, Juan Daniel Cassiani (Helmut Schmidt University); Dugarte, Margareth (Universidad del Norte); Keβler, Sylvia (Helmut Schmidt University); Arteta, Carlos (Universidad del Norte)",0,0,,,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1002/cepa.2021,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1164349335,33 Built Environment and Design; 3302 Building; 40 Engineering; 4005 Civil Engineering,

Although these systems face certain limitations, significant efforts are being made using renewable energy sources like Saline Gradient Energy (SGE). This led to the emergence of two technologies: Pressure Retarded Osmosis (PRO) and Reversal Electrodialysis (RED). Hence, this innovative study aims to contrast the potential environmental and economic benefits by performance of PRO and RED integration into desalinating seawater by Reverse Osmosis (SWRO). We comprehensively assessed their life cycle using SimaPro® software and conducted a stochastic economic evaluation to achieve this. For the calculation basis, the systems were dimensioned using Wave® software and theoretical-analytical methods based on technical literature. Our findings revealed SWRO-PRO is cheaper (1.49 USD/m3), less energy-intensive (4.602 kWh/m3), and more environmentally friendly than SWRO (emission reductions in the following categories: 10.31% human health, 11.79% ecosystem quality, and 11.44% natural resources depletion). SWRO was the second-best option with moderate costs (1.53 USD/m3), energy requirement (5.569 kWh/m3), and environmental impacts, while SWRO-RED was the least favorable, with higher costs (1.83 USD/m3), energy consumption (5.573 kWh/m3), and environmental impacts (increases of 22.20%, 21.02%, 15.2%, 22.2% of mentioned categories, respectively). PRO integration represented an enhancement, and despite lower benefits, RED maintains a substantial future potential. Thus, this study is a unique holistic approach that integrates environmental and economic considerations and endeavors to revolutionize our understanding of synergistic water-energy systems. Therefore, this pioneering research could pave the way to address global water scarcity and clean energy challenges.","Declaration of Competing Interest The authors declare the following financial interests/personal relationships which may be considered as potential competing interests: The authors reports financial support was provided by Ministerio de ciencias, tecnologia e innovacion de Colombia.","This work was funded by ‘Ministerio de Ciencias, tecnología e innovación de Colombia (MINCIENCIAS)’, in the framework of the projects: ‘Estudio y prueba piloto de un sistema de desalinización de agua de mar acoplado a una unidad de generación de Energía de Gradiente Salino’, in the programe: “Desalinización de agua de mar acoplada a Energía de Gradiente Salino como estrategia para aumentar la eficiencia energética y la disponibilidad de agua potable en zonas de alto estrés hídrico en el Caribe Colombiano’. developed under the contingent reclamation financing agreement No. 80740-538-2020.",Applied Energy,,,,2023-12,2023,,2023-12,351,,121876,All OA; Hybrid,Article,"Mendoza-Zapata, Luis; Maturana-Córdoba, Aymer; Mejía-Marchena, Ricardo; Cala, Anggie; Soto-Verjel, Joseph; Villamizar, Salvador","Mendoza-Zapata, Luis (Instituto de Estudios Hidráulicos y Ambientales (IDEHA), Departamento de Ingeniería Civil y Ambiental, Universidad del Norte, km 5 antigua vía a Puerto Colombia, Barranquilla, Colombia); Maturana-Córdoba, Aymer (Instituto de Estudios Hidráulicos y Ambientales (IDEHA), Departamento de Ingeniería Civil y Ambiental, Universidad del Norte, km 5 antigua vía a Puerto Colombia, Barranquilla, Colombia); Mejía-Marchena, Ricardo (Instituto de Estudios Hidráulicos y Ambientales (IDEHA), Departamento de Ingeniería Civil y Ambiental, Universidad del Norte, km 5 antigua vía a Puerto Colombia, Barranquilla, Colombia); Cala, Anggie (Instituto de Estudios Hidráulicos y Ambientales (IDEHA), Departamento de Ingeniería Civil y Ambiental, Universidad del Norte, km 5 antigua vía a Puerto Colombia, Barranquilla, Colombia); Soto-Verjel, Joseph (Instituto de Estudios Hidráulicos y Ambientales (IDEHA), Departamento de Ingeniería Civil y Ambiental, Universidad del Norte, km 5 antigua vía a Puerto Colombia, Barranquilla, Colombia); Villamizar, Salvador (Instituto de Estudios Hidráulicos y Ambientales (IDEHA), Departamento de Ingeniería Civil y Ambiental, Universidad del Norte, km 5 antigua vía a Puerto Colombia, Barranquilla, Colombia)","Cala, Anggie (Universidad del Norte)","Mendoza-Zapata, Luis (Universidad del Norte); Maturana-Córdoba, Aymer (Universidad del Norte); Mejía-Marchena, Ricardo (Universidad del Norte); Cala, Anggie (Universidad del Norte); Soto-Verjel, Joseph (Universidad del Norte); Villamizar, Salvador (Universidad del Norte)",2,2,,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2023.121876,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1163987382,33 Built Environment and Design; 38 Economics; 40 Engineering,13 Climate Action; 6 Clean Water and Sanitation; 7 Affordable and Clean Energy

Behind this arduous task lies a high risk of collateral damage to deminers and their equipment. The intrinsic operational cost often forces agents to abandon the task before its completion, making such areas a source of risk, especially for the civilian population and biodiversity. Most of the research to date has revolved around the technological development of devices capable of effectively detecting mines at a selected point within an area, while the search strategy itself to decide where to explore and which route to follow has been understudied. This paper proposes a decision support model (DSM) that produces highly safe and cost-effective mine detection search plans. Since the computational time of the solution increases along with the size of the area explored, exact linear methods are proposed for small and medium instances of the problem, whereas a genetic algorithm (GA) is proposed for large instances. Results show that the GA approach is capable of delivering solutions close to the optimum.",Acknowledgment All authors approved the version of the manuscript to be published.,,Socio-Economic Planning Sciences,,,,2023-08,2023,,2023-08,88,,101611,All OA; Hybrid,Article,"Camacho-Sanchez, Carolay; Yie-Pinedo, Ruben; Galindo, Gina","Camacho-Sanchez, Carolay (Universidad Sergio Arboleda, Bogota, Colombia); Yie-Pinedo, Ruben (Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); Galindo, Gina (Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia)","Yie-Pinedo, Ruben (Universidad del Norte)","Camacho-Sanchez, Carolay (Sergio Arboleda University); Yie-Pinedo, Ruben (Universidad del Norte); Galindo, Gina (Universidad del Norte)",2,2,,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.seps.2023.101611,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1158164272,33 Built Environment and Design; 3304 Urban and Regional Planning; 44 Human Society; 4404 Development Studies; 49 Mathematical Sciences; 4901 Applied Mathematics,

However, evaluations of the liveability impacts of cable cars are scarce. The TransMiCable cable car in Colombia connects the peripheral neighbourhoods of Ciudad Bolívar with the integrated public transport system of Bogotá. This study assessed the effect of TransMiCable on domains of liveability, including transport, public open space, social cohesion, local democracy, and security. Urban Transformations and Health: The Case of TransMiCable in Bogotá was a natural experiment involving participatory mixed methods. Household surveys, the Our Voice citizen science research method, and the Ripple Effects Mapping technique were applied to capture baseline measurements before TransMiCable’s inauguration and follow-up measurements afterwards in both intervention and control areas. Following a simultaneous bidirectional approach, quantitative and qualitative data were collected and analysed separately, then merged for interpretation. The mixed methods approach revealed concordance and complementarity among the multiple effects of the TransMiCable intervention across domains of liveability. These impacts included shorter travel times, increased satisfaction with public transport, increased access to parks, perceived reduction in the neighbourhood’s social stigma, increased pride in community, and decreased perceived insecurity. The participatory process facilitated dialogue between community leaders and public sector decision-makers on the ways transportation interventions can improve liveability. This multisectoral engagement enabled a broad understanding of the ongoing transformation of the Ciudad Bolívar area after the implementation of TransMiCable, providing lessons for effectively engaging with local stakeholders to support the sustainability of urban transformations.",,"The Salud Urbana en América Latina (SALURBAL)/Urban Health in Latin America project was funded by the Wellcome Trust [205177/Z/16/Z].

Our research explores the linking the of built environment with air quality by developing a model that allows relating NO2 with transport, land use, socioeconomics, and built environment characteristics. For the model estimation, we installed and quantified 114 diffusion tubes from Gradko© in Barranquilla, Colombia, a Caribbean city. Our results indicated that the lowest NO2 values occurred in remaining green areas, reduced traffic, and places that favor walking. However, the city design and current conditions of the built environment generate inequalities in exposure to air pollution. Low-income inhabitants are exposed to higher NO2 values than wealthier people. Therefore, planning sustainable and equitable cities should involve reducing NO2 concentrations by designing sound strategies for adequate mobility and developing an urban design that promotes walking.","Declaration of Competing Interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

We argue that dismemberment serves two functions for OCGs: first, it demonstrates OCGs' willingness to use gruesome violence against those who challenge their territorial hegemony, and second, it sustains criminal governance regimes by punishing individuals who violate OCGs' regulations. To demonstrate this argument, we analyse 25 cases of dismemberment in Colombia that we compiled during more than four years of fieldwork, review of press archives and databases provided by local authorities.

Preferences of Colombian higher education students,"While some students had experience receiving online education prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, the emergency remote modality offered a different experience given that higher education faculty had limited time for planning and, most of them, did not have any experience in online education. This research aims to identify the differences between undergraduate students’ perceptions and preferences on emergency remote and online education. Researchers identified a set of online education courses–that pre-existed COVID-19 times–and courses that were transformed into remote education courses–designed as a response of the COVID-19 emergency. Participants of this study are a group of students who, during the same academic semester, participated in both online and (emergency) remote courses. Researchers used a survey to understand students’ perceptions and preferences assessing their experiences in different dimensions (e.g., interaction and evaluation). Researchers used the add-on preferential groups model to identify which of the two modalities was preferred by the students for each dimension. The quantitative analysis was complemented using content analysis of responses to open-ended questions, seeking to gain a better understanding of students’ perceptions and preferences between online and emergency remote education. The results show that students have a positive view of the online and remote modalities; however, each of these modalities offers students advantages for specific dimensions. For example, the remote modality was preferred for having greater interaction among peers and with the instructor. On the other hand, online education provided more flexibility.

Nevertheless, toxic effects such as hemolysis have hampered the development of such promising drugs. Hence, a reliable computational tool to predict peptide hemolytic toxicity is enormously useful before synthesis and ex-perimental evaluation. Currently, four web servers that predict hemolytic activity using Machine Learning (ML) algorithms; however, they exhibit some limitations such as the need for a reliable negative set and limited application domain. Hence, we developed a robust model based on a novel theoretical approach that combines network science and a multi-query similarity searching (MQSS) method. A total of 1152 initial models were constructed from 144 scaffolds generated in a previous report. These were evaluated on external datasets, and the best models were fused and improved. Our best MQSS model I1 outperformed all state-of-the-art ML-based models and was used to characterize the prevalence of hemolytic toxicity on therapeutic peptides.

Since it largely defines the ability to recirculate and last longer through the reuse, remanufacture, refurbishment, or recycling of a product from its material processability and durability properties. However, existing approaches to selecting materials are not formally linked to the Circular Economy (CE) concept and do not contemplate recirculation and longevity attributes during the selection process. To contribute to that research direction, this article presents a selection material approach denominated Extended Material Circularity (EMC) which considers the ability to close and extend the loop of materials and the cumulated carbon footprint associated with multiple lifecycles. The EMC aims to provide a robust methodological approach to facilitate material selection when circularity is considered an essential requirement. The implementation of the EMC approach is demonstrated through two case studies considering both materials with dissimilar nature and materials within the same family.","Declaration of Competing Interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

This paper contributes by addressing how travel satisfaction, neighborhood satisfaction, and social capital relate to life satisfaction among a low-income community in Bogotá (Colombia) as a case study. Building on the available literature, we propose six hypotheses to understand such relationships before and after a cable car implementation, considering control and treatment groups. We defined seven latent variables and three objective indicators. We tested the hypotheses using a multiple-cause multiple-indicator modeling approach, which allowed us to identify how the comprehensive cable car intervention impacts perceptions and life satisfaction. Results showed that the principal factors associated with life satisfaction were neighborhood satisfaction as well as leisure activity participation, while travel time and transport affordability had negative effects. Positive changes in satisfaction regarding the travel experience can trigger significant improvements in life satisfaction in low-income communities in Latin America.",Declaration of Competing Interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.,"We would like to express our gratitude to the Bogotá Urban Planning Department (www.sdp.gov.co), for the funding and general support given for the development of this study through Agreement 369 of 2018.

Thus, reparability becomes an essential issue from the early product design phases, where materials, geometries, and joints are defined. Despite some repairability indicators that can be found in the literature and are applied worldwide, there is a lack of connection between repairability and the early decision-making process for improving it from the design of components of subsystems of a product. To contribute in that research direction, this article presents the Product Repairability Index (PRI), which considers the intrinsic repairability of the product components, their assembly/disassembly complexity, repairing instructions, availability of spare parts, and the self-diagnosis aids provided by the product. The PRI also considers components' relative functional importance to identify those with higher repairability requirements concerning their functional importance in the whole product assembly. The proposed indicator has been applied to a coffee machine as a case study, following a step-to-step methodology and calculation criteria to generate a quantitative value and detect the possible aspects to redesign to make a product more repairable.","Declaration of competing interest The authors declare the following financial interests/personal relationships which may be considered as potential competing interests: Jaime A.

Short answer questions (SAQs) are one of the relevant and proper tools for assessing reading comprehension skills. Unlike multiple-choice questions, SAQs allow for the assessment of cognitive abilities such as attention, language, perception, and problem solving. However, the task of SAQs scoring is time-consuming and susceptible to ambiguity. Automatic Short Answer Grading (ASAG) is a new paradigm that could help solve these problems. This experimental analysis aims to implement ASAG using several approaches to sentence embedding based on deep learning with a multilayer perceptron regression layer on the top, trained with a reading comprehension dataset based on aphorisms. For experimental testing, the available dataset is composed of answers given by 199 undergraduate students in Spanish.

Despite such a positive outlook, most accessibility metrics deployed in research and practice do not consider the dimension of (dis)utility, which resonates more clearly with mainstream transport decision-making and planning. This paper seeks to contribute to debates about the use of utility-based measures as inputs for accessibility assessment of transport infrastructure investments in the Global South using discrete choice modeling and its potential as a bridging language between socially nuanced and economics-driven transport planning practices. This paper uses mixed revealed preferences and stated preferences data collected in Bogotá, Colombia. Then, it uses a logsum accessibility metric to estimate the differentiated impact of a set of infrastructure interventions on the accessibility of residents with different income levels and other socioeconomic conditions for accessing opportunities in the city. Particularly, the logsum accessibility metric analyses future innovations and structural additions to Bogotá public transport networks reflecting their effect on the accessibility and consumer surplus in the next 20 years. The proposed approach captures the benefits derived from the opportunity locations and transport infrastructure improvements, which has relevance for debates about transport policy and practice in this and similar urban contexts in the Global South.

The present study also uses the notion of face to investigate the use of Dank ‘thanks’, Dankbarkeit ‘thankfulness’, and danken ‘to thank’ in expressions of gratitude in Old Saxon and Old High German, laying the foundations to a better understanding of the speech act of thanking in the history of German. The data suggest that, although the manifestation of gratitude was common, the expressions containing Dank , Dankbarkeit , and danken could mostly be found when the addresser was in a lower social position than the addressee. The same situation was observed when these nouns and verbs were used with the meaning of “to reward” and “to praise.” These findings provide evidence to the claim that the effects of a speech act on the speaker’s or hearer’s face are mostly situational rather than being an intrinsic property. They also suggest that, in strictly hierarchical societies such as the Old Saxon and Old High German ones, addressers would threaten their own negative face only if they were in a lower social position than the addressees.",,,Lodz Papers in Pragmatics,,,,2023-05-01,2023,2023-07-20,2023-05-01,19,1,175-198,All OA; Green,Article,"Concu, Valentina","Concu, Valentina (Universidad del Norte, ., Kilómetro 5, Vía a Puerto Colombia, Barranquilla, Colombia)",,"Concu, Valentina (Universidad del Norte)",1,1,,,https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-1766075/latest.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1160804738,"47 Language, Communication and Culture; 4703 Language Studies; 4704 Linguistics",
1601,pub.1160638981,10.1111/geb.13730,,,Pre‐adaptation and adaptation shape trait‐environment matching in the Neotropics,"Abstract  Aim Functional traits shape the distribution of taxa across environments. However, it remains unclear whether trait and environmental niche evolution are correlated, and what happened first: trait change facilitating environment shifts (pre‐adaptation) or environmental change leading to trait change (adaptation). We focus on a species‐rich Neotropical legume radiation to shed light on this enigma.   Location Neotropics.   Time Period Cenozoic.   Major Taxa Studied  Fabaceae: Papilionoidae: Swartzia .    Methods  We assembled leaflet, fruit and petal size data from monographs and herbarium collections for 86 to 96% of the c. 180 Swartzia species, inferred a dated Swartzia phylogenetic tree from existing DNA sequences covering 38% of the species and integrated these with distribution, soil and climate data. We used phylogenetic linear regression to quantify trait–environment relationships and applied comparative methods to evaluate modes of correlated evolution between traits and environments.    Results Leaflet and petal size were strongly linked to climate, while fruit size was not associated with climate or soil characteristics. Evolutionary transitions to relatively low rainfall and low temperature environments were conditional on the evolution of small leaflets, whereas transitions to wet and warm environments were preceded by the evolution of larger leaflets. In contrast, transitions to the warmest or coldest environments were followed, rather than preceded, by petal loss.   Main Conclusion  Our results show that the macroevolution of functional traits has influenced the broad‐scale distribution of Swartzia across Neotropical rainforest, seasonally dry, montane and inundated habitats. We suggest that trait evolution is conditional on environmental change but both pre‐adaptive and adaptive processes may occur. These processes are important to understand the distribution of diversity at both regional (e.g. Amazonia) and global biogeographical scales.","ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS FJVP and REO gratefully acknowledge the support of iDiv funded by the German Research Foundation (DFG–FZT 118, 202548816).

1601,pub.1159245362,10.1016/j.est.2023.107876,,,Experimentally based testing of the enthalpy-porosity method for the numerical simulation of phase change of paraffin-type PCMs,"The enthalpy-porosity method is generally applied as an economical resort for the numerical simulation of phase change materials (PCMs). However, having been developed strictly for metals, its suitability for the task is unclear, nor is the rationale for assigning its internal parameters, e.g., latent enthalpy and the constant of the momentum source term representing the “mushy” region. We first experimentally and exhaustively characterize a paraffin-type PCM, including differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) at several heating rates, T-history, and fusion visualization. Then, we develop a numerical model and systematically run simulations under different internal parameters and thermophysical properties of the PCM. Simulation results exhibit significant disagreement with experiments that cannot be reduced by any strategy for combining different material properties and model parameters. Among other effects, the constant of the momentum source term, which has to be assigned somewhat arbitrarily, has more relevance in the accuracy than any set of properties obtained by DSC and other experimental techniques. Thus, a rather negative, although interesting, conclusion is suggested: the enthalpy-porosity method may fail to model the phase change of paraffin-type PCMs. This is, of course, of paramount importance for the studies of their utilization in practical systems since it puts a fundamental point of uncertainty in any numerical study or lumped-type model derived thereof. The paper concludes with a tentative discussion of the possible causes of this failure and perspectives for developing more proper models.","Declaration of competing interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

This work explores econometric alternatives for time series forecasting, such as the ARIMA and GARCH models, which have been widely used in the financial industry. These techniques have the advantage that training the models does not require high computational cost. To improve predictions obtained from ARIMA, the discrete Fourier transform is used as ARIMA pre-processing, resulting in the wavelet ARIMA strategy. Due to the linear nature of ARIMA, non-linear patterns in the volatility time series cannot be captured. To solve this problem, two hybridisation techniques are proposed, combining wavelet ARIMA and GARCH. The advantage of applying this methodology is associated with the ability of each to capture linear and non-linear patterns present in a time series. These two hybridisation techniques are evaluated to verify which provides better prediction.

In this field, using Design For X (DFX) tools appears to be an interesting and helpful way to address requirements and considerations by applying single design rules that can enhance performance in terms of circularity. However, the current DFX approaches are not formally oriented to a circular economy (CE), and there is no clear pathway to apply design rules for circular products. Therefore, this article proposes a classification of DFX rules based on seven CE strategies related to slowing and closing the loop of products, parts, and materials. The proposed approach consisted of a literature review, an analysis of DFX rules related to CE, and the classification of such rules in terms of CE strategies and product design stages. The analysis of DFX rules in product circularity provided insights to generate a specific design guideline of 51 rules for circular products. The guideline was denominated as the Design for Circularity and Durability (DFCD) and is proposed as a design tool for practitioners, designers, and academicians in CE. A case study is also presented to demonstrate the implementation and benefits of the DFCD guideline.","The author would like to acknowledge Vicerrectoría de Investigación, Creación e Innovación Universidad del Norte (Colombia) for the funding to develop this research.",Open Access funding provided by Colombia Consortium.,Research in Engineering Design,,,,2023-06-21,2023,2023-06-21,2023-10,34,4,443-460,All OA; Hybrid,Article,"Mesa, Jaime A.","Mesa, Jaime A.

Concrete examples of how to best address that integration are needed. I subsequently provide one such example, the incorporation of cultural humility guidelines into the supervision agreement and supervisory relationship from its outset. That guidelines incorporation serves three purposes: (a) to foreground cultural humility in my practice as a supervisor, making a pledge and a promise to my supervisees that I as their supervisor will forever strive to approach our work from a culturally humble stance; (b) to introduce and orient supervisees to, and better prepare them for, the incorporation of cultural humility into their own therapeutic practice; and (c) to ideally galvanize and deepen their ever-evolving sense of culturally humility as that practice proceeds. Cultural humility is defined, and a set of supervisor-focused, supervision-adapted cultural humility guidelines is proposed.

While many commentators have rejected this claim, it has been commonly assumed that Wittgenstein himself endorsed it. In a recently published article, Thomas Müller not only provides a novel argument against Wittgenstein's claim about the standard metre but also claims that Wittgenstein did not actually endorse that claim.

The aim of this study was to assess the environmental risk of recurrent PHS on mangrove ecosystems in Tumaco municipality, Colombian Pacific. Mangrove characteristics and management aspects led to subdividing the entire the study into 11 units-of-analysis (UA) for which threats, vulnerability, potential impacts, and risks were assessed based on environmental factors and the formulation and use of indicators in a rating scale with five categories, which are very low, low, moderate, high, and very high. The results showed that all UAs are highly (64%) or moderately (36%) threatened by PHS, highly (45%) or moderately (55%) vulnerable to this kind of pollution, and susceptible of high (73%) or moderate (27%) potential impacts. Environmental risk was high in 73% of the UAs, indicating likely irreversible damage to mangrove ecosystems by PHS, thus pointing to the need of urgent intervention by responsible authorities to ease their recovery and conservation.

In this study, we revisit water masses in the Caribbean Sea using climatology and 11 months of observations at different depths from 3 moorings placed in the Guajira upwelling region, providing some new findings. The Caribbean Surface Water (CSW) seasonal variability is studied at the mixed layer depth. Salinity differences between CSW and the saltier North Atlantic Subtropical Underwater (SUW) determine static stability spatial and temporal variations, with implications for regional ocean dynamics. Besides, we assess the climatologic distribution of water masses below the salinity maximum using the optimum multiparameter analysis and the Thermodynamic Equation of Seawater 2010, defining their source water indices when entering the Caribbean Sea. The SUW, with its core at ~ 150 m depth, occupies 16% of the Caribbean Sea volume, complemented by 38% of Antarctic Intermediate Water, with its core at ~ 700 m depth and North Atlantic Deep Water, which as bottom water occupies 46% of the volume. Hydrographic observations do not differ from climatology, regardless of their large sub-annual variations decreasing with depth. Daily time series of dominant water fractions at different depths correlate at each mooring, indicating a common forcing. Besides, rotated wind stress, which is an indicator of the Guajira upwelling, correlates regularly with water mass fractions down to 700 m depth. However, during strong wind shifts, upwelling seems to affect them down to 1450 m depth.",This work was developed under the General Maritime Directorate of Colombia (DIMAR) and the Universidad del Norte agreement No. UN-OJ-2018-40336.

In particular, we are interested in evaluating the effects on traffic flows. For this purpose, it is necessary to accurately estimate the temporal variation of traffic flows during the pandemic period. New data collection techniques, including information from smartphones, can be used to collect this information at multiple locations of a road network. A key step in using this new data collection is the validation against more traditional measures to ensure consistency in traffic volume interpretation. This paper presents a case study whose main goals are to compare the smartphone-based traffic count predictions from the StreetLight data source against the values reported by traditional methods of traffic quantification and estimate reductions and recovery rates on traffic volumes in North Carolina during the COVID-19 pandemic. The results show that the largest reductions in traffic flows occurred mainly during the first three months of lockdown.","Declaration of Competing Interest The authors do not have conflict of interest to declare.

The samples received are difficult to recycle for the steel industry, which, due to their poor disposal, causes irreparable environmental damage. Here we propose a synthetic route to obtain functional magnetic particles with this residue. First, a series of washes with solvent and alcohols were proposed, thus achieving the total removal of the oil. X-ray diffraction and Mössbauer spectroscopy show that the as received sample consists of different iron phases, with wüstite being the majority phase. After the synthesis process, the hematite phase was present as the majority phase with ∼92 wt%.

Therefore, product design is a powerful research field to promote material, component, and product circularity throughout several lifecycles. However, there is a lack of formal methods to measure the circularity of products, especially from the early design stages. Therefore, this paper proposes a diagnostic tool for measuring circularity, identifying potential improvement opportunities, and redesigning interventions in the conceptual design phase. The tool consists of eight single indicators that measure disassemblability, reassemblability, durability, modularity, simplicity, standardization, commonality, relative costs, and the number of secondary functions of products. A case study is presented to validate the tool, considering several improvement scenarios around the 6R strategies. Finally, a list of redesign interventions for each improvement scenario was assembled as a primary output of the proposed tool.",,Open Access funding provided by Colombia Consortium.,Research in Engineering Design,,,,2023-03-27,2023,2023-03-27,2023-10,34,4,401-420,All OA; Hybrid,Article,"Mesa, Jaime A.; González-Quiroga, Arturo","Mesa, Jaime A.

This paper evaluates the influence of RCA as a partial replacement in a granular sub-base of 37.5 mm nominal maximum size (GSB38). Specifically, two replacement percentages of RCA by weight of the coarse aggregate of the GSB38 were evaluated: 10 and 15. To estimate the influence on the mechanical behavior, abrasion tests were carried out in the Los Angeles (LA) abrasion and California bearing ratio (CBR) methods. For GSB38, the average abrasion results were 30.54%. The CBR for the same material at a penetration of 0.254 cm was 26.90, 61.00 and 76.20% and at a penetration of 0.508 cm was 33.00, 65.70 and 82.00% for 10, 25 and 56 blows per layer, respectively. For GSB38 with 10% RCA, similar and even better behavior than natural GSB38 was found in terms of LA abrasion, with an average result of 38.68%. The CBR for the same alternative at a penetration of 0.254 cm was 13.20, 52.80 and 57.70% and at a penetration of 0.508 cm was 18.00, 61.30 and 68.90% for 10, 25 and 56 blows per layer, respectively. But GSB38 with 15% RCA showed an average abrasion of 45.51%, indicating a decrease compared with natural GSB38 and GSB38 with 10% RCA.

Considering its prevalence and the associated severe health repercussions, hypertension has become a disease of great relevance for public health across the globe. Conventionally, the classification of an individual as hypertensive or nonhypertensive is conducted through ambulatory blood pressure monitoring over a 24-h period. Although this method provides a reliable diagnosis, it has notable limitations, such as additional costs, intolerance experienced by some patients, and interferences derived from physical activities. Moreover, some patients with significant renal impairment may not present proteinuria. Accordingly, alternative methodologies are applied for the classification of individuals as hypertensive or nonhypertensive, such as the detection of metabolites in urine samples through liquid chromatography or mass spectrometry. However, the high cost of these techniques limits their applicability for clinical use. Consequently, an alternative methodology was developed for the detection of molecular patterns in urine collected from hypertension patients. In this study, a direct discrimination model for hypertensive and nonhypertensive individuals was generated through the amplification of Raman signals in urine samples based on gold nanoparticles and supported by chemometric techniques such as partial least squares-discriminant analysis (PLS-DA). Specifically, 162 patient urine samples were used to create a PLS-DA model. These samples included 87 urine samples from patients diagnosed with hypertension and 75 samples from nonhypertensive volunteers. The PLS-DA model with 4 latent variables (LV) was used to classify the hypertensive patients with a calibration sensitivity (SenCal) of 89.2%, cross-validation sensitivity (SenCV) of 75.4%, prediction sensitivity (SenPred) of 86.4%, calibration specificity (SpeCal) of 86.0%, cross-validation specificity (SpeCV) of 77.2%, prediction specificity (SpePred) of 77.8%, calibration accuracy (AccCal) of 87.7%, cross-validation accuracy (AccCV) of 77.0%, and prediction accuracy (AccPred) of 82.5%. This study demonstrates the ability of surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy to differentiate between hypertensive and nonhypertensive patients through urine samples, representing a significant advance in the detection and management of AH.",,,Research Square,,,,2023-09-07,2023,2023-09-07,,,,,All OA; Green,Preprint,"Espinosa-Garavito, Alberto C.; Quiroz, Elkin Navarro; Galán-Freyle, Nataly J.; Méndez-López, Maximiliano; Aroca-Martinez, Gustavo; Gomez-Escorcia, Lorena; Acosta-Hoyos, Antonio; Pacheco-Lugo, Lisandro; Espitia-Almeida, Fabián; Hernández-Rivera, Samuel P.; Villa-Medina, Joe; Pacheco-Londoño, Leonardo C.","Espinosa-Garavito, Alberto C.

This group represents the second most extensive pedigree clustering HD in the world.Methods We included 291 descendants of families living in Juan de Acosta, Colombia, who had at least one member with HD. Blood samples were obtained, and genomic DNA was extracted. The HTT CAG expansion was quantified using an amplicon sequencing protocol. Statistical and bioinformatic analyses were conducted using several modules implemented in R. Statistical threshold significance was set at P < 0.05.Results A total of 33 HD patients were analyzed, and a mean of 21.91 HTT CAG repeats with a standard deviation of 8.92 copies was obtained. The most affected individuals were adults, and the most common primary and secondary alleles were 17/7 and 17/10, respectively. Mosaicism increased with age in participants with HD, and slippage analyses revealed differences by HD allele type for the secondary allele, but no significant differences were observed by sex. Slippage tended to increase with the number of CAG repeats in participants with HD, but the increase was not statistically significant. The most common haplotype was 17/7_17/10.Conclusion This study analyzed the genetic and molecular features of HD by examining 291 participants, including 33 with HD. Mosaicism was found to increase with age in subjects with HD, particularly for the secondary allele; the most common haplotype was 17/7_17/10. Slippage for the secondary allele varied by HD allele type, but no significant difference in slippage was observed by sex.

At the same time, CXR interpretation is a time-consuming and subjective process. Furthermore, high resemblance among the radiological patterns of TB and other lung diseases can result in misdiagnosis. Therefore, computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) models using machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) can be designed for screening TB accurately. With this motivation, this article develops a Water Strider Optimization with Deep Transfer Learning Enabled Tuberculosis Classification (WSODTL-TBC) model on Chest X-rays (CXR). The presented WSODTL-TBC model aims to detect and classify TB on CXR images. Primarily, the WSODTL-TBC model undergoes image filtering techniques to discard the noise content and U-Net-based image segmentation. Besides, a pre-trained residual network with a two-dimensional convolutional neural network (2D-CNN) model is applied to extract feature vectors. In addition, the WSO algorithm with long short-term memory (LSTM) model was employed for identifying and classifying TB, where the WSO algorithm is applied as a hyperparameter optimizer of the LSTM methodology, showing the novelty of the work. The performance validation of the presented WSODTL-TBC model is carried out on the benchmark dataset, and the outcomes were investigated in many aspects. The experimental development pointed out the betterment of the WSODTL-TBC model over existing algorithms.",,The authors received no specific funding for this study.,Computer Systems Science and Engineering,,,,2023-02-06,2023,2023-02-06,2023,46,2,1337-1353,All OA; Hybrid,Article,"Escorcia-Gutierrez, José; Soto-Diaz, Roosvel; Madera, Natasha; Soto, Carlos; Burgos-Florez, Francisco; Rodríguez, Alexander; Mansour, Romany F.","Escorcia-Gutierrez, José (Department of Computational Science and Electronic, Universidad de la Costa, CUC, Barranquilla, 080002, Colombia); Soto-Diaz, Roosvel (Biomedical Engineering Program, Universidad Simón Bolívar, Barranquilla, 080002, Colombia); Madera, Natasha (Mechatronics Engineering Program, Universidad Simón Bolívar, Barranquilla, 080002, Colombia); Soto, Carlos (Mechatronics Engineering Program, Universidad Simón Bolívar, Barranquilla, 080002, Colombia); Burgos-Florez, Francisco (Biomedical Engineering Program, Universidad Simón Bolívar, Barranquilla, 080002, Colombia); Rodríguez, Alexander (Department of Medicine, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, 081007, Colombia); Mansour, Romany F.

Materials and Methods We extracted structured and free text data from electronic health records of all office visits (2015-2019) of children aged 4-6 years seen in a community-based primary healthcare network in California, who had ≥1 visits with an ICD-10 diagnosis of ADHD. Two pediatricians manually annotated clinical notes of the first ADHD visit for 423 patients. Inter-annotator agreement was assessed for recommendation for first-line behavioral treatment; Disagreements were reconciled. The BioClinical Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BioClinical-BERT) was used to identify mentions of behavioral treatment recommendations using a 70/30 train/test split. Following an error analysis and threshold selection, we completed external (temporal) validation by deploying the model on 1,020 unannotated notes representing other ADHD visits and well-care visits; all positively classified notes and 5% of negatively classified notes were annotated.   Results Of 423 included patients, 313 (74%) were male, 268 (63%) were privately insured; 138 (33%) were white; 61 (14 %) were Hispanic. The BERT model of first ADHD visits achieved F1=0.78, precision=0.84, and recall=0.72. Following threshold selection, temporal validation on notes from other visits achieved F1=0.80, recall=0.92 and precision=0.7.   Conclusion Deploying a machine learning algorithm on a large and variable set of clinical notes accurately captured pediatrician adherence to guidelines in treatment of children with ADHD. This approach can be used to measure quality-of-care at scale and improve clinical care for various chronic medical conditions.","We thank Packard Children’s Health Alliance and Stanford Research Information Technology for their support and assistance in data acquisition and extraction.

Although the low energy content of syngas hinders its use, syngas-natural gas blends could overcome this challenge. This study assesses syngas-natural gas interchangeability in atmospheric burners via the combustion potential and the corrected Wobbe index according to Delbourg's approach. Likewise, this research evaluates methane number as an interchangeability indicator for high-pressure combustion. The syngas originated from a Top-Lit UpDraft gasifier, using coal-biomass blends of 0–100, 25–75, and 45–55 wt %, with air as the gasifying agent. The syngas featured a Lower Heating Value ranging from 3.0 to 3.8 MJ Nm-3. Results based on Delbourg's approach indicated that syngas-natural gas blends of up to 15 vol % syngas could operate in atmospheric natural gas burners without modifications. Furthermore, the methane number for syngas-natural gas blends of 15 vol % syngas was 5.8% higher than that of natural gas. The results show slight variations in flue gas composition, adiabatic flame temperature, and laminar flame velocity between natural gas and syngas-natural gas blends. The study showcases the potential of using syngas-natural gas blends in thermal applications and identifies key areas for further research.","Declaration of competing interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

Neoplastic cells also deploy mis-expressed germ cell proteins termed Cancer Testes Antigens (CTAs) to promote genome maintenance and survival. Here, we present the first comprehensive characterization of the DNA Damage Response (DDR) and CTA transcriptional landscapes of endometrial cancer in relation to conventional histological and molecular subtypes. We show endometrial serous carcinoma (ESC), an aggressive endometrial cancer subtype, is defined by gene expression signatures comprising members of the Replication Fork Protection Complex (RFPC) and Fanconi Anemia (FA) pathway and CTAs with mitotic functions. DDR and CTA- based profiling also defines a subset of highly aggressive endometrioid endometrial carcinomas (EEC) with poor clinical outcomes that share similar profiles to ESC yet have distinct characteristics based on conventional histological and genomic features. Using an unbiased CRISPR-based genetic screen and a candidate gene approach, we confirm that DDR and CTA genes that constitute the ESC and related EEC gene signatures are required for proliferation and therapy-resistance of cultured endometrial cancer cells.

1367,pub.1153026709,10.1016/j.seps.2022.101477,,,A reservation-based parking behavioral model for parking demand management in urban areas,"The rapid increase in car ownership has become a land-use problem in many cities which have limited land for parking. It also has adverse impacts on congestion, air quality, energy consumption, as well as losses in productivity, among other consequences. The problem worsens in some cities due to the adoption of inefficient mandatory minimum parking policies for new projects, according to a building's use and size, which incentivizes driving. Therefore, it is necessary to assess appropriate parking management policies that maximize social welfare. In this regard, this paper presents a reservation-based parking behavioral hybrid choice model for parking demand management policies in urban areas, that appropriately represents the behavior of private vehicle users when choosing their parking site. The proposed model is statistically significant and consistent with expected behavior and microeconomic theory. The results demonstrate that the possibility of reserving a parking space has a significant impact on car parking market share on- and off-street. The three latent variables included in the model (pro-parking attitude, perception of risk for parking on- and off-street) have a significant effect on the modal split and the evaluation of appropriate parking policies that consider heterogeneity. The latent variable that most impacts the modal shift is the pro-parking attitude, which can generate up to 7% change in the modal partition.",,,Socio-Economic Planning Sciences,,,,2023-04,2023,,2023-04,86,,101477,All OA; Hybrid,Article,"Macea, Luis F.; Serrano, Iván; Carcache-Guas, Camila","Macea, Luis F.

As a new asset class with unique characteristics, Bitcoin's high volatility and structural breaks make forecasting challenging. Based on 2753 observations from 08-09-2014 to 01-05-2022, this study focuses on Bitcoin logarithmic returns. Results show that deep learning methodologies have advantages in terms of forecast quality, although significant computational costs are required. Although both MLP and RNN models produce smoother forecasts with less fluctuation, they fail to capture large spikes. The LSTM architecture, on the other hand, reacts strongly to such movements and tries to adjust its forecast accordingly. To compare forecasting accuracy at different horizons MAPE, MAE metrics are used. Diebold–Mariano tests were conducted to compare the forecast, confirming the superiority of deep learning methodologies. Overall, this study suggests that deep learning methodologies could provide a promising tool for forecasting Bitcoin returns (and therefore volatility), especially for short-term horizons.","This work is partially financed by national funds through FCT—Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia under the project UIDB/00006/2020.

1337,pub.1157357685,10.1016/j.ocecoaman.2023.106605,,,Assessment and management of coastal erosion in the marine protected area of the Rosario Island archipelago (Colombian Caribbean),"By utilizing historical satellite image databases, it was possible to assess the rates of coastal retreat in the Grande, Rosario, and Tesoro Islands from 2010 to 2021, due to the influence of climatic variables. It was discovered that the three islands have lost 0.4%, 1.6%, and 9.3% of their landmass, respectively. The notable increase in sea level rise, which has risen 6.2 mm/year since 2010, has emerged as the primary driving factor in the magnitude of erosion by altering the wave transformation patterns in shallow waters. This enables the wave trains to maintain more energy and intensify their height in surf zones, particularly during the dry season, where the wave height has increased by 12%. At the same time, the intensity of longitudinal currents has increased due to the new wave dynamics, leading to changes in the coastlines. Areas characterized by a coastal geomorphology of terraces and beaches, such as Tesoro Island, were found to be the most affected, unlike the cliffs of Grande and Rosario Islands. The study also revealed a lack of policies and concrete actions aimed at mitigating erosion in the coral islands of the Colombian Caribbean. Thus, a set of guidelines is proposed as a starting point to address this issue.",Declaration of competing interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.,,Ocean & Coastal Management,,,,2023-05,2023,,2023-05,239,,106605,All OA; Green,Article,"Ortega, Alisson Y.; Díaz, Luis J.

Variational (4D-Var) Ensemble Kalman Filter (4D-EnKF) methods for non-linear
data assimilation. Our formulations' main idea is to avoid the intrinsic need
for adjoint models in the context of 4D-Var optimization and, even more, to
handle non-linear observation operators during the assimilation of
observations. The proposed methods work as follows: snapshots of an ensemble of
model realizations are taken at observation times, these snapshots are employed
to build control spaces onto which analysis increments can be estimated. Via
the linearization of observation operators at observation times, a line-search
based optimization method is proposed to estimate optimal analysis increments.
The convergence of this method is theoretically proven as long as the dimension
of control-spaces equals model one. In the first formulation, control spaces
are given by full-rank square root approximations of background error
covariance matrices via the Bickel and Levina precision matrix estimator. In
this context, we propose an iterative Woodbury matrix formula to perform the
optimization steps efficiently. The last formulation can be considered as an
extension of the Maximum Likelihood Ensemble Filter to the 4D-Var context. This
employs pseudo-square root approximations of prior error covariance matrices to
build control spaces. Experimental tests are performed by using the Lorenz 96
model. The results reveal that, in terms of Root-Mean-Square-Error values, both
methods can obtain reasonable estimates of posterior error modes in the 4D-Var
optimization problem. Moreover, the accuracies of the proposed filter
implementations can be improved as the ensemble sizes are increased.",,,arXiv,,,,2023-05-04,2023,,,,,,All OA; Green,Preprint,"Nin-Ruiz, Elias; Diaz-Rodriguez, Jairo","Nin-Ruiz, Elias (); Diaz-Rodriguez, Jairo ()",,"Nin-Ruiz, Elias (); Diaz-Rodriguez, Jairo ()",0,0,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1157762903,37 Earth Sciences; 3701 Atmospheric Sciences; 49 Mathematical Sciences,

At present, the agile model is used in software development vastly due to its support to both developers and clients resourcefully. Agile methodology increases the interaction between the developer and client to make the software product defect-free. The agile model is getting to be a well-known life cycle model because of its particular features and most owing is to allow changes at any level of the project from the product owner. However, on other hand, this novel feature is a disadvantage of the agile model due to frequent change requests from the client has increased the cost and time. To overcome cost and time estimation issues different cost estimation techniques are being used in agile development but no one is pertinent for accurate estimation. Therefore, this study has proposed a cost estimation technique. The proposed estimation technique is predictions-based and has different categorizations of projects based on user stories complexities and the developer's expertise. We have applied the suggested technique to ongoing projects to find the results and effectiveness. We have used two projects with different sizes and user stories. Both projects have different modules and developers with different expertise. We have used the proposed estimation technique on projects and done a survey session with the teams.

Our new data, along with published geochronology, allowed us to reconstruct the Cretaceous forearc configuration of the trailing edge of the CLIP prior to seamount collision, ophiolite accretion, and whole-margin deformation. The ophiolite in western Azuero is composed of two tectonic slivers arranged in south-verging, imbricated thrust faults that stack a ~73 Ma pillow, flow, and picritic basalt and black chert, together with a ~ 89–93 Ma and older basalt flows and capping red chert sequences. Accretion of these slivers to form a supra-subduction zone ophiolite resulted from the middle Eocene collision and accretion of Galapagos seamounts against the trailing edge of the CLIP. Accreted seamounts are arranged in a north-verging antiformal stack duplex, and below the thrust sheets. Change in kinematics after fission of the Cocos-Nazca Plate during early Miocene times prompted the propagation of the Azuero-Sona fault zone flower structure, favouring the preservation of these slivers of oceanic crust.","In memory of Henry Martinez.

Osmotic energy, in particular, is gaining strength as a promising alternative. This review aims to analyze the influence of different pretreatment technologies on the performance of Pressure Retarded Osmosis (PRO) processes in terms of power density generation. Using the PRISMA methodology, a systematic review of the research available in the Scopus and Web of Science databases between 2006 and 2022 was carried out. The results revealed that pretreatment processes are essential for the success of the PRO application and that different pretreatment technologies can lead to different efficiency levels in removing suspended solids and organic and inorganic compounds. It is also essential to calculate the specific energy costs required by the pretreatment system, as this aspect can significantly limit the feasibility of the application. This review contributes to identifying and addressing pretreatment as a critical area requiring further research and attention in optimizing this technology. It highlights the importance of customized pretreatment approaches and identifies future trends in advanced membrane development and energy efficiency. These trends will not only improve the economic viability of Pressure Retarded Osmosis but will also be critical in the transition to more sustainable and efficient energy production.","Declaration of competing interest The authors declare the following financial interests/personal relationships which may be considered as potential competing interests:Anggie Cala reports financial support was provided by Colombia Ministry of Science Technology and Innovation.

Traditional EM approaches are often inadequate because of incomplete and imprecise information during crises, making fast and effective decision-making challenging. Computational Intelligence techniques (CI) offer decision-supporting capabilities that can effectively address these challenges. However, there is still a need for deeper integration of emerging computational intelligence techniques to support evidence-based decision-making while also addressing gaps in metrics, standards, and protocols for emergency response and scalability. This study presents a coordinated decision-making system for multiple types of emergency case scenarios for technological disaster management based on CI techniques, including an Improved Genetic Algorithm (IGA), and Multi-objective Particle Swarm Optimization (MOPSO). The IGA enhances emergency performance by optimizing the task assignment for multiple agents involved in emergency response with coordination mechanisms, resulting in an approximately 15% improvement compared to other state-of-the-art methods. Ultimately, this study offers a promising foundation for future research to develop effective strategies for mitigating the impact of technological disasters on society and the environment.",,Open Access funding provided by Colombia Consortium.,Neural Computing and Applications,,,,2023-12-29,2023,2023-12-29,2024-03,36,9,4503-4521,All OA; Hybrid,Article,"Guerrero Granados, Bethsy; Quintero M., Christian G.; Núñez, César Viloria","Guerrero Granados, Bethsy (Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Universidad del Norte, 081007, Barranquilla, Atlántico, Colombia); Quintero M., Christian G.

Despite CHIKV outbreaks occurring worldwide and several vaccines currently in development, immune responses to CHIKV in humans remains largely understudied, and targets of T cell response are currently unknown. In this study, we tested peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) collected from patients diagnosed with CHIKV infection during the 2014-2015 outbreak in Colombia against pools of overlapping peptides sequentially spanning each CHIKV protein. Using high-resolution flow cytometry, we detected robust CHIKV-specific CD4 + , but not CD8 + T cell responses, in these patients. Patients still experiencing disease symptoms six years after infection displayed significantly stronger CHIKV- specific CD4 + T cell responses against nsP1, nsP2 and E2 proteins, compared to patients that resolved the infection. CHIKV-specific CD4+ T cells in symptomatic patients displayed a significantly lower Th1 CD4 + helper T cell responses and were enriched within the Th17 CD4 + helper subset, identifying tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFα) as the predominantly produced cytokine. In conclusion, this study comprehensively characterizes the T cell response against CHIKV in humans during the chronic phase and provides insights into the role of T cells and possible treatment of CHIKVD.",We thank all members of Weiskopf and Sette lab for their helpful discussions.,This work was funded by National Institute of Health (NIH) Contract No. 75N93019C00065 to A.S. and D.W.,bioRxiv,,,,2023-11-21,2023,2023-11-21,,,,2023.11.20.567688,All OA; Green,Preprint,"Chang, James; Agarwal, Rimjhim; Côrtes, Fernanda H; Ha, Calvin; Villalpando, John; Castillo, Izabella N.; Gálvez, Rosa Isela; Grifoni, Alba; Sette, Alessandro; Romero-Vivas, Claudia M; Heise, Mark T; Premkumar, Lakshmanane; Falconar, Andrew K; Weiskopf, Daniela","Chang, James (Center for Vaccine Innovation, La Jolla Institute for Immunology (LJI), La Jolla, CA 92037, USA); Agarwal, Rimjhim (Center for Vaccine Innovation, La Jolla Institute for Immunology (LJI), La Jolla, CA 92037, USA; Biomedical Sciences Graduate Program, School of Medicine, University of California San Diego (UCSD), La Jolla, CA 92037, USA); Côrtes, Fernanda H (Center for Vaccine Innovation, La Jolla Institute for Immunology (LJI), La Jolla, CA 92037, USA; Laboratory of AIDS and Molecular Immunology, Institute Oswaldo Cruz, Fiocruz, Rio de Janeiro, RJ 21040-360, Brazil); Ha, Calvin (Center for Vaccine Innovation, La Jolla Institute for Immunology (LJI), La Jolla, CA 92037, USA); Villalpando, John (Center for Vaccine Innovation, La Jolla Institute for Immunology (LJI), La Jolla, CA 92037, USA); Castillo, Izabella N.

Therefore, lifelong learning is a fundamental pillar of open and developed societies, where the educational offer aimed at all groups in society has only grown in recent decades due to the growing demands of the labor market, which seeks increasingly qualified job profiles (Chiva et al., 2015; Prestes and Diniz, 2015). Adult education, also known as second chance education or permanent education, is an educational modality designed to meet the training demands of adults who were unable to complete their secondary education during their previous stage as students. In addition, these centers share some of the most common problems of the Spanish educational system. School failure is a transversal problem in both educational modalities and its reduction is one of the great challenges for the future of education in Spain. In this sense, the promotion of permanent education has become an essential pillar of the educational policies of the countries (Prestes and Diniz, 2015). This work analyzes how these educational institutions influence the educational and professional trajectories of their students and the consequent improvement of their professional training and their academic merits.",,,KNOW AND SHARE PSYCHOLOGY,,,,2023-01-31,2023,2023-01-31,,4,1,,All OA; Bronze,Article,"Águila, Marco José Rueda; Martínez-Martínez, Ana María","Águila, Marco José Rueda (Universidad de Almería); Martínez-Martínez, Ana María (Universidad de Almería)",,"Águila, Marco José Rueda (University of Almería); Martínez-Martínez, Ana María (University of Almería)",0,0,,,https://ojs.ual.es/ojs/index.php/KASP/article/download/8683/7653,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1155083539,"39 Education; 3901 Curriculum and Pedagogy; 3902 Education Policy, Sociology and Philosophy",4 Quality Education

invariants in real materials. Since the spin does not in general commute with
the Hamiltonian, some of the topological features of the material can be
extracted from its study. In insulating materials, the spin operator induces a
projected operator on valence states called the spin valence operator. Its
spectrum contains information with regard to the different phases of the spin
Chern class. If the spin valence spectrum is gapped, the spin Chern numbers are
constant along parallel planes thus defining spin Chern insulating materials.
If the spin valence spectrum is not gapped, the changes in the spin Chern
numbers occur whenever this spectrum is zero. Materials whose spin valence
spectrum is gapless will be denoted spin Weyl topological insulators and their
definition together with some of their properties will be presented in this
work. The classification of materials from the properties of the spin valence
operator provides a characterization that complements the existing list of
topological invariants.",,,arXiv,,,,2023-09-21,2023,,,,,,All OA; Green,Preprint,"Gonzalez-Hernandez, Rafael; Uribe, Bernardo","Gonzalez-Hernandez, Rafael (); Uribe, Bernardo ()",,"Gonzalez-Hernandez, Rafael (); Uribe, Bernardo ()",0,0,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1164347454,51 Physical Sciences; 5104 Condensed Matter Physics,

We estimated a hybrid discrete choice model for the new cable car service considering social capital as a latent variable and a stated preference survey issued before the cable car implementation. Social capital is measured through six domains associated with membership of civic groups, social networks, interpersonal trust, institutional trust, cooperation, and empowerment. Results suggest that the social capital stock in the influence zone of the cable car depends principally on age, sex, education level, and time living in the neighborhood. Results also show that higher social capital stocks are associated with a greater willingness to use the new cable car service, suggesting that social capital is a potential determinant for mode choice. Finally, we discuss implications for social capital and policymaking.","Declaration of Competing Interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

The data for the variables were obtained from the CT inspection database of the Social Security Sub-directorate of Regulation and Management of Health Research which includes minutes and inspection reports. We describe the characteristics of the CT included and findings during the inspections using relative and absolute frequencies. Likewise, we evaluated the feasibility of virtual inspection through a self-administered questionnaire.ResultsAccording to the findings of the inspection, 60% of CTs were on biological products, and 60% were focused on infectiology. Additionally, 64% of CTs were implemented in Lima, 52% were conducted in level IV health facilities, and 72% were funded by the pharmaceutical sector. The lack of submission of requested documents (16/25) and inadequate access to the internet (9/15) and source documents (4/15) were the primary observations during the inspection. Regarding the feasibility of virtual supervisions, most interviewees rated their understanding of instruction form as “normal” and its content as “adequate.” Similarly, in the virtual self-assessment matrix, a large proportion of interviewees rated comprehension as “normal” (7/15) and its content as “adequate” (13/15). The quality of the virtual supervision process was 8.6 ± 1.1 on a scale of 1–10.ConclusionDiscrepancies in records and failure to submit requested documents were the main observations. Most interviewees considered the material to be adequate and gave an overall good rating to the virtual inspection process.",,This was a self-financed study.,Therapeutic Innovation & Regulatory Science,,,Humans; COVID-19; Peru; Pandemics; Feasibility Studies; Hospitals,2023-03-28,2023,2023-03-28,2023-07,57,4,678-688,All OA; Bronze,Article,"Herrera-Añazco, Percy; Urrunaga-Pastor, Diego; Soto-Ordoñez, Suly; Torres, Fernando; Dávila, Luis Manuel López; del Carpio Toia, Agueda Muñoz","Herrera-Añazco, Percy (Instituto de Evaluación de Tecnologías en Salud e Investigación-IETSI, EsSalud, Lima, Peru; Universidad Privada del Norte, Trujillo, Peru); Urrunaga-Pastor, Diego (Instituto de Evaluación de Tecnologías en Salud e Investigación-IETSI, EsSalud, Lima, Peru; Unidad para la Generación y Síntesis de Evidencias en Salud, Universidad San Ignacio de Loyola (USIL), Lima, Peru); Soto-Ordoñez, Suly (Instituto de Evaluación de Tecnologías en Salud e Investigación-IETSI, EsSalud, Lima, Peru); Torres, Fernando (Pedro de Elizalde General Children’s Hospital, Buenos Aires, Argentina); Dávila, Luis Manuel López (Department of Medical Sciences, Centro de Investigaciones de las Ciencias de la Salud-CICS, Member of the Bioethics Committee in Health Research USAC, Universidad de San Carlos de Guatemala-USAC, Guatemala, Guatemala); del Carpio Toia, Agueda Muñoz (Escuela de Postgrado, Escuela de Medicina Humana, Vicerrectorado de Investigación Universidad Católica de Santa María, Arequipa, Peru; Instituto de Ética Clínica Francisco Vallés, Madrid, Spain)","Herrera-Añazco, Percy (EsSALUD; Private University of the North)","Herrera-Añazco, Percy (EsSALUD; Private University of the North); Urrunaga-Pastor, Diego (EsSALUD; Universidad San Ignacio de Loyola); Soto-Ordoñez, Suly (EsSALUD); Torres, Fernando (Pedro de Elizalde General Children’s Hospital, Buenos Aires, Argentina); Dávila, Luis Manuel López (University of San Carlos of Guatemala); del Carpio Toia, Agueda Muñoz (Catholic University of Santa María; Instituto de Ética Clínica Francisco Vallés, Madrid, Spain)",1,1,,,https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s43441-023-00503-7.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1156562329,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3202 Clinical Sciences,

A total of 3196 young people and adults between 18 and 56 years of age (mean = 25.88; SD = 8.81) from three cities in Peru were selected by non-probabilistic purposive sampling and divided into two phases: exploratory (n = 642) and confirmatory (n = 2527). The methodology used was network analysis to determine internal structure and reliability. Evidence in relation to another variable was explored by latent network modeling using Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-2) and Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD-2) as convergence measures. The results reveal that the SWB is a unidimensional measure both in its exploratory phase by Exploratory Graphical Analysis (EGA) and confirmatory (CFI = 1.00; RMSEA = 0.00). The reliability obtained through structural consistency identified that 100% of the time only one dimension was obtained; in addition, the items were stable because they replicated within the empirical dimension in all cases. The relationship with the PHQ-2 (r =  − .44) and GAD-2 (r =  − .34) maintained the expected direction and strength. The current data lays the groundwork for future research on subjective well-being in Peru, particularly because we now have a quick, valid, and reliable measure that can contribute to the scientific literature on subjective well-being, which is an intriguing construct to investigate due to its association with basic human needs and the prevention of mental health problems in a community.",,,Trends in Psychology,,,,2023-01-03,2023,2023-01-03,,,,1-15,All OA; Bronze,Article,"Ventura-León, José; Sánchez-Villena, Andy Rick; Caycho-Rodríguez, Tomás","Ventura-León, José (Facultad de Ciencias de La Salud, Universidad Privada del Norte, Av.

In particular, we determine that the event horizon surfaces are stable except for the extremal case and we corroborate the appearance of a new extremality condition at the Planck scale that contributes to hints about the possible existence of a final stage after the black hole evaporation process. We find explicit expressions for the area and surface gravity of the event horizon and we show the existence of an exact form dS with the surface gravity as integrating factor, in contrast to a previous no-go result for axially symmetric spacetimes with null charge. As a consequence, we are able to derive a formula for the state function S as the sum of the area of the classical event horizon plus a quantum correction linear in ℏ and logarithmic in the classical area, in accordance with other approaches. We finally calculate an explicit formula for the Komar mass at the event horizon, and we compare it with the total mass at infinity for a wide domain of values of the black hole parameters M, Q and w¯, showing a loss of mass which can be interpreted as a consequence of the antiscreening effect of the gravitational field between the event horizon and infinity.",The authors wish to thank Professor Martin Reuter from Mainz Institute of Physics for stimulating discussions and ideas about this work.

The present study also uses the notion of face to investigate the use of Danke ‘thanks’, Dankbarkeit ‘thankfulness’, and danken ‘to thank’ in expressions of gratitude in Old Saxon and Old High German, laying the foundations to a better understanding of the speech act of thanking in the history of German. The data suggest that, although the manifestation of gratitude was common, the expressions containing Danke, Dankbarkeit, and danken could mostly be found when the addresser was in a lower social position than the addressee. The same situation was observed when these nouns and verbs were used with the meaning of “to reward” and “to praise.” These findings provide evidence to the claim that the effects of a speech act on the speaker’s or hearer’s face are mostly situational rather than being an intrinsic property. They also suggest that, in strictly hierarchical societies such as the Old Saxon and Old High German ones, addressers would threaten their own negative face only if they were in a lower social position than the addressees.",,,Research Square,,,,2023-04-24,2023,2023-04-24,,,,,All OA; Green,Preprint,"Concu, Valentina","Concu, Valentina (Universidad del Norte)",,"Concu, Valentina (Universidad del Norte)",0,0,,,https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-1766075/latest.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1157484743,"47 Language, Communication and Culture; 4703 Language Studies; 4704 Linguistics",

The monotonic compressive load tests were carried out before and after performing a displacement-controlled cyclic load test to determine the impact of cycling on unit base resistance. Digital images of the sand and the model pile were taken during cyclic loading and processed using the digital image correlation (DIC) technique to obtain the cumulative displacement and strain fields in the sand domain. The results show that the ultimate unit base resistance can drop significantly after cycling. The magnitude of the drop in ultimate unit base resistance depends on both the magnitude of the cyclic displacement amplitude and the number of cycles. However, the unit base resistance at plunging increases after large-displacement half-amplitude cycling. The increase in unit base resistance at plunging after cycling is linked to the flow of sand particles to the zone below the conical base, the occurrence of sand particle crushing, and the dilative behavior of the sand outside a bulb of crushed particles formed during cyclic loading. The processed DIC data show that for cyclic displacement half-amplitudes ∆wcyclic less than or equal to 0.25 mm (0.0007B), the cumulative radial and vertical displacements in the soil domain normalized by ∆wcyclic are negligible. Values of ∆wcyclic greater than 0.25 mm produce normalized displacements in the soil domain that increase as the cyclic displacement amplitude increases.",,Open Access funding provided by Colombia Consortium.,Acta Geotechnica,,,,2023-03-15,2023,2023-03-15,2023-09,18,9,4747-4766,All OA; Hybrid,Article,"Galvis-Castro, Ayda C.; Tovar-Valencia, Ruben D.; Prezzi, Monica; Salgado, Rodrigo","Galvis-Castro, Ayda C.

Unfortunately, not all organisations have sufficient resources to achieve an adequate technological implementation, causing them to lag behind the market, affecting their competitiveness, as is the case of Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs). Therefore, the aim of this research is to establish which are the main technological developments, from the 4.0 technology approach, that have the potential to support the improvement of production processes in SMEs, in order to provide alternatives for their improvement through their implementation. To achieve this objective, a bibliometric review was carried out using specialised software, followed by a literature review and web analysis, in order to determine the needs, in technological terms, that SMEs have, taking as a reference those located in the Metropolitan Area of Bucaramanga, Colombia.

1229,pub.1154259085,10.1016/j.quascirev.2022.107939,,,Fluvial responses to late Holocene hydroclimate variability in the midcontinental United States,"Long-term relationships between mean-state climatic conditions and flood frequencies in the midcontinental United States (US) are not well established because instrumental records of fluvial processes are limited to the current warm period (CWP; the last ca. 150 years) and continuous paleo-flood records are exceedingly rare. Here, we investigate climate-flood relationships in the midcontinental US by reconstructing flood frequencies at Half Moon Pond, a 1600-year-old oxbow lake on the lower White River, Indiana (watershed = ca, 29,000 km2). We used sediment accumulation rates and clastic fluxes constrained by high-resolution radiocarbon (14C) dating. Frequent flooding, as indicated by high sedimentation rates and clastic fluxes to Half Moon Pond, occurred leading up to and during the Medieval Climate Anomaly (MCA; 950–1250 CE) when paleoclimate records suggest the predominance of ocean-atmosphere mean states resembling the negative phases of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (-PDO-like) and Pacific North American Mode (-PNA-like). Reductions in sedimentation rates and clastic fluxes, indicating reduced flooding, subsequently occurred during the transition out of the MCA and into the Little Ice Age (LIA; 1250–1830 CE) as ocean-atmosphere conditions shifted to + PDO-like and +PNA-like mean states. Sedimentation rates and clastic fluxes increased again after ca. 1800 CE, indicating increased flooding during the CWP as ocean-atmosphere conditions returned to -PDO-like and -PNA-like mean states. The White River trends were notably antiphased with sedimentation-rate-based flood frequencies for the lower Ohio River (500,000 km2 watershed) prior to 1830 CE. This antiphased relationship is consistent with flooding in moderate to small watersheds in the Midwest being sensitive to the occurrence of rainstorm events, which were more frequent leading up to and during the MCA, and flooding in large watersheds being more sensitive to large spring melts associated with extensive snowpacks, which characterized the LIA. That both the White and Ohio rivers experienced their most frequent flooding during the CWP suggests deforestation and changing land use practices increased flooding on Midwestern watersheds across scales despite a current climatic mean state that in the past only resulted in increased flooding on moderate to small watersheds. Continued increased in midcontinental rainfall are therefore likely to enhance the occurrence of floods in Midwestern watersheds across different geographic scales.","Financial support for this research was provided by the National Science Foundation (EAR 1903628), The Nature Conservancy (Award 2041–0002), and The Indiana Department of Natural Resources, (award 34068).",,Quaternary Science Reviews,,,,2023-02,2023,,2023-02,301,,107939,All OA; Bronze,Article,"Wright, Maxwell N.; Bird, Broxton W.; Gibson, Derek K.; Pollard, Harvie; Escobar, Jaime; Barr, Robert C.","Wright, Maxwell N.

However, the factors and mechanisms that control this transition vary among continents and regions. Here, we analyzed which factors best explain the transition in northern South America (Llanos ecoregion and northwestern Amazon), where common thresholds on typical environmental factors (for example, mean annual precipitation (MAP), wet season precipitation) fail to predict it. For instance, savannas in the Llanos occur at MAP levels (> 1500 mm) which are typical of forests in other tropical regions. We examined the transition’s climate features, soils, and disturbance (fire frequency) spaces using remotely sensed data. We used logistic generalized linear models to assess the effect of seasonal (season length) and intra-seasonal (daily precipitation frequency and intensity) precipitation metrics during the dry season, soil silt content, and fire frequency, on the transition using canopy cover, tree cover, and the maximum Plant Area Volume Density as vegetation structure descriptor variables. Fire frequency and precipitation frequency were the most important variables explaining the transition. Although most fires occur in savannas, we found that a significant percentage of savanna pixels (46%) had no fires. This study indicates that the transition should be characterized regionally in response to biogeographic differences (for example, climatic space) among regions and continents. Our results highlight the importance of fire frequency and intra-seasonal precipitation in determining the transition in northern South America. Furthermore, future studies should consider regional differences in the climatic space of forest and savanna to improve projections of global change impacts on these highly diverse ecosystems.","The authors thank Catalina González (Universidad de los Andes) and Carlos Jaramillo (Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute) for their comments on an earlier version of this manuscript.

Essentially, to put in a simple short slogan, DEI empowers companies to better support their employees and help meet the needs of people from all walks of life (Sternfels et al., 2022). This explains the increasing recognition given by the corporate world to the people around them. Marriott, with their “We put people first” as their foremost slogan in the 5 core values, has put undeniable efforts in contributing their employees’ and visitors’ wellness (Marriott, n.d. -a). As a multinational behemoth within the hospitality industry, Marriott has dedicated themselves in making sure the doors of their own hotels to be open to any people from diverse backgrounds; ensuring equal access to opportunities; and actively surpass themselves in the service they provide to cater the needs of different people in the society. However, the question still rises: Whether they have done enough for their employees to feel taken care of, and their customers feel their needs being satisfied?This paper aims to answer the question aforementioned, and assess Marriott's effort in upholding and promotion of DEI values in four key aspects from the contemporary model raised by Beach and Segars (2022): representation, participation, application and appreciation, to identify current insufficiencies with room to be improved upon, which enables to formulate recommendations on directions that the company could polish on in order to better, if not solve the issue. This report utilized a majority of secondary sources, either in the form of official websites and reports on their DEI performance issued by Marriott International themselves, or news articles, reports, regulatory forms and social media published by other reliable sources.The essay is dissected into several parts: (i) Diversity; (ii) Equity; (iii) Inclusion; under each of the parts we further utilize the core values suggested by Beach and Segars to further discuss Marriott's performance under the umbrella of DEI, and in turns give out specific recommendations on pathways Marriott can investigate on to solve the issues raised in the discussion.The investigation demonstrates how Marriott’s efforts in DEI initiatives have shown impressive results in their performance as an industry leader, yet there is still room for improvement in some dimensions; particularly in addressing the gender pay gaps, implementing leadership rotations, and enhancing public awareness campaigns and feedback mechanisms. If Marriott analyzes these flaws and works actively to solve them, they will be close in accomplishing the goals of DEI.",,,SSRN Electronic Journal,,,,2023,2023,2023,,,,,All OA; Green,Preprint,"Leung, Maverick; Lanza, Valerie Velilla; Yao-Fang, Krystal Hu; McEntire, Kimberly; Calderaro, Jason","Leung, Maverick (The University of Hong Kong); Lanza, Valerie Velilla (Universidad del Norte, Students); Yao-Fang, Krystal Hu (National Chengchi University (NCCU)); McEntire, Kimberly (Utah State University); Calderaro, Jason (Kennesaw State University, Students)",,"Leung, Maverick (University of Hong Kong); Lanza, Valerie Velilla (Universidad del Norte, Students); Yao-Fang, Krystal Hu (National Chengchi University); McEntire, Kimberly (Utah State University); Calderaro, Jason (Kennesaw State University)",0,0,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1167245026,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3504 Commercial Services",10 Reduced Inequalities

Esta situación, ha sido impulsada por fenómenos como la pandemia por COVID-19, acelerando aún más la necesidad de implementación de nuevas tecnologías para el aumento de la productividad empresarial. Desafortunadamente, no todas las organizaciones cuentan con los recursos suficientes para lograr una adecuada implementación tecnológica, haciendo que las mismas se rezaguen respecto al mercado,  afectando su competitividad, como lo es el caso de las Pequeñas y Medianas Empresas PYMES. Por ello, la presente investigación tiene por objetivo Establecer cuáles son los principales desarrollos tecnológicos, desde el enfoque de la tecnología 4.0, que cuentan con potencial de apoyo al mejoramiento de procesos productivos en PYMES, con el fin de brindar alternativas para el mejoramiento de los mismos a partir de su implementación. Para alcanzar este objetivo, se realizó una revisión bibliométrica a partir de software especializado, seguido de una revisión de literatura y análisis web, con el fin de determinar las necesidades, en términos tecnológicos, que poseen las PYMES, tomando como referencia las ubicadas en el Área Metropolitana de Bucaramanga, Colombia. Finalmente, se destaca como principal resultado la vigilancia y mapeo de tecnologías, además de importantes recomendaciones para futuros desarrollos en el área. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- Technological development in organisations is advancing by leaps and bounds. This situation has been driven by phenomena such as the COVID-19 pandemic, further accelerating the need to implement new technologies to increase business productivity. Unfortunately, not all organisations have sufficient resources to achieve an adequate technological implementation, causing them to lag behind the market, affecting their competitiveness, as is the case of Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs). Therefore, the aim of this research is to establish which are the main technological developments, from the 4.0 technology approach, that have the potential to support the improvement of production processes in SMEs, in order to provide alternatives for their improvement through their implementation. To achieve this objective, a bibliometric review was carried out using specialised software, followed by a literature review and web analysis, in order to determine the needs, in technological terms, that SMEs have, taking as a reference those located in the Metropolitan Area of Bucaramanga, Colombia. Finally, the main result is the monitoring and mapping of technologies, as well as important recommendations for future developments in the area.",,,,"Proceedings INNODOCT/22.

When the multiskilling plans are structured using k-chaining policies, it is possible to obtain the maximum flexibility to match the uncertain workforce demand. This work evaluates the potential benefits of multiskilled workers using a k-chaining policy with k ≥ 2 , considering the learning/forgetting phenomena to model a heterogeneous workforce. We propose a deterministic mixed-integer programming model to compute the level of required multiskilling. The mathematical formulation determines how many workers should be single-skilled and multiskilled, which task types they should be trained in, the allocation of working hours, and the expected productivity of each worker on each week of the planning horizon. We test our methodology on a case study using real, processed, and simulated data from a Chilean retail store. We perform three experiments, comparing them: zero multiskilling, k-chaining with k ≥ 2 and homogeneous workforce, and k-chaining with k ≥ 2 and heterogeneous workforce. We consider nine variability levels in the workforce demand for each experiment. The results show that modeling the workforce as homogeneous leads to underestimating the multiskilling level required to minimize understaffing. Incorporating heterogeneous workforce modeling through the learning-forgetting phenomena suggests more multiskilling to compensate for the lower workers’ productivity. We consider this solution is closer to the actual operation of the store. We also perform a sensitivity analysis on the learning rate parameter to evaluate the stability of the report solutions for each variability level.","Declaration of interest The authors report there are no competing interests to declare.

The biofouling begins when the adhesins (an anchor-type epitope made up of polar and charged amino acids) on microbial appendages bind to the surface. Two different compounds-dodecyl-β-D-maltoside (DDM) and methyl α-d-mannopyranoside (MeαMan)-were investigated as possible biofilm mitigation tools due to their documented anti-adhesin properties in the biomedical field. DDM prevented up to 56.3, 87.0, and 67.6% of the formation of Pseudomonas putida, Escherichia coli and wastewater culture biofilms, respectively, in microplate experiments. MeαMan increased biofilm in the microplates. In a biofilm reactor setting, DDM was then applied on typical membrane materials, polyvinylidene fluoride, polyamide, polyether-sulfone, and polyacrylonitrile and prevented 79.4, 62.5, 81.3, and 68.2% of the detectable wastewater culture biofilm formation, respectively. The mechanism of anti-adhesion was the binding of the polar head of the DDM to the polar amino acids of the microbial appendages in conjunction with the orientation of the DDM as it binds different membrane materials. If the anti-adhesins are effective at increasing the distance of the bacteria from the membrane materials, they will serve as a new method for delaying biofouling.","Declaration of competing interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

While Zahavi presents the experiential dimension of the self as the foundation and core of the self, and therefore of personal identity, one wonders if this experiential self cannot be complemented by a stronger notion of self, which I call the personal core. Firstly, I will present Zahavi’s account on personal identity. Secondly, I will propose that such a personal core is given as a phenomenological fact, that is, it is revealed by the very experience of the self. Finally, I will argue that this personal nucleus, which is the foundation of the other dimensions of the self and of personal identity, can be complemented with the other two dimensions of the self, developed by Zahavi.",,,Investigaciones Fenomenológicas,,,,2023-12-21,2023,2023-12-21,,,20,117-140,All OA; Hybrid,Article,"Lombardi, Agustina María","Lombardi, Agustina María (Pontificia Universidad Católica Argentina - CONICET)",,"Lombardi, Agustina María (Pontifical Catholic University of Argentina)",0,0,,,https://revistas.uned.es/index.php/rif/article/download/36056/28581,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1171109987,50 Philosophy and Religious Studies; 5004 Religious Studies,

However, the estimates of long-term exposure to air pollution are scarce in the region. We developed intraurban land use regression (LUR) models to map long-term exposure to fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) in the five largest cities in Colombia. We conducted air pollution measurement campaigns using gravimetric PM2.5 and passive NO2 sensors for two weeks during both the dry and rainy seasons in 2021 in the cities of Barranquilla, Bucaramanga, Bogotá, Cali, and Medellín, and combined these data with geospatial and meteorological variables. Annual models were developed using multivariable spatial regression models. The city annual PM2.5 mean concentrations measured ranged between 12.32 𝛍g/m3 and 15.99 𝛍g/m3 while NO2 concentrations ranged between 24.92 𝛍/m3) and 49.15 𝛍g/m3. The PM2.5 annual models explained 82% of the variance (R2) in Medellín, 77% in Bucaramanga, 73% in Barranquilla, 70% in Cali, and 44% in Bogotá. The NO2 models explained 65% of the variance in Bucaramanga, 57% in Medellín, 44% in Cali, 40% in Bogotá, and 30% in Barranquilla. Most of the predictor variables included in the models were a combination of specific land use characteristics and roadway variables. Cross-validation suggest that PM2.5 outperformed NO2 models.

This study provides a high-resolution spatially disaggregated on-road transportation emissions inventory in Colombia from 1990 to 2020. Our estimates followed a top-down approach that accounted for local characteristics such as fleet technology, fuel consumption, road infrastructure, and activity factors at a national and state level. We report annual CO2, CH4, NOx, VOCs, PM2,5, and black carbon at a spatial resolution of 0.01° x 0.01°. Economic crises (1998–2001), stringent emission requirements (2011), and the most recent sanitary quarantine (2020) all have an impact on emissions patterns, which grow at a slower rate than vehicle activity. For the annual emissions of CH4, CO, and PM2.5, the growth of motorbikes in the vehicle fleet is particularly crucial.","Declaration of Competing Interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

1188,pub.1155716543,10.1016/j.tra.2023.103618,,,"Analysing a license plate-based vehicle restriction policy with optional exemption charge: The case in Cali, Colombia","Several cities have restricted the use of private vehicles based on the last digit of a vehicle's license plate to reduce traffic congestion and pollution. However, the effectiveness of this measure has been questioned. In 2017, a hybrid scheme, License Plate Restriction Charging (LPRC), was implemented in Cali, Colombia. With this scheme, drivers can pay a charge (monthly, quarterly, or yearly) to circumvent the restriction, while the revenue is used to subsidise the BRT System. Cali was the first city in Latin America to implement such a scheme, while Colombia's capital, Bogota, adopted a similar policy in 2020. This article analyses the evolution of the measure using official information. In addition, we conducted a stated preferences survey and estimated a choice model to evaluate the behaviour of car owners to policy variables. Results show that LPRC price is the most relevant attribute in decision-making. Increasing the number of days with traffic restrictions and extending the hours of vehicle use restriction increases drivers' probability of paying for the LPRC. As currently implemented in Cali, the LPRC is a fixed cost that does not vary according to the car use level, encouraging users who pay for the exemption to use their car as much as possible to make the most out of the payment. Furthermore, the revenue from the charge contributes only marginally to financing the BRT. Finally, we propose several changes in the policy to improve its efficiency. Among them, consider a daily payment and hardening the current driving restriction.",Declaration of Competing Interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.,,Transportation Research Part A Policy and Practice,,,,2023-04,2023,,2023-04,170,,103618,All OA; Hybrid,Article,"Soto, Jose J.; Macea, Luis F.; Cantillo, Victor","Soto, Jose J.

1186,pub.1155353122,10.1007/s12095-022-00625-z,,,On recovering block cipher secret keys in the cold boot attack setting,"This paper presents a general strategy to recover a block cipher secret key in the cold boot attack setting. More precisely, we propose a key-recovery method that combines key enumeration algorithms and Grover’s quantum algorithm to recover a block cipher secret key after an attacker has procured a noisy version of it via a cold boot attack. We also show how to implement the quantum component of our algorithm for several block ciphers such as AES, PRESENT and GIFT, and LowMC. Additionally, since evaluating the third-round post-quantum candidates of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) post-quantum standardization process against different attack vectors is of great importance for their overall assessment, we show the feasibility of performing our hybrid attack on Picnic, a post-quantum signature algorithm being an alternate candidate in the NIST post-quantum standardization competition. According to our results, our method may recover the Picnic private key for all Picnic parameter sets, tolerating up to 40% of noise for some of the parameter sets. Furthermore, we provide a detailed analysis of our method by giving the cost of its resources, its running time, and its success rate for various enumerations.",,Open Access funding provided by Colombia Consortium,Cryptography and Communications,,,,2023-02-13,2023,2023-02-13,,,,1-25,All OA; Hybrid,Article,"Banegas, Gustavo; Villanueva-Polanco, Ricardo","Banegas, Gustavo (Inria and Laboratoire d’Informatique de l’Ecole polytechnique, Institut Polytechnique de Paris, Palaiseau, France); Villanueva-Polanco, Ricardo (Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Universidad del Norte, KM 5 Via Puerto Colombia, 081007, Barranquilla, Atlántico, Colombia)","Villanueva-Polanco, Ricardo (Universidad del Norte)","Banegas, Gustavo (Institut Polytechnique de Paris); Villanueva-Polanco, Ricardo (Universidad del Norte)",0,0,,,https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s12095-022-00625-z.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1155353122,49 Mathematical Sciences; 4901 Applied Mathematics; 4904 Pure Mathematics,

Therefore, this paper addresses the conditions for estimating sensitivities of voltage magnitudes with respect to complex (active and reactive) electric power injections based on sensor measurements. These sensitivities represent submatrices of the inverse power flow Jacobian. We extend previous results to show that the sensitivities of a bus voltage magnitude with respect to active power injections are unique and different from those with respect to reactive power. The classical Newton-Raphson power flow model is used to derive a novel representation of bus voltage magnitudes as an underdetermined linear operator of the active and reactive power injectionsparameterized by the bus power factors. Two conditions that ensure the existence of unique complex power injections given voltage magnitudes are established for this underdetermined linear system, thereby compressing the solution space. The first is a sufficient condition based on the bus power factors. The second is a necessary and sufficient condition based on the system eigenvalues. We use matrix completion theory to develop estimation methods for recovering sensitivity matrices with varying levels of sensor availability. Simulations verify the results and demonstrate engineering use of the proposed methods.","The authors thank the reviewers for their valuable feedback that significantly improved the manuscript. S.

1184,pub.1160814536,10.1016/j.quascirev.2023.108214,,,The evolution of the Maya coastal landscape in the Mexican Caribbean during the last 6200 years,"The modern configuration of tropical coastlines is a result of changes in sea level and regional hydroclimates during the Holocene. In some regions, such as the Yucatan Peninsula, human occupation has also played an important role in defining coastal dynamics. We use a multiproxy analysis of a 6200-year-long sedimentary record from La Encantada lagoon, located near the Bay of Chetumal, Mexican Caribbean, to reconstruct local and regional environmental dynamics. By characterizing the record in terms of pollen and charcoal content, and geochemical composition, we aim to determine the relative importance of sea level rise, long term trends of moisture availability, and anthropic influences in the evolution of the Mayan coastal landscape. Our findings indicate a dominance of marine influences between ∼6200 and 5000 cal yr. BP, probably resulting from the rapidly rising sea level. During this time, whereas the water column was brackish, fluvial dynamics seem characterized by high erosion and the development of riparian mangroves. The geochemical record indicates a millennial-scale trend towards drier conditions, likely associated with the southward migration of the Intertropical Convergence Zone through the Holocene. This trend is also reflected in a progressive increase in the abundance of deciduous taxa in the vegetation. Centennial-scale climatic dynamics, on the other hand, seem associated with variability of the North Atlantic Subtropical High. Anthropogenic influence is evident around ∼5000 cal yr. BP, when local fires became more frequent and riparian mangroves were depleted. Taxa associated with human influence substantially increased at ∼3600 cal yr. BP, coinciding with an erosion increase indicated by the geochemical record. At ∼2200 cal yr. BP, anthropic disturbance indicators decrease, suggesting a potential role of modified agricultural practices to control soil erosion. The last ∼1000 years have been characterized by a decline of agricultural activity and a recovery of the riparian mangroves, suggesting modern vegetation is a result of forest recovery during the last millennium. Overall, our results show that sea level rise and changes in the regional hydroclimate modulate the evolution of the regional landscape, particularly through influences on the sedimentation rates. However, human occupation represents an overpowering influence that can modulate processes associated with natural forcings.",Declaration of competing interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

In this manner, the carbon footprint and final cost are minimized by replacing aggregates and reducing cement. A challenge in this study was using high-celite phase available cement and avoiding the alkali-silica reaction. The Box–Wilson design and Derringer–Suich optimization were used to create an RPC mixture with a low cement content and high-volume waste glass dosage that achieved a compressive strength of more than 120 MPa. It was demonstrated that having all ground waste glass particles smaller than 1000 µm is not sufficient to prevent the alkali-silica expansion. Furthermore, commercially available cement with a high celite proportion had a modest beneficial influence on the compressive strength at an early-age but a significant detrimental impact on the RPC’s compressive strength at 28 days. Finally, the current study proved the potential of manufacturing an RPC that satisfied the strength threshold criterion while utilizing a local cement with over 12% celite and a substantial volume of waste glass powder comprising more than half of the RPC weight.","The authors extend their appreciation to Researcher Supporting Project number (RSPD2023R692), King Saud University, Riyadh, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.",Open Access funding provided by Colombia Consortium.,Archives of Civil and Mechanical Engineering,,,,2023-06-01,2023,2023-06-01,,23,3,161,All OA; Hybrid,Article,"Abellan-Garcia, Joaquin; Redondo-Mosquera, Jesús; Khan, M.

Results suggest that the association between fear of disease and support for COVID-19 preventive behaviors was strongest when trust in the government was weak (both at individual and country-level). Conversely, the association with empathic prosocial concern was strongest when trust was high, but this moderation was only found at individual-level scores of governmental trust.

The magnetization and MR measurements are both highly anisotropic and indicate an Ising-like magnetic system. The magnetic structure is complex in that it involves two magnetic ordering vectors, including an incommensurate spin density wave and commensurate ferrimagnetic state in zero field. We have discovered a large anomalous Hall conductivity that reaches ≈430Ω−1cm−1, implying that it originates from an intrinsic Berry curvature effect stemming from Weyl nodes found in the electronic structure. These electronic structure calculations indicate the presence of nested Fermi surface pockets with nesting wave vectors like the measured magnetic ordering wave vector and the presence of Weyl nodes in proximity to the Fermi surface. We associate the incommensurate magnetic structure with the large anomalous Hall response to be the result of the combination of Fermi surface nesting and the Berry curvature associated with Weyl nodes.","C.D. acknowledges the helpful discussion with M.

1144,pub.1155793225,10.2139/ssrn.4371973,,,At the Risk of Loss: Experimental Evidence on the Discriminant (In-) Validity of Self-Reported Measures of Risk Preferences,"In recent years, the use of experimentally validated self-reported items for the measurement of individuals' risk preferences has been on the rise. Although previous research has confirmed the convergent validity of such self-reported items, we argue that self-reported risk preference measures lack discriminant validity. That is, such measures may be confounded with other constructs, such as loss aversion, leading to serious endogeneity problems. Using three samples from two independently designed studies, we show that the discriminant validity of self-reported items measuring risk preference is indeed low, which affects the overall validity of such items. Specifically, we show that even when controlling for incentivized measures of risk preferences, which remove correlations caused by associations of the underlying latent construct and thus focus on measurement-related confounds, self-reported measures of risk preferences are substantially associated with incentivized measures of loss aversion. We apply our theorizing to a reinterpretation of the results of a study previously published in this journal, and then present a simple procedure that exploits individual heterogeneity in the strength of the confounding effect to test the validity of studies using self-reported measures of risk preference.",,,SSRN Electronic Journal,,,,2023,2023,2023,,,,,All OA; Green,Preprint,"Zambrano-Curcio, Andrés Felipe; Urbig, Diemo; Bönte, Werner; Schmutzler, Jana","Zambrano-Curcio, Andrés Felipe (); Urbig, Diemo (Brandenburg University of Technology Cottbus-Senftenberg); Bönte, Werner (affiliation not provided to SSRN); Schmutzler, Jana (Universidad del Norte - Business School)",,"Zambrano-Curcio, Andrés Felipe (); Urbig, Diemo (Brandenburg University of Technology Cottbus–Senftenberg); Bönte, Werner (affiliation not provided to SSRN); Schmutzler, Jana (Universidad del Norte - Business School)",0,0,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1155793225,52 Psychology; 5205 Social and Personality Psychology,

We use Fourier multiplier techniques to derive new characterizations in terms of the R-boundedness of the operator-valued symbol associated to each abstract model, when endowed with the time-fractional Liouville-Grünwald derivative. As a consequence of our characterization, we give new insights into the differences between the models based on the structure of the respective operator-valued symbols and show novel applications by including several classes of operators other than the Laplacian.","Acknowledgements C.

Somas of sensory neurons that project through the vagal nerve are located in the nodose ganglion. The presence of purinergic receptors has been reported in neurons and satellite glial cells in several sensory ganglia. In the nodose ganglion, calcium depletion-induced increases in neuron activity can be partly reversed by P2X7 blockers applied directly into the ganglion. The later suggest a possible role of P2X7 receptors in the modulation of neuronal activity within this sensory ganglion. We aimed to characterize the response to P2X7 activation in nodose ganglion neurons under physiological conditions. Using an ex vivo preparation for electrophysiological recordings of the neural discharges of nodose ganglion neurons, we found that treatments with  ATP  induce transient neuronal activity increases. Also, we found a concentration-dependent increase in neural activity in response to Bz-ATP (ED50 = 0.62 mM, a selective P2X7 receptor agonist), with a clear desensitization pattern when applied every ~ 30 s. Electrophysiological recordings from isolated nodose ganglion neurons reveal no differences in the responses to Bz-ATP and ATP. Finally, we showed that the P2X7 receptor was expressed in the rat nodose ganglion, both in neurons and satellite glial cells. Additionally, a P2X7 receptor negative allosteric modulator decreased the duration of Bz-ATP-induced maximal responses without affecting their amplitude. Our results show the presence of functional P2X7 receptors under physiological conditions within the nodose ganglion of the rat, and suggest that ATP modulation of nodose ganglion activity may be in part mediated by the activation of P2X7 receptors.",,"This work was supported by Grants from the National Fund for Scientific and Technological Development (FONDECYT) #1160227 (MAR), #1220950 (RDR), and #1130177 (JA) and the Basal Centre of Excellence in Aging and Regeneration (AFB 170005 and ACE 210009).

Current orbiting constellation satellites have brightnesses between apparent magnitudes 4 and 6, whereas in the near-infrared Ks band, they can reach magnitude 2 (ref. 2). Satellite operators, astronomers and other users of the night sky are working on brightness mitigation strategies3,4. Radio emissions induce further potential risk to ground-based radio telescopes that also need to be evaluated. Here we report the outcome of an international optical observation campaign of a prototype constellation satellite, AST SpaceMobile’s BlueWalker 3. BlueWalker 3 features a 64.3 m2 phased-array antenna as well as a launch vehicle adaptor (LVA)5. The peak brightness of the satellite reached an apparent magnitude of 0.4. This made the new satellite one of the brightest objects in the night sky. Additionally, the LVA reached an apparent V-band magnitude of 5.5, four times brighter than the current International Astronomical Union recommendation of magnitude 7 (refs. 3,6); it jettisoned on 10 November 2022 (Universal Time), and its orbital ephemeris was not publicly released until 4 days later. The expected build-out of constellations with hundreds of thousands of new bright objects1 will make active satellite tracking and avoidance strategies a necessity for ground-based telescopes.","S.E. and C.E.W. acknowledge the support of the IAU CPS SatHub.

Herein, we conducted a genome survey sequencing in N. brevirostris and determined genome size, explored repetitive elements, assembled and annotated the 45S rRNA DNA operon, and assembled and described in detail the mitochondrial genome. Lastly, the phylogenetic position of N. brevirostris in the family Carcharhinidae was examined using translated protein coding genes. The estimated haploid genome size ranged between 2.29 and 2.58 Gbp using a k-mer analysis, which is slightly below the genome size estimated for other sharks belonging to the family Carcharhinidae. Using a k-mer analysis, approx. 64-71 % of the genome of N. brevirostris was composed of repetitive elements. A relatively large proportion of the 'repeatome' could not be annotated. Taking into account only annotated repetitive elements, Class I - Long Interspersed Nuclear Element (LINE) were the most abundant repetitive elements followed by Class I - Penelope and Satellite DNA. The nuclear ribosomal operon was fully assembled. The AT-rich complete mitochondrial genome was 16,703 bp long and encoded 13 protein coding genes, 2 ribosomal RNA genes, and 22 transfer RNA genes. Negaprion brevirostris is closely related to the genera Carcharhinus, Glyphis and Lamiopsis in the family Carcharinidae.

Bacterial communities are dynamic and respond directly to changes in abiotic conditions; among these communities, poly-extremophiles are particularly sensitive to perturbations due to their high specialization. Salar de Huasco is a high-altitude wetland located on the Chilean Altiplano exhibiting several conditions considered extreme for life, including negative water balance, extreme variations in temperature and pH values, high UV radiation, and the presence of various toxic metal(oids). However, previous reports have revealed a diverse bacterial community that has adapted to these conditions, here, we aimed to determine whether microbial community diversity and composition changed in response to geographical and seasonal variations. We found that there are significant differences in diversity, abundance, and composition in bacterial taxa that could be attributed to local geographical and seasonal variations, which in turn, can be associated with microbial traits. In conclusion, in this poly-extreme environment, small-scale changes can trigger significant changes in the microbial communities that maintain basic biogeochemical cycles. Further in depth analysis of microbial functionality and geo-ecological dynamics are necessary to better understand the relationships between seasonal changes and bacterial communities.",We thank Michael G.

However, the coverage rates of diagnostic codes and their variability across institutions are underexplored.   Objective Primary objective was to describe lab- and diagnosis-based labels for 7 selected outcomes at three institutions. Secondary objectives were to describe agreement, sensitivity, and specificity of diagnosis-based labels against lab-based labels.   Methods  This study included three cohorts: SickKids Peds from The Hospital for Sick Children, and Stanford Peds and Stanford Adults from Stanford Medicine. We included seven clinical outcomes with lab-based definitions: acute kidney injury, hyperkalemia, hypoglycemia, hyponatremia, anemia, neutropenia and thrombocytopenia. For each outcome, we created four lab-based labels (abnormal, mild, moderate and severe) based on test result and one diagnosis-based label. Proportion of admissions with a positive label were presented for each outcome stratified by cohort. Using lab-based labels as the gold standard, agreement using Cohen’s Kappa, sensitivity and specificity were calculated for each lab-based severity level.    Results  The number of admissions included were: SickKids Peds (n=59,298), Stanford Peds (n=24,639) and Stanford Adults (n=159,985). The proportion of admissions with a positive diagnosis-based label was significantly higher for Stanford Peds compared to SickKids Peds across all outcomes, with odds ratio (99.9% confidence interval) for abnormal diagnosis-based label ranging from 2.2 (1.7-2.7) for neutropenia to 18.4 (10.1-33.4) for hyperkalemia. Lab-based labels were more similar by institution. When using lab-based labels as the gold standard, Cohen’s Kappa and sensitivity were lower at SickKids Peds for all severity levels compared to Stanford Peds .    Conclusions Across multiple outcomes, diagnosis codes were consistently different between the two pediatric institutions. This difference was not explained by differences in test results. These results may have implications for machine learning model development and deployment.",,This study did not receive any funding.,medRxiv,,,,2023-03-17,2023,2023-03-17,,,,2023.03.14.23287202,All OA; Green,Preprint,"Guo, Lin Lawrence; Morse, Keith E.; Aftandilian, Catherine; Steinberg, Ethan; Fries, Jason; Posada, Jose; Fleming, Scott Lanyon; Lemmon, Joshua; Jessa, Karim; Shah, Nigam; Sung, Lillian","Guo, Lin Lawrence (Program in Child Health Evaluative Sciences, The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, ON); Morse, Keith E.

Thus, to strengthen this process, it is possible to identify school buildings' most favourable environmental conditions and consider them when designing and constructing infrastructure for educational purposes. This has motivated research to determine how the environmental factors of school buildings influence the teaching-learning processes. This study aims to systematically organise, classify, categorise, and analyse the existing literature on the environmental conditions of classrooms and their influence on students' learning processes. Thus, future researchers will have a helpful guide to define the elements to consider when studying, analysing, and determining the environmental variables in school buildings that favour learning. Consequently, 71 studies classified in a scheme comprising categories designed to ensure an in-depth analysis of the most relevant topics in this area of research were considered. The results present multiple research opportunities in this field of study. The main conclusions are that the countries with the most significant interest in researching this topic are in Europe or Asia, with a common motivation to explore the adaptations necessary for the change in season. In contrast, the study variables of the most significant interest were associated with thermal comfort. Finally, it is concluded that these studies, in most cases, do not measure variables related to learning or identifying a variable of potential study to define environmental conditions.",Declaration of competing interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.,,Building and Environment,,,,2023-03,2023,,2023-03,231,,110051,All OA; Hybrid,Article,"Arroyo, Yesica Paola Villarreal; Peñabaena-Niebles, Rita; Correa, Carmen Berdugo","Arroyo, Yesica Paola Villarreal (Industrial Engineering Department, Universidad del Norte, Colombia); Peñabaena-Niebles, Rita (Industrial Engineering Department, Universidad del Norte, Colombia); Correa, Carmen Berdugo (Industrial Engineering Department, Universidad del Norte, Colombia)","Arroyo, Yesica Paola Villarreal (Universidad del Norte)","Arroyo, Yesica Paola Villarreal (Universidad del Norte); Peñabaena-Niebles, Rita (Universidad del Norte); Correa, Carmen Berdugo (Universidad del Norte)",7,7,,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.buildenv.2023.110051,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1154965366,33 Built Environment and Design; 40 Engineering,

1098,pub.1160562504,10.48550/arxiv.2307.03541,,,Observation of the anomalous Hall effect in a layered polar semiconductor,"Progress in magnetoelectric materials is hindered by apparently contradictory
requirements for time-reversal symmetry broken and polar ferroelectric
electronic structure in common ferromagnets and antiferromagnets. Alternative
routes could be provided by recent discoveries of a time-reversal symmetry
breaking anomalous Hall effect in noncollinear magnets and altermagnets, but
hitherto reported bulk materials are not polar. Here, we report the observation
of a spontaneous anomalous Hall effect in doped AgCrSe$_2$, a layered polar
semiconductor with an antiferromagnetic coupling between Cr spins in adjacent
layers. The anomalous Hall resistivity 3 $\mu\Omega$ cm is comparable to the
largest observed in compensated magnetic systems to date, and is rapidly
switched off when the angle of an applied magnetic field is rotated to $\sim
80^{\circ}$ from the crystalline $c$-axis. Our ionic gating experiments show
that the anomalous Hall conductivity magnitude can be enhanced by modulating
the $p$-type carrier density. We also present theoretical results that suggest
the anomalous Hall effect is driven by Berry curvature due to noncollinear
antiferromagnetic correlations among Cr spins, which are consistent with the
previously suggested magnetic ordering in AgCrSe$_2$. Our results open the
possibility to study the interplay of magnetic and ferroelectric-like responses
in this fascinating class of materials.",,,arXiv,,,,2023-07-07,2023,,,,,,All OA; Green,Preprint,"Kim, Seo-Jin; Zhu, Jihang; Piva, Mario M.; Schmidt, Marcus; Fartab, Dorsa; Mackenzie, Andrew P.; Baenitz, Michael; Nicklas, Michael; Rosner, Helge; Cook, Ashley M.; González-Hernández, Rafael; Šmejkal, Libor; Zhang, Haijing","Kim, Seo-Jin (); Zhu, Jihang (); Piva, Mario M.

Utility-based accessibility to evaluate transport policies,"There is now a long tradition of accessibility research, with an increasingly rich set of frameworks and methods from a distributional perspective. Despite such a positive outlook, many accessibility metrics deployed in research and practice do not consider (dis)utility, which may resonate more clearly with mainstream transport decision-making and planning. This paper seeks to contribute to debates about using utility-based measures as inputs for accessibility assessment of transport infrastructure investments in the Global South using discrete choice modeling and its potential as a bridging language between socially nuanced and economics-driven transport planning practices. This paper uses mixed revealed preferences and stated preferences data collected in Bogotá, Colombia. Then, it uses a logsum accessibility metric to estimate the differentiated impact of a set of infrastructure interventions on the accessibility of residents with different income levels and other socioeconomic conditions. Particularly, the logsum accessibility metric analyses future and structural additions to Bogotá public transport networks, reflecting their effect on the accessibility and consumer surplus in the next 20 years. The proposed approach captures the benefits derived from the transport infrastructure improvements, which has relevance for debates about transport policy and practice in this and similar urban contexts in the Global South. These accessibility gains could be assigned a monetary value to include in project cost-benefit assessments.","Acknowledgments We would like to express our gratitude to the Bogotá Urban Planning Department (www.sdp.gov.co), for the funding and general support given for the development of this study through agreement 369 of 2018.",,Journal of Transport Geography,,,,2023-10,2023,,2023-10,112,,103683,All OA; Hybrid,Article,"Guzman, Luis A.; Cantillo-Garcia, Victor A.; Oviedo, Daniel; Arellana, Julian","Guzman, Luis A.

The sample consisted of 323 Venezuelan migrants, of whom 147 (45.5%) were men. The participants were residents of the city of Santiago, Chile. The variables assessed were psychological well-being, identity fusion with host country, positive social interaction, and psychological kinship. Structural equation modeling was performed to estimate the proposed mediation model. The estimation method used was robust weighted least squares estimation. The first model showed that people who felt more fused with the host country had higher levels of psychological well-being. On the other hand, the second estimated model indicated that both positive social interaction and psychological kinship fully mediate the relationship between identity fusion with the host country and immigrants’ psychological well-being. It is not the mere sensation of feeling merged with the host country that increases the psychological well-being of migrants, but rather it is the positive social interactions and feeling that members of the host country are like family that are the components that link the fusion with the host country and the psychological well-being of Venezuelan migrants in Chile.",,"This publication is derived from the project FONDECYT Regular #1180315, funded by the National Agency for Research and Development (ANID) of the Government of Chile, who had no influence on the results of this publication.",Trends in Psychology,,,,2023-02-22,2023,2023-02-22,,,,1-20,All OA; Bronze,Article,"Henríquez, Diego; Urzúa, Alfonso","Henríquez, Diego (Escuela de Psicología, Universidad Católica del Norte, Avda.

Therefore, 28 sediment samples from northern Chile were analyzed, calculating the Abnormality Index-FAI and its spatio-temporal distributions in benthic foraminifera, as well as the minimum and maximum abnormality percentages and their relationship with heavy metal concentrations, using a generalized non-linear model and a principal component analysis. The results indicated a proportion of abnormal shells within the ranges described for polluted areas conditions, revealing environmental stress conditions. This reflected a change in the environmental conditions in the most recent sediments of the bay. The highest FAI values were observed to the southwest of the bay, caused by the local current system. The species Bolivina seminuda, Buliminella elegantissima, and Epistominella exigua presented a greater number of deformities, allowing them to be used as contamination biomarkers. A significant correlation was found between Ti, Mn, Ni, Va, and Ba with decreased chamber sizes, wrong coiling, scars, and number of abnormality types. This suggests the effect of the particular geochemical conditions of the area on the heavy metals that cause toxic effects on foraminifera. These analyses are an efficient tool for identifying the effects of environmental stress before they occur in higher organisms, mitigating the environmental impact on marine biodiversity.","To FONDECYT project 1130511 directed by Dr. Rubén Escribano for obtaining the sediment core samples and to Professor Jorge Valdés for obtaining the sediment dredge samples.

The city of 15 models seeks to ensure that urban development is sustainable. This paper evaluates the current state of mobility and the use of sustainable transport in the specific context of the city of Antofagasta, which, due to its characteristics of urban expansion and its mining activity, has been considered an international reference case. In particular, we study how the current urban structure shapes the city’s travel patterns and identify opportunities for public policy actions to focus their investment and urban intervention efforts on the essential aspects that make it possible to achieve 15- or 20-min territories. The results reveal the need for urban development initiatives to focus on improving the supply of goods and services in areas with low installed capacity, promoting the culture of micro-neighbourhoods, and encouraging cycling. In particular, only 10% of trips, for all purposes and all modes of transport, are completed in less than 15 min. And about 58% of trips, for all purposes and all modes, are completed in less than 30 min. In the marginal effects of the multinomial logit model, a one-unit increase in travel time increases the probability of choosing to travel by public transport by 63% and decreases the probability of walking by 41%.","The authors are grateful to the project, MINEDUC UCN-19101, for Postdoctoral Research, of the Academic Vice-Rectory and the Faculty of Economics and Administration of the Universidad Católica del Norte.

their electronic structure, which results in a zero anomalous Hall coefficient.
On the other hand, compensated magnets with noncollinear or canted moments or
altermagnets can yield a nonzero anomalous Hall signal and a nondissipative
transversal current. While high-symmetry systems typically exhibit an isotropic
Hall effect, more interesting are low-symmetry systems, such as hematite, which
demonstrates exceptional magnetotransport behavior as it becomes conductive
upon slight Ti doping. We scrutinize the magnetotransport in Titanium-doped
hematite, revealing a pronounced and unconventional symmetry dependence,
particularly contingent on crystal orientation. Our findings establish a
compelling correlation between our experimental observations and the
classification of hematite as an altermagnet with anisotropic magnetotransport

The success of the treatment depends largely on the appropriate storage medium that ensures the viability of the periodontal cells. The purpose of this review was to identify the most efficient media to store and transport avulsed permanent teeth, according to the viability of the periodontal ligament cells. Methods: The Scopus, Web of Science and PubMed electronically searched using the keywords “Storage media”; “Avulsed teeth”; and “Periodontal ligament”. The inclusion criteria were in vitro studies and articles published in English. The exclusion criteria were literature reviews, studies in primary teeth, studies in animals, and cell culture studies. Results: Hank’s saline solution and honey were equally effective, maintaining a cell viability rate of 98.89% and 96.43%, respectively, over a period of 3 hours. Ringer’s lactate solution maintained the viability of 906.40 viable cells/mm3 at 1 hour. Propolis maintained the viability of 285,000 cells/mm3 at 45 minutes, and the Neem extract maintained a cell viability rate of 88% at 30 minutes.

This paper proposes an novel approach to tackle the multiple outputs problems by using multi-output regression model (MORM) and providing some insights into the relations between dosages and their outputs via partial dependence plots. A UHPFRC database with 980 mixtures designs with 34 features and two outputs, namely the strain at peak tensile stress and energy absorption capacity is used to verify the propose approach. The MORM with three estimators, namely XGBoost Regressor, Decision Tree Regressor and Gradient Boosting Regressor is trained and tested. Three quantitative measures (R 2 , MAE and RMSE) are employed to evaluate the accuracy and the obtained results are superior to previous study. Among the results found, the greater feasibility of deformed high-strength steel macrofibers to achieve their exceptional values can be highlighted. On the one hand, the energy absorption capacity directly depends on the cementitious matrix’s quality. On the other hand, the strain at peak tensile stress decreases with the improvement of the matrix’s compressive strength to around 200 MPa. From this resistance, the trend is reversed due to an exponential improvement caused by the improvement in the bond strength between fiber and matrix. The proposed method could be properly used for the optimization of new UHPFRC dosages.",Declaration of Competing Interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

kagome magnet GdV6Sn6 charge carriers are investigated using de Haas van Alphen
(dHvA) oscillations measurements and electronic band structure calculations.
The temperature and angle-dependent torque magnetometry measurements revealed
at least nine different frequencies ranging from ~10 T up to ~9000 T. These
frequencies correspond to extremal areas of the Fermi surface ranging from ~0.2
% up to 50% of the first Brillouin zone, qualitatively consistent with the
electronic band structure calculations. The angle dependent dHvA oscillation
frequencies indicate that the smaller pockets of the Fermi surface have almost
3D character whereas the bigger pockets of the Fermi surface are mostly
two-dimensional. We also find evidence of the presence of light (0.28(1) m0) as
well as heavy (2.37(18) m0) charge carriers through the analysis of the
temperature dependence of dominant frequencies. The comparison of the observed
frequencies with the electronic band structure calculations indicates that the
heavy masses correspond to saddle-point-like features of electronic band
structure at the M point. The observation of the multiple low frequencies and
the calculated contributions from various bands to such low frequencies prevent
the estimation of topological nature of bands containing lighter fermions. In
conclusion, our work reveals the features of a Fermi surface containing
enhanced mass fermions originated from saddle points in the electronic band
structure at the M point, which is inherent to kagome lattices.",,,arXiv,,,,2023-06-29,2023,,,,,,All OA; Green,Preprint,"Dhital, C.; Pokharel, G.; Wilson, B.; Kendrick, I.; Asmar, M.

A total of 5779 people recruited through non-probabilistic convenience sampling participated. To collect information, we used the Fear of COVID-19 Scale, Vaccine conspiracy beliefs Scale-COVID-19 and a single item of intention to vaccinate. A full a priori Structural Equation Model was used; whereas, cross-country invariance was performed from increasingly restricted structural models. The results indicated that, fear of COVID-19 positively predicts intention to vaccinate and the presence of conspiracy beliefs about COVID-19 vaccines. The latter negatively predicted intention to vaccinate against COVID-19. Besides, conspiracy beliefs about COVID-19 vaccines had an indirect effect on the relationship between fear of COVID-19 and intention to vaccinate against COVID-19 in the 13 countries assessed.

The government's short-term measures, such as increasing groundwater extraction (by 383 % from 1997 to 2022), are exacerbating the situation, leading to long-term hydrological deterioration. The objective of this research is to establish the main processes driving the water table depth evolution within Central Chile over the period 1979-2023. This is done by conducting groundwater balances on five major hydrological basins of Central Chile. For the Megadrought (MD) period (2010-2022), the groundwater level depths reflect not only the recharge variability but, especially, the forcing trend of groundwater withdrawals: they represent 35 % and 65 %, respectively, of the total phreatic level drawdown. This result underlines the dominant role played by groundwater withdrawals in the current delicate state of Central Chile's groundwater resources, while revealing that drought is a new complex phenomenon to deal with, in the midterm, to revert the current water resource trend in Central Chile. Our study moreover presents the impact of climate change in the basin in the framework of six different groundwater withdrawal scenarios. In the worst case (i.e., RCP8.5), the aquifer recharge decreases 18 % with respect to 1979-1997, which is the period assumed to be unaffected by the impact of MD and withdrawals. Such a reduction may be irrelevant in the dynamics of the aquifer system if the current extraction rate does not change. The estimated recovery time needed to reach aquifer conditions equal to those of the unaffected period is approximately 50 years.","Declaration of competing interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

We investigate diaspore morphological traits in high-Andean Compositae and their main abiotic and biotic drivers and test whether they play a role in species distribution patterns across the naturally fragmented high-Andean grasslands.
METHODS: We collected diaspore trait data for 125 Compositae species across 47 tropical high-Andean summits, focusing on achene length and pappus-to-achene length ratio, with the latter as a proxy of dispersal investment. We analysed the role of abiotic (temperature, elevation and latitude) and biotic factors (phylogenetic signal and differences between tribes) on diaspore traits and whether they are related to distribution patterns across the Andes, using phylogenomics, distribution modelling and community ecology analyses.
KEY RESULTS: Seventy-five percent of the studied species show small achenes (length <3.3 mm) and 67% have high dispersal investment (pappus length at least two times the achene length). Dispersal investment increases with elevation, possibly to compensate for lower air density, and achene length increases towards the equator, where non-seasonal climate prevails. Diaspore traits show significant phylogenetic signal, and higher dispersal investment is observed in Gnaphalieae, Astereae and Senecioneae, which together represent 72% of our species. High-Andean-restricted species found across the tropical Andes have, on average, the pappus four times longer than the achene, a significantly higher dispersal investment than species present only in the northern Andes or only in the central Andes.
CONCLUSIONS: Small achenes and high diaspore dispersal investment dominate among high-Andean Compositae, traits typical of mostly three tribes of African origin; but traits are also correlated with the environmental gradients within the high-Andean grasslands. Our results also suggest that diaspore dispersal investment is likely to shape species distribution patterns in naturally fragmented habitats.","We thank Jorge Jacome for plot data collection in Colombia as part of the GLORIA-Andes network and Celeste Lottigier for her help in sorting out the material for DNA sequencing.

Currently, there is an intense aquaculture industry of Mytilus spp. on the Southeast Pacific Coast which depends entirely on the spat released by natural populations forming a relevant and sensitive social-ecological system. Temporal and spatial spat variability from natural mussel beds could be related to interannual reproductive dynamics with variable reproductive success and recruitment, which leave genetic signatures. Temporal and spatial genetic structure was evaluated in six natural beds in the Southeast Pacific (from 39°25’S to 43°07’S) on the most abundant and widespread Mytilus lineage detected, Mytilus cf. chilensis, in 4 consecutive years. Analyses included data from >180 individuals per year, with a total of 751 (mitochondrial COI) and 747 (nuclear H1) individuals, respectively. Overall, both markers showed high haplotype diversity and low spatial and temporal genetic differentiation. Likely, the high dispersal capacity of Mytilus cf. chilensis maintains population homogeneity and prevents diversity erosion. The slight differences in genetic variance of COI were better explained by differences among sites (space), and conversely, the H1 genetic variance was better explained by interannual (temporal) comparisons, which could explain temporal variability in spat availability. This study highlights the important insights achieved with the evaluation of both temporal and spatial population genetic structures in marine species with high reproductive output, which can condition the success and sustainability of the relevant social-ecological system.","We thank Natalia Muñoz, Francisca Gálvez, Daniel Aliste, and especially Raúl Vera for their assistance with fieldwork and sample processing.

However, conventional polystyrene-based cell culture substrates have adverse effects on cardiomyocytes in vitro due to the stress applied by a stiff substrate on contractile cells. Ultra-high viscosity alginates offer a unique versatility as tunable substrates for cardiac cell cultures due to their biocompatibility, flexible biofunctionalization, and stability. In this work, we analyzed the effect of alginate substrates on hPSC-CM maturity and functionality. Alginate substrates in high-throughput compatible culture formats fostered a more mature gene expression and enabled the simultaneous assessment of chronotropic and inotropic effects upon beta-adrenergic stimulation. Furthermore, we produced 3D-printed alginate scaffolds with differing mechanical properties and plated hPSC-CMs on the surface of these to create Heart Patches for tissue engineering applications. These exhibited synchronous macro-contractions in concert with more mature gene expression patterns and extensive intracellular alignment of sarcomeric structures. In conclusion, the combination of biofunctionalized alginates and human cardiomyocytes represents a valuable tool for both in vitro modeling and regenerative medicine, due to its beneficial effects on cardiomyocyte physiology, the possibility to analyze cardiac contractility, and its applicability as Heart Patches.",ACKNOWLEDGMENTS We thank Dr. Ralf Kettenhofen for critically assessing the manuscript and for insightful discussions.

Though the salient intellectual tradition since Hobbes has focused on how institutional design is used to eradicate violence, our framework illustrates that equilibrium constitutions may in fact have to deliberately allow for violence. This arises because some societies are unable to use institutions to influence income distribution. In this case, a constitutional tolerance of violence emerges as a credible way for an incumbent to meet the participation constraint of a challenger. We illustrate the results with the comparative constitutional history of the US and Colombia.",,,SSRN Electronic Journal,,,,2023,2023,2023,,,,,All OA; Green,Preprint,"Fergusson, Leopoldo; Mejia, Javier; Robinson, James; Torres, Santiago","Fergusson, Leopoldo (Universidad de los Andes, Colombia - Department of Economics); Mejia, Javier (Stanford University); Robinson, James (University of Chicago - Harris School of Public Policy); Torres, Santiago (University of Chicago)",,"Fergusson, Leopoldo (Universidad de Los Andes); Mejia, Javier (Stanford University); Robinson, James (University of Chicago); Torres, Santiago (University of Chicago)",0,0,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1163362725,44 Human Society; 4408 Political Science; 48 Law and Legal Studies,"16 Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions"

Its fossil record has been studied for almost a century and offers one of the best windows to the Neotropics terrestrial ecosystems during the Neogene. We have compiled all published studies and, using graphic correlation and a recently published geological map for the region, placed them into a composite standard section. Furthermore, we improved its chronostratigraphic control by analyzing new geochronological data (U-Pb in zircons) and developing a probabilistic age model using a Bayesian framework. The results suggest that most of the fossil assemblage of the Honda Group accumulated in a meandriform fluvial system (upper part of La Victoria Formation lower part of Villavieja Formation) that later shifted to an anastomosed system (upper part of Villavieja Formation). The c. 552-m-thick La Victoria Formation is younger than 16 Ma and older than 12.58 Ma, whereas the c. 569-m-thick Villavieja Formation is younger than 12.58 Ma and older than 10.52 Ma. The La Venta site is crucial for understanding Miocene paleoecological dynamics in northern South America, but despite decades of studies, it is still in the early phase of exploration. Stratigraphie d'un Lagersttte notropical du Miocne moyen (site de La Venta, Colombie). Le Konzentrat-Lagersttte du Miocne moyen du site de La Venta, situ dans le Groupe Honda, en Colombie, contient des informations inestimables sur la rponse biotique tropicale aux changements de la transition climatique du Miocne. Son registre fossile, tudi pendant prs d'un sicle, offre l'une des meilleures fentres sur les cosystmes terrestres notropicaux au cours du Nogne. Nous avons compil ici toutes les tudes publies, puis nous les avons replaces dans une coupe synthtique standard, rsultant de corrlations stratigraphiques et d'une carte gologique rcente. De plus, nous avons amlior son contrle chronostratigraphique en analysant de nouvelles donnes gochronologiques (U-Pb dans les zircons) et en dveloppant un modle d'ge probabiliste utilisant une mthode baysienne. Les rsultats suggrent que la plupart des assemblages fossiles du Groupe Honda se sont accumuls dans un systme fluvial mandriforme (partie suprieure de la Formation de La Victoria partie infrieure de la Formation de Villavieja) qui s'est ensuite dplac vers un systme anastomos (partie suprieure de la Formation de Villavieja). La Formation de La Victoria, d'une paisseur de 552 m, est plus rcente que 16 Ma et plus ancienne que 12,58 Ma, tandis que la Formation de Villavieja, d'une paisseur de 569 m, est plus rcente que 12,58 Ma et et plus ancienne que 10,52 Ma.

However, traffic safety concerns among pedestrians could reduce walking behaviour. Safety concerns are generally measured through risk perceptions. Unfortunately, a lack of theoretical development of risk perceptions in walking behaviour research has limited our capacity to identify groups of pedestrians who are inequitably affected and address their concerns. To address this gap, the present investigation identified various theory-driven risk dimensions (i.e., mechanism of injury, temporal risk dimensions, and information processing). Logistic and hierarchical linear regression analyses were used to investigate the effect of the risk dimensions on walking behaviour while considering psychosocial factors (e.g., attitudes and social norms). The findings suggest that policymakers and practitioners should consider both objective and perceived pedestrian safety to promote sustainable mobility. Older adults require particular attention as they are inequitably affected by objective and subjective risks.",Declaration of Competing Interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.,,Transportation Research Part D Transport and Environment,,,,2023-03,2023,,2023-03,116,,103590,All OA; Hybrid,Article,"Rod, J.E.; King, Mark; Oviedo-Trespalacios, Oscar","Rod, J.E.

992,pub.1158196270,10.1016/j.eswa.2023.120498,,,A multi-channel approach for detecting tampering in colour filter images,"Most devices capable of capturing photographs are provided with a Colour Filter Array (CFA). Images generated by these devices can be analysed to detect the so known CFA artefacts left by demosaicing methods. These artefacts are important in digital image forensics since they prove useful for determining the authenticity of an image. Previous works have focused exclusively on the analysis of the green band of the Bayer filter, neglecting the information in the remaining bands. In this work a process to estimate the pattern left by CFA artefacts regardless of their configuration is proposed, which can be used regardless of the size or colours used by the filter, or even in different colour spaces, obtaining in this way new sources of information for forensic analysis. A review and comparisons against state-of-the-art projects addressing the detection of manipulations using CFA artefacts are performed. The sensitivity of these proposals to post-processing methods such as compression and filtering will also be reviewed. We will also observe experimentally that the proposed technique can detect manipulations even in images affected by high levels of JPEG compression.","Declaration of Competing Interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

distinctly different from conventional ferromagnets (FM) and antiferromagnets
(AF). AM have been actively researched in the last few years, but two aspects
so far remain unaddressed: (1) Are there realistic 2D single-layer
altermagnets? And (2) is it possible to functionalize a conventional AF into AM
by external stimuli? In this paper we address both issues by demonstrating how
a well-known 2D AF, MnP(S,Se)$_3$ can be functionalized into strong AM by
applying out-of-plane electric field. Of particular interest is that the
induced altermagnetism is of a higher even-parity wave symmetry than expected
in 3D AM with similar crystal symmetries. We confirm our finding by
first-principles calculations of the electronic structure and magnetooptical
response. We also propose that recent observations of the time-reversal
symmetry breaking in the famous Fe-based superconducting chalchogenides, either
in monolayer form or in the surface layer, may be related not to an FM, as
previously assumed, but to the induced 2D AM order. Finally, we show that
monolayer FeSe can simultaneously exhibit unconventional altermagnetic
time-reversal symmetry breaking and quantized spin Hall conductivity indicating
possibility to research an intriquing interplay of 2D altermagnetism with
topological and superconducting states within a common crystal-potential
environment.",,,arXiv,,,,2023-09-05,2023,,,,,,All OA; Green,Preprint,"Mazin, Igor; González-Hernández, Rafael; Šmejkal, Libor","Mazin, Igor (); González-Hernández, Rafael (); Šmejkal, Libor ()",,"Mazin, Igor (); González-Hernández, Rafael (); Šmejkal, Libor ()",1,1,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1163876007,51 Physical Sciences; 5104 Condensed Matter Physics,

The groups presented similar predictors such as perceiving the relationship with professors as a stressor, reconciling study and leisure, carrying out extracurricular work, and relationships with the institution, and differed in the variables gender, age, type of university, current semester, and stressors such as many subjects to attend, taking tests and assignments, and relationships with colleagues. Thus, the groups differ in terms of sociodemographic and academic variables and academic stressors, and similarities occur with academic stressors.

Over the past few decades, there has been a gradual increase in the number of women entering the medical field. However, women remain underrepresented as first and last authors in medical journals. This lack of representation makes it harder for them to reach leadership roles and advance in their academic careers. Therefore, this study aims to investigate the gender distribution among authors and explore disparities in authorship in relation to the type of publication (original research, case reports, and review articles) as well as the authors’ geographic locations. Our analysis included 6,088 articles from 54 research journals sourced from Colombia’s Ministry of Health official website. These articles were predominantly original research articles, although case reports and reviews were also present. The analysis specifically focused on published research articles, as they are extensively studied in existing literature. Until now, there has been no assessment of gender disparities in authorship within medical and surgical specialty journals in Colombia. We could evidence persistent gender disparity in primary authorship in Colombia, regardless of the timeframe, location, or field of study. This emphasizes the urgent need for enhanced support for female researchers and equitable resource allocation to rectify regional imbalances. Furthermore, our findings highlight the imperative need to address gender disparities in authorship in medical and surgical research articles in Colombia and other Latin American countries.",Dra.

condensed-matter physics since the dawn of the band theory of solids. It
underpins established practical applications as well as current frontier
research, ranging from magnetic-memory technology to topological quantum
matter. Traditionally, lifted Kramers spin-degeneracy has been considered to
originate from two possible internal symmetry-breaking mechanisms. The first
one refers to time-reversal symmetry breaking by magnetization of ferromagnets,
and tends to be strong due to the non-relativistic exchange-coupling origin.
The second mechanism applies to crystals with broken inversion symmetry, and
tends to be comparatively weaker as it originates from the relativistic
spin-orbit coupling. A recent theory work based on spin-symmetry classification
has identified an unconventional magnetic phase, dubbed altermagnetic, that
allows for lifting the Kramers spin degeneracy without net magnetization and
inversion-symmetry breaking. Here we provide the confirmation using
photoemission spectroscopy and ab initio calculations. We identify two distinct
unconventional mechanisms of lifted Kramers spin degeneracy generated by the
altermagnetic phase of centrosymmetric MnTe with vanishing net magnetization.
Our observation of the altermagnetic lifting of the Kramers spin degeneracy can
have broad consequences in magnetism. It motivates exploration and exploitation
of the unconventional nature of this magnetic phase in an extended family of
materials, ranging from insulators and semiconductors to metals and
superconductors, that have been either identified recently or perceived for
many decades as conventional antiferromagnets.",,,arXiv,,,,2023-08-21,2023,,,,,,All OA; Green,Preprint,"Krempaský, J.; Šmejkal, L.; D'Souza, S.

U1-SCTRX-lg1a is a peptide isolated from a phospholipase D extracted from the spider venom of Loxosceles gaucho with antimicrobial activity against Gram-negative bacteria (between 1.15 μM to 4.6 μM). The aim of this study was to suggest potential receptors associated with the antimicrobial activity of U1-SCTRX-lg1a using in silico bioinformatics tools. Methods: The search for potential targets of U1-SCRTX-lg1a was performed using the PharmMapper server. Molecular docking between U1-SCRTX-lg1a and the receptor was performed using PatchDock software. The prediction of ligand sites for each receptor was conducted using the PDBSum server. Chimera 1.6 software was used to perform molecular dynamics simulations only for the best dock score receptor. In addition, U1-SCRTX-lg1a and native ligand interactions were compared using AutoDock Vina software. Finally, predicted interactions were compared with the ligand site previously described in the literature. Results and discussion: The bioprospecting of U1-SCRTX-lg1a resulted in the identification of forty-nine intracellular proteins originating from Gram-negative microorganisms. Among these, NH3-dependent NAD+ synthetase showed the highest dock score. This result suggests that the peptide derived from brown spider venom may interact with residues SER48 and THR160. In addition, the C-terminus has greater affinity for the receptor than the N-terminus. Conclusion: The in silico bioprospecting of receptors suggests that U1-SCRTX-lg1a may interfere with NAD+ production in Escherichia coli, a Gram-negative bacterium, altering the homeostasis of the microorganism and impairing growth.",,,Research Square,,,,2023-06-12,2023,2023-06-12,,,,,All OA; Green,Preprint,"de Oliveira, André Souza; Seif, Elias Jorge Muniz; Junior, Pedro Ismael da Silva","de Oliveira, André Souza (Butantan Institute); Seif, Elias Jorge Muniz (Butantan Institute); Junior, Pedro Ismael da Silva (Butantan Institute)",,"de Oliveira, André Souza (Instituto Butantan); Seif, Elias Jorge Muniz (Instituto Butantan); Junior, Pedro Ismael da Silva (Instituto Butantan)",1,1,,,https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-3043813/latest.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1159723386,31 Biological Sciences; 34 Chemical Sciences; 3404 Medicinal and Biomolecular Chemistry,

These ethnic groups have high vulnerability to disasters, not only due to their geographic location, but also because of inequities that exacerbate the vicious cycle of poverty. However, they have developed knowledge and tools to face these disasters that are responsive to their specific needs and should be incorporated into national and sub-national disaster risk reduction and management (DRRM) policies and strategies to ensure inclusion and institutionalization. This article aims to understand the current incorporation of the differential ethnic approach in the DRRM system of Colombia. A literature review of journal articles and grey literature directly relevant to the differential ethnic approach in DRRM in Colombia was conducted on December 2022 and January 2023. Out of 1067 records, only 20 were eligible: 15 (75.0%) grey literature and 5 (15.0%) journal articles. Majority of the records (19, 95.5%) were on disaster prevention or mitigation. Results showed that official national DRRM policies and plans recognize the cultural diversity of Colombia, mandating several activities that require the inclusion of ethnic minorities. Narratives of DRRM activities where ethnic minorities were involved were found. However, challenges in adopting the guidelines at the national and local levels were found, highlighting the need to increase efforts to strengthen the integration of the differential ethnic approach in the DRRM system. The low number of scoped records also highlights the lack of documentation, monitoring, evaluation, or research that can provide insights that can contribute to this topic.","Declaration of competing interest We declare that we have no financial or non-financial conflicts of interest related to this research.

The digitalization of society has given rise to an economic environment in which information, connectivity, and innovation play fundamental roles. In this context, a technology that has emerged as a fundamental pillar of the digital economy is the chain of blocks, commonly known as blockchain. Blockchain is a technology that has revolutionized the way online data and transactions are managed and shared. Through its ability to create secure, transparent, and decentralized ledgers, blockchain has paved the way for the digital economy, facilitating trust in digital transactions and enabling various applications ranging from cryptocurrencies to supply chain management and intellectual property. This study will delve into blockchain and its influence on the digital economy. It will explore how this technology has reshaped how companies interact, how consumers access services, and how new business models are developed in a constantly evolving digital environment. Additionally, the challenges and opportunities that blockchain presents in the context of the digital economy will be analyzed, and how it is helping to shape the future of business and society in general. As the exploration of blockchain and its impact on the digital economy progresses, it becomes evident how these two forces converge, generating a promising digital landscape full of significant opportunities and transformations. This phenomenon is consistently supported by a growing body of research and analysis, which underlines the growing influence of blockchain on the global economy (Smith, 2020; Johnson, 2019). The dynamic interplay between these two spheres, blockchain and the digital economy, constantly evolves and offers an exciting glimpse into the future regarding innovation and disruption across various sectors (Jones, 2021; Brown, 2018). As a result, significant opportunities are looming for those seeking to understand and capitalize on these emerging trends (García, 2022).

It is trained to understand and generate human language and is used in various applications, including automated customer service, chatbots, and content generation. While it has the potential to offer many benefits, there are also concerns about its potential for misuse, particularly in relation to providing inappropriate or harmful safety-related information. To explore ChatGPT's (specifically version 3.5) capabilities in providing safety-related advice, a multidisciplinary consortium of experts was formed to analyse nine cases across different safety domains: using mobile phones while driving, supervising children around water, crowd management guidelines, precautions to prevent falls in older people, air pollution when exercising, intervening when a colleague is distressed, managing job demands to prevent burnout, protecting personal data in fitness apps, and fatigue when operating heavy machinery. The experts concluded that there is potential for significant risks when using ChatGPT as a source of information and advice for safety-related issues. ChatGPT provided incorrect or potentially harmful statements and emphasised individual responsibility, potentially leading to ecological fallacy. The study highlights the need for caution when using ChatGPT for safety-related information and expert verification, as well as the need for ethical considerations and safeguards to ensure users understand the limitations and receive appropriate advice, especially in low- and middle-income countries.

For this reason, melts are often approximated by silicate glasses. Calculation of precise equilibrium Si and Fe isotopes fractionation factors between minerals and melt would indeed allow us to distinguish equilibrium fractionation from diffusion-driven kinetic fractionation involved in the iron and silicon isotopes signatures of Earth and other planets. In this study, we use for the first time, first-principles molecular dynamics based on density functional theory to determine iron and silicon isotope compositions of different silicate melts, namely: iron-rich basalt, iron-depleted basalt, basanite, trachyte and phonolite. The 57Fe/54Fe reduced partition function ratios (β-factors) of the different melts span over a 1.1 ‰ range at 1000 Kelvin (K) while 30Si/28Si β-factors are much less influenced by the melt composition with a 0.5 ‰ fractionation range at the same temperature. The main parameter controlling iron isotope fractionation in silicate melts having similar iron oxidation state is, after temperature, the average Fe-O bond length. The chemical environment around iron (e.g. Fe-Fe distances) is suggested to contribute to Fe isotope fractionation as well. Silicon isotopes fractionation seems also affected, but to a lesser extent, by its local chemical composition with decreasing Si-Fe distances leading to slightly higher Si β-factor in the melt. From these melts Fe and Si β-factors, a new set of equilibrium fractionation factors between a variety of minerals and melts has been calculated. These new Δ57Femin-melt and Δ30Simin-melt sets allow us to discuss whether processes such as fractional crystallization, partial melting and diffusion could be responsible for the documented Fe and Si isotopes variations in igneous rocks. Our results suggest that: 1) fractional crystallization may explain at least part of the Fe and Si isotopic evolution during magmatic differentiation, for values up to δ57Fe = 0.65 ‰ and δ30Si = -0.1 ‰, respectively, 2) partial melting of the upper mantle can produce the Mid-Ocean Ridge Basalts (MORB) iron isotopes signature. Finally, we calculated that olivine at equilibrium with a basaltic melt could display an iron isotope composition down to −0.1 ‰ for δ57Fe. Hence, the lower isotopic compositions (δ57Fe < -0.1 ‰) observed in natural olivines are most likely due to diffusion-driven kinetic fractionation.","We thank the associate editor Dr. Fang Huang and the three anonymous reviewers for their detailed and thoughtful reviews that improved this manuscript.

These results are mainly based on studies developed in medium‐to‐high sociocultural contexts. Thus, this study was conducted in a medium‐to‐low‐income area. The aim was to know the 4–5 years old children's motor development (both fine and gross motor skills), and its relation to language and mathematical development. A total of 219 Colombian Caribbean children (105 boys and 114 girls) aged 4 and 5 years participated in this study. Results revealed higher motor skills among girls, although differences by gender were not notable. Positive and significant correlations were found between motor skills and language and mathematical skills, although most of the correlations were weak or moderate. Also, it was observed that fine motor skills were less related to language or mathematical development in comparison with gross motor skills, especially among boys. These results suggest that among Colombian Caribbean children gross motor skills could have a higher influence on the development and acquisition of some language and mathematical skills in comparison with fine motor skills.","ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS This work, which is part of the first author&#x27;s doctoral thesis, is also framed in a project of applied research funded by the University of Castilla‐La Mancha, Spain (reference: 2022‐GRIN‐34290).",,Infant and Child Development,,,,2023-05-14,2023,2023-05-14,2023-07,32,4,,All OA; Hybrid,Article,"Rodríguez‐Guerrero, Yulmis Isabel; Gil‐Madrona, Pedro; León, María Pilar; Vásquez‐Cruz, Adrián Eduardo","Rodríguez‐Guerrero, Yulmis Isabel (Faculty of Education of Albacete, Department of Physical Activity, Arts Education and Music, University of Castilla‐La Mancha, Albacete, Spain); Gil‐Madrona, Pedro (Faculty of Education of Albacete, Department of Physical Activity, Arts Education and Music, University of Castilla‐La Mancha, Albacete, Spain); León, María Pilar (Faculty of Sports Sciences, Department of Physical Activity and Sport, University of Murcia, Murcia, Spain; Faculty of Education of Cuenca, Department of Physical Activity, Arts Education and Music, University of Castilla‐La Mancha, Cuenca, Spain); Vásquez‐Cruz, Adrián Eduardo (Faculty of Psychology, Autonomous University of Nuevo Leon, San Nicolás de los Garza, Mexico)","Gil‐Madrona, Pedro (University of Castilla-La Mancha)","Rodríguez‐Guerrero, Yulmis Isabel (University of Castilla-La Mancha); Gil‐Madrona, Pedro (University of Castilla-La Mancha); León, María Pilar (University of Murcia; University of Castilla-La Mancha); Vásquez‐Cruz, Adrián Eduardo (Universidad Autónoma de Nuevo León)",4,4,,,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1002/icd.2430,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1158045189,52 Psychology; 5201 Applied and Developmental Psychology; 5202 Biological Psychology; 5204 Cognitive and Computational Psychology,

An evaluation based on citizen science data,"To address environmental pollution by plastic litter, the European Union adopted EU Directive 2019/904, the so called ""Single-Use Plastics Directive"" (SUPD), which bans several single-use plastic products and addresses additional items with measures such as extended producer responsibility and obligatory requirements for product redesign. This study assessed the potential of the SUPD to reduce litter pollution in the environment with three scenarios. The ""best case"" scenario assumed that all measures of the SUPD completely prevent targeted items from getting into the environment. Another scenario assumed that no measures besides bans were effective. An intermediate scenario assumed partial effectiveness of measures. Data of almost 5,000 sampling events from citizen science protocols (Plastic Pirates, International Coastal Cleanup, Marine Litter Watch) and the OSPAR protocol were used to analyse litter at riversides and coastlines in Germany and the European Union. 44 to 68% of litter items in citizen science protocols consisted of single-use plastics (cigarette butts were the most prominent items). At coastlines sampled by the OSPAR protocol, fishing gear and undefined plastics prevailed. The scenario analysis revealed that substantial litter reductions could be achieved in the ""best case"" scenario (upwards of 40%), while the intermediate scenario resulted in litter reductions of 13 to 25%. The marginal effect of the ""only bans"" scenario achieved a reduction of 2-6% in Germany and the European Union, respectively. Thus, depending on implementation and enforcement, the current SUPD can be an important first step, yet further legislative actions are needed to effectively prevent plastic waste pollution.","Declaration of Competing Interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

Perhaps one of the most visible is the transformation of society towards greater digitisation. Digitalisation has gained weight in all aspects of our lives, and from the point of view of the health system we find an example in the slow historical adoption of telemedicine, which contrasts sharply with the massive conversion to this technology as a tool for social distancing. In this sense, the homebound population is the one most affected by the pandemic and the one that could benefit the most from the use of telemedicine. Using a netnography approach and based on the stimulus-organism-response paradigm, this study proposes to analyse the evolution of perception about telemedicine using the opinions expressed on Twitter. The primary technical tasks of the study incorporate the analysis of topics and the review of emotions and positive image perception using natural language processing. Specifically, tweets about telemedicine generated by the Spanish community are analysed in this work. The findings show that the COVID-19 pandemic has affected emotions and topics of interest related to telemedicine. This has changed the image that it had and the behaviour of the Twitter community in Spain. In conclusion, the study results suggest that changes in health systems affect people's emotions and behaviours.","Project financed with funds from the Junta de Andalucía (Consejería de Economía, Conocimiento, Empresas y Universidad), PAIDI: Proyectos I+D+i, with code P20_00587 of the University of Seville.",,Technological Forecasting and Social Change,,,,2023-02-15,2023,2023-02-15,2023-05,190,,122420,All OA; Bronze,Article,"Arenas Gaitán, Jorge; Ramírez Correa, Patricio E","Arenas Gaitán, Jorge (Universidad de Sevilla, Spain.); Ramírez Correa, Patricio E (Universidad Católica del Norte, Chile.)","Arenas Gaitán, Jorge (University of Seville)","Arenas Gaitán, Jorge (University of Seville); Ramírez Correa, Patricio E (Catholic University of the North)",4,4,,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.techfore.2023.122420,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1155381064,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 38 Economics",

However, little is known whether the ASSIST could be further shortened while remaining psychometrically sound across different countries, languages, gender identities, and sexual-orientation-based groups. The study aimed to validate a shortened 11-item ASSIST (ASSIST-11). Using the International Sex Survey data, 82,243 participants (M age = 32.39 years) across 42 countries and 26 languages completed questions from the ASSIST-11 regarding gender identity, sexual orientation, and other information. Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) and multigroup CFA (MGCFA) evaluated the ASSIST-11's structure and tested measurement invariance across groups. Cronbach's α and McDonald's ω were used to examine the internal consistency. Cohen's d and independent t-tests were used to examine known-group validity. The ASSIST-11 was unidimensional across countries, languages, age groups, gender identities (i.e., men, women, and gender-diverse individuals), and sexual orientations (i.e., heterosexual and sexual minority individuals). Cronbach's α was 0.63 and McDonald's ω was 0.68 for the ASSIST-11. Known-group validity was supported by Cohen's d (range between 0.23 and 0.40) with significant differences (p-values<0.001). The ASSIST-11 is a modified instrument with a unidimensional factor structure across different languages, age groups, countries, gender identities, and sexual orientations. The low internal consistency of the ASSIST-11 might be acceptable as it assesses a broad concept (i.e., use of several different substances). Healthcare providers and researchers may use the ASSIST-11 to quickly assess substance-use information from general populations and evaluate the need to follow up with more detailed questions about substance use.","Declaration of competing interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

Multiple ordinal logistic regression was performed with exposure variables from the COPSOQ and ProQoL domains; the outcome variables were the dimensions of the Quality of Work Life instrument. Ethical standards for research involving human subjects were ensured.Results According to the results of the multiple logistic model, quality of work life is predicted by job integration and predictability (OR = 6.93; 95%CI = 3.6–13.9), leisure time management and double presence (OR = 4.5; 95%CI = 1.22–8.79). Both job satisfaction and job security are related to leadership quality (OR = 3.82; 95%CI = 2.27–6.55 and OR = 3.18; 95%CI = 1.22–8.79) respectively.Conclusions The quality of work life of healthcare workers in adult intensive care units is predicted by quantitative demands, double presence, emotional demands, work pace, predictability, vertical trust, predictability, and quality of leadership.",,,Research Square,,,,2023-12-16,2023,2023-12-16,,,,,All OA; Green,Preprint,"Quiñones-Rozo, Laura del Pilar; Canaval-Erazo, Gladys Eugenia; Sandoval-Moreno, Lina Marcela","Quiñones-Rozo, Laura del Pilar (Universidad del Valle.

The objective of this study was to estimate the effectiveness of vaccines in preventing hospitalization and death from COVID-19 in Colombia under real-life conditions among people aged 18 years and older, according to sex, age, confirmed history of COVID-19 and vaccination series, including the effects of boosters. Methods: This investigation was an observational, retrospective, population-based study based on the Colombian cohort “Esperanza” (what means hop in Spanish). A total of 14,213,409 individuals aged 18 years and older were analyzed, who were matched in a 1:1 ratio of vaccinated to unvaccinated. The study groups consisted of unvaccinated individuals, those with a complete series (CS) and individuals with a CS plus booster. The vaccinated individuals received either homologous or heterologous vaccinations with Ad26.COV2-S, BNT162b2, ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, CoronaVac and mRNA-1273 vaccines. Follow-up was conducted between February 2021 and June 2022. Cox proportional hazards models were used, adjusted for potential confounders, to estimate the effectiveness of different vaccination series in preventing hospitalization and death. Results: For adults aged 18 years and older, the overall effectiveness of the vaccines in preventing hospitalization was 82.7% (95% CI 82.1 - 83.2) for CS and 80.2% (95%CI 78.7 - 81.6) for CS + booster. The effectiveness in preventing death was 86.0% (95%CI 85.5 - 86.5) for CS and 83.1% (95%CI 81.5 - 84.5) for CS + booster. Effectiveness decreased with age. While all efficacies were high, CoronaVac offered significantly lower protection, although this improved with a booster. Conclusions: Real-world evidence shows that the vaccines studied offer good protection for preventing hospitalization and death from COVID-19 among adults in Colombia. To control the pandemic, reduce the burden of disease and protect national health systems, mass vaccination should continue to be a strategic priority, especially in low- and middle-income countries.",,,SSRN Electronic Journal,,,,2023,2023,2023,,,,,All OA; Green,Preprint,"Rojas-Botero, Maylen; Niño, Julián Alfredo Fernández; Castillo, Leonardo Arregoces; Palacios-Clavijo, Andrés Felipe; Pinto-Alvarez, Mariana; Ruiz-Gómez, Fernando","Rojas-Botero, Maylen (Facultad Nacional de Salud Pública); Niño, Julián Alfredo Fernández (Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health); Castillo, Leonardo Arregoces (Pontificia Universidad Javeriana, Bogotá); Palacios-Clavijo, Andrés Felipe (Andres Felipe Palacios Clavijo); Pinto-Alvarez, Mariana (Fundación Universitaria Sanitas; Ministry of Health and Social Protection); Ruiz-Gómez, Fernando (Processum)",,"Rojas-Botero, Maylen (Facultad Nacional de Salud Pública); Niño, Julián Alfredo Fernández (Johns Hopkins University); Castillo, Leonardo Arregoces (Pontificia Universidad Javeriana); Palacios-Clavijo, Andrés Felipe (Andres Felipe Palacios Clavijo); Pinto-Alvarez, Mariana (Fundación Universitaria Sanitas; Ministry of Health and Social Protection); Ruiz-Gómez, Fernando (Processum)",0,0,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1156430918,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 42 Health Sciences; 4206 Public Health,3 Good Health and Well Being

The aim of this review is to describe three Apps, referenced in scientific articles, that can be used to estimate in advance the radiation dose and/or risk of cancer in medical and dental studies. To accomplish this, a bibliographic search was carried out on PubMed and Scielo, using Spanish and English keywords such as radiation, dose, biological effects, medical education, App, dentistry, and medicine. Sixty articles were selected for their relevance to the topic proposed, with 50% of them published between 2017 and 2022. The results indicate that the use of Apps in health education environments enhances students' knowledge and assists professionals as quick reference tools. Of the three Apps reviewed (Passport Radiation, CALDose_X, and Dental_Dose), Passport Radiation is the oldest and currently unavailable. All three provide data on equivalent human dose and effective dose, and with the exception of Dental_Dose, an estimate of the risk of cancer in various organs and types of examinations. CALDose_X is the only one that can be configured in two languages (English and Portuguese). Both Apps also display visualizations of organic structures and the irradiation field. CALDose_X must be installed, unlike Dental_Dose. CALDose_X and Dental_Dose have been referenced in at least three scientific papers, demonstrating their acceptance within the academic community. Dental_Dose is devoted to the dental field, while CALDose_X is used in the medical field.

In Puerto Madryn, where is concentrated the most part of the population of the area, studies were carried out, which allowed to evaluate changes in nutritional status of school children. Two groups (G) of girls and boys aged 6–14 years who attended schools from different neighborhoods of Puerto Madryn were studied and compared. G1 surveyed in 2001–2006 included 3,114 individuals; and G2 measured in 2014–2016 recruited 2,799 school children. Nutritional status was evaluated based on NHANES III cut-off points for height and weight by age and sex. National census data from 2001 to 2010 allowed describing the changes due to urbanization in the area. During the period considered, Puerto Madryn’s population increased by 29%, a situation that would have led to the expansion of informal settlements with high health and socio-economic vulnerability.

It is trained to understand and generate human language and is used in various applications, including automated customer service, chatbots, and content generation. While it has the potential to offer many benefits, there are also concerns about its potential for misuse, particularly in regards to providing inappropriate or harmful safety-related information. To explore ChatGPT's capabilities in providing safety-related advice, a multidisciplinary consortium of experts was formed to analyze nine cases across different safety domains: using mobile phones while driving, supervising children around water, crowd management guidelines, precautions to prevent falls in older people, air pollution when exercising, intervening when a colleague is distressed, managing job demands to prevent burnout, protecting personal data in fitness apps, and fatigue when operating heavy machinery. The experts concluded that there is potential for significant risks when using ChatGPT as a source of information and advice for safety-related issues. ChatGPT made incorrect or potentially harmful statements and emphasized individual responsibility, potentially leading to ecological fallacy. The study highlights the need for caution when using ChatGPT for safety-related information and expert verification, as well as the need for ethical considerations and safeguards to ensure users understand the limitations and receive appropriate advice, especially in low- and middle-income countries.

Yet, little is known about the intercultural teaching practices teachers use in non‐elite communities where inequity, lack of access, and inclusion have prevailed, especially during COVID‐19. This case study describes how three teachers in three Colombian state schools, where economic divides are notorious, teach for interculturality in distance and virtual learning educational environments during the outbreak of COVID‐19. Findings indicate that teachers' approach to interculturality could be categorized into four intercultural teaching practices: 1) moving from the known to the unknown, 2) going beyond factual information, 3) challenging existing sources, and 4) contextualizing through authenticity. These practices offer guidance and instructional moves about how to teach for interculturality locally and worldwide.","ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS We thank Mary and Yuly for their participation in this study.

The centralized controller uses mathematical models of power system dynamics to predict the evolution of system states over a finite horizon based on information from local state observers and relays. The MPC dynamically adjusts the setpoints of existing primary controls to maximize system stability. To address the computational challenges of a real-time MPC implementation due to nonlinear power system dynamics and short sampling intervals, a trajectory linearization technique is applied to the MPC formulation. The proposed controller is validated via a hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) testbed. The testbed includes an implementation of the controller in hardware, which interfaces with a high-fidelity microgrid simulation model running in a real-time simulator. State observers based on the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF), which provide the controller with estimates of the system state, are also implemented. The HIL testbed is used to verify the real-time operation of the controller and evaluate its performance under modeling uncertainties.",,This work was supported by Schweitzer Engineering Laboratories.,IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications,,,,2023-08-14,2023,2023-08-14,,59,6,7356-7367,All OA; Green,Article,"Hamilton, Dakota; Navarro, Loraine; Aliprantis, Dionysios; Pekarek, Steven; Zweigle, Greg","Hamilton, Dakota (Elmore Family School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, 47907, USA); Navarro, Loraine (Elmore Family School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, 47907, USA); Aliprantis, Dionysios (Elmore Family School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, 47907, USA); Pekarek, Steven (Elmore Family School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, 47907, USA); Zweigle, Greg (Schweitzer Engineering Laboratories, Pullman, WA, 99163, USA)","Hamilton, Dakota (Purdue University West Lafayette)","Hamilton, Dakota (Purdue University West Lafayette); Navarro, Loraine (Purdue University West Lafayette); Aliprantis, Dionysios (Purdue University West Lafayette); Pekarek, Steven (Purdue University West Lafayette); Zweigle, Greg (Schweitzer Engineering Laboratories (United States))",1,1,,,https://www.techrxiv.org/doi/pdf/10.36227/techrxiv.22245952.v1,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1163275543,"40 Engineering; 4007 Control Engineering, Mechatronics and Robotics; 4008 Electrical Engineering; 4009 Electronics, Sensors and Digital Hardware; 4010 Engineering Practice and Education",7 Affordable and Clean Energy

modular components that are easily adaptable to downstream healthcare tasks,
making AI development more scalable and cost-effective. Structured EHR
foundation models, trained on coded medical records from millions of patients,
demonstrated benefits including increased performance with fewer training
labels, and improved robustness to distribution shifts. However, questions
remain on the feasibility of sharing these models across different hospitals
and their performance for local task adaptation. This multi-center study
examined the adaptability of a recently released structured EHR foundation
model ($FM_{SM}$), trained on longitudinal medical record data from 2.57M
Stanford Medicine patients. Experiments were conducted using EHR data at The
Hospital for Sick Children and MIMIC-IV. We assessed both adaptability via
continued pretraining on local data, and task adaptability compared to
baselines of training models from scratch at each site, including a local
foundation model. We evaluated the performance of these models on 8 clinical
prediction tasks. In both datasets, adapting the off-the-shelf $FM_{SM}$
matched the performance of GBM models locally trained on all data while
providing a 13% improvement in settings with few task-specific training labels.
With continued pretraining on local data, label efficiency substantially
improved, such that $FM_{SM}$ required fewer than 1% of training examples to
match the fully trained GBM's performance. Continued pretraining was also 60 to
90% more sample-efficient than training local foundation models from scratch.
Our findings show that adapting shared EHR foundation models across hospitals
provides improved prediction performance at less cost, underscoring the utility
of base foundation models as modular components to streamline the development
of healthcare AI.",,,arXiv,,,,2023-11-19,2023,,,,,,All OA; Green,Preprint,"Guo, Lin Lawrence; Fries, Jason; Steinberg, Ethan; Fleming, Scott Lanyon; Morse, Keith; Aftandilian, Catherine; Posada, Jose; Shah, Nigam; Sung, Lillian","Guo, Lin Lawrence (); Fries, Jason (); Steinberg, Ethan (); Fleming, Scott Lanyon (); Morse, Keith (); Aftandilian, Catherine (); Posada, Jose (); Shah, Nigam (); Sung, Lillian ()",,"Guo, Lin Lawrence (); Fries, Jason (); Steinberg, Ethan (); Fleming, Scott Lanyon (); Morse, Keith (); Aftandilian, Catherine (); Posada, Jose (); Shah, Nigam (); Sung, Lillian ()",0,0,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1166156687,42 Health Sciences; 4203 Health Services and Systems; 46 Information and Computing Sciences,3 Good Health and Well Being

The new Forearm Dual Triboelectric Sensor (FDTS) intends to demonstrate triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) as an affordable and flexible alternative to expensive and bulky EMG devices used in prosthetic limbs by amputated patients. The proposed concept can successfully recognize up to 10 different input signals from the bending or tapping of the middle and little fingers and hand opening-closing action used as input commands for a Human-Computer-Interface (HCI) for computer navigation. In the experiments, we can successfully control horizontal, vertical and diagonal movements, left and right click of the cursor on the screen, and scroll up/down options. The FDTS was also implemented in robotic hand remote control, where different index and small finger bending amplitudes were translated to different mechanical finger rotation degrees and overall robot hand movement. Additionally, the robotic hand was able to perform right and left clicks controlled by fast finger bending. More experiments demonstrate the FDTS response to other wrist movements, such as pronation and supination. This proves the potential benefits of TS in cost-effective prosthetic devices, with limited but better functionality than standard body-powered prostheses. In the future, FDTS-like devices can be modularly integrated with artificial limbs to allow amputated patients to control computers and external devices. Additionally, this solution can positively impact the integration of online spaces like the Metaverse with healthcare technologies for rehabilitation and social inclusion.",Declaration of Competing Interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

843,pub.1155467452,10.2139/ssrn.4346827,,,The Risks of Using ChatGPT to Obtain Common Safety-Related Information and Advice,"ChatGPT is a highly advanced AI language model that has gained widespread popularity. It is trained to understand and generate human language and is used in various applications, including automated customer service, chatbots, and content generation. While it has the potential to offer many benefits, there are also concerns about its potential for misuse, particularly in regards to providing inappropriate or harmful safety-related information. To explore ChatGPT's capabilities in providing safety-related advice, a multidisciplinary consortium of experts was formed to analyze nine cases across different safety domains: using mobile phones while driving, supervising children around water, crowd management guidelines, precautions to prevent falls in older people, air pollution when exercising, intervening when a colleague is distressed, managing job demands to prevent burnout, protecting personal data in fitness apps, and fatigue when operating heavy machinery. The experts concluded that there is potential for significant risks when using ChatGPT as a source of information and advice for safety-related issues. ChatGPT made incorrect or potentially harmful statements and emphasized individual responsibility, potentially leading to ecological fallacy. The study highlights the need for caution when using ChatGPT for safety-related information and expert verification, as well as the need for ethical considerations and safeguards to ensure users understand the limitations and receive appropriate advice, especially in low- and middle-income countries. The results of this investigation serve as a reminder that while AI technology continues to advance, caution must be exercised to ensure that its applications do not pose a threat to public safety.",,,SSRN Electronic Journal,,,,2023,2023,2023,,,,,All OA; Green,Preprint,"Oviedo-Trespalacios, Oscar; Peden, Amy E.; Cole-Hunter, Thomas; Costantini, Arianna; Haghani, Milad; Rod., J.E.; Kelly, Sage; Torkamaan, Helma; Tariq, Amina; Newton, James David Albert; Gallagher, Timothy; Steinert, Steffen; Filtness, Ashleigh; Reniers, Genserik","Oviedo-Trespalacios, Oscar (Delft University of Technology); Peden, Amy E.

841,pub.1159173540,10.2139/ssrn.4461138,,,The Ethics of Exchange: The Articulation of Praxeology and Thymology,"This paper attempts to derive basic principles of ethical conduct in economic life from a relatively simple model of exchange. Economic exchange is seen as any exchange of value. It is not limited to money exchanges. In many social exchanges money may not even play a role. The theoretical framework used is that of Austrian economics which uniquely has applied subjective value to its economic analysis in a way which has enriched the understanding of human value. The analysis presented is expansive. Value exchanges in all social interactions. The question is to derive criteria which determine the ethical nature of these exchanges. It is shown that a basic praxeological model of exchange, derived from perfect market conditions, can be adapted to all exchanges and serve to guide ethical conduct. The expression of value in the exchange is a thymological event. As such it serves to guide the determination as to the ethnical nature of the exchange. This approach restores economics to its proper place, as subordinate to ethics. This is as it was through most of human history, economics as a relationship between people, mediated by the products of production and the market. There is discussion of the “hermeneutical turn” in Austrian economics which occurred beginning in the 1970’s. By inquiring more deeply into the nature of subjective value, this development served to clarify the nature of values in human beings, helping to identify ethical principles and assisting in achieving the consilience of economics with adjoining disciplines.",,,SSRN Electronic Journal,,,,2023,2023,2023,,,,,All OA; Green,Preprint,"Stomper, Richard","Stomper, Richard (Illinois FOP Labor Council; Swiss Management Centre University (Switzerland); Universidad Central de Nicaragua)",,"Stomper, Richard (Illinois FOP Labor Council; Swiss Management Centre University (Switzerland); Universidad Central de Nicaragua; Illinois FOP Labor Council; Swiss Management Centre University (Switzerland); Universidad Central de Nicaragua; Central University of Nicaragua)",0,0,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1159173540,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3507 Strategy, Management and Organisational Behaviour; 38 Economics; 3801 Applied Economics; 50 Philosophy and Religious Studies; 5001 Applied Ethics",

By using a documentary research method, we traced back 279 experiences of SARs deployments in hospitals, elderly care centers, occupational health centers, private homes, and educational institutions worldwide that involved 52 different robot models. We retrieved, analyzed, and classified the functions that SARs develop in these experiences, the areas in which they are deployed, the principal manufacturers, and the robot models that are being adopted. The functions we identified for SARs are entertainment, companionship, telepresence, edutainment, providing general and personalized information or advice, monitoring, promotion of physical exercise and rehabilitation, testing and pre-diagnosis, delivering supplies, patient registration, giving location indications, patient simulator, protective measure enforcement, medication and well-being adherence, translating and having conversations in multiple languages, psychological therapy, patrolling, interacting with digital devices, and disinfection.

839,pub.1166681992,10.1111/spc3.12919,,,COVID‐19 cases correlate with greater acceptance coping in flexible cultures: A cross‐cultural study in 26 countries,"Abstract The current study examines whether the prevalence of COVID‐19 cases and cultural flexibility correlate to one's use of acceptance coping across 26 cultures. We analyzed data from 7476 participants worldwide at the start of the first outbreak from March 2020 to June 2020. Results showed that cultural flexibility moderated the relationship between COVID‐19 cases and individuals' acceptance coping strategies. Specifically, for cultures with high flexibility, COVID‐19 cases correlated with more acceptance coping; for cultures with low flexibility, COVID‐19 cases correlated with less acceptance coping. This result demonstrates how participants from flexible cultures can coexist with the realistic challenges and suffering faced during this pandemic.","ACKNOWLEDGMENTS Our appreciation also goes to the editors and reviewers whose insightful comments and feedback have been instrumental in enhancing the quality of our paper significantly.

Despite this reality, peace has become the main political motor for the consolidation of the nation-state over the last 40 years, and the elimination once and for all of political violence is the driving force behind this process. Important sectors of the Colombian population have sought to consolidate a democratic state that guarantees rights by eliminating political violence as a leading mechanism in the processes of change—both that exercised by the state and political elites, and that exercised by those who want to subvert power. In this chapter I analyse and focus on the pathways and obstacles in the search for peace in Colombia. I also analyse the main dynamics of the political project of peace as a means to completing the consolidation of the Colombian nation-state by taking political violence out of the equation.

The salinity, temperature, density, and water velocity data utilized were derived from MOHID 3D, a previously tailored and validated model for the Magdalena River Estuary. To grasp the dynamics of the river, a flow regime analysis was conducted during both wet and dry climatic seasons of the Colombian Caribbean. The utilization of this model aimed to delineate the estuary's spatial reach, considering flow rates spanning from 2000 to 6500 m³/s across two tidal cycles. This approach facilitates the prediction of the position, stability, and stratification degree of the salt front. Among the conclusions drawn, it is highlighted that: 1. The river flow serves as the principal conditioning agent for the system, inducing a strong estuary response to weather stations; 2. The extent of wedge intrusion and the river discharge exhibit a non-linear, inversely correlation; 3. Tidal waves cause differences of up to 1000 m in the horizontal extent of the wedge; 4. Widespread channel erosion occurs during the rainy season when the salt intrusion does not exceed 2 km; 5. Flocculation processes intensify during the transition between dry and wet seasons; 6. The stability of the salt layering and the consolidation of the FSI-TMZ are contingent upon the geometric attributes of the channel.",,,Preprints.org,,,,2023-11-15,2023,2023-11-15,,,,202311.0969.v1,All OA; Green,Preprint,"Cordero-Acosta, Jhonathan; Díaz, Luis J Otero; Álvarez, Aldemar E Higgins","Cordero-Acosta, Jhonathan (); Díaz, Luis J Otero (); Álvarez, Aldemar E Higgins ()","Cordero-Acosta, Jhonathan ()","Cordero-Acosta, Jhonathan (); Díaz, Luis J Otero (); Álvarez, Aldemar E Higgins ()",0,0,,,https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202311.0969/v1/download,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1166120592,37 Earth Sciences; 3707 Hydrology,7 Affordable and Clean Energy

812,pub.1166829731,10.1111/gcb.17057,38273541,,Local climate modulates the development of soil nematode communities after glacier retreat,"The worldwide retreat of glaciers is causing a faster than ever increase in ice-free areas that are leading to the emergence of new ecosystems. Understanding the dynamics of these environments is critical to predicting the consequences of climate change on mountains and at high latitudes. Climatic differences between regions of the world could modulate the emergence of biodiversity and functionality after glacier retreat, yet global tests of this hypothesis are lacking. Nematodes are the most abundant soil animals, with keystone roles in ecosystem functioning, but the lack of global-scale studies limits our understanding of how the taxonomic and functional diversity of nematodes changes during the colonization of proglacial landscapes. We used environmental DNA metabarcoding to characterize nematode communities of 48 glacier forelands from five continents. We assessed how different facets of biodiversity change with the age of deglaciated terrains and tested the hypothesis that colonization patterns are different across forelands with different climatic conditions. Nematodes colonized ice-free areas almost immediately. Both taxonomic and functional richness quickly increased over time, but the increase in nematode diversity was modulated by climate, so that colonization started earlier in forelands with mild summer temperatures. Colder forelands initially hosted poor communities, but the colonization rate then accelerated, eventually leveling biodiversity differences between climatic regimes in the long term. Immediately after glacier retreat, communities were dominated by colonizer taxa with short generation time and r-ecological strategy but community composition shifted through time, with increased frequency of more persister taxa with K-ecological strategy. These changes mostly occurred through the addition of new traits instead of their replacement during succession. The effects of local climate on nematode colonization led to heterogeneous but predictable patterns around the world that likely affect soil communities and overall ecosystem development.","ACKNOWLEDGMENTS This study is funded by the European Research Council under the European Community&#x27;s Horizon 2020 Programme, Grant Agreement no. 772284 (IceCommunities).

Thus, developing a reliable and valid measure of love experiences is crucial. One of the most popular tools to quantify love is Sternberg’s 45-item Triangular Love Scale (TLS-45), which measures three love components: intimacy, passion, and commitment. However, our literature review reveals that most studies (64%) use a broad variety of shortened versions of the TLS-45. Here, aiming to achieve scientific consensus and improve the reliability, comparability, and generalizability of results across studies, we developed a short version of the scale—the TLS-15—comprised of 15 items with 5-point, rather than 9-point, response scales. In Study 1 (N = 7,332), we re-analyzed secondary data from a large-scale multinational study that validated the original TLS-45 to establish whether the scale could be truncated. In Study 2 (N = 307), we provided evidence for the three-factor structure of the TLS-15 and its reliability. Study 3 (N = 413) confirmed convergent validity and test–retest stability of the TLS-15. Study 4 (N = 60,311) presented a large-scale validation across 37 linguistic versions of the TLS-15 on a cross-cultural sample spanning every continent of the globe. The overall results provide support for the reliability, validity, and cross-cultural invariance of the TLS-15, which can be used as a measure of love components—either separately or jointly as a three-factor measure.","The study was made possible by funding from the IDN Being Human Lab, University of Wrocław, Poland.

In order to achieve this purpose, interpersonal features of a corpus of essays written by Mexican undergraduate students of English Language and Literature were analyzed. The model of appraisal (Martin, James R. & Peter R. R. White. 2005. The language of evaluation: Appraisal systems in English .

A New Interplay Between Physiology and Ecology,"This chapter investigates the hybrid relationships between metabolism, broadly and a-historically understood as the set of processes through which alien matter is made homogeneous to that of the organism, and forms of vitalism from the eighteenth century on. While metabolic processes have long been modeled in a reductionist fashion as a straightforward function of repair and expansion of a given structure (either chemically, or mechanistically), a challenging vitalist view has characterized metabolism as a creative, organizing, vital faculty. I suggest that this tension was overcome in Claude BernardBernard, Claude’s works on “indirect nutrition”, in which nutrition, rightly conceived as a general vital phenomenon common to plants and animals, was both characterized as an instance of the general physico-chemical determinism of all phenomena and as the sign and condition of the “freedom and independence” of the organism with respect to the environment. I propose that BernardBernard, Claude’s theory of indirect nutrition was central in the elaboration of his general physiology and has, at the same time, underpinned a self-centered view of biological identity in which the organism creates itself continuously at the detriment of its external milieu. I further argue that this conception of biological individuality as metabolically constructed has since, and paradoxically, supported a view in which the organism appears as an autonomous and self-creating entity. I then contrast this classical view of the metabolic autonomy of the organism with the challenges raised by microbiome studies and suggest that these emerging fields contribute to sketch an ecological conception of the organism and its metabolism through the reconceptualization of its relationship with the environment. The recent focus on a “microbiota – host metabolism” axis contributes to shift the focus away from the classical concept of organism, somehow externalizing vitalism out of the autonomous individual in favor of an ecological, collaborative, and interactionist view of the living.",,,"History, Philosophy and Theory of the Life Sciences",Vitalism and Its Legacy in Twentieth Century Life Sciences and Philosophy,"Christopher Donohue, Charles T.

Megadolodus and Neodolodus are bunodont litoptern genera recorded in the middle Miocene tropical faunistic assemblage of La Venta (Colombia). Both taxa were initially identified as didolodontid condylarths, but later reclassified into Proterotheriidae, within Litopterna. Previous studies proposed their inclusion within Proterotheriidae, but possible affinities with early litopterns and didolodontids have not been properly tested in phylogenetic analyses. We report new material of Megadolodus and Neodolodus from La Venta, which document new aspects of their upper and lower dentition, and we reassess their phylogenetic relationships with Litopterna and Didolodontidae. Using pre-existing matrices, we tested two alternative approaches of character construction for serial characters on the dentition in our phylogenetic analyses. Based on previously known and new fossil material, our analyses with both coding approaches support a close relationship between Megadolodus and Neodolodus, within Litopterna, and do not support a close relationship with Didolodontidae. At a less inclusive level, the relationships of Megadolodinae within Litopterna vary depending on the coding approach used. However, all of our analyses unambiguously support the monophyly of Megadolodinae as a clade of Neotropical bunodont litopterns. While the discovery of these new remains enlightens part of the litoptern phylogeny, the sensitivity of our analyses to coding approaches further highlights the importance of critical evaluation of character construction in morphological phylogenetics.

magnetization and magnetoresistance measurements are both highly anisotropic

in that it involves three magnetic ordering vectors including an incommensurate
spin density wave and commensurate ferrimagnetic state in zero field. We have
discovered a large anomalous Hall conductivity that reaches = 430

effect stemming from Weyl nodes found in the electronic structure. These
electronic structure calculations indicate the presence of nested Fermi surface
pockets with nesting wave vectors similar to the measured magnetic ordering

However, despite the fact that several thousand potentially therapeutic peptides reported, only sixty have arrived at the market. This concerning low proportion is partially explained by undesired properties such as peptide-induced hemolytic activity. Hence, we aim to get a better insight into the chemical space of hemolytic peptides using a novel approach based on network science and interactive data mining as an alternative to design more effective peptide drugs with low hemolytic activity. Metadata networks (METNs) were used to characterize and find general patterns associated to hemolytic peptides, whereas Half-Space Proximal Networks (HSPNs), created using five different two-way dissimilarity measures, represented the hemolytic peptide space. Then, using the best candidate HSPNs, we extracted various scaffolds that capture information of almost all the chemical space but avoiding peptide overrepresentation. Such scaffolds can have many applications, such as training accurate ML-based prediction models, constructing one-class multi-query similarity searching models and characterizing the diversity of hemolytic peptides using a manageable set of peptides.

Ti dejavniki imajo ključno vlogo pri oblikovanju podjetniških ambicij posameznikov in uspešnosti ustanavljanja ter delovanja podjetij. Raziskava s tem zagotavlja neprimerljiv vpogled v nacionalno podjetništvo in njegove značilnosti ter presega informacije, ki so na voljo v drugih statističnih virih. Raziskava namreč vključuje tudi odnos posameznikov in družbe do podjetništva ter želje in usposobljenost ljudi za podjetništvo, v vseh fazah podjetniškega procesa. S proučevanjem teh vidikov v različnih državah, GEM ugotavlja ključna gonila in ovire za podjetništvo, kar zainteresiranim stranem omogoča, da razvijajo podporni podjetniški ekosistem. Najnovejše poročilo je posebno, saj vključuje retrospektivo zadnjih dveh desetletij.

Se da cuenta de sus inicios, como Departamento de Psicología adscrito a la División de Educación (1964), cuando se creó la Licenciatura en Consejería Psicológica como primer avance a nivel regional. Posteriormente, se narra su transformación en un plan de Pregrado en Psicología (1976), centrado en formar profesionales psicólogos y afianzar la formación investigativa de sus profesores. Más adelante se funda el Centro de Investigaciones (1993) y se impulsa el paso de Departamento de la Facultad de Educación a Escuela de Psicología (1994), con especializaciones y maestrías diversas. Se finaliza con la constitución de un Instituto de carácter más autónomo (2003), con un desarrollo investigativo muy amplio y de alta calidad que favoreció la creación del primer Doctorado en Psicología del país, y una capacidad de respuesta a las necesidades de la población del suroccidente colombiano mediante múltiples formas social-profesionales que los egresados y el propio Instituto han agenciado como, por ejemplo, los programas de regionalización de la Universidad. Se presentan también los importantes logros de todos los integrantes del Instituto para proyectar su evolución mediante planes estratégicos y proyectos de acción diversos coordinados con la Oficina de Planeación universitaria, algunos de los cuales iniciaron su implementación entre 2017-2020, cuando el autor estuvo a cargo de la dirección del Instituto.

Although this topic has been addressed in different reviews and critical studies recently, none of them have systematically and explicitly addressed the factors that explain, or are explained by, the digital competencies of university teachers. Examples of these factors include, among others, demographic, professional and psychological aspects of university teachers, as well as very specific digital competencies. The present study seeks to close this gap through a systematic mapping of the literature published until 2021 in journals indexed by Scopus and Web of Science (WOS). Based on the selection of 53 primary studies, we characterized the literature and summarized the main results reported so far. The analysis allowed us to conclude the following: 1) there is a growing number of contributions aimed at understanding the acquisition of digital competencies, especially from external factors; 2) European, and more specifically Spanish, university teachers from multiple disciplines are the most studied population; 3) most studies adopted quantitative approaches to explain but not prove causality; 4) there is a great heterogeneity of relationships and results that explain the digital competencies of university professors. The implications of these results are discussed with a view to identifying the gaps that provide scope for future research.",,,Education and Information Technologies,,,,2023-05-18,2023,2023-05-18,2023-12,28,12,16771-16822,All OA; Bronze,Article,"Saltos-Rivas, Rafael; Novoa-Hernández, Pavel; Rodríguez, Rocío Serrano","Saltos-Rivas, Rafael (Facultad de Filosofía Letras y Ciencias de la Educación de la Universidad Técnica de Manabí, Portoviejo, Ecuador); Novoa-Hernández, Pavel (Escuela de Ciencias Empresariales, Universidad Católica del Norte, Larrondo 1281, Coquimbo, Chile); Rodríguez, Rocío Serrano (Facultad de Ciencias de la Educación, Universidad de Córdoba, Córdoba, Spain)","Novoa-Hernández, Pavel (Catholic University of the North)","Saltos-Rivas, Rafael (Universidad Técnica de Manabí); Novoa-Hernández, Pavel (Catholic University of the North); Rodríguez, Rocío Serrano (University of Córdoba)",4,4,,,https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s10639-023-11669-w.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1158161433,39 Education; 3903 Education Systems,

In this constitutional system, the King takes on a new role. The ministerial countersignature is valid to exempt the King, Head of State, from responsibility for his acts but does not divest him of all effective power: he remains the holder of an autonomous competence distinct from that of the government. Even the Albertine Statute does not escape the logical path determined by the genetic identity interconnecting European constitutions and constitutional experiences. By establishing that ministers can be parliamentarians, it sets the first condition of the parliamentary system. The Elective Chamber will claim the right of initiative and the ability to modify the laws. The genetic constitution shows that all constitutions, regardless of their underlying political legitimacy, have participated in the development and affirmation of a constitutional arrangement in accordance with the principles of the parliamentary system.

The 1990 Caracas declaration proposed a shift towards decentralised community mental health services and interventions based on the recovery approach and emphasis on social determinants of mental health in the Americas. Colombia has adopted these approaches in its legal and practical framework in recent years, but implementation has been uneven. This systematic review aims to contribute to mental health services understanding in Colombia by reviewing published studies about mental health services and interventions. A search was conducted to explore peer-reviewed studies on Colombian mental health services across five databases (Medline, PubMed, Scopus, Scielo and BVS [Biblioteca Virtual de Salud in Spanish]) on papers published in the last ten years and without language restrictions. The Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR) was used to structure the analysis and identify barriers and facilitators during the implementation of mental health services. We adapted the CFIR to attend to gender, race and age informed by the Socio-Political Economy of Global Mental Health framework, given the importance of these factors to the Colombian health landscape. 1 530 records were identified, and 12 articles met all inclusion criteria and were included in the analysis. 8 papers described substance use disorders services, 11 involved multidisciplinary healthcare professionals, and 7 were implemented at a local scale. The primary barriers to implementation were the lack of coordination, high workloads, and low funding. Facilitators included the use of protocols, and the involvement of communities, stakeholders, users, and external champions. Findings suggest the continued importance of community and recovery approaches and efforts to improve coordination between multi-sector actors involved in the mental health spaces (e.g., public, and private organisations, users and their families).",,"This paper was conducted in partial fulfilment of GA-AG MSc degree in Global Health and Development at UCL.

Since the first foundational work in active perception appeared, more than three decades ago, this field has received increasing attention across different scientific communities. This has brought about many different approaches and formulations, and makes a review of the current trends necessary and extremely valuable for both new and experienced researchers. In this article, we survey the state of the art in active SLAM and take an in-depth look at the open challenges that still require attention to meet the needs of modern applications. After providing a historical perspective, we present a unified problem formulation and review the well-established modular solution scheme, which decouples the problem into three stages that identify, select, and execute potential navigation actions. We then analyze alternative approaches, including belief-space planning and deep reinforcement learning techniques, and review related work on multirobot coordination.

Given the molecular diversity characteristic of each cellular phenotype, the possible cytopathic, tissue and clinical effects are difficult to predict, which determines the heterogeneity of COVID-19 symptoms. The purpose of this article is to provide a comprehensive review of the cyto pathic effects of SARS-CoV-2 on various cell types, focusing on the development of COVID-19, which in turn may lead, in some patients, to a persistence of symptoms after recovery from the disease, a condition known as long COVID. We describe the molecular mechanisms underlying virus-host interactions, including alterations in protein expression, intracellular signaling pathways, and immune responses. In particular, the article highlights the potential impact of these cytopathies on cellular function and clinical outcomes, such as immune dysregulation, neuropsychiatric disorders, and organ damage.

It also looks at debates on decolonisation and how their work has shaped these debates. Autobiography is one lens of doing critical analysis and understanding the progression of a scholar. This paper analyses different scholars in different generations and hopes to contribute to the search for genealogies of intergenerational Black South African scholars whose work has been forgotten and marginalised in the academic project in the humanities and social sciences curriculum in South Africa and beyond. Using autobiography as a critical method, the paper shows how black scholars from different generations navigated institutions of higher learning to achieve excellent results and produce knowledge that challenged racialised inferiority and white supremacy. The findings suggest that there is a body of work by black scholars and shows that where support is given, black scholars can shape discourse and take leadership positions in the academy.",,,Pan-African Conversations,,,,2023-07-03,2023,2023-07-03,,1,1,100-121,All OA; Hybrid,Article,"Mothlamme, Steven","Mothlamme, Steven (University of the Witwatersrand)",,"Mothlamme, Steven (University of the Witwatersrand)",0,0,,,https://journals.uj.ac.za/index.php/pac/article/download/2550/1587,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1160697687,"39 Education; 3902 Education Policy, Sociology and Philosophy; 3903 Education Systems",

Bionetopraxis es una palabra compuesta de tres categorías —bíos, net y praxis— que presenta, desde la perspectiva lingüística, un tipo de realidad ontológica. Bíos es una palabra griega que significa vida, existencia, duración de la vida, medios de vida, humanidad, mundo, residencia, morada5 . El bíos se constituye en aquella posibilidad de ser, de existir, no solo en una realidad llamada mundo, sino inserta en un ecosistema cultural que define a través de un sistema de ideas vitales la comprensión de los seres humanos.

Lack of routine measures in rural areas does not usually allow to observe changes in rural costs. We adapt the Big Mac index, typically used to measure purchasing power parity between countries, as a potential quick and inexpensive indicator of short-term local price variations. With a national random sample of McDonald's stores repeated in time, we find prices grew slightly faster in rural areas than in urban areas. Spatial transmission of prices seems to be limited to very localized effects, meaning that rural price increases are not due to urban spillover effects.",,Open Access funding provided thanks to the CRUE-CSIC agreement with Springer Nature.

As an interdisciplinary science, it relies on the knowledge of a number of sciences: psychology, neurology, consumer psychology, neuropsychology, medicine, biology, marketing, but also the knowledge gained by sharing with them. It proved to be a more advanced method of marketing research than conventional (classical, traditional) techniques and methods (surveys, interviews, focus groups, stakeholders, etc.). Neuromarketing represents the application of neuroscience studies in the knowledge and explanation of subconscious dispositions of consumer behavior. For this purpose, it uses various brain scanning methods, techniques and devices that determine the brain reactions of consumers to marketing stimuli or certain products/services. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and electroencephalography (EEG) are most commonly used. In this sense, the main goal of this work is to indicate the possibilities of practical application of the techniques and methods used by neuromarketing. By following the reactions of certain parts of the brain and knowing their basic psychological functions, researchers and marketing experts are able to determine the type of psychological process (emotion) that occurs due to a certain stimulus.

Una historia más allá de los límites de lo nacional,"El presente artículo constituye un estado del arte que, persigue contribuir al conocimiento de los aspectos de orden general e internacional en que la investigación histórica ha avanzado en torno a los procesos de flexibilización laboral. Al mismo tiempo, se reconoce la importancia de un diálogo con las contribuciones desde otras disciplinas que han abordado las transformaciones en los ámbitos del trabajo desde las últimas décadas del siglo XX. En este sentido, la historia del trabajo, con eje en los procesos de flexibilización laboral requiere insertarse en las dinámicas globales de la económica capitalista. De esa forma, las experiencias históricas nacionales se articulan, tanto en sus particularidades, como en sus relaciones con procesos históricos que van más allá de las fronteras nacionales.

This is the importance of its in-depth study, since if it is carried out correctly, re-directing resources to other fields is one of the many benefits of its application. This PhD thesis seeks to highlight the importance of correcting the displacements that satellites in orbit may experience, due to the influence of various agents, both of their own functioning and those generated by the environment in which they operate, that is why the technique of Systems estimation should be presented as a very useful option thanks to the analysis tools of the MATLAB program. The putting in orbit of a team of these characteristics implies investment of strong amounts of time, money and technology; likewise maintain its initial orientation leads to the analysis of new parameters, without mentioning the great problem generated in the orbit of the Earth, if for reasons other than those considered ""normal"", this orientation varied and the implemented processes did not fulfill their function. The necessary driver for our project is a PID Control since a control law can compensate with the integral and derivative actions. The necessary tool for the development of our controller is from MATLAB.

Considering that the avoidance of PaV1-infected lobsters by early-benthic juveniles is well documented and the previously reported costs of close proximity to PaV1-infected early-benthic juveniles (increased mortality risk), pueruli of P. argus should avoid infected conspecifics during settlement. We experimentally tested if pueruli show aversion to PaV1-infected conspecifics. We also re-tested the previously reported effect of red algae (Laurencia spp.) and healthy conspecifics on pueruli settlement decisions. Considering the known benefits of inhabiting red algae and costs of close proximity to conspecific juveniles, pueruli were predicted to be attracted to metabolites produced by red algae and repulsed by metabolites produced by conspecifics. We also predicted that attraction to red algae would decrease or cease if this cue was presented together with cues produced by PaV1-infected conspecifics. Our experiments indicate that pueruli do not avoid metabolites produced by benthic juveniles and are not attracted to metabolites produced by red algae. Importantly, pueruli are attracted to a combination of metabolites produced by red algae and conspecific juveniles but this attraction ceases if conspecifics are PaV1-infected. Our results indicate that PaV1 disrupts habitat selection by settling pueruli and suggest that assumptions about cost and benefits experienced by settling pueruli need to be revisited. Research to improve the understanding of the relationship between recruitment, disease avoidance, and fishery stock in this heavily exploited spiny lobster is needed.","JAB thanks Creative Inquiry, Clemson University for support during this study.

Therefore, certain electronic components capable of providing these characteristics are used, which makes their cost high and it becomes difficult to acquire these electronic components for special use. The proposal presented in this investigation, is the use of the embedded card tetra TK1 of the NVIDIA brand, to be used as a base device for remote sensing equipment. This card provides considerable computational capacity.

The species has a wide distribution and, although primarily associated with endangered Acropora corals, has been recorded from a myriad of hosts. Here we conducted the first genomic survey and complete mitochondrial assemblage and characterisation of any species of Domeciidae, as well as the first species within Trapezioidea. The estimated size of the nuclear genome ranged from 0.64 Gbp to 1.76 Gbp, revealing a small genome. Repetitive elements of the genome were estimated here at 66.4% and 74%, respectively, with the majority of the repetitive elements consisting of LINE, LTR, and satellite DNA. The assembled A-T rich mitochondrial genome consisted of 15,568 bp in length, with 13 protein-coding genes (PCGs), 22 transfer RNA (tRNA) genes and two ribosomal RNA (rRNA) genes. A 619 bp long non-coding region was identified as the supposed D-loop/control region, containing eight microsatellites. The 22 tRNA genes, ranging from 65 to 71 bp in length, displayed a typical “cloverleaf” secondary structure, with the exception of tRNA-Ser1 which lacked part of the DHU arm and tRNA-Asp displayed a deletion of the TΨC loop but not the arm. Two transposition events of two tRNA genes were also found when comparing the gene order of D. acanthophora to that of the brachyuran basic gene order, which had not been reported before. Despite belonging to a widely distributed, well-known superfamily of coral-associated crabs, the Trapezioidea, very little was known about this species from a genetics perspective, which is remedied here by providing a new genomic resource for D. acanthophora.",Sampling was authorised by the Direction de la Mer de Guadeloupe under autorisation N°09/2021.

Objective: To analyze the discourses and experiences regarding the perception of accessibility to primary healthcare from the perspective of international migrants and healthcare professionals in Antofagasta, northern Chile. Material and Method: A qualitative approach study with a descriptive phenomenological design, the sample consisted of 14 participants from the city of Antofagasta in the year 2021: 7 international migrants and 7 primary healthcare professionals. Non probability sampling was used. The snowball method was used to select participants through seed participants. Results: The categories expressed by the migrants were: 1) Timely accessibility with the sub-dimensions: system elements and user elements; 2) Perceived hazards; 3) Discrimination with the sub-dimensions: user service and availability of services; 4) Information availability. From the health professionals’ perspective, the categories were: 1) Timely accessibility; 2) Perceived hazards; 3) Health facilitators. Conclusion: There is a gap between the migrant population and healthcare professionals, which hinders optimal care and accessibility. This is attributed to lack of training, limited resources and awareness.

One of the most influential fields is the entertainment field, proof of this is the variety of video games. These are constantly evolving both in the technical requirements and in the complexity of the games that nowadays, strategy games are booming. These games have new ways of interacting with the player. The most characteristic is the level that the player occupies the game and proof of this are the long times that young people devote to the moment of playing. This excess time causes a change in the personality of adolescents as well as causing certain changes in cardiorespiratory effects. Sudden changes of the emotions associated with a high level of stress at the time of playing are causing the heart to react differently to these sudden changes in oxygen requirement. In this paper, we analyze the strategy games that are in full swing at this time such as the famous FORTNITE game. The research consists of a monitoring of 10 young people to whom they have been subjected at long game times. On an average 5 hours in a row, in which they have been evaluated for oxygen saturation and heart rate at the times that players are developing various emotions such as stress, frustration, joy among others. The results show that when young people win and are promoted to higher levels, they present positive emotions such as tranquility and are happy, while when they lose and lower them, they present negative changes presenting frustration, they deny, in some cases they present aggressive attitudes, throwing things. These changes are reflected in an excess of oxygen consumption reaching saturation at 99% and presenting of high heart count greater than 85 beats per minute. It should be noted that young people who are under study, do not present any type of health problem and we end with some recommendations to take into account when playing these video games that require time prolonged subjected to video games.",,,AIP Conference Proceedings,"SECOND INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON CIRCUITS, SIGNALS, SYSTEMS AND SECURITIES (ICCSSS - 2022)",,,2023-04-04,2023,,2023-04-04,2725,1,020015,All OA; Bronze,Proceeding,"Auccahuasi, Wilver; Herrera, Lucas; Leva, Antenor; Urbano, Kitty; Flores, Edward; Cuba, Ena; Bernardo, Madelaine; Santos, César; Rojas, Karin; Bejarano, Patricia; Arroyo, Sergio","Auccahuasi, Wilver (Private University of the North, / Lima, Peru); Herrera, Lucas (Continental University, / Huancayo, Peru); Leva, Antenor (Technological University of Peru, / Lima, Peru); Urbano, Kitty (Private University of the North, / Lima, Peru); Flores, Edward (Federico Villarreal National University, / Lima, Peru); Cuba, Ena (Cesar Vallejo University, / Lima, Peru); Bernardo, Madelaine (Cesar Vallejo University, / Lima, Peru); Santos, César (National University of Callao, / Lima, Peru); Rojas, Karin (Federico Villarreal National University, / Lima, Peru); Bejarano, Patricia (Cesar Vallejo University, / Lima, Peru); Arroyo, Sergio (Private University of the North, / Lima, Peru)","Auccahuasi, Wilver (Private University of the North)","Auccahuasi, Wilver (Private University of the North); Herrera, Lucas (Universidad Continental); Leva, Antenor (Technological University of Peru, / Lima, Peru); Urbano, Kitty (Private University of the North); Flores, Edward (Federico Villarreal National University); Cuba, Ena (Universidad César Vallejo); Bernardo, Madelaine (Universidad César Vallejo); Santos, César (National University of Callao); Rojas, Karin (Federico Villarreal National University); Bejarano, Patricia (Universidad César Vallejo); Arroyo, Sergio (Private University of the North)",0,0,,,https://aip.scitation.org/doi/pdf/10.1063/5.0125504,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1156958593,46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4608 Human-Centred Computing,

Current technology allows us to observe what is happening on the planet thanks to the use of terrestrial observation satellites, these satellite systems, as well as having advantages, also have disadvantages, among them we can mention that in the presence of clouds the registration of images It is carried out based on the clouds present, another of the drawbacks is the visiting time that the satellites have, which has the characteristic that the area that you want to record the image is not always available, therefore you have to wait for the day and the time in which the satellite orbit can pass through the area of interest that the image is to be recorded. Due to this characteristic, at the time of an emergency, either due to the effect of rain, earthquake or similar, when due to technical conditions the area of interest cannot be registered, other alternatives arise, such as drones, which solves a problem of satellites, on cloud cover, because the drone flies at low altitudes and does not have cloud problems, in the present work a methodology based on low-cost systems is proposed for on-board processing in drones of such In such a way that the effects of the natural disaster can be mitigated and decisions can be made in the shortest possible time, the methodology consists of processing the image in an embedded device, which is coupled to the drone and connected to the camera, in such a way that the information that is sent to the ground station, concentrates on the affected area, the methodology proposes an intelligent module capable of being able to process the newly acquired images on board and power to finalize them with a reference image bank of the area, in such a way as to be able to find any change in the land cover and to be able to send the result as an emergency message to its earth station, with this proposal it is possible to cut download times and Analysis of the images if it were to work in a conventional way because the drone must first be on the ground and then uncouple the camera, download the image and at the end just process them. As a result, it is presented by tests carried out on the detection of changes in land cover and its transmission to an earth station, using an embedded computer based on a Raspberry pi 3.",,,AIP Conference Proceedings,"SECOND INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON CIRCUITS, SIGNALS, SYSTEMS AND SECURITIES (ICCSSS - 2022)",,,2023-04-04,2023,,2023-04-04,2725,1,050003,All OA; Bronze,Proceeding,"Auccahuasi, Wilver; Herrera, Lucas; Rojas, Karin; Urbano, Kitty; Romero, Luis; Lovera, Denny; Díaz, Monica; Pacheco, Orlando; Perez, Ivan; Santos, César; Leva, Antenor; Fuentes, Alfonso; Sernaque, Fernando","Auccahuasi, Wilver (Private University of the North, / Lima, Peru); Herrera, Lucas (Continental University, / Huancayo, Peru); Rojas, Karin (Technological University of Peru, / Lima, Peru); Urbano, Kitty (Private University of the North, / Lima, Peru); Romero, Luis (Federico Villarreal National University, / Lima, Peru); Lovera, Denny (Federico Villarreal National University, / Lima, Peru); Díaz, Monica (Cesar Vallejo University, / Lima, Peru); Pacheco, Orlando (Federico Villarreal National University, / Lima, Peru); Perez, Ivan (Cesar Vallejo University, / Lima, Peru); Santos, César (National University of Callao, / Lima, Peru); Leva, Antenor (Technological University of Peru, / Lima, Peru); Fuentes, Alfonso (Private University of the North, / Lima, Peru); Sernaque, Fernando (Cesar Vallejo University, / Lima, Peru)","Auccahuasi, Wilver (Private University of the North)","Auccahuasi, Wilver (Private University of the North); Herrera, Lucas (Universidad Continental); Rojas, Karin (Technological University of Peru, / Lima, Peru); Urbano, Kitty (Private University of the North); Romero, Luis (Federico Villarreal National University); Lovera, Denny (Federico Villarreal National University); Díaz, Monica (Universidad César Vallejo); Pacheco, Orlando (Federico Villarreal National University); Perez, Ivan (Universidad César Vallejo); Santos, César (National University of Callao); Leva, Antenor (Technological University of Peru, / Lima, Peru); Fuentes, Alfonso (Private University of the North); Sernaque, Fernando (Universidad César Vallejo)",2,2,,,https://aip.scitation.org/doi/pdf/10.1063/5.0125498,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1156958588,37 Earth Sciences; 46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4605 Data Management and Data Science,

In contrast to Souleymane Bachir Diagne’s notion of lateral universality, which is premised on encounters across differences, the argument here is that Black Consciousness begins with an inward turn. This “separatism”, with its pronounced philosophical tenor in work by Steve Biko and others, needs however to be read dialectically, as a movement towards future modes of connection. Perhaps surprisingly, such a dialectical approach will also demonstrate how apartheid - the ultimate statebacked denial of universality - can be seen historically as the enabling condition of Black Consciousness. The optimistic conclusion to draw from such a reading is that oppression and racism tend to carry the seeds of their own undoing, allowing renewed modes of universality to emerge from within.",,,,Minor Universality / Universalité mineure,"Markus Messling, Jonas Tinius",,2023-08-04,2023,2023-08-04,2023-08-07,,,323-334,All OA; Hybrid,Chapter,"Helgesson, Stefan","Helgesson, Stefan ()",,"Helgesson, Stefan ()",0,0,,,https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.1515/9783110798494-019/pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1163148851,50 Philosophy and Religious Studies; 5005 Theology,

The white dwarf is modeled considering an isothermal core with central temperature 108 [K] and an envelope where the temperature distribution depends on the mass density. Regarding the fluid, we assume that it is composed of nucleons and electrons. The structure of the polarized charged white dwarfs is obtained by solving the Einstein-Maxwell equations with charge densities represented by two Gaussians, forming an electric dipole layer at the stellar surface. We obtain larger and more massive white dwarfs when polarized charge and the Gaussians width are increased. We find that to appreciate effects in the white dwarf’s structure, the electric polarized charge must be in the order of 5.0 × 1020[C]. We obtain a maximum white dwarf mass of around 2.4M⊙ for a polarized charge of 1.5 × 1021[C]. This mass result can indicate that polarized charged white dwarfs are possible progenitors of superluminous type Ia supernovae. Furthermore, the mass-central density curves we obtain are very similar to the ones reached recently for ultra-magnetized white dwarfs.",,,,The Sixteenth Marcel Grossmann Meeting,,,2023-01-24,2023,2023-01-24,2023-02,,,4447-4452,All OA; Hybrid,Proceeding,"Nunes, Sílvia P.; Arbañil, José D.

Childhood Asymmetric Labium Majus Enlargement (CALME): a Case Series,"Background Asymmetric Labium Majus Enlargement in Childhood (CALME) is a painless and fluctuating non-neoplastic poorly circumscribed swelling of the soft tissues of the labium majus, in which there is expansion of one or more components of normal vulvar tissue. It mostly occurs in prepuberal or early pubertal girls. Etiopathogenesis is still debated, although it appears to be boosted by hormonal stimulation. We present four cases of CALME with different results. Our goal is to emphasize the importance of ruling out differential diagnoses that could require early treatment, avoiding unnecessary aggressive management at this age, since this is an evolving pathology that may resolve spontaneously or be treated deferred if it has negative repercussions on the well-being of the patient Case Case 1 8-year-old patient, referred since 1 year prior, left labia majus thickening, consultation was prompted by the onset of pain and erythema. On physical examination, the patient was stable and afebrile, with enlargement of the left labia, mildly sensitive to palpation, without increased temperature, induration or exudate. Ultrasound showed hypoechoic thickening of the dermo-epidermal plane, and thickening of the hypodermis of the labium majus. Local ice and NSAIDS were indicated. Patient evolved favorably, currently asymptomatic but with persistent asymmetry. Case 2 16-year-old patient, in follow up for PCO, refers a volume increase of the left labium majus since she was 8 years old. Ultrasound compatible with CALME. Resolved by surgery when the pathology caused significant stress to the patient, with excellent cosmetic results and patient satisfaction. Case 3 Patient in follow-up for Abnormal Uterine Bleeding since the age of 11, also consulting for labium majus asymmetry, with growth of the right labia, which had not been resolved in the last control at 15 years old. Patient wants surgical resolution, currently limited for economic reasons. Case 4 10-year-old patient, tanner 3 puberty, consulted due to increased volume of the left labia majus, ultrasound showed thickening of the soft parts of the labia compromising the hypodermis, with an increase in fibroadipose tissue. Last control at 14 years old, with persistent asymmetry, asymptomatic. Currently, only with clinical follow-up. Comments Unlike what has been classically suggested in the literature, our case series did not present spontaneous resolution with pubertal development. We propose to maintain a watchful waiting behavior, with medical management, reserving surgical treatment for those patients in whom asymmetry constitutes a stressor or discomfort factor.

Business incubators emerged as a means of redistributing strategic resources and developing new tools for local and regional economies. In Croatia, most incubators are founded by cities and counties, with two private incubators also in operation. The Technological Innovation Center “Međimurje” (TICM) in Čakovec was established by Međimurje County in 2009 to incubate startup entrepreneurs, with the aim of supporting regional development and strengthening the entrepreneurial sector. With recent population emigration, the Međimurje County Development Plan until 2027 underscores the heightened importance of TICM as an entrepreneurial support institution. This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of the challenges, needs, and obstacles faced by beginner entrepreneurs working in the TICM incubator. It critically evaluates the extent to which TICM meets the needs of newly founded companies, identifies the challenges it faces, and proposes solutions. By analysing the survey responses, the research questions were answered, and guidelines for the potential future operation of the incubator were developed. Research shows unequivocally that there are numerous advantages of doing business in an incubator, primarily the possibility of survival in the market. The work determines the needs of beginner entrepreneurs, which can guide the building and redefinition of existing services, and also highlights the need to increase the incubator’s capacity.",,,Croatian Regional Development Journal,,,,2023-12-01,2023,2024-02-26,2023-12-01,4,2,65-84,All OA; Hybrid,Article,"Rončević, Ante; Ličanin, Aleksandra","Rončević, Ante (University North, Koprivnica, Croatia); Ličanin, Aleksandra (University North, Koprivnica, Croatia)",,"Rončević, Ante (University North); Ličanin, Aleksandra (University North)",0,0,,,https://sciendo.com/pdf/10.2478/crdj-2023-0008,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1169185745,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3507 Strategy, Management and Organisational Behaviour; 44 Human Society",

However, research on the monitoring and evaluation of large-scale erosion is scarce. Here, we collected 16 pairs of Sentinel-1A images from the rainy season, spanning April 5-October 26, 2019, subsidence is then quantified and its results can indirectly reflect the intensity of erosion on the largest loess plateau in China, the Dongzhiyuan tableland, using small baseline subset synthetic aperture radar interferometry (SBAS-InSAR). The results showed that, the average erosion rate was 9 mm/year, throughout the study area, Surprisingly, the average erosion rate in the gully reached 160 mm/year, the sides of the gully correspond to the most extensive and intense erosion. Heavy rainfall, slope gradients below 15°, changes in groundwater levels due to freeze–thaw action and water infiltration during rainfall, and lack of vegetation due to continued gully side erosion, drive the intense erosion. These results demonstrate the reliable ability of the SBAS-InSAR method in accurately assessing large-scale gully erosion. The InSAR-calculated subsidence demonstrates a strong predictive capability for soil erosion and is generally consistent with previously observed levels of erosion, although much noise interference also occurs. Therefore, in the future InSAR-calculated sedimentation could be used as an indirect measure of erosion levels at multiple watershed scales.",,"This research was funded by The Science and Technology Research Project of Chongqing Municipal Education Commission, grant number KJQN202100624, and The Science and Technology Research Program of Chongqing Municipal Education Commission, grant number KJQN201900628.",Natural Hazards,,,,2023-04-08,2023,2023-04-08,2023-07,117,3,2435-2454,All OA; Green,Article,"Tian, Haibo; Tao, Yuxiang; Kou, Pinglang; Alonso, Andres; Luo, Xiaobo; Gong, Chenyu; Fan, Yunpeng; Lei, Changjian; Gou, Yongcheng","Tian, Haibo (Chongqing Engineering Research Center of Spatial Big Data Intelligent Technology, Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications, 400065, Chongqing, China); Tao, Yuxiang (Chongqing Engineering Research Center of Spatial Big Data Intelligent Technology, Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications, 400065, Chongqing, China; Key Laboratory of Tourism Multisource Data Perception and Decision, Ministry of Culture and Tourism (TMDPD, MCT), Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications, 400065, Chongqing, China); Kou, Pinglang (Chongqing Engineering Research Center of Spatial Big Data Intelligent Technology, Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications, 400065, Chongqing, China; Key Laboratory of Tourism Multisource Data Perception and Decision, Ministry of Culture and Tourism (TMDPD, MCT), Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications, 400065, Chongqing, China); Alonso, Andres (Department of Civil Engineering, Catholic University of the North, 999160, Antofagasta, Chile; Institute for Risk and Uncertainty, University of Liverpool, L69 72F, Liverpool, UK); Luo, Xiaobo (Chongqing Engineering Research Center of Spatial Big Data Intelligent Technology, Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications, 400065, Chongqing, China); Gong, Chenyu (Chongqing Engineering Research Center of Spatial Big Data Intelligent Technology, Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications, 400065, Chongqing, China); Fan, Yunpeng (Chongqing Engineering Research Center of Spatial Big Data Intelligent Technology, Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications, 400065, Chongqing, China); Lei, Changjian (Chongqing Engineering Research Center of Spatial Big Data Intelligent Technology, Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications, 400065, Chongqing, China); Gou, Yongcheng (Chongqing Engineering Research Center of Spatial Big Data Intelligent Technology, Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications, 400065, Chongqing, China)","Tao, Yuxiang (Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications; Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications)","Tian, Haibo (Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications); Tao, Yuxiang (Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications; Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications); Kou, Pinglang (Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications; Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications); Alonso, Andres (Catholic University of the North; University of Liverpool); Luo, Xiaobo (Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications); Gong, Chenyu (Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications); Fan, Yunpeng (Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications); Lei, Changjian (Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications); Gou, Yongcheng (Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications)",2,2,,,https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-2073431/latest.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1157112560,37 Earth Sciences; 3709 Physical Geography and Environmental Geoscience,

acyclic product is analogous to the product of ideals. The sequence of powers
of a given left-exact localization defines a tower of localizations. We show

In the article in the study process, when studying the state of water intake and facilities of pumping stations, systemic analysis, processing of the results of inventive and model studies of hydraulic structures for further use and use in hydraulic objects were used. Analysis of the partial situation in the water intake area of KMC was used. Based on these data, the conditions for the operation of pumping equipment can be attributed to being very heavy. They are predetermined by a high content of solid suspended particles in pumped waters 6 - 15 g/l. Based on the analysis of the operation of pumping stations, the requirements for the limiting elements of the hydrotechnical node of pumping stations are prepared. The results show that installing the flowing elements on the water intakes of large pumping stations includes the staining systems, bottom walls, and floating spares, which do not lead to a significant improvement in water intake conditions from water sources. With the basic modes of the operation of pumping stations caused by the need to change the pump porcelain, the loss of pressure due to the excavation and clogging of the lattilities of the water receiver increase. The methodology for their accounting is to use methods for analyzing operational information on operational and economic characteristics. Improving operation modes can be achieved when changing the characteristics of the elements of their designs.",,,AIP Conference Proceedings,"THE THIRD INTERNATIONAL SCIENTIFIC CONFERENCE CONSTRUCTION MECHANICS, HYDRAULICS AND WATER RESOURCES ENGINEERING (CONMECHYDRO 2021 AS)",,,2023-03-15,2023,,2023-03-15,2612,1,020031,All OA; Bronze,Proceeding,"Glovatsky, O.; Krutov, A.; Ergashev, R.; Gazaryan, A.; Rashidov, J.; Kholbutayev, B.","Glovatsky, O.

313,pub.1166060358,10.1002/adfm.202306162,,,Bio‐Inspired Fog Harvesting Meshes: A Review,"Abstract Freshwater scarcity has become a critical global challenge affecting some of the most vulnerable populations. In response, significant effort has focused on ways to increase access to this precious resource. Within the context of geographical, cultural, political, and technological factors governing freshwater availability, atmospheric water harvesting (AWH) has demonstrated tremendous promise to help address these shortages. Specifically, mesh‐based fog harvesters have received considerable attention for their passive qualities compared with their energy‐dependent technological siblings (sorbents, condensation, etc.), yet their specific water yield (SY) has developed only modestly in recent decades. While the plant and animal kingdom provide diverse examples of passive fog collection, and science has developed a remarkable understanding of these processes, much of this knowledge has yet to be translated practically at scale. This is partially due to challenges in mass‐producing complex (often micro‐scale) structures observed in nature. Fortunately, manufacturing technology is catching up with scientific understanding, especially at the scale of mesh design. To this end, the review begins by surveying bioinspired research in fog harvesting. Afterward, this study identifies milestones in developing bioinspired fog harvesting meshes, concluding in a discussion of future mesh research opportunities connecting bioinspiration and emerging advanced manufacturing techniques.","Acknowledgements The authors would like to thank Comstock Inc. for their financial support of the authors’ Fog Harp fog harvesting work.

Para lo cual se emplearon las sondas: aguja (2 mm), esférica (6,35 mm) y de plato (75 mm), para evaluar la cinética de ablandamiento de dos especies de leguminosas: frijol castilla (Vigna unguiculata) y zarandaja (Lablab purpureus). Los granos de las leguminosas fueron hidratados y luego cocinados en agua hirviendo, sacando una muestra cada cierto tiempo del proceso para medir la fuerza de compresión o penetración de los granos. La cinética de ablandamiento fue obtenida graficando la máxima fuerza de compresión/penetración en función del tiempo de proceso, ajustando los datos a una ecuación del mismo comportamiento cuyos parámetros nos den información del proceso de cocción. Como principal resultado se tuvo que la velocidad de ablandamiento fue similar para las tres sondas utilizadas.

In a spirit of positive criticism, it addresses some of the ellipses inevitable in a project as ambitious as southern theory. It engages with the unequal nature of the exchange between northern and southern theorising. It also traces some of the lineage of the project and raises some issues about the ‘geographic’ distinctions between the global north and the global south. It briefly compares this to the east-west ‘axis’ as recognised and theorised by Edward Said. Lastly, it suggests a reading of southern theory which resists individualist models of theory production.",,,,Using Social Theory in Higher Education,"Remy Y.S.

According to its purpose, this research had a correlational design. The exhibition consisted of 40 collaborators, including men and women who work in a private company. Likewise, in relation to the techniques used for data collection, there were two questionnaires, the one on work motivation and performance, both adapted by Sánchez, I; in 2020, which are designed using the Likert scale that consists of 5 levels of response. The results show that there is a highly significant relationship between motivation and work performance (0.937*, p<0.01). Likewise, a significant correlation was found between intrinsic motivation and performance of the task (0,864*, p<0.01). Also, a significant relationship was found between extrinsic motivation and civility (0.898**, p<0.01).

Here, we examined cross-nationally the structure and correlates of these beliefs with an 8-item scale, using a multigroup confirmatory factor analysis. We obtained a two-factor model of unfounded (conspiracy and health) beliefs with good internal structure (average CFI = 0.98, RMSEA = 0.05, SRMR = 0.04), but a high correlation between the two factors (average latent factor correlation = 0.57). This model was replicable across 50 countries (total N = 13,579), as evidenced by metric invariance between countries (CFI = 0.96, RMSEA = 0.06, SRMS = 0.07) as well as scalar invariance across genders (CFI = 0.98, RMSEA = 0.04, SRMS = 0.03) and educational levels (CFI = 0.98, RMSEA = 0.04, SRMS = 0.03). Also, lower levels of education, more fear of COVID-19, and more cynicism were weakly associated with stronger conspiracy and health beliefs. The study contributes to knowledge about the structure of unfounded beliefs, and reveals the potential relevance of affective (i.e., fear of COVID-19) and cognitive (i.e., cynicism) factors along with demographics, in endorsing such beliefs. In summary, we obtained cross-cultural evidence for the distinctiveness of unfounded conspiracy and health beliefs about COVID-19 in terms of their structure and correlates.",,"The work of Magdalena Żemojtel-Piotrowska and Jarosław Piotrowski was supported by the National Science Centre, Poland under Grant [2017/26/E/HS6/00282].

This study, for the first time, assembled and characterised in detail the mitochondrial genome of this species that is in need of genomic resources. The mitogenome of Musonycteris harrisoni is 16,668 bp in length and encodes 13 protein-coding genes (PCGs), 22 transfer RNA genes (tRNAs), two ribosomal RNA genes (rRNAs), and a relatively long non-coding putative control region (CR) 1229 bp in length. Mitochondrial synteny is identical to that reported before in the family Phyllostomidae. As reported before in all phyllostomids, most mitochondrial genes are encoded on the heavy strand (H-strand), except for nad6 and eight tRNA genes that are encoded on the light strand (L-strand). All the tRNAs exhibit a ‘cloverleaf’ secondary structure, except tRNA Serine-1 that is missing the dihydrouridine (DHU) arm. All 13 mitochondrial PCGs are evolving under purifying selection, with atp8, nad4l and nad6 experiencing relaxed purifying selection in comparison to the other PCGs. Tandem repeats, microsatellites, and hairpin structures are observed in the CR of Musonycteris harrisoni, in agreement with what has been reported before in other cofamilial bats. The CR contains three functional domains: extended termination associated sequence (ETAS) domain, central domain, and conserved sequence block (CSB) domain. The mitochondrial genome sequence herein characterised completely and in detail represents a new genomic resource for M. harrisoni that will further the understanding of genetic diversity in this endangered species.",We thank the Creative Inquiry programme at Clemson University for funding the bioinformatics section of this project.

The detection of anti-AChR using Radio Immuno Precipitation Assay (RIPA) has 100% specificity for the diagnosis of MG, however RIPA has high execution and interpretation complexity and requires radioactive materials, which restrict their use to specialized laboratories.   Objective We compared the performance of the gold standard RIPA with different non-RIPA anti-AChR immunoassays, including a cell-based assay (CBA) and two solid-phase ELISA kits.   Results  145 samples were included with medical indication for anti-AChR testing. By the RIPA method, 63 were negative (RIPA-Neg <0.02 nmol/L), 17 were classified as B orderline (≥0.02 – 1 nmol/L), and 65 were positive (RIPA-Pos >1 nmol/L). The competitive ELISA yielded a poor performance with low Kappa agreement with RIPA (0.210). The indirect ELISA yielded a substantial Kappa agreement (Kappa=0.652), with ∼70% sensitivity and ∼96% specificity, compared to RIPA. In a semiquantitative analysis, there was a good Spearman correlation between the indirect ELISA and RIPA levels (r=0.845). The best performance was observed with the CBA that uses fixed cells expressing clustered AChR as antigenic substrate. There was an almost perfect agreement with RIPA (Kappa = 0.969), with ∼97% sensitivity and 100% specificity. However, in the Borderline group, only 5 (∼30%) were positive using the CBA method, suggesting a slightly lower sensitivity for the CBA.    Conclusion For detection of anti-AChR reactivity, the indirect immunofluorescence assay yielded a very good analytical performance taking RIPA as the reference method, with potential to replace the RIPA in the clinical laboratory. ELISA could be an option to estimate anti-AChR AAb levels after confirming positivity by the CBA.",,"This work was mainly supported by Sao Paulo Government agency FAPESP (Sao Paulo State Research Foundation) grant numbers #2017/20745-1 and #2021/04588-9, granted to G.D.K. and L.D.S.

In this regard, microalgae-derived products, and, more specifically, microalgal exopolysaccharides (EPSs), have attracted attention, since multiple biotechnological applications are being described for these molecules. Furthermore, depending on culture conditions, the composition and, therefore, properties of EPSs can vary. In the present study, the antiviral activity of EPSs from Tetraselmis suecica and Porphyridium cruentum cultured under autotrophic and heterotrophic conditions has been evaluated in vitro against Viral Haemorrhagic Septicaemia Virus (VHSV), an important pathogen in fish farming. Results showed that EPSs from both species have anti-VHSV activity. T. suecica EPSs from autotrophic cultures showed the strongest effect, since both, adsorption and post-adsorption phases of the VHSV multiplication cycle were affected. In contrast, both, autotrophic and heterotrophic P. cruentum EPSs showed anti-VHSV activity only after the adsorption phase. These results pave the way to use these EPSs to fight VHSV infections, and animate to evaluate the EPS antiviral activity against other viral pathogens relevant to the aquaculture industry.",,"Funding for open access publishing: Universidad Málaga/CBUA.

Considering a uniform magnetic field ( B ) aligned along the axis of helicoid, this problem is explored in the context of Dirac equation in a curved space‐time. As this system does not support exact solutions due to considered background, the bound‐state solutions and local density of states (LDOS) are obtained numerically by means of the Numerov method. The combined effects of width of the nanoribbon ( D ), length of ribbon ( L ), twist parameter (ω), and B on the equations of motion and LDOS are analyzed and discussed. It is verified that the presence of B produces a constant minimum value of local density of state on the axis of helicoid, which is possible only for values large enough of ω, in contrast to the case for already studied in the literature.","Acknowledgements The authors are indebted to the anonymous referees for an excellent and constructive review.

Peripheral regions in the Global South that offer favourable natural conditions for renewable energies are expected to become nodes of emerging global value chains. This has led to high expectations with regard to development impulses. The paper assesses the prospects of linkage-based development in the region of Antofagasta, Chile. Against the backdrop of expert interviews, secondary sources and insights gained at the first meeting of the region’s green hydrogen committee, the author cautions against being overly optimistic. The green hydrogen industry in Antofagasta benefits from horizontal linkages with the mining sector and related externalities. There are prospects for forward linkages with mining and also chemicals production. Backward linkages will, most likely, be limited to generic, low value-adding tasks. This restricts industrial diversification and upgrading by suppliers. Being capital intensive, the green hydrogen industry will not create many jobs.

While the 33 miners were rescued alive, 43 copper miners died in Chile the same year due to accidents in mining operations – the most significant number of mining fatalities in more than 20 years. The same year, copper reached its highest average annual price in history. Does this mean that high commodity prices induce a higher number of fatal accidents in mining operations? This paper addresses this question using 21 years of accident data in copper mines in Chile. We find that when the international price of copper surpasses approx. $5200/tonne, there is a strong positive correlation with the number of fatalities in copper mining. Scrutinizing such findings, we observe that the relationship mainly occurs with companies’ direct employees, while the number of deaths within contractors does not vary along with the copper price. Our results suggest that in the wave of high commodity prices, mining operations intensify their production processes, including rushing to bring back medium-sized operation sites that have previously been in care and maintenance, and which negatively affects the safety of operations.",Declaration of competing interest None.

In these theories, the Lagrangian contains the Ricci scalar and its first and second derivatives in a specific combination that makes them free of ghosts, thus corresponding to healthy biscalar extensions of general relativity. We examine two specific models, and for particular choices of the model parameters, we find that the effect of the additional terms is negligible at high redshifts, obtaining a coincidence with ΛCDM cosmology; however, as time passes, the deviation increases, and thus, at low redshifts the Hubble parameter acquires increased values (H0≈74 km/s/Mpc) in a controlled way. The mechanism behind this behavior is the fact that the effective dark-energy equation-of-state parameter exhibits phantom behavior, which implies faster expansion, which is one of the sufficient conditions that are capable of alleviating the H0 tension. Lastly, we confront the models with cosmic chronometer (CC) data, showing full agreement within 1σ confidence level.","M.

For a nonlinear f Q model there exist always the limit of General Relativity with or without the cosmological constant term. The de Sitter solution is always provided by the theory and for the specific models f A Q ≃ Q α α − 1 , f B Q ≃ Q + f 1 Q α α − 1 and f C Q ≃ Q + f 1 Q ln Q it was found to be the unique attractor. Consequently small deviations from STGR can solve the flatness problem and lead to a de Sitter expansion without introduce a cosmological constant term. This result is different from that given by the power-law theories for the other two scalar of the trinity of General Relativity. What makes the nonlinear symmetric teleparallel theory to stand out are the new degree of freedom provided by the connection defined in the non-coincidence frame which describes the nonzero spatial curvature.","Declaration of competing interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

We examine two studied f(Q) models of the literature, namely, the power-law and the exponential ones. For both cases, we obtain a matter-dominated saddle point characterized by the correct growth rate of matter perturbations, followed by the transition to a stable dark-energy-dominated accelerated universe in which matter perturbations remain constant. Furthermore, analyzing the behavior of fσ8, we find that the models fit observational data successfully, obtaining a behavior similar to that of the Lambda cold dark matter (ΛCDM) scenario, although the exponential model does not possess the latter as a particular limit. Hence, through the independent approach of dynamical systems, we do verify the results of observational confrontation, namely, that f(Q) gravity can be considered as a very promising alternative to the ΛCDM concordance model.","J.

At the background level we show that we can successfully describe the usual thermal history of the universe, with the sequence of matter and dark-energy epochs, while the dark-energy equation-of-state parameter can lie in the phantom regime, tending progressively to -1 at present and future times. Furthermore, we confront the theory with cosmic chronometer data, showing that the agreement is very good.

                    This study aims to investigate the main areas in which researchers are focusing their efforts in terms of sustainability in higher education (curriculum, campus greening, research, governance or outreach), the format in which this research is performed (in terms of individual or combined efforts) and the primary research focus (in terms of local or global issues).
                  
                  
                    Design/methodology/approach
                    Trends on sustainability research were investigated by means of an online survey – the World Survey on Sustainability Publishing and Research in Higher Education, which was disseminated among members of the European School of Sustainability Science and Research and the Inter-University Sustainable Development Research Programme.
                  
                  
                    Findings
                    The survey collected responses from 103 researchers across over 40 countries. Three trends emerged: in spite of the intrinsic value of sustainability research in higher education, this area is not as mature as one could expect; the range of themes covered is wide and addresses a variety of areas; and individuals working alone is the most common means of doing research, whereas research at the university, department and faculty level appears to be less common.

Esta estrategia metodológica supuso la realización de visitas a las zonas, observación de actividades cotidianas y entrevistas a los habitantes de los ETCR de Tierra Grata (César) y Pondores (Guajira). Todas estas acti­vidades estuvieron acompañadas de registros audiovisuales y ejercicios de video análisis. Entre los principales hallazgos que muestra este estudio es que el pro­ceso de reincorporación ha sido una tensión entre dos percepciones de la reincorporación, una de corte individualista promovida por la agencia para la reincorporación, y una segunda, colectivista, desarrollada por los excombatientes de las FARC-EP. Esta última caracterizada, por nuevas formas de organización política como el partido de las FARC (Fuerza Al­ternativa Revolucionaria del Común, hoy Comunes), consejos y comités políticos en los espacios territoriales, así como la creación de juntas de acción comunal han contribuido de manera decisiva en la permanencia en los ETCR, así como en el desarrollo de proyectos como la creación de un programa de vivienda para sus habitantes y el mejoramiento de servi­cios como el suministro de agua. La utilización de técnicas visuales como el video y la fotografía fueron centrales para captar la cotidianidad de la vida en los Espacios Territoria­les y, también, se convirtieron en un importante mecanismo de socializa­ción y reflexión conjunta con los firmantes de paz, sobre los principales temas y problemas de la reincorporación.",,,,,,,2023-05-19,2023,2023-05-19,2023,,,,All OA; Hybrid,Monograph,"Salcedo, José Fernando Sánchez; Jordán, Ana María Díaz; Hetzer, Andreas; Dießelmann, Anna-Lena; Schnettler, Bernt; Pach, Helen; Meneses, Luis Bernardo Bastidas","Salcedo, José Fernando Sánchez (); Jordán, Ana María Díaz (); Hetzer, Andreas (); Dießelmann, Anna-Lena (); Schnettler, Bernt (); Pach, Helen (); Meneses, Luis Bernardo Bastidas ()",,"Salcedo, José Fernando Sánchez (); Jordán, Ana María Díaz (); Hetzer, Andreas (); Dießelmann, Anna-Lena (); Schnettler, Bernt (); Pach, Helen (); Meneses, Luis Bernardo Bastidas ()",0,0,,,https://libros.univalle.edu.co/index.php/programaeditorial/catalog/download/780/585/4560,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1158209106,,

However, regional transformation requires more than just physical infrastructure; it particularly necessitates effective coordination among diverse actors to achieve development. The main objective of this document is to provide a detailed explanation of the actor network structure within the Bi-Oceanic Highway Corridor and propose a potential governance approach that facilitates improved coordination among participants. Through Social Network Analysis (SNA), we conducted an exploration of the participation dynamics and decision-making among the different actors involved. Our primary findings reveal a low level of private sector engagement, limited transnational links (with more interactions occurring among actors from the same country), scarce connections between national and subnational/local government actors, as well as minimal involvement of the national government in Argentina. Regarding the governance proposal, we suggest the creation of two new committees (Social and Environmental Development, and Border Security), the promotion of business missions with a regional integration approach, and the preservation of the progress made by the CVB Working Group.",,,Interações (Campo Grande),,,,2023-11-08,2023,2023-11-08,,,,e2444180-e2444180,All OA; Hybrid,Article,"Franco, Ledys; De Souza Borba Gonçalves, Julia; Atienza, Miguel; Barros, Pedro Silva","Franco, Ledys (Universidad Católica del Norte de Chile (UCN)); De Souza Borba Gonçalves, Julia (Instituto de Pesquisa Econômica Aplicada (IPEA)); Atienza, Miguel (Universidad Católica del Norte); Barros, Pedro Silva (Instituto de Pesquisa Econômica Aplicada (IPEA))",,"Franco, Ledys (Catholic University of the North); De Souza Borba Gonçalves, Julia (Instituto de Pesquisa Econômica Aplicada (IPEA)); Atienza, Miguel (Catholic University of the North); Barros, Pedro Silva (Instituto de Pesquisa Econômica Aplicada (IPEA))",0,0,,,https://www.interacoes.ucdb.br/interacoes/article/download/4180/2896,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1166938696,44 Human Society; 4407 Policy and Administration,

With densely built modernist architecture and relatively free building regulations, it is challenging to trace the actual development of the whole city. Compared to European cities, their overall urban landscapes are much denser, higher, and functionally mixed. In order to achieve a quicker and more accurate identification of urban forms in mega-cities, this study proposed a two-level machine-learning approach. At the building level, we extracted features from topographic maps and building licenses to automatically classify building types. Four state-of-the-art multi-class classification models were compared. At the block level, we used building types as input data and compared two methods for block clustering. In total 61,426 buildings from Taipei were classified and grouped into 10 block types. Different from Western cities, many of the block types in Taipei were mixtures of different types of buildings. This approach is efficient in exploring new urban form types, especially for emerging mega-cities where block types are previously unknown. The result not only sheds light on the features of East Asian urban landscapes but also serves as important basis of type-based strategic plans for contemporary urban issues.",,"FundingThe author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This work was supported by the PhD grant by Ministry of Education, Taiwan.",Environment and Planning B Urban Analytics and City Science,,,,2023-09-29,2023,2023-09-29,2024-05,51,4,854-869,All OA; Hybrid,Article,"Chen, Chih-Yu; Koch, Florian; Reicher, Christa","Chen, Chih-Yu (RWTH Aachen University, Germany); Koch, Florian (University of Applied Sciences HTW Berlin, Germany); Reicher, Christa (RWTH Aachen University, Germany)","Chen, Chih-Yu (RWTH Aachen University)","Chen, Chih-Yu (RWTH Aachen University); Koch, Florian (HAW Hamburg); Reicher, Christa (RWTH Aachen University)",3,3,,,https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/23998083231204606,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1164534501,33 Built Environment and Design; 3301 Architecture,11 Sustainable Cities and Communities

The millimetre continuum emission observed at an angular resolution of 20 milliarcsec (corresponding to 70 AU) reveals a bright compact central component whose spectral index indicates that it is composed of amorphous carbon dust. Based on these findings, we conclude that this emission traces the previously suggested dust disc observed in mid-infrared observations, and therefore our observations provide the first direct imaging of this disc. The H 12 CN( J = 4 → 3) line emission observed at an angular resolution of 300 milliarcsec (corresponding to 1000 AU) displays a bipolar structure with a north–south velocity gradient. From the position–velocity diagram of this emission, we identify the presence of an expanding disc and a bipolar molecular outflow. The inclination of the disc is determined to be i = 72°. The derived values for the de-projected expansion velocity and the radius of the disc are v exp = 53 km s −1 and R = 277 AU, respectively. On the other hand, the de-projected expansion velocity of the bipolar outflow detected in the H 12 CN( J = 4 → 3) emission is of approximately 1000 km s −1 . We propose that the molecular outflow has an hourglass morphology with an opening angle of around 60°. Our observations unambiguously show that an equatorial disc and bipolar outflows formed in Sakurai’s object during the 30 years following the occurrence of the born-again event, providing important constraints for future modelling efforts of this phenomenon.","This paper makes use of the following ALMA data: ADS/JAO.ALMA # 2017.1. 00017.S, 2018.1.00088.S and 2018.1.00341.S.

The fluid matter inside compact stars is described by the MIT bag model equation of state. For the anisotropy profile, we consider a local anisotropy that is both regular at the center and null at the star’s surface.

In this paper, we established an increasing sequence of lower bounds for the spectral radius of D. Our lower bounds improve some known lower bounds for the spectral radius that appear in the literature. Furthermore, this result allows us to obtain a sequence of upper bounds for the energy of D. We will show this sequence of upper bounds for energy E ( D ) decreases for a n ≤ γ ( k ) and increases for a n > γ ( k ) , where γ ( k ) is the graph parameter introduced in the paper.","The authors would like to express their sincere gratitude to the referees for their very careful reading of the paper and for insightful comments and valuable suggestions, which improved the presentation of this paper.",,Discrete Mathematics,,,,2023-01,2023,,2023-01,346,1,113118,All OA; Bronze,Article,"Ganie, Hilal A.; Carmona, Juan R.","Ganie, Hilal A.

As most of the existing literature on sensory atmospheres says little about the intersection between tourism and atmospheric production, this book affirms the centrality of the notion of ambiance as a mode of inquiry into the making and remaking of urban places for tourist consumption. The book takes the reader into the sensory worlds of a traditional Italian marketplace, a jungle park in Kuala Lumpur, a slum in the Colombian city of Medellín, or the “sun and sand” tourism destinations in Southern Spain, among other case studies. It offers new insights into the impact of tourism on the urban environment from multidisciplinary perspectives and a wide range of geographical regions across Europe, North America, Asia, and South America. Through these contemporary case studies, the book further deepens our understanding of the ways in which “ambiances” and “atmospheres” pervade the physical regeneration and sensory transformation of contemporary tourist destinations. Conversely, this book offers insights on the effects of tourism on everyday urban experience. By bringing together a diverse group of scholars and case studies to present a global perspective on the atmospheric production of the tourist city, this book is to serve as a valuable reference tool for researchers and undergraduate and postgraduate students with an interest in urban ambiances, tourism, cultural geography, and urban planning.",,,,,,,2023-02-21,2023,2023-02-21,,,,,All OA; Green,Edited Book,,,,,2,2,,,https://digital.csic.es/bitstream/10261/308332/1/Fullbook.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1155623191,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3504 Commercial Services; 3506 Marketing; 3508 Tourism; 44 Human Society; 4406 Human Geography",11 Sustainable Cities and Communities

Evidential deep learning stands out achieving remarkable performance in detecting out-of-distribution (OOD) data with a single deterministic neural network. Motivated by this fact, in this paper we propose the integration of an evidential deep learning method into a continual learning framework in order to perform simultaneously incremental object classification and OOD detection. Moreover, we analyze the ability of vacuity and dissonance to differentiate between in-distribution data belonging to old classes and OOD data. The proposed method 1, called CEDL, is evaluated on CIFAR-100 considering two settings consisting of 5 and 10 tasks, respectively. From the obtained results, we could appreciate that the proposed method, in addition to provide comparable results in object classification with respect to the baseline, largely outperforms OOD detection compared to several posthoc methods on three evaluation metrics: AUROC, AUPR and FPR95.","This work is funded by the Government of Chile through its ANID (No. FONDECYT INICIACIÓN 11230262), the Horizon EU project MUSAE (No. 01070-421), 2021-SGR-01094 (AGAUR), Icrea Academia’2022 (Generalitat de Catalunya), Robo STEAM (2022-1-BG01-KA220-VET-000089434, Erasmus+ EU), DeepSense (ACE053/22/000029, ACCIÓ), DeepFoodVol (AEI-MICINN, PDC2022-133642-I00), PID2022-141566NB-I00 (AEI-MICINN), CERCA Programme / Generalitat de Catalunya, and grants PID2022-143257NB-I00, TED2021-132513B- I00, PID2019-104174GB-I00 funded by MCIN/AEI/10.13039/501100011033, Spanish Government.","This work is funded by the Government of Chile through its ANID (No. FONDECYT INICIACIÓN 11230262), the Horizon EU project MUSAE (No. 01070-421), 2021-SGR-01094 (AGAUR), Icrea Academia’2022 (Generalitat de Catalunya), Robo STEAM (2022-1-BG01-KA220-VET-000089434, Erasmus+ EU), DeepSense (ACE053/22/000029, ACCIÓ), DeepFoodVol (AEI-MICINN, PDC2022-133642-I00), PID2022-141566NB-I00 (AEI-MICINN), CERCA Programme / Generalitat de Catalunya, and grants PID2022-143257NB-I00, TED2021-132513B- I00, PID2019-104174GB-I00 funded by MCIN/AEI/10.13039/501100011033, Spanish Government.",,2023 IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision Workshops (ICCVW),,,2023-10-06,2023,,2023-10-06,00,,3436-3446,All OA; Green,Proceeding,"Aguilar, Eduardo; Raducanu, Bogdan; Radeva, Petia; Van de Weijer, Joost","Aguilar, Eduardo (Dept. de Ingeniería de Sistemas y Computación, Universidad Católica del Norte, Antofagasta, Chile; Computer Vision Center, Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain; Dept. de Matemàtiques i Informàtica, Universitat de Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain); Raducanu, Bogdan (Computer Vision Center, Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain); Radeva, Petia (Computer Vision Center, Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain; Dept. de Matemàtiques i Informàtica, Universitat de Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain); Van de Weijer, Joost (Computer Vision Center, Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain)","Aguilar, Eduardo (Catholic University of the North; Computer Vision Center; University of Barcelona)","Aguilar, Eduardo (Catholic University of the North; Computer Vision Center; University of Barcelona); Raducanu, Bogdan (Computer Vision Center); Radeva, Petia (Computer Vision Center; University of Barcelona); Van de Weijer, Joost (Computer Vision Center)",2,2,,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.02995,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1167352374,46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4605 Data Management and Data Science; 4611 Machine Learning,

Several investigations raised questions about the determinations of smaller and intermediate earthquakes using Mw scale. Recent investigations (Das et al. in Bull Seismol Soc Am 108(4):1995–2007, 2018b) show that the moment magnitude scale Mw is not applicable for lower and intermediate ranges throughout the world and does not efficiently represent the seismic source potential due to its dependence on surface wave magnitudes; therefore, an observed seismic moment (M0)-based magnitude scale, Mwg, which smoothly connects seismic source processes and highly correlates with seismic-radiated energy (Es) compared to the Mw scale is suggested. With the goal of constructing a homogeneous data set of Mwg to be used for earthquake-related studies, relationships for body wave (mb) and surface wave magnitudes (Ms) toward Mwg have been developed using regression methodologies such as generalized orthogonal regression (GOR) (GOR1: GOR relation is expressed in terms of the observed independent variable; and GOR2: GOR relation is used inappropriately in terms of theoretical true point of GOR line) and standard least-square regression (SLR). In order to establish regression relationships, global data have been considered during 1976–2014 for mb magnitudes of 524,790 events from the International Seismological Centre (ISC) and 326,201 events from the National Earthquake Information Center (NEIC), Ms magnitudes of 111,443 events from ISC along with 41,810 Mwg events data from the Global Centroid Moment Tensor (GCMT). Scaling relationships have been obtained between mb and Mwg for magnitude range 4.5 ≤ mb ≤ 6.2 for ISC and NEIC events using GOR1, GOR2 and SLR methodologies. Furthermore, scaling relationships between Ms and Mwg have been obtained for magnitude ranges 3.0 ≤ Ms ≤ 6.1 and 6.2 ≤ Ms ≤ 8.4 using GOR1, GOR2 and SLR procedures. Our analysis found that GOR1 provides improved estimates of dependent variable compared to GOR2 and SLR on the basis of statistical parameters (mainly uncertainty on slope and intercept, RMSE and Rxy) as reported in Das et al. (2018b). The derived global scaling relationships would be helpful for various seismological applications such as seismicity, seismic hazard and Risk assessment studies.",The article has been benefitted from funding by the Fondo Nacional de Desarrollo Cientifico y Technologico (FONDECYT) Grant Number 11200618.

For this gravitational model the field equations admit a point-like Lagrangian with as unknown functions the scalar field potential and the coupling function which is responsible for the chameleon mechanism. Noether’s first theorem provides us with four sets of closed-form functional forms for which variational symmetries exist. We construct the corresponding conservation laws and we use them in order to determine new analytic solutions in chameleon gravity. From the analysis of the physical properties of the new solution it follows that in the late universe they can reproduce the Λ CDM model without having to assume the presence of a pressureless fluid in the cosmological fluid.,"Declaration of competing interest I declare no conflict of interest.

Educational experience of economic valuation in Chile,"Coastal wetlands are important habitats for human well-being due to their ecosystem services, which require tools to ensure their conservation. Environmental management proposes to estimate the economic value of environmental resources that make decisions in both the ecological and economic spheres. A learning experience was carried out in the context of postgraduate students, addressing the contents of the Economic Aspects of Sustainable Development subject, to then give way to the implementation of two economic valuation methods. The valuation of El Culebrón Wetland was carried out using Contingent Valuation (CV) and Defensive Expenditure (DE) estimation methods in an academic framework. The 20-year valuation results were US$5,750,000 (CV) and US$3,050,009 (DC). The experience allowed us to estimate the economic value of wetlands and reflect on the opportunities and complexities that the application of these methodologies implies, linked to decision-making with an emphasis on the conservation of these vulnerable and productive ecosystems, leaving ethical questions about economic valuation.",,,Research Square,,,,2023-09-21,2023,2023-09-21,,,,,All OA; Green,Preprint,"Araya-Piñones, Angelo; Bakit, José; Flores, Mario; Guerrero, Matías; Silva, Mariela; Valencia-Ceballos, Leslie; Varela, Fabiola; Poblete, Rodrigo","Araya-Piñones, Angelo (Programa de Magíster en Gestión Ambiental, Facultad de Ciencias del Mar, Universidad Catolica del Norte, Larrondo 1281, Coquimbo, Chile); Bakit, José (Departamento de Acuicultura, Facultad de Ciencias del Mar, Universidad Católica del Norte, Larrondo 1281, Coquimbo, Chile.); Flores, Mario (Programa de Magíster en Gestión Ambiental, Facultad de Ciencias del Mar, Universidad Católia del Norte, Larrondo 1281, Coquimbo, Chile.); Guerrero, Matías (Programa de Magíster en Gestión Ambiental, Facultad de Ciencias del Mar, Universidad Católica del Norte, Larrondo 1281, Coquimbo, Chile.); Silva, Mariela (Programa de Magíster en Gestión Ambiental, Facultad de Ciencias del Mar, Universidad Católica del Norte, Larrondo 1281, Coquimbo, Chile.); Valencia-Ceballos, Leslie (Centro de Investigación en Materiales Avanzados, S.C., Unidad Durango, Calle CIMAV 110, Ejido Arroyo Seco, Durango, México, 34147.); Varela, Fabiola (Programa de Magister en Gestión Ambiental, Facultad de Ciencias del Mar, Universidad Católica del Norte, Larrondo 1281, Coquimbo, Chile.); Poblete, Rodrigo (Universidad Católica del Norte, Facultad de Ciencias del Mar, Escuela de Prevención de Riesgos y Medio Ambiente)",,"Araya-Piñones, Angelo (Catholic University of the North); Bakit, José (Catholic University of the North); Flores, Mario (Programa de Magíster en Gestión Ambiental, Facultad de Ciencias del Mar, Universidad Católia del Norte, Larrondo 1281, Coquimbo, Chile.); Guerrero, Matías (Catholic University of the North); Silva, Mariela (Catholic University of the North); Valencia-Ceballos, Leslie (Centro de Investigación en Materiales Avanzados); Varela, Fabiola (Catholic University of the North); Poblete, Rodrigo (Catholic University of the North)",0,0,,,https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-3211015/latest.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1164224410,38 Economics; 3801 Applied Economics; 41 Environmental Sciences; 4104 Environmental Management,

We report on the detection of ∼100 000 new proper motions in four fields covering the far side of the Galactic bar/bulge, at negative longitudes. Our proper motions have been obtained using observations from the Advance Camera for Surveys (ACS), on board of the Hubble Space Telescope (HST), with a time-baseline of 8–9 years, which has produced accuracies better than 0.5 mas yr−1 for a significant fraction of the stellar populations with F814W < 23 mag. Interestingly, as shown in previous works, the Hess diagrams show a strikingly similar proper motion distribution to fields closer to the Galactic center and consistent with an old stellar population. The observed kinematics point to a significant bulge rotation, which seems to predominate even in fields as far as l ≃ −8°, and is also reflected in the changes of the velocity ellipsoid in the l, b plane as a function of distance.","We would like to thank the anonymous referee for comments and advice that have greatly improved the clarity of the paper.

243,pub.1163036343,10.1093/mnras/stad2344,,,Kinematics of Galactic Centre clouds shaped by shear-seeded solenoidal turbulence,"ABSTRACT The Central Molecular Zone (CMZ; the central ∼500 pc of the Galaxy) is a kinematically unusual environment relative to the Galactic disc, with high-velocity dispersions and a steep size–linewidth relation of the molecular clouds. In addition, the CMZ region has a significantly lower star formation rate (SFR) than expected by its large amount of dense gas. An important factor in explaining the low SFR is the turbulent state of the star-forming gas, which seems to be dominated by rotational modes. However, the turbulence driving mechanism remains unclear. In this work, we investigate how the Galactic gravitational potential affects the turbulence in CMZ clouds. We focus on the CMZ cloud G0.253+0.016 (‘the Brick’), which is very quiescent and unlikely to be kinematically dominated by stellar feedback. We demonstrate that several kinematic properties of the Brick arise naturally in a cloud-scale hydrodynamics simulation, that takes into account the Galactic gravitational potential. These properties include the line-of-sight velocity distribution, the steepened size–linewidth relation, and the predominantly solenoidal nature of the turbulence. Within the simulation, these properties result from the Galactic shear in combination with the cloud’s gravitational collapse. This is a strong indication that the Galactic gravitational potential plays a crucial role in shaping the CMZ gas kinematics, and is a major contributor to suppressing the SFR, by inducing predominantly solenoidal turbulent modes.","This work was carried out by the ACES Collaboration as part of the ALMA CMZ Exploration Survey.

We revisit the generalized EFT framework of modified teleparallel gravity, and apply it by considering both linear and second-order perturbations for f(T) theory. We find that no new scalar mode is present in both linear and second-order perturbations in f(T) gravity, which suggests a strong coupling problem. However, based on the ratio of cubic to quadratic Lagrangians, we provide a simple estimation of the strong coupling scale, a result which shows that the strong coupling problem can be avoided at least for some modes. In conclusion, perturbation behaviors that at first appear problematic may not inevitably lead to a strong coupling problem, as long as the relevant scale is comparable with the cutoff scale M of the applicability of the theory.",,,Journal of Cosmology and Astroparticle Physics,,,,2023-07-01,2023,2023-07-28,2023-07-01,2023,07,060,All OA; Green,Article,"Hu, Yu-Min; Zhao, Yaqi; Ren, Xin; Wang, Bo; Saridakis, Emmanuel N.; Cai, Yi-Fu","Hu, Yu-Min (Deep Space Exploration Laboratory/School of Physical Sciences, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, Anhui 230026, China; CAS Key Laboratory for Researches in Galaxies and Cosmology/Department of Astronomy, School of Astronomy and Space Science, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, Anhui 230026, China); Zhao, Yaqi (Deep Space Exploration Laboratory/School of Physical Sciences, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, Anhui 230026, China; CAS Key Laboratory for Researches in Galaxies and Cosmology/Department of Astronomy, School of Astronomy and Space Science, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, Anhui 230026, China); Ren, Xin (Deep Space Exploration Laboratory/School of Physical Sciences, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, Anhui 230026, China; CAS Key Laboratory for Researches in Galaxies and Cosmology/Department of Astronomy, School of Astronomy and Space Science, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, Anhui 230026, China); Wang, Bo (Deep Space Exploration Laboratory/School of Physical Sciences, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, Anhui 230026, China; CAS Key Laboratory for Researches in Galaxies and Cosmology/Department of Astronomy, School of Astronomy and Space Science, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, Anhui 230026, China); Saridakis, Emmanuel N.

This causes adverse morphological effects on benthic microorganisms, such as foraminifera. This group is one of the most susceptible to environmental deterioration, so they can be used as pollution biomarkers by identifying shell abnormalities. Therefore, 28 sediment samples from northern Chile were analyzed, calculating the Abnormality Index-FAI and its spatio-temporal distributions in benthic foraminifera. As well as the minimum and maximum abnormality percentages and their relationship with heavy metals concentrations, using a generalized non-linear model and a principal component analysis. The results indicated a proportion of abnormal shells within the ranges described for polluted areas conditions, revealing environmental stress conditions. This reflected a change in the environmental conditions in the most recent sediments of the bay. The highest FAI values were observed to the southwest of the bay, caused by the local current system. The species Bolivina seminuda, Buliminella elegantissima, and Epistominella exigua presented a greater number of deformities, allowing them to be used as contamination biomarkers. A significant correlation was found between Ti, Mn, Ni, Va, and Ba with decreased chamber sizes, wrong coiling, scars, and number of abnormality types. This suggests the effect of the particular geochemical conditions of the area on the heavy metals that cause toxic effects on foraminifera. These analyses are an efficient tool for identifying the effects of environmental stress before they occur in higher organisms, mitigating the environmental impact on marine biodiversity.",,,Research Square,,,,2023-03-15,2023,2023-03-15,,,,,All OA; Green,Preprint,"Martínez, Laura Tavera; Marchant, Margarita; Díaz, Roberto T.

But the reality falls far from the vision, as the implementation of ambitious goals in the form of smart city projects in subcontracting mode occurs in complicated socio-techno-political settings, which often end up in failure. Institutional facets of political commitment and its impact on public value creation are not fully recognized. To close this gap, this study adopts the approach of political commitment to identify and analyze those elements that could hinder the provision of public value in a smart city project. To do so, we perform a qualitative analysis of four smart city initiatives' failures in different countries. The findings reveal that particular elements associated with political commitment in subcontracting projects impact public value provision in smart city initiatives. Particularly, the key role of the continuation of political commitment in its institutionalization phase leads to a loss of public value within strategic, political, and financial spheres. Our study contributes to better recognition of institutional settings that contribute to smart city initiatives’ failure.",,,,Proceedings of the 24th Annual International Conference on Digital Government Research,,,2023-07-11,2023,2023-07-11,2023-07-11,,,449-457,All OA; Bronze,Proceeding,"Ciesielska, Magdalena; Ortiz, Aurora Sanchez","Ciesielska, Magdalena (Informatics in Management, Gdansk University of Technology, Poland); Ortiz, Aurora Sanchez (Universidad Catolica del Norte, Chile)",,"Ciesielska, Magdalena (Gdańsk University of Technology); Ortiz, Aurora Sanchez (Catholic University of the North)",1,1,,,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3598469.3598520,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1160580707,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3507 Strategy, Management and Organisational Behaviour; 44 Human Society; 4407 Policy and Administration",

                  We consider the unified bulk viscous scenarios and constrain them using the Cosmic Microwave Background observations from Planck 2018 and the Pantheon sample from Type Ia supernovae. Then we generate the luminosity distance measurements from ${\cal O}(10^3)$ mock Gravitational Wave Standard Sirens (GWSS) events for the proposed Einstein Telescope. We then combine these mock luminosity distance measurements from the GWSS with the current cosmological probes in order to forecast how the mock GWSS data could be effective in constraining these bulk viscous scenarios. Our results show that a non-zero time dependent bulk viscosity in the universe sector is strongly preferred by the current cosmological probes and will possibly be confirmed at many standard deviations by the future GWSS measurements. We further mention that the addition of GWSS data can significantly reduce the uncertainties of the key cosmological parameters obtained from the usual cosmological probes employed in this work.","The authors thank the referee for some important comments which helped us to improve the article considerably.

We considered a classical, finite and uniform average magnetic field background ⟨B(x)⟩Δ=B, subject to white-noise fluctuations with autocorrelation of magnitude ΔB. By means of the Schwinger representation of the propagator in the average magnetic field as a reference system, we used the replica formalism to study the effects of the magnetic noise at the mean-field level, in terms of a vector order parameter Qj=ieΔB⟪ψ¯γjψ⟫Δ whose magnitude represents the ensemble average (over magnetic noise) of the fermion currents. We identified the region where this order parameter acquires a finite value, thus breaking the U(1) symmetry of the model due to the presence of the magnetic noise.","J. D. C.-Y. and E.

This preliminary work highlighted a significant absence of local institutional involvement in international publications. In light of this, a follow‐up study was conducted to confirm or refute these first impressions, by comparing the search in two bibliographic databases: Web of Science and Scopus. The results show that almost 60% of the publications based directly on data from the Puna, the Altiplano, or the Atacama Desert with objectives related to planetary science or astrobiology do not include any local institutional partner (Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, and Peru). Indeed, and beyond the ethical questioning of international collaborations, Latin‐American planetary science deserves a strategic structuring, networking, as well as a road map at national and continental scales, not only to enhance research, development, and innovation, but also to protect an exceptional natural heritage sampling extreme environmental niches on Earth. Examples of successful international collaborations such as the field of meteorites, terrestrial analogs, and space exploration in Chile or astrobiology in Mexico are given as illustrations and possible directions to follow to develop planetary science in South America. To promote appropriate scientific practices involving local researchers, possible responses at academic and institutional levels will eventually be discussed.","Acknowledgments The authors acknowledge Amy Marquardt for a careful review of the manuscript, two anonymous reviewers for their comments that improved the content of this article and the meticulous work of the editor Dr. A.J.

                    This study aims to investigate a framework for implementation of legislative framework governing records management throughout the life cycle in the Limpopo provincial government of South Africa.
                  
                  
                    Design/methodology/approach
                    This quantitative multi-method study used a semi-structured questionnaire, document analysis and interviews to collect data. The dominant approach was quantitative, with some support from limited qualitative data, which served to clarify the statistical data. No sampling method was applied, as the study targeted the entire population of 135 records management participants from the provincial departments with the questionnaire, while nine participants from provincial archives participated in interviews.
                  
                  
                    Findings
                    The study revealed that the role of the provincial archives in enforcing compliance with legislative frameworks for the proper management of records was always disrupted by a lack of key resources such as staffing, for inspecting and training records-creating departments and working resources at the departmental levels.
                  
                  
                    Research limitations/implications
                    The findings will contribute to the field in respect of future studies into compliance with records management legislation, and the proposed framework may be applied as a theoretical basis for, or part of, a conceptual framework.
                  
                  
                    Practical implications
                    The study will serve as a resource or benchmark for archivists and records management professionals in the industry, as they count amongst the policymakers who find ways of monitoring, evaluating and enforcing compliance with the legislation governing proper records management.
                  
                  
                    Social implications
                    The proper implementation of recommendations from this study will lead to significant improvements in the management of records with enduring value, allowing them to finally be transferred to an archival repository to serve the public interest as heritage, national memory, or resources for researchers and authors, amongst others.

226,pub.1164979656,10.1093/mnras/stad3178,,,CAPOS: the bulge Cluster APOgee Survey IV elemental abundances of the bulge globular cluster NGC 6558,"ABSTRACT This study presents the results concerning six red giant stars members of the globular cluster NGC 6558. Our analysis utilized high-resolution near-infrared spectra obtained through the CAPOS initiative (the APOgee Survey of Clusters in the Galactic Bulge), which focuses on surveying clusters within the Galactic Bulge, as a component of the Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment II survey (APOGEE-2). We employ the Brussels Automatic Code for Characterizing High accUracy Spectra (BACCHUS) code to provide line-by-line elemental-abundances for Fe-peak (Fe, Ni), α-(O, Mg, Si, Ca, Ti), light-(C, N), odd-Z (Al), and the s-process element (Ce) for the four stars with high-signal-to-noise ratios. This is the first reliable measure of the CNO abundances for NGC 6558. Our analysis yields a mean metallicity for NGC 6558 of 〈[Fe/H]〉 = −1.15 ± 0.08, with no evidence for a metallicity spread. We find a Solar Ni abundance, 〈[Ni/Fe]〉 ∼ +0.01, and a moderate enhancement of α-elements, ranging between +0.16 and <+0.42, and a slight enhancement of the s-process element 〈[Ce/Fe]〉 ∼ +0.19. We also found low levels of 〈[Al/Fe]〉 ∼ +0.09, but with a strong enrichment of nitrogen, [N/Fe] > +0.99, along with a low level of carbon, [C/Fe] < −0.12. This behaviour of Nitrogen-Carbon is a typical chemical signature for the presence of multiple stellar populations in virtually all GCs; this is the first time that it is reported in NGC 6558. We also observed a remarkable consistency in the behaviour of all the chemical species compared to the other CAPOS bulge GCs of the same metallicity.","DG-D and JGF-T gratefully acknowledge support from the Joint Committee ESO-Government of Chile 2021 (ORP 023/2021).

The overall removal efficiency for COD was 63% and 15% using FP and CPC, respectively. Also, for the overall removal efficiency of polyphenols, a percentage of 73% and 43% were obtained using FP and CPC, respectively. When ozone was used in the solar photoreactors, the resulting trends were similar. COD and polyphenol removal, using an FP photoreactor in the solar photo-Fenton/O3 process, resulted in values of 98.8% and 86.2% after the process. COD and polyphenol removal, using solar photo-Fenton/O3 process in a CPC, resulted in values of 49.5% and 72.4%, respectively. The economic indicators of annual worth and economic treatment capacity established that FP reactors represent lower costs than CPCs.

Besides, we find that thermal fluctuations, which appear as a logarithmic term in the entropy, affect the stability of the black hole and change the phase transition point.

225,pub.1166261172,10.1093/mnras/stad3611,,,The merger of hard binaries in globular clusters as the primary channel for the formation of second-generation stars,"ABSTRACT We have recently presented observational evidence which suggests that the origin of the second-generation (G2) stars in globular clusters (GCs) is due to the binary-mediated collision of primordial (G1) low-mass main-sequence (MS) stars. This mechanism avoids both the mass budget problem and the need of external gas for dilution. Here, we report on another piece of evidence supporting this scenario: (1) the fraction of MS binaries is proportional to the fraction of G1 stars in GCs and, at the same time, (2) the smaller the fraction of G1 stars is, the more deficient binaries of higher mass ratio (q>0.7) are. They are, on average, harder than their smaller mass-ratio counterparts due to higher binding energy at a given primary mass. Then (2) implies that (1) is due to the merging/collisions of hard binaries rather than to their disruption. These new results complemented by the present-day data on binaries lead to the following conclusions: (i) the mass-ratio distribution of binaries, particularly short-period ones, with low-mass primaries, MP < 1.5 M⊙, is strongly peaked close to q=1.0, whereas (ii) dynamical processes at high stellar density tend to destroy softer binaries and make hard (nearly) twin binaries to become even harder and favour their mergers and collisions. G2 stars formed this way gain mass that virtually doubles the primary one, 2MP, at which the number of G1 stars is approximately five times smaller than at MP according to the slope of a Milky Way-like initial mass function at MMS < 1.0 M⊙.",The authors thank the anonymous referee for both the expressed interest to the results obtained in this paper and for useful comments that improved its final version.,,Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society,,,,2023-11-22,2023,2023-11-22,2023-11-27,527,3,7005-7012,All OA; Hybrid,Article,"Kravtsov, Valery; Dib, Sami; Calderón, Francisco A","Kravtsov, Valery (Sternberg Astronomical Institute, Lomonosov Moscow State University, University Avenue 13, Moscow 119899, Russia); Dib, Sami (Max Planck Institute for Astronomy, Königstuhl 17, D-69117 Heidelberg, Germany); Calderón, Francisco A (Departamento de Física, Universidad Católica del Norte, Av.

225,pub.1163561819,10.1016/j.dark.2023.101318,,,Dark Universe phenomenology from Yukawa potential?,"We argue that the effect of cold dark matter in the cosmological setup can be explained by the coupling between the baryonic matter particles in terms of the long-range force having a graviton mass m g via the Yukawa gravitational potential. Such a quantum-corrected Yukawa-like gravitational potential is characterized by the coupling parameter α , the wavelength parameter λ , which is related to the graviton mass via m g = ħ / ( λ c ) , that determines the range of the force and, finally, a Planck length quantity l 0 that makes the potential regular at the centre. The modified Friedmann equations are obtained using Verlinde’s entropic force interpretation of gravity based on the holographic scenario and the equipartition law of energy. The parameter α modifies the Newton’s constant as G eff = G ( 1 + α ) . Interestingly, we find an equation that relates the dark matter density, dark energy density, and baryonic matter density. It is given by Ω D = 2 Ω B Ω Λ ( 1 + z ) 3 . We argue that dark matter is an apparent effect as no dark matter particle exists in this picture. Furthermore, the dark energy is also related to graviton mass and α ; in particular, we point out that the cosmological constant can be viewed as a self-interaction effect between gravitons. We further show a precise correspondence with Verlinde’s emergent gravity theory, and due to the long-range force, the theory can be viewed as a non-local gravity theory. To this end, we performed the phase space analyses and estimated λ ≃ 1 0 3 [Mpc] and α ≃ 0 . 04 , respectively. Finally, from these values, for the graviton mass, we get m g ≃ 1 0 − 68 kg, and cosmological constant Λ ≃ 1 0 − 52 m − 2 . Further, we argue how this theory reproduces the MOND phenomenology on galactic scales via the acceleration of Milgrom a 0 ≃ 1 0 − 10 m / s 2 .","Declaration of competing interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

What has changed over time is the perception, description, and practice of diversity in and by societies – and the way in which it is dealt with and employed by governments. That is, the phenomenon has been around for a long time, but its framing and application have been transformed. Towards the end of the nineteenth century, all European empires employed the ‘rule of colonial difference’. This often encompassed an essentializing of identity markers such as race, caste, religion, and gender, ascribing to them static characteristics of ‘otherness’. This chapter opens a window into how ‘diversity’ was practised, understood, framed, and conceptualized across imperial, apartheid, and post-apartheid phases in South Africa. This chapter argues that diversity was seen, employed, and implemented in quite distinct ways in these phases, and that throughout the past century, diversity, that is (dis)similarities of communities and how these were/are negotiated, differed significantly over space and time. To illustrate this argument, this chapter looks at the developments in the educational sector in South Africa with a particular focus on what these meant for Indian communities.

Long wave forcing in the form of solitary waves and error function waves was applied to both pre-inundated high water level conditions with currents, and to low water level runup loading without currents. Behind the wall, the cross-shore peak load declined as a function of the sheltering angle; on the other hand, the highest loads occurred with seawall lengths that exposed the instrumented structures. Flow concentration around the end of the wall caused higher velocities when a structure was just exposed, and led to large loads for nonbreaking waves at these wall lengths. For cases with breaking waves, particularly for inundation conditions, the wave breaking location was also a determining factor of the magnitude of loading, as larger loads were observed when a wave broke far enough in front of the first structure that a strong bore had developed. These results will serve to provide a better understanding of the wave impact to a coastal urban region in a tsunami event when the seawall is breached.","Work here was funded by the National Institute of Standards and Technology, and by the National Science Foundation under grants 1661015 and 1727662.

The effects of climate change from human-made emissions of greenhouse gases are devastating and accelerating, yet are uncertain and uneven both in terms of geography and socio-economic impacts. Emerging from the dynamics of capitalism since the industrial revolution—as well as industrialization under state-led socialism—the consequences of climate change are especially profound for the countryside and its inhabitants. This book interrogates the narratives and strategies that frame climate change and examines the institutionalised responses in agrarian settings, highlighting what exclusions and inclusions result. It explores how different people—in relation to class and other co-constituted axes of social difference such as gender, race, ethnicity, age and occupation—are affected by climate change, as well as the climate adaptation and mitigation responses being implemented in rural areas. This book in turn explores how climate change—and the responses to it—affects processes of social differentiation, trajectories of accumulation and in turn agrarian politics. Finally, this book examines what strategies are required to confront climate change and the underlying political-economic dynamics that cause it, reflecting on what this means for agrarian struggles across the world. The 26 chapters in this volume explore how the relationship between capitalism and climate change plays out in the rural world and, in particular, the way agrarian struggles connect with the huge challenge of climate change. Through a huge variety of case studies alongside more conceptual chapters, this book makes the often-missing connection between climate change and critical agrarian studies. This book argues that making the connection between climate and agrarian justice is crucial.

Furthermore, it seeks to identify the specific strategies that these companies use to foster ethical behaviour and promote sustainability in their business operations.   Design/methodology/approach The study entails a bibliometric analysis and a set of case studies from a sample of companies working in different industry sectors. Based on these tools, it analyses whether – and how – enterprises are placing an emphasis on sustainability and ethics as part of their businesses. In addition, the selected companies' unethical practices or socially irresponsible corporate activities were investigated and presented.   Findings The findings suggest that using an ethics perspective can be a valuable tool in improving the accuracy and correctness of business decision-making. In addition, the paper has identified the fact that sustainability standards can be used to improve customer satisfaction as many important issues are addressed. Finally, the paper highlights the importance of ethical considerations when designing and implementing sustainability standards at enterprises and the need for regulatory guidance in this regard.   Originality/value The paper addresses the need for studies on how sustainability and ethics are being discussed by both the literature and companies. The paper presents some elements that can be used as possible corporate indicators for a wider implementation of sustainability and ethics objectives in enterprises.","This study is part of the “00 papers to accelerate the implementation of the UN Sustainable Development Goals” initiative.

As the existing literature in this application domain is vast and has exponentially grown over the last years, this work remarks the key relevant milestones and contributions that may allow readers to concisely capture the foundations and evolution on which the modern Big Data Analytics (BDA) framework is deployed in this field. Here, it is covered from the first Artificial Intelligent solutions that relied on rule-based expert systems, passing through the usage of Data Mining techniques and arriving to the BDA unfolding, including its trends and prospects in the power industry. Due to exponential increase of metering and communication infrastructure deployment, as well as the impact of distributed generation, one of the stages in the power delivery process that has been particularly revolutionized by the BDA breakthrough is the distribution sector. For this context, the latest and most noteworthy perspectives and experiences are also addresses to highlight the relevance and applicability of knowledge extraction from big data in future power distribution networks.",Declaration of Competing Interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.,,Electric Power Systems Research,,,,2023-05,2023,,2023-05,218,,109193,All OA; Hybrid,Article,"Dominguez, Xavier; Prado, Alvaro; Arboleya, Pablo; Terzija, Vladimir","Dominguez, Xavier (Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Oviedo, Gijón, Spain); Prado, Alvaro (Departamento de Ingeniería de Sistemas y Computación (DISC), Universidad Católica del Norte (UCN), Antofagasta, Chile); Arboleya, Pablo (Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Oviedo, Gijón, Spain); Terzija, Vladimir (Center for Energy Science and Technology, Skolkovo Institute of Science and Technology, Moscow, Russia)","Dominguez, Xavier (University of Oviedo)","Dominguez, Xavier (University of Oviedo); Prado, Alvaro (Catholic University of the North); Arboleya, Pablo (University of Oviedo); Terzija, Vladimir (Skolkovo Institute of Science and Technology)",9,9,,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.epsr.2023.109193,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1155349458,40 Engineering; 4008 Electrical Engineering,"9 Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure"
223,pub.1164288049,10.1093/mnras/stad2888,,,Light elements Na and Al in 58 bulge spheroid stars from APOGEE,"ABSTRACT We identified a sample of 58 candidate stars with metallicity [Fe/H] ≲ −0.8 that likely belong to the old bulge spheroid stellar population, and analyse their Na and Al abundances from Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment (APOGEE) spectra. In a previous work, we inspected APOGEE-Stellar Parameter and Chemical Abundance Pipeline abundances of C, N, O, Mg, Al, Ca, Si, and Ce in this sample. Regarding Na lines, one of them appears very strong in about 20 per cent of the sample stars, but it is not confirmed by other Na lines, and can be explained by sky lines, which affect the reduced spectra of stars in a certain radial velocity range. The Na abundances for 15 more reliable cases were taken into account. Al lines in the H band instead appear to be very reliable. Na and Al exhibit a spread in abundances, whereas no spread in N abundances is found, and we found no correlation between them, indicating that these stars could not be identified as second-generation stars that originated in globular clusters. We carry out the study of the behaviour of Na and Al in our sample of bulge stars and literature data by comparing them with chemodynamical evolution model suitable for the Galactic bulge. The Na abundances show a large spread, and the chemodynamical models follow the main data, whereas for aluminum instead, the models reproduce very satisfactorily the nearly secondary-element behaviour of aluminum in the metallicity range below [Fe/H] ≲ −1.0. For the lower-metallicity end ([Fe/H < −2.5), hypernovae are assumed to be the main contributor to yields.","BB acknowledges grants from FAPESP, CNPq, and CAPES – Financial code 001.

Deep ensembles have shown better parameter estimations and often provide reliable uncertainty estimates that contribute to the robustness of the results. In this work, we propose a new metric to identify samples that are hard to classify. Our metric is defined as coincidence score for deep ensembles which measures the agreement of its individual models. The main hypothesis we rely on is that deep learning algorithms learn the low-loss samples better compared to large-loss samples. In order to compensate for this, we use controlled over-sampling on the identified ”hard” samples using proper data augmentation schemes to enable the models to learn those samples better. We validate the proposed metric using two public food datasets on different backbone architectures and show the improvements compared to the conventional deep neural network training using different performance metrics.","Declaration of competing interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

In particular, the kinetic part of the Brans–Dicke scalar field is modified such that the equation of motion for the scalar field is modified according to the quadratic Generalized Uncertainty Principle (GUP). For the background geometry, we assume the homogeneous and isotropic Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker metric. We investigate the dynamics and the cosmological evolution of the dynamical variables of the theory, and we compare the results with the unmodified Brans–Dicke theory. It follows that in consideration because of the additional degrees of freedom in the energy-momentum tensor the dynamical variables describe various aspects of the cosmological history. This is one of the first studies on the effects of GUP in a Machian gravitational theory.","This work is based on the research supported in part by the National Research Foundation of South Africa (Grant Number 131604).

In Chile, two kelp fishery management policies were implemented sequentially over the last 20 years and currently co-exist. We analysed fishers’ perceptions regarding the performance of a territorial user rights policy and a regional management plan policy operating in what were historically open access areas along the coastline of two important kelp production regions in northern Chile. Interviews with Directorates of fisher associations were used to report key dimensions of both regimes, their problems, benefits, and proposals for improvement. A survey was used to assess artisanal fishers’ perceptions of the outcomes of the two management regimes studied: satisfaction, perceived success, and compliance. Trust, environmental attitude, and participation in decision-making associated to both regimes were also assessed. The results of the interviews show that the majority of association Directorates mentioned illegal harvesting by unregistered fishers as the most important problem of the regional management plan regime and suggest that the state needs to invest in law enforcement as a key issue for improvement. The survey results showed that, in general, the territorial user rights regime is perceived to have higher levels of compliance, success, and generates more satisfaction. Lessons from the different management regimes can provide important insights for improving the implementation of management plans to generate synergies between co-existing management regimes.","Declaration of Competing Interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

Yukawa cosmology is obtained from a Yukawa-like gravitational potential, with coupling parameter α and wavelength parameter λ , which gives rise to modified Friedmann equations. We show that the agreement with observations is very efficient, and within 1 σ confidence level we find the best-fit parameters λ = 269 3 − 1262 + 1191 Mpc , α = 0 . 41 6 − 0 . 326 + 1 . 137 , and a graviton mass of m g = 2 . 37 4 − 0 . 728 + 2 . 095 × 1 0 − 42 GeV .

213,pub.1153937835,10.1111/rsp3.12620,,,Urbanization and productivity at a global level: new empirical evidence for the services sector,"Studies in developed countries show a positive relationship between urbanization and productivity; however, this is often not the case for developing countries. This is due to the absence of conditions permitting the expression of agglomeration economies, such as the lack of complementarity between city size and individuals' education, and high levels of informality. Given the increasing importance of services in terms of employment and production, this article analyzes the relationship between the rapid urbanization and tertiarization of developing countries and the productivity of the services sector. Fixed effects and dynamic panel models are estimated using data for a sample of 91 countries between 1990 and 2018. The results indicate that urbanization increases the productivity of services in developed countries but has the opposite effect in developing countries. This evidence supports the recent literature on urbanization without growth in developing countries for the case of the services sector.","ACKNOWLEDGMENTS This research is financially supported by the Chilean National Agency of Research and Development (Grant Fondecyt 11190112) and by the Millennium Scientific Initiative of the Ministry of Economy, Development and Tourism of Chile (Grant NCS2022_013).

In particular, enhanced cosmological perturbations collapsing to form PBHs are responsible for the generation of a stochastic gravitational-wave background (SGWB) induced by second-order gravitational interactions, usually called scalar induced gravitational waves (SIGWs). This SGWB is sensitive to the underlying gravitational theory; hence it can be used as a novel tool to test the standard paradigm of gravity and constrain possible deviations from general relativity. In this work, we study the aforementioned GW signal within modified teleparallel gravity theories, developing a formalism for the derivation of the GW spectral abundance within any form of gravitational action. At the end, working within viable f(T,ϕ) models without matter-gravity couplings, and accounting for the effect of monoparametric f(T) gravity at the level of the source and the propagation of the tensor perturbations, we show that the respective GW signal is indistinguishable from that within GR. Interestingly, we find that in order to break the degeneracy between different f(T) theories through the portal of SIGWs one should necessarily consider nonminimal matter-gravity couplings at the level of the gravitational action.",C.

This optimism has now become a concern. This is due to the fact that a combination of unfavourable circumstances and crises have so severely undermined the pursuit of the SDGs, that there are serious concerns about the probability of their achievement by 2030. This paper reports on an expert-driven literature review of the implementation of the SDGs and a bibliometric analysis, aimed at identifying some of the issues which have been slowing SDGs’ progress. Based on the information gathered, it suggests some specific measures which may be deployed, in order to accelerate their implementation by 2030.",Declaration of competing interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

In the current work we propose a new mechanism of PBH production within non-canonical inflation, using a class of steep-deformed inflationary potentials compatible with natural values for the non-canonical exponents. In particular, requiring significant PBH production we extract constraints on the non-canonical exponents. Additionally, we find that our scenario can lead to the formation of asteroid-mass PBHs, which can account for the totality of the dark matter, as well as to production of solar-mass PBHs within the LIGO-VIRGO detection band. Finally, we find that the enhanced cosmological perturbations which collapse to form PBHs can produce a stochastic gravitational-wave (GW) background induced by second-order gravitational interactions.

203,pub.1156144424,10.1016/j.aquaculture.2023.739468,,,First insights about orexigenic activity and gastrointestinal tissue localization of ghrelin from Corvina drum (Cilus gilberti),"The croaker Cilus gilberti commonly known as Corvina drum is considered a target marine species for the diversification of Chilean aquaculture. To optimize culture conditions, molecular markers for appetite regulation must be examined. Ghrelin, a gastrointestinal peptide, plays a stimulatory role in the food intake of mammals and teleost fish. Nevertheless, even though the appetite-controlling system is considered relatively well conserved among vertebrates, the bioactivity of these molecules should be analyzed in each fish species. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the expression and orexigenic ability of C. gilberti ghrelin. After the pre and postprandial period, the stomach expression of ghrelin mRNA in juvenile C. gilberti was analyzed. The coding sequence of C. gilberti ghrelin was used to identify the mature peptide and then chemically synthesized. The orexigenic ability of acylated ghrelin (cgGhre) and non-acylated (D-cgGhre) ghrelin was tested in C. gilberti juveniles. Moreover, the blood and the gastrointestinal location of synthetic ghrelin after intraperitoneal injection were measured. The results showed that the stomach has the highest expression of ghrelin mRNA, and that ghrelin levels increased in the preprandial period and diminished after it. There were no differences in the secondary structure of D-cgGhre compared to cgGhre but the peptide with the serine acylation stabilized its unordered conformation. However, the highest cumulative feed intake occurred in fish intraperitoneally injected with cgGhre. In addition, synthetic ghrelin was maintained in the C. gilberti blood until 8 h post-injection (hpi). Finally, biotinylated ghrelin allowed localizing the synthetic peptide in digestive tissue, mainly in the stomach and pyloric caeca. The mRNA expression of the growth hormone secretagogue receptor (GHS-R), also known as the ghrelin receptor, in gastrointestinal organs supports the idea of peripheral orexigenic regulation in these tissues. In conclusion, results suggest that C. gilberti ghrelin conserves the orexigenic ability reported in other teleost fish with a regulatory role in the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) of the Corvina drum. This is the first report demonstrating the uptake and distribution of a small orexigenic peptide in the digestive tissues of a South American sciaenid. Although ghrelin is a promising molecular marker for feed intake analysis in C. gilberti culture, further research is needed to continue evaluating the effects of aquaculture practices on peripheral appetite signalizer.",Declaration of Competing Interest The author declares no conflicts of interest.

203,pub.1156896725,10.1111/geb.13678,,,Thermal tolerance of tropical and temperate alpine plants suggests that ‘mountain passes are not higher in the tropics’,"Abstract  Aim Tolerance of species to extreme temperatures largely determines their distribution and vulnerability to climate change. We examined thermal tolerance in tropical and temperate alpine plants, testing the hypotheses that: (a) temperate plants are resistant to more extreme temperatures and have an overall wider thermal tolerance breadth (TTB); (b) TTB in temperate plants is wider than TTB in tropical plants during the entire growing season; (c) resistance to frost and heat varies during the season in temperate plants but not in tropical plants; (d) TTB of a species predicts its latitudinal range.   Location Tropical (Ecuador, Bolivia) and temperate (USA, Austria) mountains.   Time period Four periods of the growing season (2014, 2016–2019).   Major taxa Ninety‐six vascular plant species.   Methods We employed the electrolyte leakage method to estimate the temperature resistance, that is, the temperature at which 50% tissue injury (Lt50) occurs in leaves. We used phylogenetic linear mixed‐effect models in a Bayesian framework to test for differences between the plant groups.   Results Temperate and tropical plants do not differ in their temperature resistance. The four hypotheses are rejected since: (a) temperate plants do not have significantly wider overall TTB compared to tropical plants, (b) TTB of temperate plants is wider than TTB of tropical plants only at the end of the temperate summer, (c) seasonal acclimation is observed in both plant groups, (d) the latitudinal range of the plants is not related to TTB.   Main conclusions The lack of TTB differences between temperate and tropical alpine plants is consistent with trends observed in ectothermic animals, which suggests a general latitudinal pattern in high‐elevation poikilotherm organisms. Limited acclimation capacity to cope with long freezing exposures restricts the occurrence of tropical alpine species to thermally aseasonal environments making them particularly vulnerable to climate change.","ACKNOWLEDGMENTS The research was funded by the Grant Agency of the Czech Republic (project no. 17‐12420S).

However, collecting images is often expensive and challenging. Many image augmentation algorithms have been proposed to alleviate this issue. Understanding existing algorithms is, therefore, essential for finding suitable and developing novel methods for a given task. In this study, we perform a comprehensive survey of image augmentation for deep learning using a novel informative taxonomy. To examine the basic objective of image augmentation, we introduce challenges in computer vision tasks and vicinity distribution. The algorithms are then classified among three categories: model-free, model-based, and optimizing policy-based. The model-free category employs the methods from image processing, whereas the model-based approach leverages image generation models to synthesize images. In contrast, the optimizing policy-based approach aims to find an optimal combination of operations. Based on this analysis, we believe that our survey enhances the understanding necessary for choosing suitable methods and designing novel algorithms.","This research was partly supported by the Basic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) funded by the Ministry of Education (No.2019R1A6A1A09031717), supported by the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) grant funded by the Ministry of Science and ICT (MSIT) (No. 2020R1A2C2013060), and supported by the Korea Institute of Planning and Evaluation for Technology in Food, Agriculture, and Forestry (IPET) and Korea Smart Farm RD Foundation (KosFarm) through the Smart Farm Innovation Technology Development Program, funded by the Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs (MAFRA), Ministry of Science and ICT (MSIT), and Rural Development Administration (RDA) (No. 421027-04).",,Pattern Recognition,,,,2023-05,2023,,2023-05,137,,109347,All OA; Hybrid,Article,"Xu, Mingle; Yoon, Sook; Fuentes, Alvaro; Park, Dong Sun","Xu, Mingle (Department of Electronics Engineering, Jeonbuk National University, Jeonbuk 54896, South Korea); Yoon, Sook (Department of Computer Engineering, Mokpo National University, Jeonnam 58554, South Korea); Fuentes, Alvaro (Core Research Institute of Intelligent Robots, Jeonbuk National University, Jeonbuk 54896, South Korea); Park, Dong Sun (Core Research Institute of Intelligent Robots, Jeonbuk National University, Jeonbuk 54896, South Korea)","Yoon, Sook (Mokpo National University); Park, Dong Sun (Jeonbuk National University)","Xu, Mingle (Jeonbuk National University); Yoon, Sook (Mokpo National University); Fuentes, Alvaro (Jeonbuk National University); Park, Dong Sun (Jeonbuk National University)",203,201,,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.patcog.2023.109347,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1154639563,46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4602 Artificial Intelligence,

In this paper, we investigate the production of DM through the WIMP and FIMP mechanisms during inflationary reheating. We show that the details of the reheating, such as the inflaton potential and the reheating temperature, have a strong impact on the genesis of DM. The strong entropy injection caused by the inflaton decay has to be compensated by a reduction of the portal coupling in the case of WIMPs, or by an increase in the case of FIMPs. We pinpoint the smooth transition between the WIMP and the FIMP regimes in the case of low reheating temperature. As an example, we perform a full numerical analysis of the singlet-scalar DM model; however, our results are generic and adaptable to other particle DM candidates. Interestingly, in the singlet-scalar DM model with low-reheating temperature, regions favored by the FIMP mechanism are already being tested by direct detection experiments such as LZ and XENONnT.",,,Journal of Cosmology and Astroparticle Physics,,,,2023-09-01,2023,2023-09-07,2023-09-01,2023,09,015,All OA; Green,Article,"Silva-Malpartida, Javier; Bernal, Nicolás; Jones-Pérez, Joel; Lineros, Roberto A.","Silva-Malpartida, Javier (Sección Física, Departamento de Ciencias, Pontificia Universidad Católica del Perú, Apartado 1761, Lima, Peru); Bernal, Nicolás (New York University Abu Dhabi, PO Box 129188, Saadiyat Island, Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates); Jones-Pérez, Joel (Sección Física, Departamento de Ciencias, Pontificia Universidad Católica del Perú, Apartado 1761, Lima, Peru); Lineros, Roberto A.

Firstly, we present the necessary field redefinitions of the scalar field and the tetrads. Then we provide all the terms at next-to-leading-order, containing the torsion tensor and its derivatives, and derivatives of the scalar field, accompanied by generic scalar-field-dependent couplings, where all operators are suppressed by a scale Λ. Removing all redundant terms using the field redefinitions we result to the EFT of TEGR, which includes significantly more terms comparing to the EFT of general relativity (GR). Finally, we present an application in a cosmological framework. Interestingly enough, although GR and TEGR are completely equivalent at the level of classical equations, we find that their corresponding EFTs possess minor but non-zero differences. Hence, we do verify that at higher energies the excitation and the features of the extra degrees of freedom are slightly different in the two theories, thus making them theoretically distinguishable. Nevertheless, we mention that these differences are suppressed by the heavy mass scale Λ and thus it is not guaranteed that they could be measured in future experiments and observations.",The authors would like to acknowledge the contribution of the COST Action CA21136 ‘Addressing observational tensions in cosmology with systematics and fundamental physics (CosmoVerse)’.

In this theory, the Gauss-Bonnet term contributes to the field equations. The mass of the scalar field depends on the potential function and the Gauss-Bonnet term. For the scalar field potential, we consider the exponential function and the coupling function between the scalar field and the Gauss-Bonnet scalar is considered to be the linear function. Moreover, the scalar field can have a phantom behavior. We consider a set of dimensionless variables and write the field equations into a system or algebraic-differential equations. For the latter, we investigate the equilibrium points and their stability properties. We use compactified variables to perform a global analysis of the asymptotic dynamics. This gravitational theory can explain the Universe’s recent and past acceleration phases. Therefore, it can be used as a toy model for studying inflation or as a dark energy candidate.","A. D.

The reactive inverse matrix assisted pulsed laser evaporation (RIMAPLE) technique shows promise for the deposition of complex functional nanocomposites in a facile way. In this work, hybrid supercapacitor electrodes constituted by reduced graphene oxide (rGO) and carbon nanotubes (CNTs) decorated with a myriad of cerium and manganese oxide nanoparticles were obtained by using GO sheets, CNTs, CeO2 nanoparticles and, for the first time, the (NH4)2[Mn2(C6H5O7)2(H2O)2] coordination compound as precursors in the RIMAPLE targets. Compositional and structural characterizations revealed that post-annealing treatments at mild conditions (150-250 °C) induce a further reduction of the rGO and CNTs, besides an oxidation of the Ce oxide phases (Ce3+ to Ce4+) and a reduction of the Mn oxides (Mn3+ to Mn2+). The substantial change of the carbon and metal oxide nanostructures causes an up to 8-fold increase of the capacitance of the electrodes (63 F/cm3 @ 10 mV/s). Finally, the generation of a high quantity of edge defects at 250 °C and long dwell time leads to the drop of the electrode's capacitance.","Declaration of competing interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

The new species was observed on only two of seven seamounts surveyed in the area (25.079°S, 82.006°W, and 25.408°S, 81.769°W, ∼220 m depth), being abundant on one of them. Specimens were observed under optical and scanning electron microscopes, and DNA was sequenced (COI, 16S, 18S, and 28S nucleotide alignment). Chloeia rozbaczyloi sp. nov. belongs to the venusta group of Chloeia and is distinguished mainly by: (i) the chromatic pattern of the dorsum (with a single middorsal dark band) and the caruncle (with 16–20 vertical folds and 12 to 14 black spots posteriorly decreasing in diameter), (ii) by the bi-annulated dorsum of the first ten chaetigers, each with a bean-shaped anterior pseudosegment, (iii) long neuropodial cirri, with a short ceratophore, at chaetiger 2 and reaching chaetiger 6, and (iv) bipinnate branchiae from chaetiger 4, with seven to nine lateral branches arising from the primary axis, each possing five pinnules; branchiae change progressively in size to the posterior end. The ciliated margin of the accessory dorsal cirri suggests a respiratory function that might be relevant considering that both seamounts in which the species was observed could be influenced by low-oxygen waters. DNA results further support that C. rozbaczyloi sp. nov. differs from the other five congeneric taxa (C. bimaculata, C. flava, C. parva, C. pocicola, and C. viridis) for which genetic information is available. This finding constitutes the first report of the genus for Chilean waters, increasing the number of species of Amphinomidae in this area to seven. It also confirms the presence of the family in the NR and increases the number of Chloeia species in the world to 43. The seamounts where the new species have been collected are within the newly created offshore Nazca-Desventuradas Marine Park. Information on potentially unique and endemic species, such as the one discussed here, is of utmost importance to preserve special ecological units, address ecosystem services, and implement management measures in the area.","Declaration of competing interest The authors declare the following financial interests/personal relationships which may be considered as potential competing interests: Javier Sellanes, Ivan Canete reports financial support was provided by Comité Oceanográfico Nacional.

194,pub.1164799270,10.1007/s10811-023-03103-y,,,The Kelp Forest Challenge: A collaborative global movement to protect and restore 4 million hectares of kelp forests,"Marine kelp forests cover 1/3 of our world's coastlines, are heralded as a nature-based solution to address socio-environmental issues, connect hundreds of millions of people with the ocean, and support a rich web of biodiversity throughout our oceans. But they are increasingly threatened with some areas reporting over 90% declines in kelp forest cover in living memory. Despite their importance and the threats they face, kelp forests are entirely absent from the international conservation dialogue. No international laws, policies, or targets focus on kelp forests and very few countries consider them in their national policy. The Kelp Forest Challenge addresses that gap. Together with 252 kelp experts, professionals, and citizens from 25 countries, the Kelp Forest Challenge was developed as a grassroots vision of what the world can achieve for kelp forest conservation. It is a global call to restore 1 million and protect 3 million hectares of kelp forests by 2040. This is a monumental challenge, that will require coordination across multiple levels of society and the mobilization of immense resources. Pledges may therefore include area for protection or restoration, enabling pledges which assist in conservation (funding, equipment, professional expertise, capacity building), or awareness-based pledges which increase awareness or education about kelp forests. Correspondingly, participants may be from government, scientific institutions, private sector, NGOs, community groups, or individuals. This challenge is the beginning of a 17-year mission to save our kelp forests and anyone and any organisation is invited to participate.","The Kelp Forest Alliance would like to recognize support for developing the Kelp Forest Challenge from The Nature Conservancy, The Banner Foundation, The University of New South Wales, The Center for Marine Science and Innovation, the Institute of Marine Research in Norway, and the Van Dyson Foundation.

Here, we complement ongoing studies focusing on emerging inequality during the Middle Period (AD 400–1000) in the San Pedro de Atacama oases (Chile) by investigating entheseal patterns among individuals ( n = 210) interred in four cemeteries. This period represents a time of demographic expansion and the development of interregional networks and formalized social inequalities, all of which would have shaped the lived experiences of local inhabitants. The four cemeteries studied here allow investigations of potential differences between individuals living in a close geographic area: Solcor 3 and Casa Parroquial represent “elite” sites connected with the Tiwanaku state, the somewhat later site of Coyo 3 is associated with mining activities, and Quitor 6 Tardío represents individuals from relatively lower status. Using two complementary multifactorial tests, factorial ANOVA and ANCOVA, we identified differences in entheseal scores in several joints as a proxy for activity patterns among the cemeteries (left and right shoulders and wrists, and left elbow and hip; p < 0.05), with individuals from Casa Parroquial demonstrating lower entheseal scores in most joints. Results highlight how we can infer differences in entheseal patterns among individuals interred in cemeteries that were in close geographic proximity and in use over similar periods, highlighting possible differences in lived experiences in the sites categorized as “elite” as well as the effects of cemetery location, either within the core oases or outside them. Our analyses further suggest that ANCOVA and factorial ANOVA can identify more nuanced differences among the cemeteries while accounting for covariates in a single test, making them more robust inferential statistical approaches for this type of study.","ACKNOWLEDGMENTS This work was possible with the support of the staff of the Instituto de Arqueología y Antropología and the Museo Arqueologico Le Paige of the Universidad Católica del Norte, particularly M.

The International Union for Nature Conservation classifies the blue shark and shortfin mako as ‘Near Threatened’ and ‘Vulnerable’, respectively, in the Nature Red List of Threatened Species v. 2019‐2.     This study examined the population genetics of the shortfin mako and blue sharks at a regional (south‐eastern Pacific Ocean) and global scale. The null hypothesis of no genetic discontinuities among ocean basins and/or between hemispheres was tested using two mitochondrial markers suitable for population genetics inference in these species: the non‐coding control region and the protein‐coding gene cytochrome c oxidase I in  I. oxyrinchus  , and the control region and cytochrome b in  P. glauca  .    Spatial genetic analyses suggested a single and two genetic clusters co‐occurring along the south‐eastern Pacific Ocean in the shortfin mako and blue shark, respectively. Phylogeographic analyses, migration estimates, haplotype networks and AMOVAs demonstrated that the two species exhibit an overall pattern of high genetic connectivity among hemispheres and across ocean basins with a signature of shallow genetic structuring worldwide.   This study has generated valuable information for the management and conservation of heavily exploited sharks and highlights the need for additional inclusive research programmes assessing inter‐regional genomic discontinuities using more statistically powerful genetic markers to determine with precision population genetic discontinuities (if any) in these and other highly migratory sharks.","ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS M.T.G. thanks project ANT 1856 from University of Antofagasta, Chile for funding a short visit to the laboratory of Dr J.

194,pub.1157658074,10.1093/mnras/stad1240,,,WASP-131 b with ESPRESSO – I. A bloated sub-Saturn on a polar orbit around a differentially rotating solar-type star,"ABSTRACT
                  In this paper, we present observations of two high-resolution transit data sets obtained with ESPRESSO of the bloated sub-Saturn planet WASP-131 b. We have simultaneous photometric observations with NGTS and EulerCam. In addition, we utilized photometric light curves from TESS, WASP, EulerCam, and TRAPPIST of multiple transits to fit for the planetary parameters and update the ephemeris. We spatially resolve the stellar surface of WASP-131 utilizing the Reloaded Rossiter McLaughlin technique to search for centre-to-limb convective variations, stellar differential rotation, and to determine the star–planet obliquity for the first time. We find WASP-131 is misaligned on a nearly retrograde orbit with a projected obliquity of $\lambda = 162.4\substack{+1.3 \\ -1.2}^{\circ }$ . In addition, we determined a stellar differential rotation shear of α = 0.61 ± 0.06 and disentangled the stellar inclination ($i_* = 40.9\substack{+13.3 \\ -8.5}^{\circ }$ ) from the projected rotational velocity, resulting in an equatorial velocity of $v_{\rm {eq}} = 7.7\substack{+1.5 \\ -1.3}$ km s−1. In turn, we determined the true 3D obliquity of $\psi = 123.7\substack{+12.8 \\ -8.0}^{\circ }$ , meaning the planet is on a perpendicular/polar orbit. Therefore, we explored possible mechanisms for the planetary system’s formation and evolution. Finally, we searched for centre-to-limb convective variations where there was a null detection, indicating that centre-to-limb convective variations are not prominent in this star or are hidden within red noise.","This work is based on observations made with ESO Telescopes at the La Silla Paranal Observatory under the programme ID 106.21EM.

193,pub.1160158550,10.1111/geb.13721,,,Compositional shifts of alpine plant communities across the high Andes,"Abstract  Aim Climate change is transforming mountain summit plant communities worldwide, but we know little about such changes in the High Andes. Understanding large‐scale patterns of vegetation changes across the Andes, and the factors driving these changes, is fundamental to predicting the effects of global warming. We assessed trends in vegetation cover, species richness (SR) and community‐level thermal niches (CTN) and tested whether they are explained by summits' climatic conditions and soil temperature trends.   Location High Andes.   Time period Between 2011/2012 and 2017/2019.   Major taxa studied Vascular plants.   Methods Using permanent vegetation plots placed on 45 mountain summits and soil temperature loggers situated along a ~6800 km N‐S gradient, we measured species and their relative percentage cover and estimated CTN in two surveys (intervals between 5 and 8 years). We then estimated the annual rate of changes for the three variables and used generalized linear models to assess their relationship with annual precipitation, the minimum air temperatures of each summit and rates of change in the locally recorded soil temperatures.   Results  Over time, there was an average loss of vegetation cover (mean = −0.26%/yr), and a gain in SR across summits (mean = 0.38 species m 2 /yr), but most summits had significant increases in SR and vegetation cover. Changes in SR were positively related to minimum air temperature and soil temperature rate of change. Most plant communities experienced shifts in their composition by including greater abundances of species with broader thermal niches and higher optima. However, the measured changes in soil temperature did not explain the observed changes in CTN.    Main conclusions High Andean vegetation is changing in cover and SR and is shifting towards species with wider thermal niche breadths. The weak relationship with soil temperature trends could have resulted from the short study period that only marginally captures changes in vegetation through time.","ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS This study was carried out under scientific research authorization from the Ministry of Environment of Ecuador N029‐2019 IC‐FLO‐DNB/MA.

                    /Fe] (i.e., O, Mg, Si, Ca, and Ti) of the stars in Scl, Sagittarius, and the MW, we confirm the general trend that less massive galaxies tend to show lower [
                    α
                    /Fe]. The low [Al/Fe] (∼ − 0.5) in Scl demonstrates the value of this ratio as a discriminator with which to identify stars born in dwarf galaxies (from MW field stars). A chemical-evolution model suggests that Scl has a top-light initial mass function (IMF), with a high-mass IMF power index of ∼ − 2.7, and a minimum Type Ia supernovae delay time of ∼100 Myr. Furthermore, a linear regression analysis indicates a negative radial metallicity gradient and positive radial gradients for [Mg/Fe] and [Ca/Fe], in qualitative agreement with the outside-in formation scenario.","We thank Thomas Masseron, Gary Da Costa, Yang Huang for helpful discussions.

However, understanding the effects of regional precipitation variability in relation to local ecological stressors remains to be fully resolved. Here, we present a pollen-based qualitative precipitation reconstruction derived from fossil rodent middens recovered from two sites near Laguna Roja (LRO; n = 25) and Isluga (ISL; n = 15) in the Atacama highlands (19°S) of northern Chile. At LRO, the fossil pollen record shows multi-centennial hydroclimatic anomalies during the last millennium, with wetter than present phases at 1155–1130, 865–670, and 215–80 cal yrs BP, and similar to present conditions between 1005 and 880 cal yrs BP. In contrast, the ISL record shows a wet phase during 1115–840 cal yrs BP, suggesting that meso-ecological processes were as important in vegetation turnover as regional hydroclimate anomalies. Wetter conditions derived from LRO partially overlap with the Medieval Climate Anomaly (865–670 cal yrs BP) and with the latest part of the Little Ice Age (215–80 cal yrs BP). Furthermore, no strong anthropogenic signal was identified possibly related to the remote location of the records. Palynological diversity analyses evidence increasing diversification of plant communities during wet events at both sites. In correlation to existing regional hydroclimatic records from the Western Andes, our precipitation reconstruction verifies that centennial-scale changes in the strength of the South American Summer Monsoon (SASM) and partial influence of El Niño-like (ENSO) conditions drove vegetation turnover in the Atacama Desert during the last millennium.",,"Funding The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: We thank the indigenous communities of Laguna Roja and Isluga for permission to work in their territories.

192,pub.1163879636,10.1111/grow.12692,,,Agglomeration factors and the geography of growing early‐stage businesses in Chile,"Abstract New models of agglomeration cast the urban productivity premium as the outcome of agglomeration economies, a spatial sorting of skilled entrepreneurs and greater selection effects leading to less, but more productive businesses. We provide descriptive evidence of the spatial distribution of growing early‐stage businesses in Chile that concurs with the theory. We show, first, that while business entry rates increase systematically with the size of a region, the rates of growing early‐stage businesses are not related to the levels of agglomeration. Second, we show that, on the contrary, average early‐stage business productivity, the levels of human capital and business exit rates all relate positively with agglomeration. Third, we estimate regression models that verify the expected relationships between agglomeration factors and regional growing early‐stage‐business activity. The results for Chile suggest that the disadvantages of agglomeration largely offset the benefits, and therefore there is no obvious location penalty to venturing in peripheral areas. Entrepreneurship policies in less‐developed countries should not target excessively to specific industries and regions, as they might curtail an entrepreneurial potential that is ubiquitous.","ACKNOWLEDGMENTS The authors are grateful to William Foster and to an anonymous reviewer for the insightful comments and suggestions.

191,pub.1167124865,10.1093/mnras/stad3871,,,The VISCACHA survey – IX. The SMC Southern Bridge in 8D,"ABSTRACT The structure of the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) outside of its main body is characterized by tidal branches resulting from its interactions mainly with the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). Characterizing the stellar populations in these tidal components helps to understand the dynamical history of this galaxy and of the Magellanic system in general. We provide full phase-space vector information for Southern Bridge clusters. We performed a photometric and spectroscopic analysis of twelve SMC clusters, doubling the number of SMC clusters with full phase-space vector information known to date. We reclassify the sample considering 3D distances and 3D velocities. We found that some of the clusters classified as Southern Bridge objects according to the projected 2D classification actually belong to the Main Body and Counter-Bridge in the background. The comparison of the kinematics of the genuine foreground Bridge clusters with those previously analysed in the same way reveals that Southern Bridge clusters are moving towards the LMC and share the kinematics of the Northern Bridge. Adding to our sample clusters from the literature with CaT metallicity determinations we compare the age–metallicity relation of the Southern Bridge with the one of the Northern Bridge. We reinforce the idea that both regions do not seem to have experienced the same chemical enrichment history and that there is a clear absence of clusters in the Northern Bridge older than 3 Gyr and more metal poor than −1.1, which would not seem to be due to a selection effect.","MCP and BD thank Sergio Vasquez for providing his script to measure EW of CaT lines.

191,pub.1160518247,10.1051/0004-6361/202244594,,,Dark dust,"The nature of dust in the diffuse interstellar medium can be best investigated by means of reddening curves where only a single interstellar cloud lies between the observer and the background source. Published reddening curves often suffer from various systematic uncertainties. We merged a sample of 820 reddening curves of stars for which both FORS2 polarization spectra and UVES highresolution spectra are available. The resulting 111 sightlines towards OB-type stars have 175 reddening curves. For these stars, we derived their spectral-type from the UVES high-resolution spectroscopy. To obtain high-quality reddening curves, we excluded stars with composite spectra in the IUE/FUSE data due to multiple stellar systems. Likewise, we omitted stars that have uncertain spectral-type designations or stars with photometric variability. We neglected stars that show inconsistent parallaxes when comparing data releases two and three from Gaia . Finally, we identified stars that show differences in the space- and ground-based-derived reddening curves between 0.28 µm and the U band or in R  V  . In total, we find 53 stars with one or more reddening curves passing the rejection criteria. This provides the highest-quality Milky Way reddening curve sample available today. Averaging the curves from our high-quality sample, we find R  V  = 3.1 ± 0.4, confirming previous estimates. A future paper in this series will use the current sample of precise reddening curves and combine them with polarization data to study the properties of dark dust.","J.K. acknowledges the financial support of the Polish National Science Centre, Poland (2017/25/B/ST9/01524) for the period 2018–2023.

The region was divided into 30 zones of 0.5 • latitude and 0.5 • longitude and the non-extensive statistical physics was used. Both, the Sotolongo-Costa-Posadas and Mathai models were proposed to analyze the magnitude-frequency distribution. The subdivision into cells of the catalog allowed to demonstrate that systems with value of q ∼ 1 present exponential behavior, while with the superposition of subsystems it was expected to obtain q > 1, supporting the su-perstatistical model. Thus, by subdividing the Coquimbo region into the South and North regions, we find that in both the entropic index is greater than one, q > 1, however , according to the value obtained, in the southern sector the long-range effects are greater than in the northern sector. This means that both sectors ae well described by the nonextensive statistical model, either by SCP model or Mathai model; the entropic index is q > 1 and in both cases R 2 > 0.99. As the Coquimbo region is considered as a all, the nonextensive statistical distribution is the more adequated. With respect to the probabilistic seismic hazard assessment, we showed that the Mathai’s model has the better fit. Thus, in the frequency-interevent time distribution was used for different limite magnitudes values. Our analysis shows that the probability occurrence of an seismic event in the northern sector of the region is lower than in the southern sector for the same period; in the former the behavior is of Poissonian type. Thus, the region’s northern and southern zones show different behaviors in terms of earthquake occurrence probability.",,,Research Square,,,,2023-05-18,2023,2023-05-18,,,,,All OA; Green,Preprint,"Ojeda, Valentina; Vega-Jorquera, Pedro; Barra, Erick; Palma-Chilla, Luis; Vidal, Luis; Saavedra, José; Pizarro, Alfredo","Ojeda, Valentina (Universidad de La Serena); Vega-Jorquera, Pedro (Universidad de La Serena); Barra, Erick (Universidad Católica del Norte); Palma-Chilla, Luis (Universidad de La Serena); Vidal, Luis (Jumpitt Labs); Saavedra, José (Colegio Albert Einstein, Chile); Pizarro, Alfredo (Universidad de La Serena)",,"Ojeda, Valentina (University of La Serena); Vega-Jorquera, Pedro (University of La Serena); Barra, Erick (Catholic University of the North); Palma-Chilla, Luis (University of La Serena); Vidal, Luis (Jumpitt Labs); Saavedra, José (Colegio Albert Einstein, Chile); Pizarro, Alfredo (University of La Serena)",0,0,,,https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-2917887/latest.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1158174488,37 Earth Sciences; 3706 Geophysics,
185,pub.1162804200,10.1093/mnras/stad2222,,,Exploring the short-term variability of H α and H β emissions in a sample of M dwarfs,"ABSTRACT The time-scales of variability in active M dwarfs can be related to their various physical parameters. Thus, it is important to understand such variability to decipher the physics of these objects. In this study, we have performed the low resolution (∼5.7 Å) spectroscopic monitoring of 83 M dwarfs (M0–M6.5) to study the variability of H α/H β emissions; over the time-scales from ∼0.7 to 2.3 h with a cadence of ∼3–10 min. Data of a sample of another 43 late-type M dwarfs (M3.5–M8.5) from the literature are also included to explore the entire spectral sequence. 53 of the objects in our sample (∼64 per cent) show statistically significant short-term variability in H α. We show that this variability in 38 of them are most likely to be related to the flaring events. We find that the early M dwarfs are less variable despite showing higher activity strengths (LH α/Lbol and LH β/Lbol), which saturates around ∼10−3.8 for M0–M4 types. Using archival photometric light curves from TESS and Kepler/K2 missions, the derived chromospheric emission (H α and H β emission) variability is then explored for any plausible systematics with respect to their rotation phase. The variability indicators clearly show higher variability in late-type M dwarfs (M5–M8.5) with shorter rotation periods (<2 d). For 44 sources, their age has been estimated using StarHorse project and possible correlations with variability have been explored. The possible causes and implications for these behaviours are discussed.","The research work at the Physical Research Laboratory (PRL) is funded by the Department of Space, Government of India.

It was thought that they had met a tragic end while crossing the Zambezi River into the Eastern Caprivi of South West Africa (now the Zambezi Region of Namibia). After 1994, renewed attempts to establish the men’s fate were hampered by a paucity of archival data, the unwillingness of witnesses to provide information and the passage of time. Recent research in the Eastern Caprivi brought new information to light when local communities were found to be familiar with a story about ‘foreign fighters’ who crossed the Zambezi River. The strangers were betrayed to the South African police and drawn into an ambush. Research in the National Archives of Namibia also yielded new information. By piecing together local narratives with archival material and interviews with former members of Umkhonto we Sizwe and the South African Police, this article chronicles the odyssey and fate of Boshielo and his companions, although some questions remain. Unfortunately, in South Africa, the search for those who disappeared during the struggle against white minority rule is by no means complete. This article demonstrates the value of extending research beyond South African borders when information and knowledge are scattered across countries, institutions, communities and individuals.","This article is dedicated to the memory of Professor Stephen Ellis who first alerted me to the disappearance of Flag Boshielo and his companions.

In this study, we present a novel unoccupied aircraft system (UAS) dataset collected at Lascar, northern Chile, one of the most active volcanoes in the Central Volcanic Zone of the Andes. Lascar features nested craters, the deepest crater of which has experienced repeated lava dome emplacement and numerous violent explosions in recent decades. We performed UAS surveys in 2017 and 2020 to collect the optical and thermal imaging data of the active crater. By applying the Structure-from-Motion (SfM) method, we obtained centimeter-scale optical and thermal orthomosaics as well as digital terrain models. We quantify the spatial and volumetric changes that occurred during the observation period. The results show material removal from the crater wall and a significant accumulation of volcanic material on the crater floor. The thermal orthomosaic helps identify thermal anomalies and the spatial distribution of fumaroles. The highest thermal anomaly was found on the crater floor and delimited by ring structures. Both the optical orthomosaics and DEMs from 2017 and 2020 showed a consistent ring structure, which remained stable following two explosive events. Possible localized subsidence was observed within the ring structure. Consequently, we hypothesize that the ring structure represents the surface expression of underlying concentric fracture systems and constrains a narrow conduit top. Our results provide important insights into an active crater’s morphological, structural, and thermal features, with implications for understanding the formation mechanism and evolution of volcanic craters.","Declaration of Competing Interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

                    The recent and exquisite astrometric, photometric, and radial velocity measurements of the
                    Gaia
                    mission resulted in a substantial advancement of the determination of the orbits for old star clusters, including the oldest Milky Way globular clusters (MW GCs).
                  
                  
                    Aims.
                    The main goal of the present paper is to use the new
                    Gaia
                    data release 3 (DR3) and the VISTA Variables in the Via Láctea Extended Survey (VVVX) measurements to obtain the orbits for nearly a dozen new MW GC candidates that have been poorly studied or previously unexplored.
                  
                  
                    Methods.
                    We use the
                    Gaia
                    DR3 and VVVX databases to identify bona fide MW GC candidates, namely VVV-CL160, Patchick 122, Patchick 125, Patchick 126, Kronberger 99, Kronberger 119, Kronberger 143, ESO 92-18, ESO 93-08,
                    Gaia
                    2, and Ferrero 54. The relevant mean cluster physical parameters are derived (distances, Galactic coordinates, proper motions, radial velocities). We also measure accurate mean radial velocities for the GCs VVV-CL160 and Patchick 126 using observations acquired at the Gemini-South telescope with the Immersion GRating INfrared Spectrometer (IGRINS) high-resolution spectrograph. Orbits for each cluster are then computed using the
                    GravPot16
                    model, assuming typical Galactic bar pattern speeds.
                  
                  
                    Results.
                    We reconstruct the orbits for these 11 star clusters for the first time. These include star clusters with retrograde and prograde orbital motions, both in the Galactic bulge and disk. We obtain orbital properties for this sample, such as the mean time-variations of perigalactic and apogalactic distances, eccentricities, vertical excursions from the Galactic plane, and
                    Z
                    -components of the angular momentum.
                  
                  
                    Conclusions.
                    Our main conclusion is that, based on the orbital parameters, Patchick 125 and Patchick 126 are genuine MW bulge or halo GCs; and Ferrero 54,
                    Gaia
                    2, and Patchick 122 are MW disk GCs. In contrast, the orbits of Kronberger 99, Kronberger 119, Kronberger 143, ESO 92-18, and ESO 93-08 are more consistent with old MW disk open clusters, in agreement with previous results. VVV-CL160 falls very close to the Galactic centre, but reaches larger distances beyond the Solar orbit, and therefore its origin is still unclear.","We gratefully acknowledge the use of data from the ESO Public Survey program IDs 179.B-2002 and 198.B-2004 taken with the VISTA telescope and data products from the Cambridge Astronomical Survey Unit.

In order to evaluate the degree of this affliction, we build categories of deprivation with increasing intensity, using the 2014–2018 EU-SILC cross-sectional data for households in Spanish regions. We explore household characteristics and regional heterogeneity associated with the relative risk ratios of falling into such categories. Moreover, the paper assesses whether two axes of the European Structural and Investment Funds (specifically, those allocated to the objective of social inclusion and sustainable and quality employment) matter at weakening such risks. Only social inclusion funds are strongly associated with a lower relative risk of material deprivation. This might be due to a regional misalignment and/or to an inefficient use of the funds.","Acknowledgement We would like to thank the editor and three anonymous reviewers for their insightful suggestions, which helped us to improve the manuscript.

This method is considered an inexpensive and environmentally friendly synthetic method to produce materials with controllable size and morphology. A combination of X-Ray powder diffraction, X-Ray photoelectron spectrometry and Scanning Electron Microscopy revealed that the composite is made of micrometric platelets of La(OH)2Cl covered by c.a. 10 nm TiO2 anatase nanoparticles. The activity in photocatalytic reactions was examined through cetirizine degradation under UV-A irradiation. Results of the screening studies confirmed the excellent photocatalytic activity of the as-synthesized composite compared to pure anatase and pure La(OH)2Cl, highlighting the positive role of the synergy between the two solids. The composite was further explored in detail in terms of catalyst load, pollutant concentration, water matrix and mechanism of the reaction. The target molecule was completely removed from the aqueous suspension at 2.5 mg/L of pollutant and 0.2 g/L of catalyst load. Also, reaction mechanism evaluation showed the active role of hydroxyl radicals in the degradation of cetirizine by the TiO2@La(OH)2Cl composite. Additionally, phytotoxicity investigations were performed to study the germination of cress seeds for treated and raw solutions. Data revealed that the degradation reaction products for cetirizine were scarcely toxic compared to the untreated sample confirming the usefulness of the photocatalytic treatment with the TiO2@La(OH)2Cl composite. Lastly, all these data demonstrate the excellent catalytic efficiency of the new synthesized material, opening new ways for its use for future applications for water purification.","Declaration of Competing Interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

The catalogue is the result of a critical search of the APOGEE Data Release 17 (DR17) catalogue for candidate members of all known Galactic GCs. Candidate members are assigned to various GCs on the basis of position in the sky, proper motion, and radial velocity. The catalogue contains a total of 7737 entries for 6422 unique stars associated with 72 Galactic GCs. Full APOGEE DR17 information is provided, including radial velocities and abundances for up to 20 elements. Membership probabilities estimated on the basis of precision radial velocities are made available. Comparisons with chemical compositions derived from the GALactic Archaeology with HERMES (GALAH) survey, as well as optical values from the literature, show good agreement. This catalogue represents a significant increase in the public data base of GC star chemical compositions and kinematics, providing a massive homogeneous data set that will enable a variety of studies. The catalogue in fits format is available for public download from the SDSS-IV DR17 value-added catalogue website.","RPS dedicates this paper to the memory of Professor José Augusto Buarque de Nazareth.

By means of the Schwinger representation of the propagator in the average magnetic field as a reference system, we used the replica formalism to study the effects of the magnetic noise in the form of renormalized quasiparticle parameters, leading to an effective charge and an effective refraction index that depend not only on the energy scale, as usual, but also on the magnitude of the noise ΔB and the average field B.","J.

182,pub.1152195234,10.1051/0004-6361/202244959,,,Ca triplet metallicities and velocities for 12 globular clusters toward the galactic bulge⋆,"Context.
                    Globular clusters (GCs) are excellent tracers of the formation and early evolution of the Milky Way. The bulge GCs (BGCs) are particularly important because they can reveal vital information about the oldest in situ component of the Milky Way.
                  
                  
                    Aims.
                    Our aim is to derive the mean metallicities and radial velocities for 13 GCs that lie toward the bulge and are generally associated with this component. This region is observationally challenging because of high extinction and stellar density, which hampers optical studies of these and similar BGCs, making most previous determinations of these parameters quite uncertain.
                  
                  
                    Methods.
                    We used near-infrared low-resolution spectroscopy with the FORS2 instrument on the VLT to measure the wavelengths and equivalent widths of the CaII triplet (CaT) lines for a number of stars per cluster. We derived radial velocities, ascertained membership, and applied known calibrations to determine metallicities for cluster members, for a mean of 11 members per cluster. Unfortunately, one of our targets, VVV-GC002, which is the closest GC to the Galactic center, turned out not to have any members in our sample.
                  
                  
                    Results.
                    We derive mean cluster RV values to 3 km s
                    −1
                    , and mean metallicities to 0.05 dex. We find general good agreement with previous determinations for both metallicity and velocity. On average, our metallicities are 0.07 dex more metal-rich than those of Harris (2010, arXiv:1012.3224), with a standard deviation of the difference of 0.25 dex. Our sample has metallicities between −0.21 and −1.64, and the values are distributed between the traditional metal-rich BGC peak near [Fe/H] −0.5 and a more metal-poor peak around [Fe/H] −1.1, which has recently been identified. These latter are candidates for the oldest GCs in the Galaxy, if blue horizontal branches are present, and include BH 261, NGC 6401, NGC 6540, NGC 6642, and Terzan 9. Finally, Terzan 10 is even more metal-poor. However, dynamically, Terzan 10 is likely an intruder from the halo, possibly associated with the Gaia-Enceladus or Kraken accretion events. Terzan 10 is also confirmed as an Oosterhoff type II GC based on our results.
                  
                  
                    Conclusions.
                    The CaT technique is an excellent method for deriving mean metallicities and velocities for heavily obscured GCs. Our sample provides reliable mean values for these two key properties via spectroscopy of a significant number of members per cluster for this important yet previously poorly studied sample of BGCs. We emphasize that the more metal-poor GCs are excellent candidates for being ancient relics of bulge formation. The lone halo intruder in our sample, Terzan 10, is conspicuous for also having by far the lowest metallicity, and casts doubt on the possibility of any bona fide BGCs at metallicities below about −1.5.","D.G. gratefully acknowledges support from the ANID BASAL project ACE210002.

177,pub.1166868860,10.1111/jbi.14774,,,Global genetic diversity and historical demography of the Bull Shark,"Abstract  Aim  Biogeographic boundaries and genetic structuring have important effects on the inferences and interpretation of effective population size ( N  e  ) temporal variations, a key genetics parameter. We reconstructed the historical demography and divergence history of a vulnerable coastal high‐trophic shark using population genomics and assessed our ability to detect recent bottleneck events.    Location Western and Central Indo‐Pacific (IPA), Western Tropical Atlantic (WTA) and Eastern Tropical Pacific (EPA).   Taxon  Carcharhinus leucas (Müller & Henle, 1839).    Methods  A DArTcap™ approach was used to sequence 475 samples and assess global genetic structuring. Three demographic models were tested on each population, using an ABC‐RF framework coupled with coalescent simulations, to investigate within‐cluster structure. Divergence times between clusters were computed, testing multiple scenarios, with fastsimcoal . N  e  temporal variations were reconstructed with STAIRWAYPLOT. Coalescent simulations were performed to determine the detectability of recent bottleneck under the estimated historical trend for datasets of this size.    Results  Three genetic clusters corresponding to the IPA, WTA and EPA regions were identified, agreeing with previous studies. The IPA presented the highest genetic diversity and was consistently identified as the oldest. No significant within‐cluster structuring was detected. N  e  increased globally, with an earlier onset in the IPA, during the last glacial period. Coalescent simulations showed that weak and recent bottlenecks could not be detected with our dataset, while old and/or strong bottlenecks would erase the observed ancestral expansion.    Main Conclusions  This study further confirms the role of marine biogeographic breaks in shaping the genetic history of large mobile marine predators. N  e  historical increases in N  e  are potentially linked to extended coastal habitat availability. The limited within‐cluster population structuring suggests that N  e  can be monitored over ocean basins. Due to insufficient amount of available genetic data, it cannot be concluded whether overfishing is impacting Bull Shark genetic diversity, calling for whole‐genome sequencing.","ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS Sampling permits and ethics approval are listed in Data S6.

176,pub.1160165127,10.1007/s10460-023-10482-y,,,Easier said than defined? Conceptualising justice in food system transitions,"The transition towards sustainable and just food systems is ongoing, illustrated by an increasing number of initiatives that try to address unsustainable practices and social injustices. Insights are needed into what a just transition entails in order to critically engage with plural and potentially conflicting justice conceptualisations. Researchers play an active role in food system transitions, but it is unclear which conceptualisations and principles of justice they enact when writing about food system initiatives. To fill this gap this paper investigates: Which conceptualisations of justice emerge from the literature related to food system initiatives and which principles of justice do authors use? We developed an initial framework for which we drew on political philosophy literature. We then undertook an extensive review of the food system transitions literature using this framework and were able to identify a range of recognition, distributive, and procedural justice conceptualisations and associated principles of justice. Recognised as subjects of justice were those with a particular role in the food system, people who are marginalised, Indigenous communities, those with experiences of negative consequences of the food system, future generations, and nonhumans. The identified conceptualisations and the developed framework can be used by those involved in food system initiatives to reflect on how they conceptualise justice. We challenge them to be more explicit about who they do and do not recognise as subjects of justice and which principles of justice they use. Such clarity is needed to reflexively enact a just transition towards sustainable and just food systems.",The authors wish to acknowledge the funders of the ‘Circular Agriculture in North-Netherlands: Daring scenarios and Interlinked Transformation’ (CAN-DO-IT) project of which this paper is a part.,"This article is part of the project ‘Circular Agriculture in North-Netherlands: Daring scenarios and Interlinked Transformation‘ (CAN-DO-IT).

176,pub.1160131738,10.1177/10597123231183996,,,Entangled cognition in immersive learning experience,"Immersive learning environments in education provide a set of rich and diverse learning affordances (possibilities). Cognition in such environments can be considered as embodied, enacted, embedded, and extended (the 4Es of cognition). During such cognitive happenings, we assume and live as valid everything we experience. Yet in this enactive structural coupling between individuals and their experiential world, another phenomenon occurs. We become a behaviorally inseparable entity with the virtual/immersive world. We become entangled with that virtual/immersive world. Here we propose that, within the framework of the 4Es of cognition, a recognizable lived experience phenomena occurs when learners engage with virtual or immersive learning environments. That is, cognition becomes entangled in immersive environments with alternative realities. Coming from the Santiago school of cognition, and building from ideas from immersive learning, 4E cognition, and quantum entanglement inspired in quantum cognition, we attempt to describe the process of entangled cognition happening in immersive learning environments. We recognize at least two levels of entanglement from the same recursive phenomenology: one we call a local entanglement, related to perception and sense-making; and a second we call a global entanglement, connected to the process and phenomena of human consciousness and meaning-making, accessible when conceived as a whole. We see the benefits for such a theoretical framework to ultimately guide, justify, and encourage the emergence of an epistemology shift in educational technology towards design principles that account for entangled cognition in immersive learning (and beyond), and the associated possibilities offered by new immersive technologies in education.",,"FundingThe author(s) received no financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.",Adaptive Behavior,,,,2023-06-26,2023,2023-06-26,2023-10,31,5,497-515,All OA; Hybrid,Article,"Aguayo, Claudio; Videla-Reyes, Ronnie; Veloz, Tomas","Aguayo, Claudio (AppLab, Te Ara Poutama, Faculty of Māori and Indigenous Development, Auckland University of Technology, New Zealand; Buckminster College, Brussels, Belgium; Foundation for the Interdisciplinary Development of Science, Technology and Arts, Chile; Innovasteam Lab, La Serena, Chile); Videla-Reyes, Ronnie (Escuela de Educación Diferencial, Facultad de Educación, Universidad Santo Tomás, Chile; Buckminster College, Brussels, Belgium; Foundation for the Interdisciplinary Development of Science, Technology and Arts, Chile; Innovasteam Lab, La Serena, Chile; Escuela de Educación, Universidad Católica del Norte, Chile); Veloz, Tomas (Departamento de Matemáticas, Universidad Tecnológica Metropolitana, Chile; Centre Leo Apostel for Interdisciplinary Studies, Vrije Universiteit Brussel, Belgium; Buckminster College, Brussels, Belgium; Foundation for the Interdisciplinary Development of Science, Technology and Arts, Chile; Innovasteam Lab, La Serena, Chile)","Aguayo, Claudio (Auckland University of Technology; Buckminster College, Brussels, Belgium; Foundation for the Interdisciplinary Development of Science, Technology and Arts, Chile; Innovasteam Lab, La Serena, Chile)","Aguayo, Claudio (Auckland University of Technology; Buckminster College, Brussels, Belgium; Foundation for the Interdisciplinary Development of Science, Technology and Arts, Chile; Innovasteam Lab, La Serena, Chile); Videla-Reyes, Ronnie (Universidad Santo Tomás; Buckminster College, Brussels, Belgium; Foundation for the Interdisciplinary Development of Science, Technology and Arts, Chile; Innovasteam Lab, La Serena, Chile; Catholic University of the North); Veloz, Tomas (Metropolitan University of Technology; Vrije Universiteit Brussel; Buckminster College, Brussels, Belgium; Foundation for the Interdisciplinary Development of Science, Technology and Arts, Chile; Innovasteam Lab, La Serena, Chile)",2,2,,,https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/10597123231183996,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1160131738,46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4602 Artificial Intelligence; 4608 Human-Centred Computing; 4611 Machine Learning,4 Quality Education

Additionally, we obtained orbital parameters for each star using the nonaxisymmetric gravitational potential GravPot16 . Seven structures are detected, including Splash, Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus (GSE), the high- α heated-disk population, N-C-O peculiar stars, and inner disk-like stars, plus two other groups that did not match anything previously reported in the literature, here named Galileo 5 and Galileo 6 (G5 and G6). These two groups overlap with Splash in [Fe/H], with G5 having a lower metallicity than G6, and they are both between GSE and Splash in the [Mg/Mn] versus [Al/Fe] plane, with G5 being in the α -rich in situ locus and G6 on the border of the α -poor in situ one. Nonetheless, their low [Ni/Fe] hints at a possible ex situ origin. Their orbital energy distributions are between Splash and GSE, with G5 being slightly more energetic than G6. We verified the robustness of all the obtained groups by exploring a large range of t-SNE parameters, applying it to various subsets of data, and also measuring the effect of abundance errors through Monte Carlo tests.","This work has received funding from the grant support provided by Agencia Nacional de Investigación y Desarrollo de Chile (ANID) under the Proyecto Fondecyt Iniciación 2022 Agreement No. 11220340 (PI: José G.

The present research investigates how and whether the COVID‐19 pandemic might have favoured greater support for antidemocratic governmental practices, on the premise of regaining control and security. Using data from 17 countries ( N = 4364) and national‐level indicators (i.e., real number of contagions and deaths, and sociopolitical indicators), we test how the risk of contagion and death from COVID‐19, along with personal orientations (i.e., social dominance orientation [SDO], right‐wing authoritarianism [RWA], and perceived anomie) motivate authoritarian and antidemocratic practices. Results from multilevel models indicate that risk perception and perceptions of political instability predict a wish for stronger leadership, agreement with martial law, and support for a controlling government especially when SDO and RWA are high, while more egalitarian and less conservative people agree less with these authoritarian measures in spite of the levels of risk perception.

The area is characterized by extremes in climate (e.g., temperature, humidity, UV irradiation) and edaphic factors (e.g., hyper-salinity, high pH, compaction, high perchlorates, and low moisture, phosphorus and organic matter). However, the halophytic C4 plant Distichlis spicata appears to be one of the few species on the planet that can thrive in this environment. Within this habitat it captures windblown sand leading to the formation of unique structures and the generation of above-ground phyllosphere soil. Using a combination of approaches (e.g., X-ray Computed Tomography, TXRF, δ13C/δ15N isotope profiling, microbial PLFAs, 14C turnover, phosphate sorption isotherms) we examined the factors regulating the biogeochemical cycling of nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) and carbon (C) in both vegetated and unvegetated areas. Our results showed that D. spicata rhizomes with large aerenchyma were able to break through the highly cemented topsoil layer leading to root proliferation in the underlying soil. The presence of roots increased soil water content, P availability and induced a change in microbial community structure and promoted microbial growth and activity. In contrast, soil in the phyllosphere exhibited almost no biological activity. Organic C stocks and recent C4 plant derived input increased as follows: phyllosphere (1941 g C m−2; 85% recent) > soils under plants (575–748 g C m−2; 55–60%) > bare soils (491–642 g C m−2; 9–17%). Due to the high levels of nitrate in soil (>2 t ha−1) and high rates of P sorption/precipitation, our data suggest that the microbial activity is both C and P, but not N limited. Root-mediated salt uptake combined with foliar excretion and dispersal of NaCl into the surrounding area indicated that D. spicata was responsible for actively removing ca. 55% of the salt from the rhizosphere. We also demonstrate that NH3 emissions may represent a major N loss pathway from these soil ecosystems during the processing of organic N. We attribute this to NH3 volatilization to the high pH of the soil and slow rates of nitrification. In conclusion, we demonstrate that the extremophile D. spicata physically, chemically and biologically reengineers the soil to create a highly bioactive hotspot within the climate-extreme of the Atacama Desert.","Declaration of competing interest The authors declare the following financial interests/personal relationships which may be considered as potential competing interests:Davey Jones reports financial support was provided by Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council.

163,pub.1166887752,10.1051/0004-6361/202347046,,,Chemo-dynamical tagging in the outskirts: The origins of stellar substructures in the Magellanic Clouds,"We present the first detailed chemical analysis from APOGEE-2S observations of stars in six regions of recently discovered substructures in the outskirts of the Magellanic Clouds extending to 20° from the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) center. We also present, for the first time, the metallicity and α -abundance radial gradients of the LMC and the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) out to 11° and 6°, respectively. Our chemical tagging includes 13 species including light, α -, and Fe-peak elements. We find that the abundances of all of these chemical elements in stars populating two regions in the northern periphery, along the northern “stream-like” feature, show good agreement with the chemical patterns of the LMC, and thus likely have an LMC origin. For substructures located in the southern periphery of the LMC we find more complex chemical and kinematical signatures, indicative of a mix of LMC-like and SMC-like populations. The southern region closest to the LMC shows better agreement with the LMC, whereas that closest to the SMC shows a much better agreement with the SMC chemical pattern. When combining this information with 3D kinematical information for these stars, we conclude that the southern region closest to the LMC likely has an LMC origin, whereas that closest to the SMC has an SMC origin and the other two southern regions have a mix of LMC and SMC origins. Our results add to the evidence that the southern substructures of the LMC periphery are the product of close interactions between the LMC and SMC, and thus likely hold important clues that can constrain models of their detailed dynamical histories.","We thank the anonymous reviewer for their helpful comments, which improved the quality of this paper.

We use a Multidimensional Bayesian Network Classifier model to estimate the conditional probability of being multidimensionally poor and then we use these probabilities and the standard downside semi‐deviation as the risk parameter to identify the vulnerable households. Despite significant reductions over the study period, in 2017 approximately 150 million people—excluding Guatemala, Nicaragua and Venezuela for which we do not have recent data—remained vulnerable to multidimensional poverty. We also observe that vulnerability to poverty is reduced at a much slower rate than poverty itself, revealing that achievements in SDG1 can be quite fragile. We perform a decomposition and find that as poverty decreases, risk‐induced vulnerability becomes relatively more important than poverty‐induced vulnerability. However, the poor‐vulnerable still constitute the core vulnerability group.",,,Review of Income and Wealth,,,,2023-08-02,2023,2023-08-02,2024-09,70,3,661-696,All OA; Hybrid,Article,"Gallardo, Mauricio; Santos, María Emma; Villatoro, Pablo; Pizarro, Vicky","Gallardo, Mauricio (Universidad Católica del Norte, Escuela de Ciencias Empresariales); Santos, María Emma (Instituto de Investigaciones Económicas y Sociales del Sur (IIESS), Departamento de Economía, Universidad Nacional del Sur (UNS)‐CONICET); Villatoro, Pablo (Comisión Económica para América Latina y el Caribe, Unidad de Estadísticas Sociales); Pizarro, Vicky (Universidad Católica del Norte, Escuela de Ingeniería)","Santos, María Emma (Universidad Nacional del Sur)","Gallardo, Mauricio (Catholic University of the North); Santos, María Emma (Universidad Nacional del Sur); Villatoro, Pablo (Comisión Económica para América Latina y el Caribe, Unidad de Estadísticas Sociales); Pizarro, Vicky (Catholic University of the North)",0,0,,,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1111/roiw.12654,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1162988380,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3502 Banking, Finance and Investment; 38 Economics; 3801 Applied Economics",1 No Poverty
162,pub.1158055072,10.1093/mnras/stad1435,,,NGTS clusters survey – V. Rotation in the Orion star-forming complex,"ABSTRACT
                  We present a study of rotation across 30 square degrees of the Orion Star-forming Complex, following a ∼200 d photometric monitoring campaign by the Next Generation Transit Survey (NGTS). From 5749 light curves of Orion members, we report periodic signatures for 2268 objects and analyse rotation period distributions as a function of colour for 1789 stars with spectral types F0–M5. We select candidate members of Orion using Gaia data and assign our targets to kinematic sub-groups. We correct for interstellar extinction on a star-by-star basis and determine stellar and cluster ages using magnetic and non-magnetic stellar evolutionary models. Rotation periods generally lie in the range 1–10 d, with only 1.5 per cent of classical T Tauri stars or Class I/II young stellar objects rotating with periods shorter than 1.8 d, compared with 14 per cent of weak-line T Tauri stars or Class III objects. In period–colour space, the rotation period distribution moves towards shorter periods among low-mass (>M2) stars of age 3–6 Myr, compared with those at 1–3 Myr, with no periods longer than 10 d for stars later than M3.5. This could reflect a mass-dependence for the dispersal of circumstellar discs. Finally, we suggest that the turnover (from increasing to decreasing periods) in the period–colour distributions may occur at lower mass for the older-aged population: ∼K5 spectral type at 1–3 Myr shifting to ∼M1 at 3–6 Myr.","The NGTS facility is funded by a consortium of institutes consisting of the University of Warwick, the University of Leicester, Queen’s University Belfast, the University of Geneva, the Deutsches Zentrum für Luft- und Raumfahrt e.V.

The case of La Soufrière de Guadeloupe volcano,"Hydrothermal or low-temperature volcanic emissions, most commonly occurring in fumarolic environments, dominate the global volcanic landscape. This work presents physicochemical characterization of the aerosols contained in steam- and H2S-rich plumes discharged from La Soufrière volcano, in conjunction with the first report on their heavy metal degassing emission rates. Our results indicate that the plume is enriched in certain lithophile (K, Ti, Si, Al, Mn, and Mg) and siderophile (Fe) elements, related to hydrothermal rock leaching, and chalcophile (Sb, As, Zn, Pb, and Tl) elements, which are usually degassed from the magma source. Heavy metal emission rates were found to be below 15 g/d, which are modest compared to available worldwide data. Nevertheless, Cr and Sb emission rates were very similar to those of Lascar volcano (Chile), which instead has produced magmatic eruptions in recent times. We propose that the depth of the magma chamber and the input of meteoric waters play an important role in scavenging heavy metals in the hydrothermal system of magmatic-hydrothermal volcanoes. Notwithstanding low heavy metal emission rates, La Soufrière can be regarded as an important pollution source in the Lesser Antilles volcanic arc.","Declaration of Competing Interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.
